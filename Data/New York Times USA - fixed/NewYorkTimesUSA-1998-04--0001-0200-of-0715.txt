ABZUG, BELLA

 BODY:
ABZUG-Bella. The National Women's Political Caucus of New York State mourns the death of Bella Abzug, our leader in the fight for women's rights. As we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Women's Rights Movement, Bella will be remembered as our history and our strength.
ABZUG-Bella. The Hunter College community is deeply saddened by the passing of Bella Abzug, who spent her extremely productive life supporting a broad range of human rights causes, and was, we are proud to say, a lifelong supporter of Hunter College. She received her B.A. from Hunter in 1942, made her decision to become a lawyer while at Hunter, and went on to become a specialist in labor and civil-liberties law, a political activist who fought for peace and civil rights, and a member of Congress. As a Congresswoman she worked for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, introduced pioneering legislation promoting women's rights, worked on behalf of a host of laws that sought equality and dignity for all, & became a global symbol of feminism and humanitarianism. After leaving Congress, she concentrated on global women's issues and environmental issues, and in 1990 she joined with other activists to found WEDO-The Women's Environment and Development Organization. She has remained close to her alma mater throughout her life, and our Alumni Association has named her to its Hall of Fame and presented her with its Award for Outstanding Professional Achievement. A lecture series sponsored by our Women's Studies Program is named for her, and she was its first speaker. Her most recent appearance at Hunter was in October 1997, when she gave the College's Millennium Address at our annual Fall Celebration. Her topic was "Celebrating People's Empowerment for the New Millennium"-an apt subject for a woman who devoted her life to working for people's empowerment. We shall miss her deeply, as will the tens of thousands of people whose lives she touched, and we send our sincerest condolences to her daughters, her entire family, and her many friends and colleagues. David A. Caputo, President, Hunter College
ABZUG-Bella. With profound grief & loss, The Womens Environment and Development Organization (WEDO) Board, Staff and Global Network, mourns the death of Bella Abzug, our Co-Founder and President. We extend our deepest sympathy to her beloved family. Bella was a world-class leader, a brilliant tactician in Congress and the U.N., where she championed the rights of women worldwide. She was a fearless and passionate advocate of women's empowerment, equality and a healthy planet. Most of all, she was a woman of principle who never sold out or gave in. Bella, we love you. You have left a living legacy. We will carry on your brand of passionate politics, fighting for social justice, human rights, peace, and a healthy environment. WEDO Board of Director Thais Corral, Brazil Jocelyn Dow, Guyana Elin Enge, Norway Farkhonda Hassan, Egypt Mim Kelber, USA Brownie Ledbetter, USA Wangari Maathai, Kenya Chief Bisi Ogunleye, Nigeria Maria Eugenia Penon, Costa Rica Vandana Shiva, India Hon. Maxine Waters, USA Faye Wattleton, USA Susan Davis, Exec Director
ABZUG - Bella. The Planned Parenthood family mourns the loss of Bella Abzug, stalwart champion of women's rights and reproductive freedom here at home and around the world. We will miss the sound advice and encouragement of a witty, shrewd, and courageous colleague who illuminated our lives. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her family. Sharon Allison, Chairperson Gloria Feldt, President Planned Parenthood Federation of America
ABZUG-Bella. The Jewish Fund for Justice mourns the passing of Bella Abzug, a friend, supporter and recipient of our Women of Valor award. Bella was a trailblazing feminist and passionate, relentless fighter for social and economic justice in this country and worldwide. She leaves a towering legacy of accomplishments and hope. Our hearts go out to her daughters, Liz and Eve. Ronna Stamm, President Marlene Provizer, Exec Director
ABZUG-Bella. The Alumni Association of Hunter College notes with sorrow the passing of its distinguished member of the Class of 1942 and recipient of the 1996 Alumni Award for Outstanding Professional Achievement. We extend condolences to her family and friends. Helene D. Goldfarb, President, Alumni Association

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
How good is business? It's so good that good workers are very hard to find, and to keep.

BYLINE: By Carol Marie Cropper 

 BODY:
EXECUTIVES at Sicola Martin, an agency in Austin, Tex., have two problems: Business is booming. And their high-technology clients' business is booming, too.
How is that a problem? Just try finding and then holding onto talented workers, they say, echoing a lament heard throughout the advertising industry. 
 "We're often training people only to lose them," complained Barbara Matijevich, a spokeswoman at the $53 million agency. "We lose a lot of people to the high-tech companies themselves."
Sicola Martin -- facing fierce competition for workers from computer companies as well as within the advertising industry -- may be having a particularly tough time. But executives around the country say recruiting good people has been more difficult in the last year to two years.
Many blame the industry itself, in part at least, for the crunch. During the recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's, agencies stopped hiring and laid off the middle managers they now need, said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York.
"We're now paying the penalty for that," he said. "We sort of lost a whole generation of new people."
Some of those lost workers became freelancers and are now quite happy on their own, thank you, said Anne Melanson, director of human resources at the Bates Worldwide unit of Cordiant Communications Group P.L.C., a $6 billion agency based in New York. About 10 percent of the people her agency would like to hire are freelancing, she said.
As the economy has improved, others have jumped to lucrative jobs at consulting firms and in corporate marketing departments, leaving lagging agency salaries behind, Mr. Drake and others said.
Camille Weas, human resources manager at Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis, an $863 million agency that is majority-owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, said Campbell Mithun stopped shopping for young M.B.A.'s in the late 80's because advertising salaries were no longer competitive.
New York agencies complain about a shortage of talent, but those in Minneapolis and elsewhere in the Midwest are particularly frantic.
"There are certain areas that people don't necessarily want to go to," explained Judy Wald, chairwoman of Judy Wald Partners, an executive search firm in Manhattan that specializes in advertising positions.
Campbell Mithun opened a 15-employee satellite office in New York last year for finicky creative types who are hard to lure to Minneapolis, Ms. Weas said.
In Los Angeles, Brian Morris, president of Dailey & Associates, another unit of Interpublic, said area agencies had found recruiting tough because of "the riots and earthquakes and floods and everything else." Then, as the agencies started to recover, he added, they found themselves in a boom-time scramble for employees.
Agencies all over are adding perquisites to attract employees and offering incentives to those already on staff who bring in new hires.
D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Communications in New York, the flagship of MacManus Group, doubled its new-worker bounty to $1,000 last year, said Leslie Engel, human resources director. D.M.B.& B. has also added tuition reimbursement and health-related programs, along with referrals for child care and care for the elderly, in an attempt to woo Generation X'ers, she said.
Still, Ms. Engel said, it takes perhaps twice as long to fill a vacancy as it once did, and account supervisors are especially hard to find (an assessment echoed at several other agencies).
All this would seem to be good news for recruiting firms at least -- except for one thing. Robert Herman, of the Robert Herman Company in New York, said he lost about $200,000 in fees last year as prospective hires were lured back by their old agencies.
Ms. Wald, who has experienced the same setback, said: "It shows how hard they try to hold onto their valued people. They know how hard it is to find a replacement."
Even when a hiring appears to be successful, it may not last long-term. Sicola Martin, the Texas agency, spent a year looking for one account director, only to have him leave within six months.

HEADLINE: Make the Tobacco Bill Tougher

 BODY:
The tobacco bill drafted by Senator John McCain that will be considered by the Senate Commerce Committee today is far better than the original settlement negotiated between tobacco companies and state attorneys general last June. But it still falls short in deterring smoking among teen-agers.
A key question is whether cigarette prices would be raised sufficiently to curb consumption, particularly among youths. The McCain bill would require the industry to pay some $506 billion over 25 years. That cost would be passed on to consumers in incremental price increases projected to reach $1.10 per pack of cigarettes over five years. 
 Most health economists who have studied this problem believe that a price increase of at least $1.50 a pack is necessary to make a significant dent in youth smoking, and some believe the hike should be even higher. The McCain plan, though it would raise prices more than the 62-cent-per-pack increase contemplated in the attorneys general deal, looks too low to achieve that primary public health goal.
Under this bill, the industry would also have to pay penalties if teen-age smoking rates do not go down by 60 percent over the next 10 years. But the penalties are capped at $3.5 billion annually, an amount that is probably not enough to deter bad conduct from an industry that desperately needs to hook the next generation of smokers. The bill would not provide any immunity from class-action lawsuits or limit punitive damages, but it would cap the industry's payout on civil awards to $6.5 billion in any single year. Damage awards exceeding that amount would be collectible in subsequent years.
The cap could help stabilize tobacco companies if they face gigantic court judgments. But unless the rest of the package is strengthened to insure that the industry will play by the new rules, giving it any financial protection cannot be justified.
The bill would ban outdoor cigarette advertising and a range of aggressive promotional practices. It also gives the Food and Drug Administration full authority to regulate tobacco and nicotine, and would provide more than $28 billion to help tobacco farmers affected by reduced tobacco consumption. These provisions are sensible, but they do not shore up the main weaknesses.
If the bill is approved in committee, President Clinton should be poised to fight for higher payments and penalties when it goes before the full Senate. He should not accept legislation that will leave millions of American youths exposed to tobacco addiction.

Prices Up on Signs of Sound Economy and Scant Price Pressure

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities turned higher yesterday after a regional manufacturing report showed that the economy was remaining strong but without the price pressures that normally accompany such strength.
The Federal Reserve's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee held its second monetary policy meeting of the year, and, as expected, concluded the meeting with no action on interest rates, and consequently little impact on the market. 
 The 30-year bond rose 18/32, to 102 22/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.93 percent, from 5.98 percent on Monday.
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's index of manufacturing activity rose unexpectedly for March, while the prices paid index dropped to 48.7 in March from 55.5 in February. It showed that fewer companies were reporting price increases and that employment eased in March.
Traders said the end of the quarter had a muting effect on activity yesterday, with much of the market's attention focused on the March employment report, which is scheduled to be released Friday.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said yesterday's inaction by the Fed was not surprising, "with economic growth expected to moderate and inflation still very restrained."
Mr. Fine added that "although a growing number of market observers feel there is a reasonable chance that the Fed may have reinstated its bias toward tightening in light of the exuberant performance of both consumer spending and housing activity of late," he expected monetary policy to remain on hold for quite some time before economic conditions changed sufficiently to dictate a policy shift.
The Fed last adjusted the Federal funds target rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans a year ago, when it raised it to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent.
Treasury bill prices rose after the Government said yesterday that it would offer $5.75 billion in three-month bills next week, about $500 million less than the previous week.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Contrition

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: GABORONE, Botswana, March 31

 BODY:
The last stop on President Clinton's 12-day trip to Africa will be a visit to Goree Island on Thursday afternoon, just before he boards Air Force One for the flight back to Washington.
It was on Goree, a speck in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Senegal, that millions of Africans spent their last hours on the continent, chained to walls in dank underground cubicles, before beginning the ghastly (and for many fatal) voyage to the New World. In the weighing room of the Slave House, men's muscles were examined, women's breasts measured and children's teeth checked. Then they were fattened to what was considered an ideal shipping weight -- 140 pounds for men. Those who failed to meet specifications were fed to the sharks. 
 Mr. Clinton's visit, fraught with wrenching emotional symbolism, will bring to a climax the politics of contrition he has practiced in Africa.
Although his main focus has been on the continent's future, especially his hopes that political and economic reform will make possible an increase in American trade and investment here, he has apologized for what he depicted as excessive concentration on cold-war imperatives in past United States relationships with African nations. He has also apologized for American inattention to the continent.
But he has not explicitly apologized to Africans for slavery, as some African-Americans would like him to, though the issue has lurked in the background throughout the trip. Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, has been asked repeatedly about the subject, and has replied that the United States long ago made clear by word and deed that it considered slavery repugnant.
As he seeks in the months ahead to sell his policy of greater engagement with Africa to Congress, business and the American public, Mr. Clinton needs the backing not only of black voters but also of white moderates and conservatives. His efforts to increase aid to and trade with Africa would not be helped by a debate over apologizing for the benefits the United States derived from slavery or even paying reparations to modern African-Americans, as some have asked.
"Going back to the time before we were even a nation, European-Americans received the fruits of the slave trade," the President said in Mukono, Uganda, in his most explicit comments on the issue so far. "We were wrong in that as well, although I must say, if you look at the remarkable delegation we have here from Congress, from our Cabinet and Administration, and from the citizens of America, you can see there are many distinguished African-Americans who are in that delegation who are making America a better place today."
Mr. Clinton returned to the subject in a weekend interview, released today, with correspondents for black-oriented news organizations.
"Most of my African-American friends and advisers don't believe that we should get into what was essentially a press story about whether there should be an apology for slavery in America," he said. "They think that that's what the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendment was, they think that's what the Civil Rights Amendment was and they think we need to be looking toward the future.
"So I think we've drawn the right balance and I feel good about it."
The facts of slavery are complex, as are the reactions of African-Americans to efforts to bring it into discussions of modern United States policy toward African nations.
It was not only European slave traders and ship captains who profited for three centuries from the shipment of Africans to the United States, the West Indies and South American countries like Brazil (where many voyages from Goree ended). Arab agents played a major role, as did African chiefs and clan leaders, especially in the territories stretching south from modern Senegal and then east along the bulge of West Africa to present-day Nigeria and beyond.
The Arabs seldom ventured far from the coast. But African leaders in the hinterland, sorely tempted by products newly introduced to the continent by Europeans, sold their people into bondage for cloth, beads, tobacco, firearms and especially cheap liquor. It was the beginning of the plunder of Africa's riches by the outside world, starting with the most basic, its human resources.
President Clinton's advisers, notably the African-Americans among them, have expressed conflicting views on the relevance of slavery to his trip.
The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, a special Presidential envoy to Africa, took traveling reporters (and by extension the American people) to task at a briefing for what he described as their failure to appreciate the emotional links of African-Americans to their homeland and to the experience of slavery.
He said Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's trip to the Prague ghetto last September was far more widely noted than the trip of the President's entourage to the castle in Accra, Ghana, once used to protect slave traders. For people like himself, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman, Mr. Jackson said, "It was a big emotional day," and that had been missed.
Mr. Jackson also outlined an unusually Afrocentric view of American history, arguing that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had more to do with modern democracy than Thomas Jefferson. He asserted that the American economy was built by slaves who were not paid and blacks who were underpaid, making the United States the real debtor nation rather than the countries of Africa.
Susan Rice, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, sat glowering through much of Mr. Jackson's briefing. When her turn came she commented, "As an African-American, I would like to say that I think slavery is largely irrelevant to what we are about here."
As if to smooth over the disagreement, Mr. Jackson said later, "We're not really wallowing in the emotions, even at the high points."
But those are unlikely to be the final words on such a vexed topic. Mr. Jackson has a wide following among African-Americans, and some other black leaders -- such as Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam -- take an even stronger stance on slavery than he does. Mr. Farrakhan travels often to Africa.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
A quarter of rich mergers dilutes the Asia effect on Wall St.

BYLINE: By Kenneth N. Gilpin 

 BODY:
WALL STREET, which began the year wondering if Asia was going to upset its apple cart, needn't have worried.
Helped by falling interest rates, the securities industry raised a record $472.7 billion in American financial markets in the first three months of 1998, up more than 62 percent from the same period a year ago and 27 percent higher than the previous record of $372.5 billion, set in the third quarter of last year. 
 The performance was buttressed by a mergers-and-acquisitions market that remained white-hot.
During the period, a total of $240.2 billion worth of mergers was announced, according to the Securities Data Company. That is well down from the $325.6 billion in American deals announced in the fourth quarter of last year, but is still the second-best quarter on record. Globally, $469.6 billion worth of mergers were announced in the first quarter, down somewhat from the record $543.5 billion in the last three months of 1997.
Over the last three months, Merrill Lynch & Company retained its position as the leading manager of United States securities issues with a 16.3 percent market share. Merrill, the world's largest securities firm, was followed by Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of the Travelers Group; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company; Goldman, Sachs and Lehman Brothers.
Merrill was also the top adviser in global mergers and acquisitions, followed by Goldman, Sachs and Lehman Brothers. But Lehman was the top adviser on American deals, topping Merrill and Goldman.
Wall Street's bottom line will be helped by the mergers business, but fees generated by its underwriting activities were nowhere near as plump as the overall underwriting volume figures might suggest.
In the quarter, underwriters received $2.1 billion in fees for their services in selling stocks and bonds, up just 10.5 percent from the same period a year ago.
The reason for the disparity is that in the quarter Wall Street sold many, many more bonds than stocks, and fees from bond sales are much lower than they are from stocks.
Rankings of the firms that earned the biggest underwriting fees showed a fairly significant shift in the quarter.
Goldman, Sachs, which has not led the underwriting tables in years but which often earns the highest fees, saw its fees shrink substantially from the corresponding period a year earlier.
Goldman, which ranked second in last year's first quarter to Merrill Lynch in disclosed fees, fell another notch. It earned $209.5 million in fees during the period, down sharply from $296.5 million in the first three months of 1997. Merrill Lynch earned the biggest fees -- a total of $347 million.
"Fixed income was stunning," during the quarter, said Sallie Krawcheck, a senior research analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "Mergers and acquisitions was unbelievable, but equity was slow in getting started."
Common stock offerings were up a healthy 19 percent from the same period a year ago, at $25.8 billion. But sales of so-called straight debt, which excludes securities like mortgages and asset-backed securities, rose by more than 94 percent, to $232.1 billion.
"As a proportion of overall issuance, in the first quarter equity was at its lowest level since the fourth quarter of 1990," said Richard J. Peterson, a spokesman for Securities Data.
To some degree, the stock market's concerns about Asia persuaded some companies not to price new equity offerings, particularly in January and the early part of February.
"Nervousness about Asia principally impacted the mid-cap and small-cap market for equities," said Jes Staley, head of global equity capital markets at J. P. Morgan & Company.
"But for much of the quarter, the average deal size in the equity market was up a lot. Offerings from companies like Gillette, Tyco and Chancellor Media were all bigger than $800 million."
J. P. Morgan, which has struggled to gain a solid foothold as a leading underwriter of common stock, saw its position improve significantly from a year ago.
During the quarter the firm was lead manager on seven deals totaling $1.7 billion, a performance that vaulted it to seventh place from No. 14 among equity underwriters.
According to the Securities Data figures, Morgan Stanley topped the list with 12.5 percent of the market.
To be sure, the Asian economic troubles and their impact on the United States economy have worried stock issuers as well as investors. Still, the crises in the region have led foreign investors to pour billions of dollars into the relative safety of American debt markets, pushing down interest rates sharply. Corporate treasurers responded to the lower rates by flooding the fixed-income market with new securities.
"January made a great quarter in and of itself," said Mark Siegel, a managing director and head of worldwide debt syndication at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
"The confluence of lower rates, stable markets and significant investor demand led to a record month in fixed-income issuance. February and March did not keep pace, but by historic standards the level of activity was still very high."
In what should be a positive sign for the second quarter, market participants say that conditions in emerging debt markets, unglued in the wake of the Asian crisis, are improving.
Yesterday, Merrill Lynch priced a $1.25 billion deal for Brazil, the largest transaction since the Asian troubles began last summer.
"I think the Brazil deal is a very positive sign for the Republic of Korea deal, which will be the biggest of the year so far and is the one everyone is concerned about," said Keith Horn, head of Latin American debt capital markets at Merrill Lynch.
The South Korean offering, which could be as large as $5 billion, is being co-managed by Salomon Smith Barney and Goldman, Sachs and is expected to be priced early this month.
Similarly, there seems to be nothing that will slow down the flow of merger deals.
In the quarter that just ended, blockbusters like the $13.1 billion combination of Waste Management and USA Waste Services, AT&T's $11.3 billion purchase of Teleport Communications and the Compaq Corporation's $9.6 billion purchase of the Digital Equipment Corporation were the largest American deals. Many more are likely.
"In conversations we are having with management teams, there is nothing that would suggest there is any less motivation to do transactions," said Jack Levy, global head of mergers and acquisitions at Merrill Lynch. "Our European business is as strong as it has ever been, and a lot of people are doing a good deal of preparatory work for what may be soon be an active period in Asia."

HEADLINE: Great-Grandmother, 88, Charged in Man's Death

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: FRANKLIN, Va., March 30

 BODY:
Almost everybody here knows Virginia B. Davis.
Among the paper mill workers, peanut farmers and small-business owners who make this a prosperous and pleasant town of 8,500 people in southeastern Virginia, Mrs. Davis cuts a dashing figure as an 88-year-old great-grandmother, running errands around town in her red Camaro, the one with the Washington Redskins banner on the radio antenna. 
 Townspeople say she is a little eccentric, what with her passion for feeding animals, wearing skirts above the knee when fashionable and cheering for the Redskins.
But now, Mrs. Davis is known for something else. The authorities here in Southampton County say she is a murderer. After a yearlong investigation, leading to a county grand jury indictment on March 16, she was charged last week with killing John E. Wimbrow, a 52-year-old unemployed man who had lived in her house for about 20 years, until he died on March 8, 1997.
An autopsy report indicated that Mr. Wimbrow suffered injuries to his chest and neck and died as the result of a blunt-force injury. With the Franklin police still investigating the death, the authorities have not said what evidence they have that would prove that Mrs. Davis killed Mr. Wimbrow. Nor have they speculated on a possible motive.
Richard C. Grizzard, the Commonwealth Attorney for Southampton County, did not reply to a telephone message that was left for him, seeking comment.
Mrs. Davis, the widow of an insurance executive, denied the charge and was released on $20,000 bail. But if she is convicted she would become would become a rarity in the American justice system. Statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 1996, the most recent available, show that less than 1 percent of 12,359 murders -- 125 -- were committed by people 75 or older, and just 3 of them were by women.
In Virginia, the state police say 24 people 65 or older were arrested on charges of murder from 1992 to 1996; the data are not broken down by sex.
The charge against Mrs. Davis, a frail woman who weighs 100 pounds and has trouble hearing, has captured the town's attention like nothing else in recent memory. Even now, two weeks after the indictment, "people are still talking about it," said David Rabil, whose family has owned Fred's Restaurant on Main Street for more than 50 years. "Most people can't believe she did it."
The accusation has also left Mrs. Davis and her family stunned and frightened. Wearing a Redskins vest that one of her daughters made, and a Redskins necklace and bracelet, Mrs. Davis today joined her daughters, Ginger Britt and Margaret Gibbs, at Mrs. Britt's home before driving to Virgina Beach to meet with Mrs. Davis's lawyer.
Her blue eyes twinkled in the sunlight. But later, sitting inside, it was apparent that the episode has taken a toll. In an interview, her eyes welled with tears several times as she tried to convey how upset she feels. "I can't sleep," she said. "I don't have much of an appetite. I'm just devastated."
"The part that worries me is that everybody tells me everything is going to be all right," she continued. "But I can't help but lie awake at night and think about it."
Under the advice of her lawyer, Richard G. Brydges, she declined to discuss the matter, other than to say, "To think I could bludgeon somebody to death -- I couldn't kill anything."
She expressed sorrow over Mr. Wimbrow's death. He was a good friend, she said, a man who opened her life to many new experiences.
"He got me hooked on the Redskins, car racing, fishing in the Chesapeake Bay and rock concerts," she said. "I've seen Rod Stewart, the Rolling Stones, the Bee Gees, Eric Clapton. Lord, I love rock concerts. I'd go right now if I had someone to take me."
Mr. Wimbrow, a former shipworker, real estate salesman and exterminator from Virginia's Eastern Shore, was not so well known in Franklin as Mrs. Davis, whose grandfather, a doctor in the Civil War, went on to become the first public school superintendent of Franklin and later the town's Mayor. While many people in town said they knew that Mr. Wimbrow lived in her house, few said they ever saw them together or saw him on his own.
Sandra Finney, Mr. Wimbrow's sister, who lives in the Eastern Shore town of Onley, said in a separate interview that her brother was a "quiet, kind and caring" man who later in life suffered from alcoholism. She said he and Mrs. Davis met after Mrs. Davis's husband died, when "she just wanted a young man on her arm. And he, with his drinking problem, was real enthusiastic that an old lady was interested in him, so he stuck by her."
Mrs. Britt said her mother's relationship with Mr. Wimbrow was platonic. But Ms. Finney disagreed, asserting that "it was romantic, definitely, at least in the beginning." She also said she was convinced that Mrs. Davis killed her brother after getting angry at him for planning to move to Florida, where his parents lived part of the year.
"He lost jobs and felt frustrated," Ms. Finney said. "He wanted to move away from Franklin. He was going to move to Florida and stay there in the winter, hoping to find work. She was angry about that."
It was not until early this month that Mrs. Davis had any idea the police were considering foul play in Mr. Wimbrow's death. Until then, she and members of her family had met with investigators three times since last year to answer questions about the night Mr. Wimbrow died, but always assuming that his death came as a result of his drinking.
Mrs. Britt, whose husband, Grady, retired in 1990 after 10 years as Franklin's police chief, said she had been at her mother's house two days before the death and found blood "all over the kitchen." She said she thought Mr. Wimbrow had fallen and hit his head.
"I think John fell repeatedly, and he died from his falls," she said.
Two days after her visit, as Mrs. Britt recalled, her mother telephoned, looking for Mr. Britt. "She said John was sick and needed to go to the hospital," Mrs. Britt said.
The Britts drove to Mrs. Davis's house, which is just a few blocks away, and when they arrived at about 7:40 P.M., Mrs. Britt said they found Mr. Wimbrow in his bed, his eyes closed and blackened.
"My husband said, 'Hey, John, do you need some help?" Mrs. Britt said. "I heard him say yes."
Help from a nearby fire and rescue station arrived quickly, and medical personnel worked on Mr. Wimbrow for 45 minutes, Mrs. Britt said, before transporting him to Southampton Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
Mrs. Britt said the episode has been "like a nightmare" for the family even though Mrs. Davis is maintaining her usual daily regimen of driving to the grocery store for food and the post office for mail, which has picked up considerably in recent days.
"I can't tell you the hundreds of people who call me, send cards and stop me on the street when I go out for food," Mrs. Davis said. "When I went to the post office today, a number of people told me they were on my side. Nobody who knows me believes this. They just don't believe it."

HEADLINE: A Corporate Son Remakes Danone;
By Focusing on Best-Selling Brands, French Food Maker Grows Globally

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 28

 BODY:
When Franck Riboud was named at a shareholders meeting in 1994 to eventually succeed his father as the head of Danone S.A., France's largest food company, the room rocked with catcalls.
Though he had spent 13 years working his way up Danone's corporate ladder, Mr. Riboud had never shaken his reputation for being something of a beach bum after college. Nepotism had won him the job, plain and simple, the critics said. How else, they argued, could he beat out such young, well-connected Danone managers as Henri Giscard d'Estaing, a finance executive and the son of the former French President, Valery Giscard d'Estaing? 
 But less than four years later, the catcalls have largely turned to coos. The ex-surfer, it seems, has managed to transform his father's scattershot collection of food businesses into a lean and focused company with a worldwide reach, one that puts it in the running with the likes of Bestfoods, Nestle S.A. and Unilever.
"Shareholders were a bit disappointed at first, thinking he was his father's son," Edouard de Boisgelin, who follows Danone (pronounced dah-KNOWN) for Merrill Lynch in London, said. "It turned out the guy is good -- he was the right choice."
What Franck Riboud has done is not so original, his newfound supporters say. It is just that he has executed well, as any athlete would.
By taking a page from John F. Welch Jr.'s playbook at the General Electric Company, Mr. Riboud (pronounced ree-BOO) focused Danone's energy and capital on expanding businesses in which it was No. 1 -- fresh dairy products like Dannon yogurt; cookies and snacks, including the Lu brand, and beverages like Kronenbourg beer and Evian mineral water.
A tousled and boyish-looking 42, Mr. Riboud also shed underperforming businesses, like soups and pasta, and expanded aggressively into Eastern Europe, South America and Asia. And he has sculptured the name Danone -- Dannon in the United States -- into a global brand.
"I'm always under pressure to succeed," Mr. Riboud said in an interview here. "But you need pressure to achieve. You try harder."
Now the question is not whether Mr. Riboud is up to the job, but whether he can continue to maintain the company's steady pace.
Some analysts are skeptical. It is one thing, they say, to make sense out of a mishmash of a conglomerate and quite another to keep the momentum going for the long term.
"The problem for a group like Danone," said Jean-Marie L'Home, who follows the company for Banque Nationale de Paris, "is that opportunities for growth in Asia and Latin America are more and more rare. Either you build businesses yourself, which is time consuming, or you buy small and big companies and merge them, which is costly."
That Mr. Riboud would wind up anywhere near the chairman's desk, let alone behind it, seemed a preposterous idea two decades ago when he finished technical school as an engineer but decided to follow his real passion -- windsurfing -- and shun the empire his father built from scratch.
Even after exchanging the windsurfer for the office, Mr. Riboud stuck close to another outdoor passion, skiing, signing on with the French ski maker Rossignol to work at a factory planned for Vermont. As it turned out, several snowless winters torpedoed Rossignol's American plans, and Mr. Riboud joinedhis father's company, then known as the BSN Groupe, in 1981.
Over the years, he held a variety of jobs, helping for instance with the $2.5 billion takeover in 1992 of RJR Nabisco's European biscuit and snack activities and running Evian. In 1992, he took over the company's international expansion strategy.
Indeed, having studied in Switzerland and not at a classic French ecole, Mr. Riboud, an easy English speaker, is in many ways a picture of the new young French executive.
Still, the reception was decidedly chilly in 1994 when his father, Antoine, named him to the No. 2 position, with the implicit right of succession. Antoine Riboud responded angrily to critics that he could "not understand why it's a handicap to have the name Riboud."
The cold shoulder treatment continued in 1996, when Antoine stepped down at 77. The Riboud family owned less than 1 percent of the shares, it was noted, and, at 40, Franck Riboud was considered by many to be too young to run Europe's third-largest food company, after Nestle and Unilever.
And even as recently as last year, when the Agnelli family of Italy, major shareholders in Club Mediterranee, ousted Serge Trigano, the chief executive and son of Club Med's founder, stock market rumors had it that Franck Riboud would be the next father's son to get the ax from the Agnellis, who own 5.8 percent of Danone. Only a statement of confidence in Franck Riboud by the Agnellis and Michel David-Weill of Lazard Freres, the French investment bank that is another major shareholder, quieted the talk.
Last October, Mr. Riboud took Danone to Wall Street, selling three million American depository shares, not so much to raise capital as to show the Danone flag. The shares have risen strongly from the initial offering price of $31. They closed Tuesday at $48.125. The stock got its latest lift in January on news that Danone's revenues in 1997 rose 5.4 percent, to 88.47 billion francs, or $14.7 billion, with profits rising 8.3 percent, to 3.66 billion francs.
In part, Danone is simply riding the wave of restructuring, as European food manufacturers and distributors reinvent themselves to overcome consumer stagnation and break out of narrow national boundaries. In 1996, Unilever, known in the United States for products like Lipton Tea and Wishbone dressings, announced it was shedding about 20 percent of its $50 billion of businesses in a major restructuring. Last December, two of France's biggest food distributors, Promodes S.A. and Casino S.A., agreed to an informal alliance; that followed the $3.2 billion takeover a year earlier of Docks de France by another giant food retailer, Auchan S.A.
It was in the early 1990's, when Danone was still the BSN Groupe and Antoine Riboud was running it, that the company realized that its strategy needed tuning. When recession throttled Europe in 1993, revenues contracted for the first time ever; operating margins slipped below 10 percent, beginning a slide that was not arrested until 1996.
"The main criticism was strategy," Joseline Gaudino, an analyst at Societe Generale in Paris, said. "They were too much in Europe, and they had too many activities. Results were suffering, and the share price was depressed."
To regain momentum, Franck Riboud raised $850 million in 1997 by scrapping less valuable product lines, selling Danone's soup business to the Campbell Soup Company, and selling subsidiaries that made sauces, pasta and ready-to-eat meals to a group of investors. At the same time, he concentrated on yogurt, beverages and other products in which Danone was a leader.
To revamp management following the defection of executives like Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, Mr. Riboud brought in new faces, hiring a former Procter & Gamble executive, Jan Bennink, a Frenchman, to run the key dairy products division, and Simon Israel, another Frenchman who once headed Sara Lee's operations in Asia, to build Danone's businesses in the Far East. Both men, like Mr. Riboud, are in their early 40's.
Part of the strategy has been to follow the broader trend to branded products by shaping the Danone name into a global trademark, including changing the company name from BSN Groupe in 1994. In Europe, Mr. Riboud added Danone to local brand names on products like mineral water and crackers; in North America, he started a new Canadian spring water under the Dannon brand.
"People are asking: 'Should I buy instead of make? What's my market share? What's the value of my brands there?' " said Jean-Pierre d'Estienne d'Orves, chief economist at the National Association of Food Industries, in discussing the trend. "Companies want to know what their business is, and adjust cash flow to focused activities."
The conglomerate Franck Riboud inherited needed focusing more than most, since it was essentially cobbled together over more than two decades by his father.
In 1968, Antoine Riboud was running a glass products group called Boussois-Souchon-Neuvesel, or BSN, when he made an unsuccessful hostile bid for Saint-Gobain, the leading French glass maker. Disenchanted with glass, he embarked on a string of takeovers of food businesses to find products for his bottles. The group became the country's largest food company in 1972, when it acquired Gervais-Danone, a yogurt and cheese maker.
(Danone yogurt was made in France until World War II by a Frenchman named Daniel Carasso, who fled to the United States, where he made yogurt under the anglicized Dannon brand. The business was later bought by the Beatrice Foods Company, which sold Dannon to Antoine Riboud in 1981, thus returning it to the French fold.)
Some analysts believe that Antoine Riboud recognized early on the need to shape the company, but felt a younger person would have to take on the task. "Perhaps he tried to accomplish through his son what he dreamed of doing, but did not have the chance" because of age, said Mr. L'Home of Banque Nationale.
Franck Riboud denies that his father planned for one of his children -- Franck is the youngest of four -- to succeed him. "My father's position was, 'Do what you want, but do it best,' " he said.
As for the future, Mr. Riboud is looking to expand mostly outside Europe. Last year, roughly one-fourth of Danone's revenues were generated outside Europe, against 5 percent five years ago.
"I need people with increasing buying power -- in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Asia," he said. The recent turmoil in the Far East does not upset him. While economies in Southeast Asia, like Indonesia, are hardest hit, roughly half of Danone's $865 million of annual revenues in Asia and the Pacific region come from China, and most of the rest from India and New Zealand.
In the United States, sales in 1997 totaled about $1 billion, from roughly $200 million five years ago, and Mr. Riboud says his strategy there is to "build around our existing activities."
Despite all those good intentions, Mr. L'Home switched Danone's stock late last year from an outperform ranking to hold. He said he made the decision, in part, because the share price touched target levels, but also because he saw "no strong reason to recommend it," given the challenge of finding ways to produce more growth.
It is the kind of challenge that Mr. Riboud thinks he can handle.
It shouldn't be too difficult to keep growing, he said cockily. After all, the ex-surfer added, "I'm a competitor."

HEADLINE: For Middle Class, New York Shrinks as Home Prices Soar

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Todd Neuhaus, an advertising executive, and his wife, Christina, didn't want much. They wanted to rent a Manhattan apartment for less than $3,000 with a bedroom for themselves and one for their two boys. They wanted it to be near good public schools, because private school was beyond their means.
Most of all, the Neuhauses wanted to believe it could happen, because they are financially comfortable, their bank account buoyed by the economic tide that has rolled into the New York region. 
 But after a few disheartening weeks, they gave up looking for two bedrooms. The living room could be a second bedroom, right? After another month, they gave up completely. "We said, 'You got us. We're beaten,' " recalled Mr. Neuhaus, 38, who lives in a modest house in New Canaan, Conn.
"This economy has done a strange thing to New York City," he said. "I guess it's good for the tourists who come here and see it, but what about the people who want to live here?"
It is one of the crueler paradoxes of the city's economic boom and bright new image: even as middle-income families tend to earn more, they are finding themselves priced out of dozens of neighborhoods in and around Manhattan, say real-estate brokers and legions of frustrated apartment seekers.
The phenomenon of middle-income neighborhoods' morphing into upper middle-income or wealthy enclaves is, of course, an old story in New York. It gathered steam in the late 1960's and slowed during the 1970's fiscal crisis.
By the high point of the 1980's boom, swatches of several neighborhoods -- Chelsea, Clinton, Yorkville, Brooklyn Heights -- had gentrified beyond the means of many middle-income families.
But housing experts say the present squeeze reflects a deeper problem that will endure long after the economy cools and apartment prices plateau or drop: builders are creating new housing only for the city's wealthiest residents and, using government subsidies, for a comparatively small number of its poorest.
But they say that for various reasons -- chiefly the high cost of land and construction -- the housing supply is not growing and, in fact, may be shrinking, for those in the middle. They are the city's teachers, nurses, civil servants, small-business owners, even mid-level executives, who want basic, affordable housing near their jobs.
Mary Nance-Tager, a 35-year-old teacher frustrated in her search for a home for her family in brownstone Brooklyn, echoed a widespread sentiment: "We don't want extravagance, but I guess our extravagance is wanting to live in New York City."
Brokers say that over the last two years, typical rents for nondoorman, one-bedroom apartments in many Manhattan neighborhoods have risen to more than $2,000 from $1,800. On the cooperative market -- where monthly maintenance can vary from a few hundred dollars to more than $1,000 -- a similar apartment, with about 800 square feet, could sell for anywhere from $150,000 to more than $200,000 now, an increase of 30 to 40 percent from two years ago.
For basic two-bedroom apartments, the most sought-after by families, typical rents have risen to $3,000 from $2,400 in two years and sales prices have risen to more than $300,000 from $240,000. And these prices are for what are known as type B apartments: no outdoor space and little detail or other extras. Add a washer and dryer, fireplace or terrace and the prices can jump by tens of thousands.
 
Requiring Earnings Of 52 Times Rent
For many rentals, landlords now make a special security demand: applicants must earn 52 times the rent to qualify for the lease -- to be able, in other words, to pay one month's rent with one week's paycheck. That means a tenant would need $104,000 for a $2,000 apartment.
Only a few years ago, the multiple was as low as 40, said Andrew S. Heiberger, who owns Citi Habitats, a rental brokerage. "I get kids coming out of Harvard," he said, "who get offered $90,000 plus bonus, and they're having a hard time finding a decent place to live."
As the pressure propels renters and buyers outward, the percentage price increases have been even higher in parts of Brooklyn -- Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Fort Greene, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace -- narrowing the gap with Manhattan.
In all the neighborhoods, the costs dangle tantalizingly just out of reach of many in the middle class, if it is defined as many policymakers define it in New York City: families with income from $50,000 to $120,000, depending on household size.
Figuring what those prices would buy in other cities -- a popular, if masochistic, pastime of space-starved New Yorkers -- is now more heartbreaking than ever.
For roughly the same money it takes to buy and maintain a one-bedroom cooperative in Manhattan, a family could, for instance, grab a newly-minted four-bedroom brick Georgian house in Houston. Incomes for comparable jobs are higher in New York, but not enough to explain that kind of difference.
"It's the kind of thing you've been able to say about New York for a very long time now," said Frank Braconi, the director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a housing advocacy group normally associated with low-income development that has joined other advocates in warning of a middle-income crisis.
"It's hard to generate sympathy for people who make this kind of money," he added. "But that's not the point. The point is: Ultimately it begins to affect the city's competitiveness. The fact is that educated, upwardly mobile people have a lot more choices these days about where they can live to do what they want to do."
Angela M. Mitchell, an operations manager and consultant in Cleveland who is weighing a job offer in Manhattan, said she had not decided whether she could afford a likely doubling of her $800 rent to move with her 10-year-old daughter. "Making sixty thousand here goes a lot further than sixty thousand there," Ms. Mitchell, 37, said in a telephone interview. "And I'm sure I'll make more in New York, but not double."
When she started looking at two-bedroom rents on the Internet, she said, "I felt incredibly sick."
For Mr. Neuhaus, an associate creative director at an advertising agency in midtown, New York is still the place he needs to be. But he and his wife, a 36-year-old photographer, say they will have to make hard decisions soon about whether they can stand to stay in the region.
They live in New Canaan, Conn., in a small Victorian house that they bought seven years ago for $220,000. But Mr. Neuhaus has to commute more than an hour each way, his hours are grueling and he has little time to spend with his boys, 6 and 3. His biggest fear is becoming the weary, lifelong "commuter in the raincoat," he said. "I've seen it."
But with an income of about $95,000 and plans to rent out their house, the family discovered that any place big enough and close to work would break them. He said he and his wife might try again, looking near Manhattan, or they might leave the area. "It's just discouraging," Mr. Neuhaus said, "to realize that you can't afford to live anywhere near where you work."
Housing policy analysts warn that rising prices near Manhattan and rundown housing in many borough neighborhoods may already be driving out middle-income families who would have made New York their home in years past. They worry that this could undermine public schools, erode the city's tax base and further widen the sizable gap between rich and poor.
 
A Million People Have Left in the 90's
While there are no hard numbers, Census figures released this month found that a little more than a million New Yorkers left the city so far this decade. (Because of the number of births, 937,000, and new immigrants who moved to the city, 677,000, as well as newcomers from elsewhere in the nation, the overall population has grown slightly.)
Census figures from 1990 show that proportionately, the New York region is losing out in the competition to draw other Americans. While 8.6 percent of the region's residents reported that they had lived elsewhere in the nation within the previous five years, the equivalent number in the region of Raleigh-Durham, N.C., was 24.8 percent, for example, and in Atlanta 18.6 percent.
John Watts, a keyboard player, and his fiancee, Debora Santos, a pharmacist, say they want to stay in the city but probably will not be able to afford to raise a family.
Mr. Watts, 35, lived in a 400-square-foot studio in the West Village that his parents owned. He and Ms. Santos, 29, began looking last summer to buy a one-bedroom apartment for less than $200,000, and quit in disgust after three months. They moved into Ms. Santos's one-bedroom rental in Astoria, Queens, and if they have children they will look to buy "in Westchester or Yonkers, probably," Mr. Watts said.
Of Manhattan, where he had lived for a decade, he said mournfully: "I left a place that I really honestly felt was the best place in the world, a place where people like me used to live." When his parents were young -- his father was a salesman and his mother was a secretary -- their salaries easily paid the rent for a roomy one-bedroom on 63d Street off Second Avenue. And they bought all the furniture already there, including a brand-new Wurlitzer piano, for $500.
"Those days are long, long gone," Mr. Watts said.
Residential developers, for their part, say it takes only a glance at the math to understand why they are not creating middle-income apartments: Land prices and construction costs are higher than ever. So, it does not make sense to build except in areas where the market will guarantee a profit. And in rent-regulated buildings, landlords say they have little incentive to invest in renovations to turn dilapidated buildings into middle-income ones.
David J. Wine, the president of residential development for the Related Companies, one of the city's most active luxury rental builders, insists that in many Manhattan neighborhoods it could cost $225,000 to $250,000 to build a typical apartment in a building with studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms.
"Someone's also got to pay for the debt service and the real-estate taxes and the maintenance of that building," he said. Add in a profit and that could mean $2,700 a month rent for a one-bedroom apartment.
There is a growing consensus among housing experts and policy makers that the only way to solve the problem is for the city or state to do what it has long done to stimulate low-income building: provide subsidies to help house the middle-class.
The last subsidized middle-income development, in the so-called Mitchell-Lama program in the 1960's and 1970's, built about 135,000 apartments for families making $30,000 to $90,000. Qualified applicants now wait more than a decade to get in.
The city recently announced a modest program to help finance the construction of a dozen middle-income apartment buildings outside prime Manhattan locations. But housing advocates say that a dozen buildings, even a dozen huge buildings, will hardly make a dent in middle-income demand.
"I think the real question is: Does New York become a place only for those who have already made it?" said Mr. Braconi, the housing advocate. "Or do we still have room for those who are coming here to make it? Isn't that what's made New York great?"

HEADLINE: House, by Narrow Margin, Votes Money for Military

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The House today narrowly approved $2.9 billion for emergency military spending and aid to disaster victims, but the White House said President Clinton would veto the bill because money to pay for it would come from cutting some of the Administration's prized domestic programs.
The vote was 212 to 208 -- surprisingly close given lawmakers' usual support for troops in the field and constituents hurt by natural disasters. Seventeen Republicans -- moderates opposed to the domestic cuts and conservatives against American military involvement in Bosnia -- voted with 190 Democrats and one independent against the legislation. Seven Democrats joined 205 Republicans in support of the bill. 
 The slim margin undercuts House Republicans' bargaining leverage going into what is expected to be a contentious conference committee with the Senate late next month when lawmakers return from their spring recess.
"No one can dispute the fact this is a difficult bill, start to finish," Representative Robert L. Livingston, a Louisiana Republican who heads the House Appropriations Committee, told reporters after the vote.
The House legislation provides $2.3 billion for military spending, primarily $487 million for troops in Bosnia and $1.3 billion for troops in the Persian Gulf, and $575 million for disaster relief.
Senators completed work last week on an emergency spending bill, but it is vastly different from the House legislation approved today. The Senate was more generous -- approving $5 billion for disaster aid and military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf -- and senators did not cut domestic spending to pay for it.
The Senate, by a vote of 84 to 16, had also attached $18 billion in new financing for the International Monetary Fund to refill the fund's treasury, which has been strained by the Asian financial crisis.
House Republican leaders have separated the I.M.F. monies and $505 million in dues that the United States owes the United Nations in a separate spending bill, which will not come up for a vote until late April, if at all, a spokeswoman for Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican leader, said today.
Moreover, House Republicans have vowed to attach an anti-abortion provision to the I.M.F. financing, which has drawn a veto threat from Mr. Clinton.
Today Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin issued a public appeal for Congressional support, saying the nation's economy and national security were at stake.
Pentagon officials have warned lawmakers for weeks that military readiness could suffer if Congress did not assure them by mid-April that the emergency financing was on the way.
The military does not budget for unforeseen missions, so when they happen the Pentagon borrows from other accounts to pay for troop deployments. Pentagon officials say these accounts will dry up in the next few months if Congress does not refill them.
Pentagon officials are concerned that the House and Senate might not reconcile their competing emergency spending bills in time, so Mr. Cohen has ordered the armed services to consider deferring maintenance on equipment, temporarily closing non-essential operations and temporarily laying off thousands of civilian employees.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff met today for 45 minutes to discuss the problem, and senior Defense Department officials will meet next week to review their options.

HEADLINE: New Reports Show Little Reason Not to Be Optimistic on Economy

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell in March, but only slightly from a level that was the highest in 29 years, a business research group reported today.
The group, the Conference Board, said its consumer confidence index fell to 134.3 points in March from 137.4 in February. Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its monthly index of manufacturing activity in the Chicago region, seen as a bellwether for the economy, unexpectedly rose to 59.5 points in March from 57.8 in February. 
 Taken together, the numbers indicate that the economy remains on a roll, analysts said.
"These numbers are still remarkable," said Kathleen Stephansen, economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities. "The expectation is that income will continue and buying plans will hold up."
With inflation nearly absent, the Federal Reserve's policy makers, as expected, held interest rates steady today at a meeting of the Open Market Committee, which has not changed borrowing costs for more than a year.
Adding to the evidence that prices are not threatening to accelerate, the Chicago purchasing managers reported that the index of prices paid by factories for materials fell to 48.7 in March from 55.5 in February, indicating that more companies reported price declines than increases.
A separate Conference Board index measuring consumer expectations for the next six months fell to 108.6 in March from a revised 114.5 in February. Still, March's overall index was almost 16 points higher than it was in March 1997. February's index reading was the highest since June 1969.
"There are no signs of any significant downturn in optimism," said Lynn Franco, a Conference Board economist.
Consumers are flush with cash given steady income growth, big tax refunds and a resilient stock market. Personal income rose six-tenths of 1 percent in February after a six-tenths of 1 percent increase a month earlier, the Commerce Department said last week.
As confidence rises, so does retailer activity. Apparel stores like Gap, Talbots and Limited, which introduced their lines of spring clothing in February, have shown significant sales strength. Sales at discount stores like Wal-Mart also rose more than expected in February.

HEADLINE: Suffolk Legislature Orders Lilco Takeover on Ballot

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: RIVERHEAD, N.Y., March 31

 BODY:
In a slap at Gov. George E. Pataki, the Suffolk County Legislature voted today to authorize a November referendum on his plan for the state to take over the Long Island Lighting Company's electricity service.
In a tumultuous meeting here, the audience shouted and hooted, one legislator wept and votes changed at the last minute. When it was over, the sides disagreed on whether today's vote would block the takeover. 
 Although Suffolk County government has no direct say in the takeover, the County Legislature would be required to continue its opposition to the plan in court and regulatory proceedings if directed to do so by the voters. So far, the Pataki plan has cleared most of its legal hurdles.
Governor Pataki says that the deal would cut electricity rates about 20 percent for all the utility's customers. He and other backers have long argued that their plan has widespread support, but they have opposed a referendum, calling it a distraction that could complicate efforts to complete the deal.
Opponents say they do not believe the promised rate cuts would be sustained and that the deal would bring more benefits to stockholders. These foes were jubilant today. They said that the mere prospect of the referendum would stymie the final regulatory approval and bond sales needed for the takeover. Wayne Prospect, a Hauppauge Industrial Association lobbyist against the plan, said, "This freezes everything."
The Governor's aides scoffed at that notion, however. "It's not going to stop the deal," said Richard M. Kessel, Mr. Pataki's appointee as the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, the agency that would buy part of Lilco. "We're moving forward," he said. "The referendum is moot. It's our intention to close the deal in the late spring or summer."
One Wall Street utility analyst agreed with Mr. Kessel. Edward J. Tirello of BT Alex. Brown, said: "Don't they realize it's all over? By the 15th of May, we expect this deal to be signed, sealed and delivered."
Mr. Kessel did concede, however, that concern about the referendum might drive up interest rates on the bonds to finance the takeover. Critics of the Pataki plan say that the referendum should also give pause to Sheldon Silver, the Speaker of the State Assembly, who controls one vote on a panel that must unanimously approve the bond sale. Asked today if the prospect of a referendum would delay his decision, Mr. Silver declined to comment.
Governor Pataki, who is campaigning for re-election, would like to avoid any more hurdles to his plan. He is eager to complete the takeover before the election so he can lower the island's electricity bills nearly 20 percent and send every customer a refund of $101 in Suffolk, and $232 in Nassau and the Rockaways in Queens. The plan would also resolve a $1.5 billion judgment that Lilco won for excess property taxes levied on its Shoreham nuclear power plant, which never opened.
Thus Mr. Pataki hopes to solve the island's long-vexing problem of having the highest electricity rates in North America, which raises the cost of living and discourages business.
But critics dispute the projected rate cuts, and say the plan would crush Long Islanders with $23 billion of debt while giving huge profits to Lilco stockholders and bailing out its Shoreham plant. Because Lilco would continue to run the system for several years under a contract, critics say the island would be locked into a monopoly while the rest of the nation is being opened to energy competition through deregulation.
If the plan is as good for Long Island and as popular as Mr. Pataki says it is, the critics argued today, why not let the people vote on it?
A spokesman for the Governor, Michael McKeon, replied in a statement: "We wouldn't want to do anything that would jeopardize the savings for the ratepayers." The Long Island Power Authority plan "will save ratepayers nearly $500 million a year while also protecting taxpayers from a $1.5 billion property tax bill," Mr. McKeon said. "We're confident the plan will continue to move forward so Long Islanders get the savings they need and deserve."
While the Pataki plan enjoys bipartisan support among elected officials in Nassau County, neighboring Suffolk has long been the hotbed of opposition to Lilco and the Shoreham plant. Last year, the County Legislature hired lawyers and experts to fight the Pataki plan and also authorized a referendum in the last election, but the courts threw it off the ballot on technical grounds.
This year's referendum has been revised to withstand a challenge, legislators say. John V. N. Klein, who filed the suit against the prior referendum for a developers' group, the Association for a Better Long Island, said today he doubted whether the new referendum was worth challenging.
The final tally was 12 in favor with 6 abstentions -- exactly enough votes to override the veto that County Executive Robert Gaffney has promised to issue. Although he supported the referendum last year, Mr. Gaffney said a vote this year would be pointless, because the deal is expected to close soon.

HEADLINE: A Dated War, a Modern Peace

 BODY:
Now that virtually all wars are internal conflicts, most of them ethnic or religious, the hostilities between Peru and Ecuador are a throwback. Their clash, which last erupted in 1995, was the last time the armies of any two governments fought each other. Since 1942 Peru and Ecuador have gone to war three times over border areas that both claim. Now, however, this traditional war may be coming to a very modern end, since the two countries have agreed on the outlines of a peace treaty that would set up trade, commerce and joint access to the disputed land that started the war.
The two nations have been arguing over the territory since Spanish colonial times. In 1942 a treaty called the Rio Protocol awarded the land to Peru. Ecuador ratified the pact but then repudiated it, and its maps still show the old borders. The land matters symbolically, as it is the basis of Ecuador's proud claim to be an Amazon country. 
 The 1995 fighting killed dozens of people and wounded hundreds. Since then Peru has bought more jet fighters and bombers. Nationalist politics on both sides could push the countries back to war.
Fortunately, this ancient dispute is now facing some modern solutions, including regional diplomacy and cooperation, and the decision of both nations that trade and growth are more important than nationalist symbols. The two stopped fighting when leaders of Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the United States organized peace negotiations. In January both nations signed an agreement setting May 30 as a target for a peace treaty, and four committees are working out the details.
The basics are already there. Ecuador will give up its quixotic claim to the disputed land. In return it will have permanent access to the Amazon, which is closed to it today. The two countries would also work together on development projects, such as roads, irrigation and hydroelectric plants.
The Peruvian negotiator has rightly said the two countries should focus on their common enemies of poverty and underdevelopment. The apparent success of regional diplomacy shows how Latin America's pursuit of a business-friendly climate has changed the continent. Such a focus has had mixed results, often pushing aside the poor. But one of its positive aspects is that Latin America now wants to make money, not war.

HEADLINE: Emergency! Emergency! Senate Needs More Pork!

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund, maple syrup producers in New England, American troops in Bosnia and motorists in Honolulu are all facing an "emergency."
So says the United States Senate. The four disparate groups would all receive money set aside in a special $5 billion "emergency spending" bill the Senate completed work on last week. 
 What started out as a fast-moving legislative vehicle to pay for unforeseen military operations, refill the monetary fund's dwindling treasury and quickly help flood and storm victims soon offered senators an opportunity they could not resist to tack on pet projects to must-pass legislation.
But does $4.5 million to replace ice-damaged maple sugar tap-and-tubing in Vermont or $3 million to study the transit patterns in Hawaii really qualify as an emergency, much less make a case for shoring up United States national security?
Pure pork, cry critics of the add-ons.
"None of these items were requested as emergency disaster relief requirements, and most bear no relation to disaster relief at all," Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said in a floor speech last week.
Mr. McCain has waged a lonely, battle against pork before. And in almost every case, he loses. So it was no great surprise last week when the Senate voted 61 to 31 to defeat his proposal to cut $78 million in what Mr. McCain he called "low-priority, unnecessary or wasteful" spending from the bill. After all, one senator's pork is another's bacon.
"To deal with a bill of this type, you have to come back to the concept of the eye of the beholder," Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee, said in response to Mr. McCain.
Just what that might be probably will not be settled until House and Senate negotiators hammer out a compromise of their competing emergency spending bills (with competing add-ons, of course) late next month.
The House today approved a slimmer version of the disaster aid and military spending bill. But the House made sure to make farmers who raise ostriches and other flightless birds eligible for $4 million in livestock assistance.
The list of Senate add-ons is as rich and varied as the Senate's many constituencies.
Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, obtained $151 million in additional financing for research on anti-missile systems, one of his keen interests.
Some $2 million was tucked into the bill at the insistence of Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, to soften the economic impact in rural areas of Idaho and Montana and other Western states, from the Clinton Administration's moratorium on road-building in national forests, and with it the loss of timber revenue and jobs.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, had $10 million inserted in the legislation to aid dairy farmers in the Northeast who could not get their milk to market on time because of ice storms.
Northern California's wine country suffered a beating at the hands of El Nino-driven storms, prompting Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, to win for her home state much of the $8.7 million designated for trees and vineyard damage.
Senators know they can offer these add-ons with virtual impunity because no one is going to vote against dubious expenses when they are attached to such essentials as beans and bullets for the troops.
"Those who add unrelated provisions to disaster relief measures are engaging in a game of chicken -- daring the body to oppose the emergency relief that may be desperately needed," Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said on the floor last week.
That, of course, just emboldens senators to keep piling on.
"Supplemental appropriations legislation has routinely become a Christmas tree," Senator Rod Grams, Republican of Minnesota, said in the debate. "The rush to spend reminds me of the free-for-all that results when you toss a piece of raw meat to a pack of hungry dogs."
But senators championing the add-ons said they and their causes were misunderstood. Take the $4.5 million in relief for New England's $24 million-a-year maple syrup industry.
"These maple sugar producers in northern New England have fallen through the cracks of our traditional disaster assistance program," said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. "They need our assistance."

HEADLINE: $9 Million and Extras for Oxford Health's Ex-Chief

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Despite leaving a company in turmoil, Stephen F. Wiggins, the founder and former chairman of Oxford Health Plans Inc., will receive a severance package of $9 million and assorted benefits, according to company filings made public last night.
Oxford, a leader in managed health care, also disclosed that it had taken on additional short-term financing and was starting to put its new management team in place. But the filing suggests that a quick cure for Oxford's ills is unlikely. 
 Under the severance agreement, reached when Mr. Wiggins resigned in February, he will receive a cash payment of $3.6 million and annual payments of $1.8 million for three years in return for various consulting services, which include assisting the company's new chief executive. He will also remain a director.
Mr. Wiggins will continue to receive health insurance and the services of a secretary and will be reimbursed for the cost of having his income taxes prepared until February 2002. In addition, he will be reimbursed for his expenses as a member of the Harvard Club of New York, the Wee Burn Country Club in Darien, Conn., and the Young Presidents Organization. He is entitled to stock options and has until 2002 to exercise them.
Mr. Wiggins's departure came after months of difficulty at Oxford, the Norwalk, Conn., company that he founded in 1984.
After several years of rapid growth, Oxford was one of the largest plans in the metropolitan New York region but proved unable to handle its volume of business, falling months behind in paying the plan's doctors and hospitals. The company's stock, once as high as $89, had fallen as low as $13.75 at the end of the year. Yesterday, before the company disclosed its filings, the stock closed at $14.9375 a share, down 43.75 cents.
In February, as the company reported that it lost $291 million in 1997, it also announced that the Texas Pacific Group, a private investment concern, was expected to invest $350 million in the company and arrange for another $350 million in debt. The company also named a new chief executive, Norman C. Payson, to take over when the financing was completed.
Yesterday, Oxford disclosed that it had raised $100 million more in bridge financing from a unit of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, bringing the amount it has borrowed from the unit, at high interest rates, to $200 million. Oxford said it had obtained this temporary financing in order to meet the regulatory capital requirements of various states. In its filing, the company said it had provided $160 million so far this year in financing to various subsidiaries to meet these requirements and would need additional capital.
The picture that emerged from the filing was of a company still very much in difficulty. Oxford said that it expected to continue to lose money in 1998 and that it would have $20 million to $25 million in severance expenses and other costs in the first quarter of the year as it reduces its work force in an attempt to bring down administrative expenses.
The company also indicated it needed to reduce the cost of delivering medical care, which now accounts for 94 percent of its premiums.
The company was also cautious in describing the status of its financing from Texas Pacific, which it described as "subject to various conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals, absence of a material adverse effect and completion of the debt financing," although it said it believed it would be able to pursue its turnaround if the financing fell through.
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette has been retained to try to arrange the debt financing, which the company said would be a mixture of senior secured debt and unsecured high-yield debt.
Oxford also acknowledged that its problems with its computer system, which it has maintained is at the heart of its difficulties, are far from over. The filing said it could take another year or more to find another system and put it into operation.
As part of its effort to install a new management team, Oxford named Marvin P. Rich, a former executive of the Kmart Corporation, as its chief administrative officer. Mr. Rich, who was Kmart's executive vice president for strategic planning, finance and administration, had been with Kmart since 1994. He had previously been an executive vice president for finance and information services at Wellpoint Health Networks.
William Sullivan, who had taken over as chief executive for Mr. Wiggins last summer, was named president.
The company disclosed the developments in a statement late yesterday.
In the statement, Dr. Payson, the designated chief executive, praised Mr. Rich's skills in back-office operations, information systems and turnarounds.
Officials from Oxford were not available for further comment, a company spokeswoman said.
In addition to acknowledging that it is being investigated by a number of state insurance departments, the New York Attorney General and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company also disclosed that the Health Care Financing Administration, the Federal agency in charge of Medicare, was also investigatinng.
In its filing, Oxford emphasized that the company's moves in recent weeks to focus on its core business was part of an overall strategy to reduce losses in its state and Federal Government programs and its individual business, where it provides coverage to people who are not part of large employer groups. In addition to trying to exit much of its Medicaid business, Oxford said it intended to stop its growth in the Medicare business and try to shift a significant amount of the risk in that program to its network providers.
The company also said it would try to improve its contracts with some of its largest vendors and providers and might adopt certain medical management programs.

HEADLINE: Bella Abzug, 77, Congresswoman And a Founding Feminist, Is Dead

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

 BODY:
Bella S. Abzug, New Yorker, feminist, antiwar activist, politician and lawyer, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 77.
She died of complications following heart surgery, said Harold Holzer, who was her spokesman when she served in Congress. She had been hospitalized for weeks, and had been in poor health for several years, he said. 
 Ms. Abzug represented the West Side of Manhattan for three Congressional terms in the 1970's. She brought with her a belligerent, exuberant politics that made her a national character. Often called just Bella, she was recognizable everywhere by her big hats and a voice that Norman Mailer said "could boil the fat off a taxicab driver's neck."
She opposed the Vietnam War, championed what was then called women's liberation and was one of the first to call for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. Long after it ceased to be fashionable, she called her politics radical. During her last campaign, for Congress in 1986, she told The New York Times, "I am not a centrist."
Bella Abzug was a founding feminist, and an enduring one. In the movement's giddy, sloganeering early days, Ms. Abzug was, like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, an icon, the hat bobbing before the cameras at marches and rallies.
After leaving the House in January 1977, she worked for women's rights for two more decades. She founded an international women's group that worked on environmental issues. And she was a leader of a conference of nongovernmental organizations that paralleled the United Nations' fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.
Even then, she continued to rankle. Former President George Bush, on a private visit to China that coincided with the Beijing conference, said to a meeting of food production executives: "I feel somewhat sorry for the Chinese, having Bella Abzug running around. Bella Abzug is one who has always represented the extremes of the women's movement."
When told of Mr. Bush's remark, Ms. Abzug, 75 and in a wheelchair, retorted: "He was addressing a fertilizer group? That's appropriate."
Her forceful personality and direct manner made her a lightning rod for criticism from those who opposed the idea of holding a women's conference. After Bob Dole, then the Senate majority leader, said he could not imagine why anyone "would want to attend a conference co-chaired by Bella Abzug," she responded that she was not running the meeting but simply participating with more than 30,000 other women over how best to achieve equal rights.
But much of what Ms. Abzug agitated for -- abortion rights, day care, laws against employment discrimination -- was by that time mainstream political fare.
In Congress, "she was first on almost everything, on everything that ever mattered," said Esther Newberg, Ms. Abzug's first administrative assistant and one of many staff members who quit but remained devoted. "She was first to call for Richard Nixon's impeachment, first to call for an end to the war."
Ms. Abzug made enemies easily -- "Sometimes the hat and the mouth took over," Ms. Newberg said -- but Ms. Abzug saw that as a consequence of a refusal to compromise, as well as a matter of sport. Of her time in the House, Ms. Abzug wrote in a journal that was published in 1972 as "Bella," "I spend all day figuring out how to beat the machine and knock the crap out of the political power structure."
She worked relentlessly at organizing and coalition-building. A founder of Women Strike for Peace and the National Women's Political Caucus, she spent a lifetime prodding for change, with a lawyer's enthusiasm for political channels, through organizations from the P.T.A. to the United Nations.
She made friends easily, too. "She's fierce and intense and funny," said her longtime friend Gloria Steinem. "She takes everyone seriously. When she argues with you fiercely, it's because she takes you seriously. And she's willing to change her mind. That's so rare."
 
Her First Speech, In a Subway Station
Bella Savitzky Abzug was born on July 24, 1920 in the Bronx, the second daughter of Jewish immigrants from Russia. Her father, Emanuel Savitzky, whom Ms. Abzug later described as "this humanist butcher," ran (and named) the Live and Let Live Meat Market on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan.
She said she knew from the age of 11 that she wanted to be a lawyer, and not long afterward gave her first public speech, in a subway station, while collecting for a Zionist youth organization. She went from Hunter College, where she was student body president, to Columbia University Law School, where she was an editor of The Law Review, to a practice representing union workers.
Ms. Abzug traced the wearing of her trademark wide-brimmed hats to those days. She once recalled: "When I was a young lawyer, I would go to people's offices and they would always say: 'Sit here. We'll wait for the lawyer.' Working women wore hats. It was the only way they would take you seriously.
"After a while, I started liking them. When I got to Congress, they made a big thing of it. So I was watching. Did they want me to wear it or not? They didn't want me to wear it, so I did."
All the while, she was a leftist and an agitator. Later, exasperated with her Congressional aides, she wrote: "I just don't understand young people today, quite frankly. Our struggle was political, ideological and economic, and we felt we couldn't make something of ourselves unless we bettered society. We saw the two together."
In the 1950's, Ms. Abzug's law practice turned to other cases identified with the left. One client was Willie McGee, a black Mississippian convicted of raping a white woman and sentenced to death. Ms. Abzug, who was pregnant at the time, argued the case in Mississippi while white supremacist groups threatened her. Though the Supreme Court stayed the execution twice, Mr. McGee was eventually executed.
She also represented people accused of Communist activities by Senator Joseph McCarthy's Congressional committee and its counterpart in Albany.
In the 1960's, Ms. Abzug became an antiwar activist. A founder of Women Strike for Peace, she became its chief lobbyist, protesting nuclear testing and, later, the Vietnam War. She organized insurgent Democrats into other groups, too, becoming a leader of the movement against President Lyndon B. Johnson and a prominent figure in the 1968 Presidential campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy.
During those years, Ms. Abzug started navigating New York City politics. She and her husband, Martin, moved from Mount Vernon, the Westchester suburb where they had raised their two daughters, to a town house at 37 Bank Street in Greenwich Village. In 1970, Ms. Abzug ran for Congress.
The 19th Congressional District, which snaked from lower Manhattan to the West 80's, had four registered Democrats to every Republican and had been represented in Congress for seven terms by Leonard Farbstein, a solid but rather somnolent liberal. Ms. Abzug won the Democratic primary with 54 percent of the vote.
 
Campaign Became A Women's Crusade
At this point, Bella Abzug became national news, a flash of local color in a political year. She seemed to be everywhere, clapping backs and jabbing biceps. Her campaign headquarters next to the Lion's Head, a writers' and journalists' bar in Greenwich Village, was also a day-care center for her legions of female volunteers. The women's crusade she led brought considerable, if sometimes derisive, attention.
Though she eventually took 55 percent of the vote, she had genuine Republican opposition, unusual in an era when New York's main political action consisted of various Democratic factions knifing one another. The Republican-Liberal candidate was Barry Farber, a well-known radio talk show host. Mr. Farber drew many Democrats who resented Mr. Farbstein's humiliation or were simply put off by Ms. Abzug's style.
To her chagrin, Mr. Farber accused Ms. Abzug, who advocated direct negotiations between Israelis and Arabs, of flagging in her support of Israel. For years after that, she made a point of stating her Jewish credentials, dating to childhood: her family was religious and she went regularly to synagogue (though she was bothered that women were relegated to the back rows of the balcony), studied Hebrew and was enrolled for a time at the Jewish Theological Seminary.
When Ms. Abzug went to Washington, she sought an appointment to the Armed Services Committee. She wanted a resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam and she vowed to take on the military-industrial complex. She wanted to end the draft. She wanted national health insurance, money for day-care centers and housing, and more money for New York City, all to be paid for with billions siphoned from the Pentagon's budget.
She got little of this, but during the next six years "she was indefatigable," Ms. Newberg recalled. "She yelled a lot,only because she couldn't get everything done." And if she couldn't, Ms. Newberg added, it was partly because "her agenda was too pure for her moment in time."
Ms. Abzug did become expert at parliamentary rules, worked them skillfully and was famously well prepared for every vote, hearing and committee spat. The "sunshine law" requiring governing bodies to meet publicly came out of a subcommittee she headed. She coaxed funds for New York from the Public Works Committee. She was a co-sponsor of the women's equal rights amendment. "She was one of the most exciting, enlightened legislators that ever served in the Congress," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, with whom Ms. Abzug sometimes collaborated and sometimes sparred.
From her first day on Capitol Hill -- the day she dismayed her colleagues by introducing her Vietnam resolution -- Ms. Abzug derided the Congressional club, the seniority system, the log-rolling and back-scratching. She did not spare fellow Democrats; when she spoke of liberals, it was usually dismissively. She badgered the House leadership over committee appointments and votes.
She badgered the President, too. Invited to a reception at Richard Nixon's White House, she accepted (while writing in her journal, "Who wants to listen to his pious idiocies?"), then announced to Nixon in the receiving line that her constituents demanded a withdrawal from Vietnam.
For all of her railing against Democrats who went along to get along, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill named her one of his dozen assistant whips, and by most accounts she worked well with some of the crustiest fixtures in the House.
Still, a 1972 report by Ralph Nader estimated that Ms. Abzug's sponsorship of a measure often cost it 20 to 30 votes. Her reputation as an irritant came from all quarters. Jimmy Breslin wrote of a campaign worker who repaired to the Lion's Head one night, holding his side and swearing never to work for Ms. Abzug again. "She punched me," he explained, in a quarrel over scheduling. The next day, Mr. Breslin reported, Ms. Abzug called the aide. "Michael, I called to apologize," she said. "How's your kidney?"
Mr. Breslin also recounted the Congresswoman's introduction to Sol Linowitz, the former chairman of the Xerox Corporation and a Democratic Party luminary: "Are you the man that used to be head of the Xerox?" Ms. Abzug asked. "That's right," Mr. Linowitz replied. "I'm glad to meet a big shot," Ms. Abzug said. "I'm in hock $35,000 on my campaign."
Ms. Abzug acknowledged loneliness in her years in Congress. "Outside of Martin and the kids, I don't feel very related to most people at this point," she wrote in 1971. "I feel detached in social situations. I'm always thinking about other things, about Congress, about the issues, about the political coalition I'm trying to organize. It never leaves me. I even have trouble relating to some of my closest friends, though God knows I still love them, even if they don't know it."
Always, she returned to Manhattan to spend weekends with her husband.
She had married Martin Abzug in 1944. The two New Yorkers met on a bus in Miami, when both were on the way to a Yehudi Menuhin concert. Mr. Abzug, a stockbroker and an author of two published novels, had next to no interest in politics. In an interview in 1970, he murmured, while his wife was out of the room, "The political bug is a curious bug." But he was, she said, her best friend and supporter, and "one of the few unneurotic people left in society."
 
Corrosive Ambition Hampers a Career
Ms. Abzug's own ambition was too corrosive for many people, even -- or, perhaps, especially -- for her fellow New York Democrats. When the State Legislature sliced up her district in 1972, they urged her to challenge one of the two conservative incumbent Democrats in adjoining districts, Representative John J. Rooney or Representative John M. Murphy. Instead, she opposed a liberal Democrat, William Fitts Ryan, in the 20th District, encompassing the Upper West Side and the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
The primary was bitter and, eventually, politically expensive to Ms. Abzug. Bill Ryan was one of the earliest heroes of the city's insurgent Democrats, an early opponent of the Vietnam War and a genuinely well-liked man who, as many of his constituents knew, was waging a gallant fight against cancer.
Mr. Ryan defeated Ms. Abzug in the Democratic primary but died before the general election. The Democratic County Committee appointed Ms. Abzug as the candidate to replace him, but she was challenged by Mr. Ryan's widow, Priscilla, who ran on the Liberal line. Ms. Abzug won in November, but she had made dedicated enemies who believed she was an overly aggressive politician who would not hesitate to attack anyone who got in her way. Ten years later, she was denied a seat in the state's delegation to the national party's biannual conference because New York leaders considered her disruptive.
In 1976, she gave up her House seat to run for the Senate. She lost in the primary, to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, by a margin of only 1 percent. Two more campaigns quickly followed. (In a 1978 interview, she said: "I'm a politician. I run for office. That's my profession.") She lost to Edward I. Koch in a crowded mayoral primary in 1977. The next year, running for the House again, she lost, again by just 1 percent, to a little-known Republican, S. William Green.
She was appointed co-chairwoman of President Jimmy Carter's National Advisory Committee on Women, and then, after disagreeing with him over economic policy, was dismissed. The majority of the committee members resigned in protest. Ms. Abzug, unapologetic, said with a shrug, "I've got to find myself another big, nonpaying job."
Her next and last campaign was in 1986, this time for a House seat in Westchester County. She won the primary in a burst of the old, ebullient campaigning style, but lost in November to Joseph J. DioGuardi, the Republican incumbent.
It was during that campaign that Martin Abzug died. Her friends said Ms. Abzug never recovered. Nine years later, she said, , "I haven't been entirely the same since."
There was one more bid for office, for her old House seat on the Upper West Side, when she announced her candidacy to replace Representative Ted Weiss on his death just before the 1992 election. But she was quickly eliminated from the field at the party convention.
During the next decade, Ms. Abzug suffered from ill health, including breast cancer, but continued to practice law and work for women's groups. She wrote a book, "Gender Gap," with her old friend Mim Kelber. She started a lobbying group called Women U.S.A. and founded the Women's Environment and Development Organization, a group that works with international agencies.
In addition to her daughters, Eve and Liz, Ms. Abzug is survived by her sister, Helene Alexander of Great Neck, N.Y.
"I've been described as a tough and noisy woman, a prizefighter, a man hater, you name it," Ms. Abzug said of herself in "Bella." "They call me Battling Bella, Mother Courage and a Jewish mother with more complaints than Portnoy."
"There are those who say I'm impatient, impetuous, uppity, rude, profane, brash and overbearing. Whether I'm any of these things or all of them, you can decide for yourself. But whatever I am -- and this ought to be made very clear at the outset -- I am a very serious woman."

HEADLINE: Black and Hispanic Admissions Off Sharply at U. of California

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif., March 31

 BODY:
In a demonstration of the impact of California's referendum that banned the use of race and ethnicity in college admissions, the state's most competitive public universities today announced steep drops in admissions of black and Hispanic applicants for next fall's freshman class.
At the University of California at Berkeley, the most selective public university in the country, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and American Indians together made up 10.4 percent of the admitted freshmen for 1998; in 1997, they made up 23.1 percent. At the University of California at Los Angeles, representation by these groups fell to 12.7 percent, from 19.8 percent last year. 
 "My own personal emotions are a mixture of disappointment, anger, frustration, hope and resolve," a grim-faced Robert M. Berdahl, Berkeley's chancellor, said at a news conference today. "To the extent this leaves us a less diverse campus, it diminishes us."
Some opponents of affirmative action said they too were disturbed by the drop-off, but only because, they said, it proved their point that the school systems had been failing to prepare black and Hispanic applicants properly while the university system had been discriminating against whites and Asians.
"We shouldn't become obsessed with the year-to-year numbers," said Terence J. Pell, senior counsel of the Washington-based Center for Individual Rights, which has brought many cases against affirmative action to courts around the country.
"It is clear it will take a few years for the system to adjust," Mr. Pell said. "Diversity is important. The challenge is how to get it without focusing on skin color."
The figures are among the first on admissions to California state universities since Proposition 209 was passed in November 1996. The ballot initiative, which for undergraduate admissions went into effect this year, made California the only state to ban the consideration of race, ethnicity and sex in the public sector.
A Federal appeals court has forbidden the state universities of Texas to do the same, and other states, notably Michigan, are facing similar legal challenges. To avoid a large drop in minority admissions, the Texas Legislature required the top 10 percent of graduating seniors from each school to be admitted.
While the California referendum also barred the consideration of sex, admissions officials said they had never taken sex into account anyway because of the large number of women applying to college.
The data released today mirror similar drops in most of the smaller University of California campuses announced two weeks ago and at the state's business and law schools.
It is still unclear what percentage of next fall's freshman classes will consist of minorities, since the applicants, of all races, have yet to choose where they will go and many will probably be able to go to the smaller state campuses.
The two campuses that are known to be least selective, Riverside and Santa Cruz, reported increases in minority admissions. Moreover, the very top candidates may choose private institutions like Harvard and Stanford, where many may have also been admitted.
The percentage of Asian-Americans, who are not considered an under-represented minority in California, increased slightly. Asians account for 38.3 percent of freshman admissions at Berkeley this year, up from 35.5 percent last year. At U.C.L.A. they account for 33 percent, a 0.8 percentage-point increase from last year.
Mr. Berdahl, the Berkeley chancellor, and Albert Carnesale, U.C.L.A. chancellor, both said at separate news conferences today that they would try to persuade the minority members admitted to attend their universities and not leave the system or the state for other institutions.
They said they were concerned that the number of students attending would fall further from those admitted because those minority members offered a slot at these campuses are the very top performing students sought after by colleges everywhere. Both chancellors said they fear a chilling effect on the attitude of future high school seniors toward California's best state campuses.
"Now the challenge before us is, despite this drop in admission in under--represented minorities, to get the highest possible enrollment so we can maintain the diversity of this campus," Chancellor Carnesale said. "This is the academically strongest class in U.C.L.A. history. We received more applications than any university in the United States and probably more than any in the world."
Ward Connerly, author of the voter initiative, said the new figures were attributable to the end of what he called a dual-track system with different standards for whites and Asians on the one hand and black, Hispanic and other minority applicants.
"They reveal beyond a shadow of a doubt," Mr. Connerly told The San Francisco Chronicle, " that the university was discriminating against Asians and whites."
Together, Berkeley and U.C.L.A. account for nearly 46,000 of some 129,000 undergraduates spread across eight campuses. As the desirability of the two schools has increased, they have been able to choose from among the very top students. Now, as applications from all racial groups are increasing, there is concern that black and Hispanic faces will disappear from the two key campuses and increase at the less desirable ones.
In anticipation of a sharp drop in minority admissions, Berkeley officials said, they overhauled their admission procedure, relying less on grade point averages and scores on standardized tests like the S.A.T. and more on essays and a mix of criteria like whether the applicant had overcome difficult barriers.
Some officials said they had postulated that by taking into account other factors, like individuality, as well as low socio-economic status, the number of black and Hispanic students would remain high. But Bob Laird, director of undergraduate admissions at Berkeley, said that many low-income whites and Asians also overcame such barriers so it did not especially benefit minorities.
The same is true at U.C.L.A., where such an admission system has been in place for 15 years, according to Jeffrey Hirsch, director of university relations there.
"The fact is that lots of the blacks we admit are middle class, second and third-generation in college while many of the Asian-Americans are poor," he said.
At Berkeley, the mood at the lush campus, covered in budding sycamore trees, seemed a mix of resignation and anger.
"It sends a strong message that this school is going to cater to a certain population and not open itself to the diverse population that is out there," said Marisa L. Galvan, a senior who is Mexican-American. "Eliminating affirmative action didn't solve any problems. It only created new ones."
Some students and professors suggested that the university consider breaking the law to maintain its diversity.
Across the country, where the California situation is being carefully watched, supporters of affirmative action said they were not surprised by the numbers. They expressed depression and fury.
"We are seeing these campuses returning to a race-exclusive status," said Theodore M. Shaw, associate director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. "This shows that economics will not substitute for race. We know that the great majority of the poor are white. You know, it is pretty depressing when you think that this is 30 years, almost to the day, after the assassination of Martin Luther King and we're still fighting a battle we thought we had moved beyond."
High school seniors had varying reactions to the new numbers. Most had not yet received their letters from either U.C.L.A. or Berkeley and so did not yet know where they stood, but were worried.
In Castlemont High School in East Oakland, Charles E. Jones, 18, an African-American and student body president, said he was frustrated because he felt he had got all he could out of high school, taking all of the three advanced placement courses offered by the school, earning a grade point average of 3.67 out of a possible 4.0 and S.A.T.'s of 1100.
He said there was often a shortage of books and other resources there. He was waiting nervously to hear from both Berkeley and U.C.L.A. and had already been disappointed by rejection from the University of California at Santa Barbara.
"The U.C. schools need to take into account what it is like going to school here," he said. "Because of my family situation, I spend a lot of time baby-sitting. Kids at other schools are doing the extracurricular activities that help them get into college."
A classmate, Gabriel Escobar, 18, a Mexican-American, said he had already been accepted to the University of California at Davis and U.C.-Santa Barbara but was waiting to hear from Berkeley.
"Since I was a little kid I've wanted to go to Berkeley," he said. "With affirmative action gone, part of me wishes I was born a little earlier. There are people with much worse grades who got in last year. But it's going to be harder for me."
One Los Angeles high school senior, Maria Prado, has been accepted by Santa Barbara but rejected by San Diego and U.C.L.A.
"I think that taking away affirmative action has hurt me in a way," she said. "But in a way, I think it is better because they don't emphasize who you are but what you can do."
At San Francisco's Abraham Lincoln High School, Amy S. Cheung, a 17-year-old Asian-American, said she was waiting to hear from U.C.L.A. and Berkeley and, like many Americans, had mixed feelings about affirmative action.
'I don't think it's fair to look at people as a whole group," she said. "Looking at them as a race and giving them benefits because of that race doesn't make any sense. But I don't want to go into a classroom where everyone is Asian. What I like about living in California is that you get to know different types of people. That's the one thing that's good about America."

HEADLINE: TV News in Schools Costs $1.8 Billion in Class Time, Study Says

 BODY:
Channel One, the 12-minute news program that is broadcast daily to eight million students, costs $1.8 billion a year in classroom time, including $300 million for its two minutes of commercials, a study by the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee has found.
In the study, "The Hidden Costs of Channel One," which is being made public today, researchers used data from the National Center for Education Studies to determine the cost of educating a single public school student, per minute, state by state. Twelve minutes a day -- which comes to a total of roughly six school days a year -- cost an average of $229 per pupil nationally ($366 in New York, $401 in New Jersey and $345 in Connecticut). 
 That figure, the amount of time that Channel One broadcasts, was multiplied by the number of public school viewers -- 7.8 million students, or 94 percent of Channel One's audience -- to come up with what the researchers said was the total cost of the programming to taxpayers.
"This study communicates clearly that Channel One, whatever else it might be, is not free," said Prof. Alex Molnar, director of the Center for the Analysis of Commercialism in Education at the University of Wisconsin School of Education.
"Channel One costs time, and time is money," said Professor Molnar, a co-author of the report with Max B. Sawicky, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
David M. Tanzer, president and chief executive officer of Channel One, said he objected to the entire premise of the report: that the program is not educational. Mr. Tanzer noted that Channel One, which covers current events, sometimes with teen-agers as anchors, had received some 150 awards, including the George Foster Peabody Award in broadcasting.
"More than 35,000 teachers in 12,000 schools watch our show 180 school days a year," he said, "and they've renewed at a 99 percent rate since the beginning. Educators clearly have a very high opinion of our programming."
Channel One was introduced in 1990 by Whittle Communications and later sold to Primedia. The company installs television sets and VCR's in every classroom of participating middle and high school. In return, 80 percent of the schools' classrooms watch Channel One programs on 90 percent of school days. Advertisers like Reebok and Nintendo and the Army pay about $200,000 for a half-minute commercial.
Many financially strapped school districts embrace Channel One because it supplies expensive audio-visual equipment. Opponents call it an advertising vehicle of little educational value.
In response to the report, the Citizens Campaign for Commercial-Free Schools, an advocacy group based in Seattle, has asked that city's school district not to renew contracts with Channel One. Currently, all middle schools and 4 of 10 high schools broadcast the program in Seattle, one of the primary battlegrounds in the fight over advertising in schools.
The district's superintendent, John H. Stanford, has actively sought companies to advertise in schools with posters, on lunch menus or by sponsoring educational materials, saying the additional revenue improves the district.
Bruce S. Hunter, principal of the Washington Middle School in Seattle, said that recent budget cuts limited his ability to buy equipment, and that the school could not afford televisions without Channel One. He also said he was happy with the content of the programs.
"We feel middle-school students don't get enough information about the news," Mr. Hunter said. "This is an opportunity for us to give them that exposure each day and use it as an opportunity to discuss some of the current events."
But some parents are angry that students are required to watch television during the school day.
"My tax money is being wasted and the kids are not learning what the teachers and the district has planned for them during that time," said David O. Wall, whose daughter watched Channel One for three years at Washington Middle School. "I'm even more disturbed that they're being advertised to during that time."
Andrea Okomski, a volunteer coordinator for the Citizens Campaign, agreed, saying, "If there's a national problem of funding our schools, selling off the school environment to commercial interests isn't the answer to that problem."

Airlines Coddle High Fliers At Expense of Coach Class

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Last month, business travelers paying full coach fare on Trans World Airlines began receiving white-glove service in St. Louis. A special skycap now checks their bags at the curb, issuing a large, gilt-edged tag that is intended to insure that the luggage will be the first off the plane.
Elite fliers are also given a white ticket envelope -- as opposed to the dark blue ones issued to the hoi polloi -- so that T.W.A. employees know to give them the "extra level of customer service they deserve." And T.W.A. scrapped a three-year effort to offer the most spacious coach cabin in the industry to make room for more first-class seats. 
 "We have essentially moved that space from the back to the front, where it is made available to people who can pay for it," said Mark Abels, a T.W.A. spokesman.
There have long been clear class distinctions in the air, but the divisions are growing ever wider as airlines invest millions of dollars to pamper their best customers, enticing them with everything from more leg room to extra frequent-flier miles to fancier V.I.P. lounges.
Who loses out? In some cases, passengers with discount tickets. "The back end of the plane has become a bus with wings," said Ivan Michael Schaeffer, president of Woodside Travel Trust, a consortium of 132 travel agencies.
The focus on the elite, who represent fewer than a tenth of all passengers, often translates into a decline in service for everyone else. Few airlines are adding new workers to staff their new premium services, so budget travelers may have to make do with longer check-in lines and longer waits for baggage.
U S Airways recently removed a row of coach seats in each wide-body plane to make room for a new, luxurious business-class service. The distance from row to row in the new section is 55 inches, a yawning chasm compared with the 31 inches in coach, where the old seats merely received new covers.
American Airlines announced last month that it would remove 12 coach seats on many of its planes flying domestic routes to add 6 in first class. It also introduced a new top tier in its frequent-flier program, promising each member personalized phone reservations and special concierge service in Chicago, Dallas, Miami and New York. Both American and T.W.A. have also begun giving more frequent-flier credits to passengers who pay top dollar. T.W.A., for example, grants an extra mile for each dollar spent on a full-fare ticket.
Northwest Airlines and United Airlines have even begun limiting the number of bags low-paying passengers can carry onto certain flights. United, Delta Air Lines and others once routinely let passengers with small children board first. Now that privilege is reserved for full-fare passengers and frequent fliers.
"I'm amazed at how poor the general coach service is," said Jean Wyman, president of Good Thinking Inc. in Baltimore, which sells self-improvement audio tapes. "The general feeling is, 'If you are sitting in coach, we don't have to be nice to you,' " said Ms. Wyman, who was an elite traveler until she started her own business.
For most travelers, there is little choice. "The people who are left out in the cold are the leisure travelers who want something better and would be willing to pay a modest amount for that," said Ed Perkins, editor of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter. "Your cheap ticket is a very bad product, and if you want a good product, you pay up to 12 times as much."
Fewer seats in coach will also mean more competition for low fares. Most major airlines now give prime spots in the front of the coach cabin to business travelers who pay full coach fares but are not lucky enough to be upgraded to business or first class. They often have an empty seat next to them, while passengers flying on discount tickets are packed three abreast.
The airlines deny that they skimp on service for economy passengers, saying they are simply offering more to those who pay the highest fares.
"I think the principle 'You get what you pay for' is recognized in America and around the world," said Donald Casey, a T.W.A. executive vice president.
Not surprisingly, catering to the elite makes good business sense. An industry study conducted for United last year identified five distinct types of business travelers and three types of leisure passengers. The top two tiers of business travelers -- "road warriors" and "global travelers" -- represented 9 percent of all passengers but contributed 44 percent of industry revenues. Leisure travelers represented 60 percent of the total but only 28 percent of revenues.
That is largely because business travelers are most likely to fly on short notice in the middle of the week, when fares are highest, while vacationers tend to buy in advance and stay over a Saturday to obtain the lowest fares.
Over the last three years, a strong economy has lifted passenger traffic far faster than the airlines have added airplanes, allowing them to raise walk-on fares to record heights, such as $1,836 for a last-minute round trip to Los Angeles from New York. Business fares soared an average of 16 percent last year, according to American Express. As a result, many carriers are under pressure from corporate clients to provide better service.
"In all honesty, I don't think the airlines do enough for their frequent fliers," said Chip Rowe, senior vice president at a computer consulting company in Phoenix, who flew about 100,000 miles last year.
One problem the airlines face is that no matter how much they expand the first-class cabins, there are still too few seats on many domestic flights, meaning that some full-fare passengers end up staying in coach. Business travelers complain that they are then treated the same as passengers who have paid much less.
"Sometimes I'm paying $1,000 in coach and somebody sitting next to me is paying $300 and we are both getting lousy service, so there is some equality there," said Peter Schaeffer, a stock analyst at SBC Warburg Dillon Read in New York.
The situation was made worse in the early 1990's, when large losses at many airlines forced them to cut back meal service and other amenities in coach. Now that the airlines are making record profits, many carriers are restoring some cuts.
"There is probably further to go to catch up in economy class than in first class," said Lynda Zane, president of the International Inflight Food Service Association and senior director of dining services at Continental Airlines.
United Airlines is in the midst of spending $390 million to overhaul the interiors of all its planes, installing new, more comfortable seats in every section -- including coach. The airline has also received good reviews for a new menu in coach created by the chef Sheila Lukins, author of "The Silver Palate Cookbook." American, too, has said it will replace 70,000 seats in first class and coach.
But even these changes are geared more toward the full-fare passenger and frequent fliers. For example, American is touting the fact that it plans to install power plugs for laptop computers in both first class and coach in many planes. But in coach, the plugs will be concentrated in the front rows, where the airline gives priority to premium customers.
One of the biggest complaints from business travelers who fly economy is that by the time they get on the plane the overhead luggage compartments are full. Northwest has begun limiting coach passengers with discount tickets to a single carry-on bag, while allowing full-fare or frequent fliers to bring on two.
United's new "Take-Off Fares" from Des Moines to Chicago and Denver are sold with the proviso that the holder can carry on only a single bag. Last month, passengers who purchased a ticket to Chicago 14 days in advance and paid on the spot were quoted a fare of $177. But if they wanted to carry on two bags, they would have had to pay $543 or be forced to check one of their bags at the gate. (Premier members of United's frequent-flier program are exempt from the restriction.) United has said it may expand the idea into other markets.
Virtually every major airline is also spending millions to expand and spruce up its network of V.I.P. airport lounges, which are increasingly being made available to passengers paying full fares as well as to frequent fliers.
Trying to win the loyalty of frequent fliers with fancy perks may be good marketing, but it also poses dangers. Raising expectations increases the chances that passengers will be disappointed when planes are late, or there is no room in first class to upgrade.
Indeed, the airline that regularly receives the fewest customer complaints is Southwest Airlines, the no-frills carrier that offers peanuts and no assigned seating.
"With Southwest, you're in a cattle car, but you leave on time and get there on time," said James L. Kincaid Jr., president of an energy company in Tulsa, Okla. "I would give up my status of getting first-class seats and all that if I just knew that I would get there on time."

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day yesterday with the continuation of a front-page article about the special treatment that airlines increasingly give their best customers omitted the number of frequent-flier miles awarded by American Airlines to different categories of passengers in a new program. A corrected chart appears on page D11.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "In First Class, Friendlier Skies"
American Airlines recently began weighting the miles it awards passengers looking to qualify for its new top-tier Executive Platinum frequent-flyer status. It takes 100,000 miles to qualify and depends on how much is paid for each ticket.
 
Here is how many miles passengers in different classes would earn on a 4,950-mile round-trip flight from New York's Kennedy Airport to Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Nasdaq Index Leads Rivals After Quarter

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Even as some technology companies warned investors to lower their expectations, the index that is home to many technology stocks turned in an extraordinary performance in the first quarter of 1998.
The Nasdaq composite, aided by Microsoft and Internet stocks, gained 16.90 percent in the period, outpacing other major market gauges. Microsoft's stock rose 39 percent as the company foreshadowed record profits, while Dell Computer's shares gained 61.3 percent on strong demand for its products. 
 Internet stocks, like the bookseller Amazon.com, soared, as investors bid up nearly everything in the category. Even the chip maker Intel, which led stock analysts to lower their earnings estimates in early March, held up remarkably well, gaining more than 11 percent in the early months of the year.
Technology shares were not the only winners. Stock market measures of all types finished the quarter sharply higher. The Dow Jones industrial average, which contains blue chips like Ford Motor, gained 11.27 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broader gauge, rose 13.53 percent. The Russell 2000, which includes small-company stocks, had a more than respectable 9.99 percent increase.
The Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 set record highs again yesterday. But the big-stock gauges were lackluster. After falling four days in a row, the Dow inched up 17.69 points to close at 8,799.81. The S.& P. 500 rose 8.20, to 1,101.75, just shy of its high of 1,105.65 reached on March 24.
The muted performance yesterday could signal a long anticipated slowdown, several analysts cautioned.
Many economists and analysts have dubbed this the "Goldilocks economy," characterized by robust growth, low unemployment, strong corporate earnings and low inflation. But it may be headed for an encounter with the economic equivalent of the three bears: an overheating economy, an Asian slowdown and ensuing pressure on corporate earnings growth in the United States.
"This was another very surprising quarter," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. "The economy was stronger than expected. Yes, inflation was subdued, but I think everybody is worried."
Wall Street analysts are forecasting that corporate profits will grow by just seven-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates. In January, they called for a 10.4 percent gain.
The picture for later in the year remains fuzzy. "I think the risks have gone up considerably for earnings disappointments later in the year due to Japan," said Chuck Hill, First Call's director of research. Asia's financial crisis and slowing demand from the region are the common complaints cited by companies warning of earnings shortfalls, he added.
Along with Intel, such technology stalwarts as I.B.M., Motorola, National Semiconductor, Bay Networks, Cabletron, VSLI Technology, Iomega and Silicon Valley Group issued profit warnings in the first quarter.
A belief that the Asian crisis will begin taking its toll on corporate profits has led Barbara Marcin, senior equity portfolio manager at Citibank Global Asset Management, to reduce her holdings of technology shares.
"I think the market will tread water for six months until we see the impact of Asia," she said. "Over the next couple of quarters, the impact of cheaper Asian goods and slowing demand is going to show up in the earnings."
Ms. Marcin has also been avoiding bank stocks, but she has been buying energy stocks, saying that oil prices already reflect decreased demand from Asia.
But some investors, who in recent months had taken a more cautious investment stance, are venturing back into some large multinational stocks. For the last few months, Alan Bond, chief investment officer at Bond Procope Capital Management in New York, has focused on domestic concerns, buying up shares of drug companies, retailers and regional banks in a bid to lessen his exposure to Asia's woes. But he recently began buying strong multinational companies, like Procter & Gamble and Gillette.
While some analysts are bracing for weaker stock market performance, cash inflows into mutual funds and, more importantly, investor sentiment, remain the wild cards that could again push stocks higher, analysts acknowledge.
"I'm optimistic, but less optimistic," Mr. Johnson said. "But I can't tell you how many times I've said that, but this thing just keeps rolling along."
In percentage terms, Apple Computer was among the best-performing companies on the Nasdaq in the quarter. Apple's stock rose 109.52 percent, buoyed by new products and expectations that Steven Jobs, co-founder and now interim chief executive, will remain at the company's helm.
Another Nasdaq winner was SCM Microsystems, which went public at $13 a share in October and ended the first quarter at $80.50. The company, which makes computer equipment and software, got a jolt after signing a contract with Gemplus S.C.A. of France that could be worth $20 million over three years.
Among the worst performers in the technology sector was Iomega. Plagued by shrinking demand for its disk drives and growing competition, Iomega warned that it would lose $10 million to $25 million in the first quarter. Its stock dropped more than 44 percent in the quarter. Iomega's chief executive and president, Kim Edwards, was forced to resign last week.
While Internet stocks have generally been hot, Netscape Communications fell 25.38 percent.
Among the big winners on the New York Stock Exchange were takeover candidates, Metromail, a consumer data base company, which rose 93.7 percent, and Coleman, the camping and leisure equipment maker acquired by Sunbeam, up 92 percent.
Pfeiffer Vacuum Technologies, a German vacuum pump maker, was the leading gainer on the Big Board, up 123 percent.
Laggards on the New York exchange included Paragon Trade Brands, down more than 58 percent. The company reported a fourth-quarter loss because of the loss of a patent infringement suit for its disposable diapers to Procter & Gamble. It has set aside $123 million to settle the suit.
Consolidated Cigar Holdings, which had been a high-flying initial public offering in 1996 at $23 a share, faltered, and was down more than 42 percent.

Gates Describes the Road Ahead as Noisy

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
IMAGINE an office or school where all the people are talking to their computers at the same time. That is the future enunciated last week by Bill Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, at the annual Windows Hardware Engineering Conference in Florida.
At the Winhec keynote session, Mr. Gates told hundreds of the world's top computer engineers and developers that Microsoft had begun developing a consumer version of its Windows NT operating system, which is intended to replace Windows 98 in a few years. Mr. Gates said he believed that the voice, not fingers tapping on a keyboard or a mouse, might eventually become the primary user interface for computers. 
 Cool! Now imagine a prankster running into your office and shouting, "Start menu! MS DOS prompt! Format C, colon, enter! Yes!"
Mr. Gates also stressed the importance of high-speed computer networking, both in the home and between the home and the Internet. Cable modems, Mr. Gates said, will offer the most practical high-speed Internet connections to the home, at least in the near term. He must believe it because he has invested a couple of billion dollars in cable-related companies.
 
Doom and Gloom
All the talk about the future of computers may be moot unless programmers figure out how to fix the so-called millennium bug, also known as the Year 2000, or Y2K, bug. Decades ago, when the century was middle-aged and the extra two bytes were precious, programmers adopted a date format that omitted the "19," as in 1955 or 1999. It is likely to become the most expensive mistake in the history of technology.
How bad will it be when uncorrected computers automatically reset to the year 1900 or simply crash because they cannot compute the year 2000? We all know that it will be bad, but in The Sunday Times of London this week, the upper lip of a senior executive at Barclays Bank, quoted anonymously, was anything but stiff.
"The average man or woman does not appreciate what is going to happen," The Sunday Times quoted the bank executive as saying. "I'm going to plan for the absolute worst. I am talking about the need to start buying candles, tinned food and bottled water from mid-1999 onward. People think that I am mad, but a company director I met last week is intending to set up a commune and buy a shotgun because the potential for looting is also quite high."
He also advised people to sell their homes, stockpile their cash and buy gold in case the Y2K bug causes a global economic collapse, with currencies and stock exchanges tumbling into a computer-induced free fall.
Another British banker, asked by the newspaper to comment on his rival's seemingly daffy remarks, said investing in gold might not be a bad idea. The next day, Prime Minister Tony Blair announced that his Government would recruit an extra 20,000 programmers to try to avert disaster on Jan. 1, 2000.
 
The Privacy Wars
There were several developments last week on the privacy front. First, it was revealed that Kenneth W. Starr, the special prosecutor who is investigating myriad facets of Bill Clinton's personal life, obtained from two bookstores in Washington the records of all the books Monica S. Lewinsky had bought there. No subpoenas or warrants were necessary, apparently, even though Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, has not been charged with any crime.
Also last week, the Census Bureau dropped its plan to allow citizens to respond to questions in the 2000 Census via the Internet. Continuing public concern over privacy on the Internet was the reason, a spokesman said.
And on Monday, a bidding war for the vast databases of Metromail, an Illinois company that boasts of having detailed personal information on more than 100 million Americans, came to an end. The winner is Great Universal Stores P.L.C. of Britain, which two years ago bought the databases of the giant credit bureau TRW, now called Experian. The losing bidder for Metromail was American Business Information of Omaha. Privacy advocates say swapping and selling such lists lessens the control consumers have over information about them.
As privacy questions mount, the Clinton Administration has announced a plan to hold a high-level conference in May to discuss Internet privacy issues.

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK;
California Modern's Emerging Voices

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
PERHAPS Los Angeles seems like a city without a past because the better part of its architectural history this century has been modernist: the clean stucco planes and crisp corners were conceived to look forever new.
Already in the teens and 20's, the architects Irving Gill, Frank Lloyd Wright and the Viennese prophets R. M. Schindler and Richard Neutra came here as though to a promised land, establishing the start of an enduring modernist tradition. 
 That tradition of experimental architecture is now five, going on six, generations long, and a group exhibition at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood -- "New Blood: 101" -- showcases 101 emerging voices.
A continuous easel of panels hung on metal studs marching down a wing of the Pacific Design Center -- the installation was designed by Robert Hale -- attests to Los Angeles's depth on the design bench, and the critical mass of projects, some real, some hypothetical, implies that there are schools, clients, land, attitude and bank loans behind what may be a unique architecture culture within the United States.
The organizer of the show, the architect Bernard Zimmerman, who has a three-decade track record of timely group exhibitions, decided to look beyond the usual suspects -- Frank Gehry, Thom Mayne, Eric Moss -- "to expose, reframe and validate emerging or reinvented design practitioners hidden from view by standard routes of power," he writes, somewhat stiffly, in an introductory overview.
By inviting designers in other disciplines, Mr. Zimmerman and a selection committee also make the point that the architects are part of a larger interdisciplinary pool in which the boundaries between graphics, fashion, photography, landscape, industrial design and video are liquid.
Each of the 101 architects and designers presented a cluster of four panels, and collectively the panels show there is no single line of thought here, but an impressive range and intensity of research.
As in past decades, the house in this city of single-family homes is still the most frequent medium of invention, because it is the most accessible to the small firms that are the Los Angeles norm. Sometimes, the commission that proves a talent is simply a small addition or modification to a house, as in a kitchen with a strikingly inclined roof by Dagmar Richter or a dynamically shaped two-story entry space with listing walls for an existing Santa Monica bungalow by Scott Parker, of the William Taylor Architecture Studio.
Joe Addo, an architect involved in the restoration of the Watts Towers, captured all the drama of living on the hills of Los Angeles with a house in Palos Verdes whose glass-walled rooms project into space.
To judge by the panels, all phases of modernist history are currently subjects of investigation and reinvention. Architecture in the embrace of nature, the machine in the garden and the influence of Japanese buildings are still familiar themes and issues in Southern California, though in the hands of an architect like Jeffrey Daniels, the leaning forms, with a hint of cartoon dynamism, make them new.
The lowly 2-by-4 has provided a great assist to the prevailing climate of design freedom. The postwar promise of mass-produced housing was never realized, because steel never quite won over the cowboy contractor with hammer slung at his hip. Wood remains the material of choice and economy. Wood studs flex in earthquakes and are highly malleable, lending themselves to ad hoc site decisions and custom tailoring. A bedroom addition by Lanier Lubowicki, with a large volume telescoping into smaller living areas, emphasizes wood as both structure and esthetic.
When steel appears, it is as exception rather than rule. Two houses by Finn Kappe mix messages by combining wood and steel, as well as surface finishes made of different but complementary materials -- glass, metal, wood, stucco, stone. Mr. Kappe does not strive for the purity often associated with modernism but for complex character that embraces both the warm and the cool.
In this city of maverick small-scale entrepreneurs, the relative absence of a corporate mentality is mirrored in the design community, which is constituted largely of boutique operations in which a single person, or two people of the same mind, determine the design.
Some architects have succeeded in extending that independence to a scale beyond single-family houses, as in a housing and community center by Hok Sik Son, a former Gehry associate, where he breaks the so-called dingbat formula of standard low-rise stud-and-stucco housing with an apartment block packed with units elegantly wedged at an angle: the jostled balconies on the facade express the angled internal organization.
Modernist design here was radically transformed two decades ago by Mr. Gehry, who deliberately mixed art into his architecture, and about the same time by the Southern California Institute of Architecture, an alternative school founded by Finn Kappe's father, Ray, based on experimentation.
The fallout for many designers is a practice of uncertain, apparently chaotic geometry. Michele Saee, who teaches at the school, wrote on his panels that architecture cannot represent "the Big Machine of a Newtonian world" any longer. The fractal geometries of his design sketches resemble a Richard Chamberlain crashed-fender sculpture.
One casualty of these investigations is modernism's famously flat roof, which has been bent and folded into strangely beautiful topographies, as in Janek Bielski's design for St. Vibiana Cathedral in downtown Los Angeles. Similarly, a long roof of a low-slung house by Melvyn Bernstein has the profile of a readout from an electrocardiogram that concludes in a heart attack.
The resistance to corporate culture, and the ethic and cult of individuality, has found its way even into some large-scale corporate firms and from there into major institutional projects. Mehrdad Yazdani, formerly with Ellerbe Becket and now with Daniel Dworsky, displays on his boards a poetically complex Los Angeles subway station at the corner of Vermont and Santa Monica Boulevards, nearing completion, with elliptical shapes inside and out, and elaborate stainless-steel armature for air ducts.
A premise of the exhibition was to show architecture within a larger visual culture, to reflect "a more pluralistic, heterogeneous sense of design in our community," Mr. Zimmerman writes. The furniture designer Lisa Krohn created a collection of looping-metal chairs that look like line drawings in space -- some have become instant classics.
In a panel called Transarchitectures, Marcos Novak -- a teacher at the University of California at Los Angeles -- speculates on the impact of cyberspace and physical space on each other in geometrically complex computer images.
With Los Angeles's modernist design culture now a decade or two shy of being a century old, there are several distinct design genealogies. The Gehry office has spawned several smaller firms, including those of Michael Maltzen, Daly-Genik, Narduli-Grinstein, Greg Walsh and Hagy Belzberg, who exhibited highly dynamized plans of a house that juts out from its hillside site like a wing taking flight.
In an exception to small-scale explorations, John Lumsden -- whose father is Tony Lumsden, an eminent Los Angeles architect -- produced high-tech, high-rise buildings of virtuoso complexity, the pristine shapes beautifully sheathed in anodized aluminum.
"New Blood: 101" may be a large show without a single viewpoint, but scope and pluralism are precisely the issue, and if the shape of the exhibition seems formless, the high standards of selection keep it from mere cheerleading.
Pandora escaped from the architectural box here some time ago, and she is still very alive, well and kicking conventions.
"New Blood: 101" runs through April 30. It is available on line at www.volume5.com.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
In Which a Young Abolitionist Woman Goes West

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

THE ALL-TRUE TRAVELS AND ADVENTURES OF LIDIE NEWTON
By Jane Smiley
452 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.
 In a completely new voice for her, the versatile Jane Smiley in her latest novel, "The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton," authentically mimics a 20-year-old mid-19th-century woman who likes to do whatever she damned pleases, as one of her Quincy, Ill., neighbors might say. 
 "Worse, I was plain," Lidie tells us near the opening of her harrowing adventures. "Worse than that, I had refused the three elderly widowers who had made me offers and expected that I would be happy to raise their packs of motherless children. Worst of all, I had refused them without any show of gratitude or regret. So, I freely concede, there was nothing to be done with me."
But she is honest, thoughtful, independent-minded and smart. She can ride a horse "astride, saddle or no saddle." She has swum the width of the Mississippi River. She can shoot and she can fish. So when Thomas Newton passes through Quincy on the way to the Kansas Territory with the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company -- which means that he's "a d----- Abolitionist," as Lidie quotes one of her relatives -- Thomas takes heed of Lidie.
And she takes heed of him. "One thing I've noticed is that when a particular notion enters your head, then its very particularity makes everything tend toward it, and the tending goes faster and faster," she remarks. "One day you will have barely thought of something, and that little thought inspires such excitement and fear that you don't want to think of it again, but some few days later, maybe three or four, the thing you could hardly think of is now done, and you are embarked upon a new life."
In no time at all, Thomas and Lidie are married, much to the relief of her sisters, and on their way West.
What follows is not at all what Lidie expected based on the "delightful bills" she had gazed at, advertising the beauty and temperateness of Kansas. What she and Thomas go through are extremes of heat and cold, insult and rancorousness. "Bleeding Kansas," as it was called in the 1850's, is in the throes of civil violence as pro-slavery men contend with Free Staters. Lidie, after running afoul of everything from claim-jumpers to "border ruffians" from Missouri, suffers a trial that only a woman of her extraordinary mettle can survive.
In extreme contrast to recent books of hers like "A Thousand Acres," an updating of "King Lear" set on a mid-American farm, and "Moo," a satire of academia, "The All-True Travels" is written in the style of a 19th-century novel, complete with asides addressed to the reader, running heads that reflect the plot's development ("Alone in the World," "Delights of the West," "An Impromptu Eulogy"), and selections at the beginning of each chapter from "A Treatise on Domestic Economy, for the Use of Young Ladies at Home," by Miss Catherine E. Beecher, the gentility of which contrasts amusingly with the rough realities of Lidie's world.
The chief appeals of Ms. Smiley's narrative are the integrity of her protagonist and the authentic feel of the world she creates. Like actual history, the plot offers no neat solutions, no final victories or defeats, no revenge for wrongs done, no poetic justice. Characters wander randomly on and off stage. Details accumulate for no particular reason. The only sure thing is Lidie's voice and presence. The only thread of development is her growth as an Abolitionist.
But a little of this goes a very long way, and Ms. Smiley has given us some 450 pages of it. After a hundred pages or so, the story grows intermittently tedious. True, it keeps coming to life again, whenever Lidie is endangered, or when halfway through the plot she assumes the disguise of a man, or whenever a horse named Jeremiah appears, who, aside from Lidie, is the novel's most appealing character.
And an amusing literary joke is worked in, when Lidie reads "Pride and Prejudice" while staying at a Missouri plantation complete with slaves, which spoils the ending of Austen's book for her. "I no longer felt that living with Mr. Darcy at Pemberley was the be-all and end-all of existence, and I wondered how Elizabeth, who was so witty and lively that it was easy to feel a kinship with her, would assume authority over the invisible but necessary troop of servants."
Still, "The All-True Travels and Adventures" asks a lot of the reader. Its main complication doesn't occur until page 250. And its writing falls prey to the fallacy that by returning to a slower-paced period of history you can expect the reader to revert to a sensibility that preceded faster forms of narrative like the movies and television.
Ms. Smiley's novel impressively recreates a violently contentious period of American history. But among other things, that contentiousness was depressing. And one of the strongest feelings you come away from "Travels" with is gloom.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Plan for Foreign Corporate Accountability

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
An international advisory group of experts in corporate governance is expected to submit recommendations today to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that are intended to improve the accountability of foreign companies to their shareholders.
In its report, the advisory panel recommends, among other things, greater independence for board members and increased disclosure of timely financial information. It was established in 1996 at the request of the O.E.C.D., a Paris-based grouping of 29 industrial nations. The panel, headed by Ira M. Millstein, a lawyer with Weil, Gotshal & Manges in New York who advises many corporate boards, said that such measures were necessary for countries to attract foreign capital. 
 The group, however, advised O.E.C.D. members to stop well short of developing a one-size-fits-all template for running companies and to allow businesses to develop structures that best suit their needs.
The report is timely. The financial crises in East Asia have led to widespread discussion about failed corporate practices governing lending and borrowing. And last month, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, one of Japan's most conservatively run enterprises, outlined a number of changes in the way it will run the company.
It said it would repurchase shares, introduce a stock option plan for senior executives and directors, link managers' salaries to the performance of its stock and streamline its board. Matsushita said the changes were meant to "place increasing emphasis on shareholder interests, management transparency and management resource efficiency."
Many institutional investors in the United States are demanding such changes of the companies in which they hold shares. The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, for example, said last month that it wanted Japanese corporate boards to make several changes, including adopting formal counting practices for all shareholder votes, improving disclosure and linking executive compensation to performance.
Mr. Millstein said he expected O.E.C.D. members to adopt the guidelines later this month, adding that it would help many countries, including France, Germany and Japan, justify the need for companies to make changes so they will be more responsive to outside shareholders than in the past.
The six-member advisory group includes executives from France, Britain, Germany and Japan. Besides Mr. Millstein, the other American member of the group is Robert E. Denham, a former chairman of Salomon Inc.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Agency executives meet to assess the good times now and to prepare for the challenges ahead.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE ebullient mood of Madison Avenue is likely to infuse the 80th annual meeting of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, under way in Scottsdale, Ariz., with a rosy glow reminiscent of a desert sunrise. Still, much of the meeting will be devoted to a discussion of issues that are challenging the industry even during one of its most upbeat eras.
"There are not a lot of storm signals on the horizon in terms of the economy or the stock market," said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the association. 
 "As long as those hold up," he added, "ad spending will hold up. And our members will be pretty happy."
Yet a substantial portion of the agenda of the meeting, which began yesterday afternoon, is being dedicated to what Mr. Drake described as "recurring concerns I get from members," who are the top executives at 560 agencies.
Those topics range from the pitfalls faced in handling the accounts of giant worldwide marketers to the difficulties of reorganizing operations for increased efficiency to the perils posed by clients that abruptly change agencies.
Among the speakers and panelists scheduled to appear at the meeting -- which is being held at a hotel with the rather ungainly name of the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort at Gainey Ranch -- are Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP Group P.L.C.; Bob Wehling, senior vice president of the Procter & Gamble Company; Robert J. Herbold, chief operating officer of the Microsoft Corporation, and Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican Presidential candidate who has since developed a post-political career as a product pitchman.
Officials of the association, which is also known as the Four A's, will also address the meeting as it continues through Saturday.
"At the moment, times are good in the agency business," said Ralph Rydholm, the 1997-98 chairman of the association, "and I'm not a doom-and-gloomer. But we do have some issues."
Mr. Rydholm, who is chief executive of Euro RSCG Tatham, a unit of Havas Advertising in Chicago, will share his thoughts in a speech, which he has tentatively titled "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," scheduled for the general session of the meeting this morning.
Among the subjects Mr. Rydholm said he may discuss are the problems agencies encounter in working with consultants who are hired by advertisers to conduct account reviews, the struggle to attract a diversified work force and the battle to keep compensation from dwindling to levels that make servicing accounts unprofitable.
The executive who is succeeding Mr. Rydholm as chairman of the Four A's is scheduled to address the general session on Saturday. He is Patrick J. McGrath, president and chief executive at Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor in New York.
"I'm still fiddling with the idea of what I want to try and spend my year as chairman doing," Mr. McGrath said. "One proposal is that we do a better job of making sure our industry is sold properly, not only talking about the value of advertising but about the value of advertising agencies." That has become a pressing issue for agencies as management consultants begin to sell themselves to advertisers as experts in marketing communications.
And when the "quarter-to-quarter mentality is rampant" among chief executives, Mr. McGrath asserted, "that is not conducive to our best efforts, because the big, brand-building ideas that agencies do better than anyone else impact a business best over a long period of time."
Mr. McGrath was elected the 1998-99 chairman of the association at a business session yesterday. He had been the 1997-98 vice chairman.
Also, Shelly Lazarus, chairwoman and chief executive of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, a unit of WPP in New York, was elected the 1998-99 vice chairwoman. Sally Minard, a partner in Lotas Minard Patton McIver in New York, was elected the secretary and treasurer for 1998-99.
About 440 agency executives and spouses were expected in Scottsdale for what the Four A's has formally designated as its management conference and annual meeting. That is to help differentiate the event from three others now held annually for media executives, account planners and creative executives.
In the 1980's, Mr. Drake said, before the Four A's began narrowing the annual meeting to agency managers, about 750 people attended each year. That declined to about 600 a year in the early 1990's, primarily because of the recession, and has settled at around 400 a year recently.
Mr. Drake said that he would propose an idea in a speech this morning "to take this meeting back to twice its size." He declined to elaborate, saying cheerfully, "See you in the desert."
What could that idea be? Free registration for executives who sell their agencies to WPP, Omnicom Group or the Interpublic Group of Companies? Designating Walt Disney World as the annual meeting site in perpetuity? Sponsoring posh meetings at sea, Titanic style -- minus icebergs, of course? Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: Afghans Meet With U.N. Official Who Is, er, a Woman

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, April 1

 BODY:
Confronted with growing hostility in Afghanistan, the United Nations told the radical Islamic movement Taliban today that unless harassment of international officials stops and more attention is paid to the rights of women, the organization could sharply reduce its assistance. This is the only substantial aid flowing into this country, one of the world's poorest and least developed.
The message was delivered by Carol Bellamy, executive director of Unicef and one of the highest ranking Americans in the United Nations system. Her arrival here today, after meetings in Geneva over the weekend with Secretary General Kofi Annan, sent another message: that a woman has the power to affect Afghanistan's national development and cannot be ignored. 
 Today for the first time the No. 2 man in the Taliban hierarchy, the Acting President, Mullah Mohammed Rabanni, agreed to meet a foreign woman publicly.
The movement's chief of protocol, Dr. Abdul Sattar Paktiss, then entertained Ms. Bellamy and other United Nations officials at a relatively lavish lunch, complete with white linen and an abundant floral centerpiece laid out under bullet-riddled picture windows at the skeletal Kabul Inter-Continental Hotel. Ms. Bellamy spent the day dressed conservatively in slacks, a long-sleeved sweater, a raincoat and a headscarf.
In recent months, as fissures in the Taliban seemed to be widening, Afghan officials in some regions have stepped up a campaign of harassing United Nations staff members with unexplained searches, threats and generally confrontational behavior
The incidents culminated last month in an assault on a United Nations worker in Kandahar by the regional Taliban governor, who was apparently annoyed that money for flood relief had not been delivered. The United Nations withdrew all its staff from Kandahar, the religious headquarters of the Taliban.
The United Nations is studying a general cutback to only "life saving" activities, which could gut already modest programs in health, narcotics control and other areas. Unicef's education projects are on hold because girls are denied equal access to schooling.
More worrying in the long term than isolated acts of violence, Ms. Bellamy told the Taliban today, was the edict issued recently forbidding Muslim women from working and traveling in Afghanistan without a husband or other close male relative.
International aid workers see that as an attempt to curtail the influence of women from more moderate Muslim countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh or Turkey. United Nations officials had welcomed such women's involvement in Afghanistan, seeing them as a cultural bridge. The edict effectively bars them from working.
The Taliban leadership continues to bar girls from education beyond primary school, citing a lack of buildings and safety concerns. Many girls are enrolled in often-secret home schools run by teachers who became unemployed when the movement sharply limited the right of women to work outside the home.
At the same time, in the absence of foreign aid from traditional sources, the Taliban leadership has become increasingly demanding of United Nations attention and money. The Taliban controls more than three-quarters of Afghanistan but has almost no international recognition because of its human rights record. Its politically inexperienced religious fighters, drawn from Islamic schools, have not developed economic policies for lifting the war-ravaged country out of extreme poverty.
"Our country needs support," Dr. Paktiss, the chief of protocol, said before meeting Ms. Bellamy, whom he welcomed as "an honored guest." He added that he asked only that Islamic culture be respected.
Mr. Rabanni, the Acting President, told Ms. Bellamy, "Everything is negotiable," adding that the edict on women's work and travel was being reviewed.
Afghan and United Nations officials say the edict was apparently issued by extreme conservatives in Kandahar without the knowledge of less radical officials in Kabul.
Ms. Bellamy said Afghan culture would not be ignored, but that this was not an excuse for unacceptable behavior.
"The United Nations works in more than 180 countries around the world, in many different cultures, in many different environments," she said. "But there are basic principles that are followed. We respect different cultures. But there is a level of response that will be necessary.
"We want to work with the authorities to improve conditions for the people of Afghanistan. But there needs to be agreement about how we will be able to work in this country."
Ms. Bellamy said that the Taliban understands the seriousness of the United Nations position, and that the Taliban and the United Nations are choosing negotiating teams to resolve outstanding issues. "There is an indication that the upcoming negotiations will be taken quite seriously," she said.

Treasury Securities in a Rebound After Some Early Volatility

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities ended sharply higher yesterday after some early volatility from an unexpectedly strong manufacturing report and a large Fannie Mae debt sale.
Some traders said the dismissal of the sexual harassment lawsuit by Paula Corbin Jones against President Clinton may also have helped bond prices late in the afternoon by removing some political uncertainty surrounding the White House. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly index of manufacturing rose to 54.8 in March from 53.3 in February.
Market forecasters had expected a decline to 53.0, and the surprise gain suggested a modest acceleration in economic growth that caused some investor concern about inflation, even though the economy shows few price pressures. Bond prices fell on the purchasing report before rebounding.
The Treasury's 30-year bond rose 25/32, to a price of 103 15/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.88 percent, from 5.93 percent on Tuesday and the lowest in a week. Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, partly attributed the market's recovery to a realization among sellers that there was little evidence in the purchasing report of rising inflation.
Bond market participants are now beginning to turn their attention to the Labor Department's report tomorrow on March unemployment, with specific attention directed toward payroll growth to see if its recent strong pace will continue.
The bond market also overcame some selling pressure yesterday caused by Fannie Mae, one of the largest debt issuers in the United States outside the Treasury, which sold $4 billion of five-year notes through various securities dealers at a price to yield 5.814 percent, or about 18 basis points more than the 5.5 percent Treasury note due March 2003. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The Treasury was also in the market yesterday to auction $19.1 billion of 13-day cash management bills at an average rate of 5.45 percent. The cash management bills are used to meet the Treasury's short-term cash needs, in addition to its regular schedule of debt sales. It announced that it will sell $8 billion of 30-year inflation-indexed bonds next Wednesday, making it the latest addition to the number of inflation-indexed securities it will be selling in the future.

Socialism and its long lines are alive and well at Disneyland.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif.

 BODY:
ATTENTION demoralized commissars: Dismayed by the failure of perestroika, goulash communism and other attempts to find a "third way" between mindless central planning and soulless capitalism? Don't waste your time searching for inspiration in Stockholm or Santa Monica, Calif. Come to Disneyland, where socialism really does have a human face.
A tasteless joke, you say, at the expense of that late, great archconservative, Walt Disney? Perhaps. But the closer one looks at the Magic Kingdom, the more parallels one sees with economies that use a "first come, first serve" approach as a substitute for market forces. And unlike Eastern Europe's hapless experiments with a third way, this one can boast of smiling workers, fresh vegetables and even clean public bathrooms. It even boasts a "gray market" that was not so evident in a visit by this columnist two years ago. 
 In the capitalist world, scarce goods and services are allocated with prices. Want a new car? Make General Motors an offer.
In socialist economies like Disneyland, scarcity is resolved with queues. Want to test your mettle against the spiders, lava pits and falling boulders on the Indiana Jones Adventure ride? Or share a spooky moment with the holographic ghosts in the Haunted Mansion? Get in line.
In the former Soviet Union, queues were widely seen a symbol of social and economic failure. The hours frittered away waiting to buy shoes or sausage or vodka were hours away from work and family. In Disneyland, by contrast, 90-minute queues only seem to reinforce the view that the prize is worth the sacrifice -- that, against all evidence to the contrary, the Matterhorn Bobsleds are the equal of the gut-busting roller coasters at Six Flags, or that Splash Mountain offers thrills unavailable from other water flume rides.
One reason is that the Walt Disney apparachiks simply do a better job than their cynical counterparts in the former Soviet bloc. To generate the illusion of progress, the lines are single file and their length is concealed in mazes of tunnels and passageways. To maintain morale, the customers are distracted with dioramas -- cuddly George Lucas androids repairing spaceships at the Star Tours simulation, a nifty African Queen set for the Jungle Cruise. Meanwhile, strolling barbershop quartets, Dixieland bands, story tellers and Disney characters keep the 5e-year-olds from chewing on their Mickey ears.
Look a bit closer, though, and all does not appear well in this socialist paradise. For starters, the vacationing proletariat can't be entirely pleased with the arrangement since it spends a lot of effort gaming the system. Indeed, a whole cottage industry has sprung up to provide counsel on how to beat the lines. "Bob Sehlinger's Unofficial Guide to Disneyland" (2.5 million copies in print) offers some hundred pages of tips for minimizing the tedium.
More ominous, scarcity has led to the creation of gray markets in which money is legally used as a substitute for time in line. Those willing to buy a hotel package or five-day Flex Signature Passport are permitted to enter the park an hour or two before each day's official opening -- what Disney calls "magic morning" admission. Concierge service, an expensive option at the most expensive Disney-owned hotels, includes guaranteed access to breakfasts with Winnie-the-Pooh, Pinocchio and the gang. Guided tours ($60 a hour for a minimum of four hours) get you reserved seating at jam-packed street and stage performances such as the Fantasmic laser light show.
Disney has thus far been careful to minimize the visibility of this gray market. And for good reason: Nothing undermines the egalitarian ethic as swiftly as preferential access to the salad bar.
But capitalist rot does seem to be spreading as -- shades of the Soviet Union -- managers look to outside cash and technology to speed modernization. Corporations, including Eastman Kodak, AT&T and Federal Express, get backdoor access to the various Disney rides or exhibits they sponsor through private lounges. And according to The Wall Street Journal, these sponsors, in turn, offer back-door privileges to employees of other Disney corporate sponsors, creating what amounts to a first-class deck on the good ship Disney.
Could socialism, Disney-style, follow the Soviet Union into the ash can of history? Don't get your hopes up: the old theme park is still a money machine. And it is about to get a face lift that among other things will update the embarrassingly quaint vision of the future known as Tomorrowland.
But it's still fun to imagine. Perhaps the day is not far off when the Mouse's cult of personality will be denounced at Congressional hearings, speculators will hawk tickets to Pirates of the Caribbean to the highest bidders, and gangs of disillusioned Disney characters will extort protection money from the shops on Main Street.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Sales Slip Despite Sport Vehicle

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 1

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation's sales slipped 1.8 percent in March, with strong sales of the latest brawny sport utility vehicle to hit the market nearly offsetting a sharp decline in car sales.
Chrysler said today that its car sales last month dropped 12,470, or 16.8 percent. But the company sold 12,283 Dodge Durangos -- the new sport utility vehicle -- nearly offsetting the drop in cars. Trucks fared better: combined sales of sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks rose 6.3 percent in March, compared with 1997. 
 "The Dodge Durango has proven itself to be a runaway hit," said James P. Holden, Chrysler's executive vice president for sales and marketing. "We continue to be impressed by the strong demand for our trucks and sport utility vehicles," he said, noting that sales of Dodge Dakota pickups rose 16.0 percent.
The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company are expected to announce their sales on Friday. Wall Street analysts expect that for the industry as a whole, sales will fall 3 to 4 percent from the strong sales last March.
So far, the results seem to be following a familiar pattern. While sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans are selling briskly, cars are selling slowly.
"The light-truck business continues to boom, the passenger car business continues to suffer, and over all we're having continued strong sales," David B. Healy of Burnham Securities said.
The 10 auto makers reporting results today saw a combined drop of 8.7 percent. "It looks a little weaker than last year, but we're looking for G.M. to report a strong number, and to lift the overall sales somewhat," Nicholas J. Colas, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, said. He said G.M. sales might be up as much as 5 percent, compared with the strong levels a year earlier and were expected to be no worse than flat. He cited an aggressive advertising campaign and rebate push from the company last month.
Foreign auto makers reported mixed sales results today. Toyota sales fell 13.4 percent, with truck sales up 1.8 percent and car sales down 20.4 percent. Toyota's flagship Camry sedan recorded another month of weak results -- sales fell 24.4 percent in March. The only models with sales increases were Toyota's four newest -- the Sienna mini-van, the Lexus GS300 and GS400 performance sedans and the Lexus RX300 sport utility vehicle. Sales declined for the rest.
Nissan sales plunged 42.3 percent, partly because its sales were so strong during the 1997 period. Mitsubishi sales dropped 27.8 percent. Land Rover sales fell 20.2 percent.
Others fared better. Despite weak truck sales, overall sales at Honda rose 5 percent in March. Car sales rose 8.1 percent, led by a 24.5 percent increase for the Honda Accord. Even the Honda Civic -- one of the only small cars selling well in a slump for that segment of the market -- saw its sales rise 8.6 percent.
"Civic sales continue to defy the trend, while demand for the new Accord shows no signs of letting up," said Richard A. Colliver, Honda's senior vice president for sales.
Honda's sales of sport utility vehicles and mini-vans fell a combined 12.4 percent, hurt by a 27.3 percent drop in sales of the Odyssey mini-van and a 19.8 percent fall in sales of the CR-V sport utility vehicle, but helped by a 55 percent rise in sales of the Passport, Honda's larger sport utility vehicle.
Subaru sales rose 20.7 percent last month, compared with March 1997, helped by strong sales of its popular Forester sport utility vehicle and its Legacy "sport utility sedan."
Mazda sales jumped 17.3 percent, helped by strong sales of its 626 sedan. Two Korean auto makers, Kia and Hyundai, reported hefty sales increases after offering steep discounts on cars. Kia sales rose 96.6 percent, while Hyundai's rose 27.6 percent.

Auto Sales Down in Japan
 TOKYO, April 1 (Bloomberg News) -- Japanese auto makers reported their 12th consecutive monthly decline in domestic sales, as record unemployment and lower wages kept buyers out of showrooms.
Domestic vehicle sales fell 20.7 percent from March 1997, to 658,997, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said. The decline followed a 22.4 percent drop in January.
Sales of imported vehicles for the month plunged 34.6 percent, to 37,845, following a 39.8 percent decrease in February.

HEADLINE: Early Sign of March Growth As Purchasers Index Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Growth in the nation's manufacturing sector expanded smartly in March, well ahead of analysts' expectations, without showing signs of rekindling inflation.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday that its monthly index of business activity, compiled from interviews with corporate purchasing executives nationwide, surged to 54.8 percent last month from 53.3 percent in February. 
 Economists had expected the trade group's figure to be unchanged or slightly lower, reflecting a slowing of the economy because of Asia's financial woes.
But there were no immediate signs in that report or in two other economic reports released yesterday that the Asian fallout was hitting the American economy significantly.
"New news is no news," said Rob ert A. Brusca, chief economist at the Nikko Securities International Company. "Whether there's an Asian effect or not, there's no dramatic evidence of it yet."
The economy, he said, "is still growing very well and still isn't producing much inflation."
In Washington, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending rose in February for the third consecutive month, with increases in housing and government construction offsetting a decline in commercial projects.
The increase, three-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $622 billion, followed stronger gains of seven-tenths of 1 percent in January and eight-tenths of 1 percent in December.
In the third report, an important projection of future economic activity was up a sharp four-tenths of 1 percent in February, the strongest rise in a year.
The index of leading indicators for February stood at 105.0, said the Conference Board, a private research group. Economists had expected the measure to gain a more modest two-tenths of 1 percent. It advanced one-tenth of 1 percent in January.
In its report, the purchasing managers group said its measure indicated that prices paid by manufacturers were still declining. Production and new orders were up in March, it said.
New export orders contracted last month for the third month in a row, while imports of materials by manufacturers increased at a faster rate than in February, it said.
The group's report is widely followed by economists because it is usually the first indicator of how the economy fared in the previous month. Any reading over 50 percent in the index is a sign that manufacturing is growing.
In its report, the Commerce Department said the strength in construction spending in February was led by a 1.1 percent increase in residential construction, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $278.8 billion. Single-family construction advanced 1.9 percent and remodeling grew by one-tenth of 1 percent, while apartment building declined eight-tenths of 1 percent.
Government construction rose 1 percent, the largest increase in four months, to a rate of $140 billion. Commercial construction fell 2.6 percent in February, the biggest drop since August 1995, to a rate of $158.9 billion.
The third report, from the Conference Board, said eight of the 10 components of the leading index rose in February, led by money supply, stock prices and building permits. The biggest decliner was new orders for nondefense capital goods.

HEADLINE: Anger Over Bank Merger Spills Onto Web

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
The joke tellers said that UBS stood for "Unemployed Before Summer" and that Union Bank of Switzerland might as well be the Titanic. But the sarcasm about the proposed merger of the company and the Swiss Bank Corporation was not just limited to conversations in corporate hallways.
A Web site critical of the proposed merger reflected the depths of Union Bank employees' resentment about the prospect of dismissals in one of the biggest banking mergers in history. But this time, unlike other mergers where emotions run high among employees, the authors vented their anger in public. 
 The Web site, housed on America Online, vanished over the weekend after an article about it was distributed on Friday by Bloomberg News.
But Swiss Bank took some lumps, too.
"What's SBC stand for?" one joke read referring to the Stamford, Conn., offices of SBC Warburg Dillon Read, Swiss Bank's United States investment banking unit. "Severance Beats Connecticut."
The Web site included a mock newspaper front page, complete with headlines and a picture of the Titanic, according to the Bloomberg News report. There was a section for job hunters, a place to post E-mail and a list of things to do in Stamford, a suburban community not well known for its hip nightspots.
The $25 billion union between the two companies was never billed as a marriage of equals. Swiss Bank is, in effect, the acquirer, and the combined companies expect to eliminate 13,000 jobs worldwide. Defections at the United States investment banking units were expected because of the overlap between the companies' operations. But many employees at UBS Securities in New York, the Union Bank unit, were not waiting for dismissal notices.
On Monday, for instance, 23 bankers from UBS Securities left for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Among them was Richard Barrett, the former managing director of UBS's financial institutions group. The same day, Furman Selz hired David MacCallum, UBS's global head of the life sciences group. Last Friday, Salomon Smith Barney hired three former UBS energy specialists. And several equity traders are expected to join Lazard Freres & Company this month.
Industry watchers say the relationship between the United States arms of the Swiss rivals has been unusually testy compared with other recent mergers, including those of Salomon Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
"This one gets the soap opera, bang-for-the-buck award," said one stock analyst who has heard complaints from friends at UBS. "Instead of seeing individuals leaving, you are seeing whole departments."
Andrea de Cholnoky, head of the global securities and wholesale banking practice at Spencer Stuart, said, "What we see as recruiters is a ton of people calling us up scrambling to find jobs."
Tricia Primrose, a spokeswoman for America Online, confirmed that the Web site was shut down, but not by America Online. "It was taken down by the account," she said.
Ms. Primrose, citing privacy concerns, would not identify the authors or confirm whether they were employees of either of the companies. She said America Online had received no complaints about the site. "Anybody has a right to create what they want," she said.
In a statement, UBS said the Web site reflected "unproductive comments of a few disgruntled employees." It went on to say, "We do not know the source of the Web site, the reason it was created or why it was shut down." An official from SBC said the company had no comment.
One of the main reasons UBS Securities' employees are upset is the lack of information about the merger from management. One investment banker, who recently landed a job at another firm and asked not to be identified, said he first heard about the merger not from his UBS bosses but from a friend at SBC a few days before the announcement.
Another investment banker who left and also asked not to be identified, said he met an SBC executive in mid-December who told him he would be assigned a new job in the company by month's end. But the banker said he did not hear from the executive until the end of February, after he learned most of the top jobs would be filled by SBC professionals. "And they were trying to keep me," he said. "What about the people they didn't like?"
Mitchell Lee Marks, a consultant in San Francisco who advises chief executives on how to handle the cultural aspects of combining companies, said poor communication between management and employees was all too common in most mergers. "The irony here is executives will spend a lot of money on investment bankers and lawyers to advise them on a merger but not spend a lot of money integrating the companies," he said. "The first thing I tell executives is know what you are going to do."
That is especially important now that disgruntled employees have easy access to a worldwide audience over the Internet and are eager to voice their complaints. Samuel Hayes, a professor of investment banking at the Harvard Business School, said, "This could well be the beginning of a new chapter in employees' capacity to express their views about how they don't like their companies being merged."

Japan Deregulation Starts Amid Bad News

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, April 2

 BODY:
Japan entered a new era of financial-market deregulation on Wednesday as its fiscal year began, but the opening was overshadowed by chronic economic symptoms: a pioneering property broker declared bankruptcy, stocks plummeted and a global trading company disclosed its first loss in nearly a half-century.
Other news of economic weakness also marked the beginning of Japan's financial changes. The Nissan Motor Company, the nation's No. 2 auto maker, said it would suffer an annual loss on its stockholdings in other companies. And forecasters said the quarterly business-sentiment survey of the Japanese central bank would confirm that most companies believe that the nation's economic problems are worsening. 
 The survey, released this morning, showed that corporate managers are scaling back on capital investment and see little hope for a turnaround before summer.
An index derived from the results of the survey, known as the Tankan, fell to minus 31, the most pessimistic level since July-September 1994. "It's a grim situation," said Takeshi Matsui, executive vice president of Daikin Industries, which makes commercial refrigeration equipment.
Securities traders said the biggest negative development affecting the markets on Wednesday was the bankruptcy of the Dai-Ichi Corporation, a real estate broker with 37 billion yen in liabilities, or about $277 million, because of falling property prices.
"It's bad news," said Jason James of HSBC Securities Japan. "People were thinking bankruptcies were held up until the fiscal year-end, and now axes will start falling."
The developments sent Japanese stocks lower, led by Dai-Ichi's main creditors -- the Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Yasuda Trust and Banking, Nippon Credit Bank and Chuo Trust and Banking.
The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 285.51 points, or 1.73 percent on Wednesday, to 16,241.66, erasing Tuesday's gains from year-end Government buying. Early today, stocks tumbled 394.51 points more, or 2.43 percent, to 15,847.15, the lowest since mid-January.
Dai-Ichi said its four main banks had refused to reschedule loans. Its bankruptcy is further evidence that Japanese banks, weakened by soured property loans, have reduced their willingness to lend.
In another consequence of Japan's anemic stock market, which finished the fiscal year down 8.2 percent, the Marubeni Corporation said it would report the first annual loss since 1952. The main reason given by Marubeni, a big trader of metals, machinery and food, was an estimated loss of 51 billion yen on its holdings of shares in other companies.
Japan's financial-system changes, to be completed by 2001, are aimed at dismantling barriers between banks and other financial companies and reducing the regulations that restrict how Japanese can invest their enormous pools of savings. The aim is to increase competition with vibrant markets in New York and London. But these systemic changes are beginning just as the economy is effectively in a recession, the first in more than two decades.

HEADLINE: SENATE COMMITTEE MAKES FAST WORK OF CIGARETTE BILL

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
Sweeping aside challenges favorable and unfavorable to cigarette manufacturers, the Senate Commerce Committee gave a strong bipartisan vote of approval today to legislation that would raise the price of cigarettes and stiffen regulations on tobacco.
No other measure before Congress this year could lead to such fundamental changes in society. If the sponsors are right, it could reduce the number of teen-agers who smoke by as much as 40 percent and prevent millions of early deaths from smoking-related illness. 
 The vote was 19 to 1. The only "no" vote came from Senator John Ashcroft, Republican of Missouri, who argued that other industries were entitled to the same annual limit on damage claims that the bill would give the tobacco companies.
But the ease with which the bill cleared the committee today without substantative change belied the extent of the opposition and the many obstacles that lie ahead.
No one disagreed when Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, called the tobacco question "as contentious an issue as you can get in Congress."
Nor did anyone challenge Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, when he said, "This is nothing like what the final project will be."
Senator John McCain, the committee chairman, said that he hoped the bill would be before the full Senate before Memorial Day. He said that before the Senate could take up the bill, intense negotiations would be needed with other committee chairmen, with the party leaders in the Senate and with the White House.
The House of Representatives has been treading water on the issue, waiting to see what happens in the Senate. White House officials have said that the Senate bill is basically satisfactory, but was not perfect.
The bill would force up the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10 over the next five years, penalize cigarette companies if the number of teen-age smokers did not fall to specified levels and limit the civil liability of the industry to $6.5 billion a year. It also would require the manufacturers to accept strict limits on their advertising and marketing in order to retain the liability ceiling.
Money would be set aside to buy out tobacco farmers who wanted to get out of the business and to help communities that would suffer economically if fewer people smoked.
The bill would be much tougher on the tobacco companies than the settlement they reached with state attorneys general last June.
Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and other public health authorities oppose the measure because they say it is too generous to the tobacco industry. Spokesmen for the industry, on the other hand, say the measure is unacceptable because it would force companies into bankruptcy and lead to a contraband market in cigarettes.
The White House maintains that the penalty imposed on the industry if the rate of youth smoking does not fall enough is too low. The bill would require payments of no more than $3.5 billion a year.
"This is not a perfect document," declared Senator McCain, the person most responsible for putting together a package that satisfied no one entirely but kept the various factions on the committee from bolting.
Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, implored his colleagues to vote for his bill just to push the legislative process along. "If we are ever to complete our mission," he said, "we have to move this through the committee."
With the committee's regular meeting room much too small to handle the crowd, the drafting session was held in a mammoth room in the Hart Office Building, across Constitution Avenue from the Capitol. The room was jammed with lobbyists representing a spectrum of interests -- tobacco companies, public health organizations, convenience stores, vending machine owners, trial lawyers and countless others.
During the breaks, they compared notes and talked softly into cellular phones. Whatever their motives, many of them stood and cheered at the final vote.
When disputes arose today, like whether to lift a ceiling on the tobacco industry's annual legal liability or to place a limit on lawyers' fees, the senators accepted Mr. McCain's plea to leave his bill alone and plan to settle the matter on the Senate floor.
Proposals to raise and to lower theamount by which cigarette prices would be driven up were handily rejected. The price increase would be obtained by placing a steadily rising fee on the cigarette manufacturers for each pack they produced.
To avoid excessive controversy, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who has fought the tobacco companies for years, withdrew his amendment that would have stiffened the penalties on the industry if annual goals for reducing youth smoking were not met.
Similarly, "in deference to the chairman," Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, withdrew a proposal that would have limited to $250 an hour the fee that lawyers who successfully sue the tobacco companies could charge. Approval of the McCain bill intact, said Senator Brownback, "moves us toward a final settlement."
The committee did not deal with the critical question of how to spend the more than $500 billion the bill would raise from the cigarette companies over the next 25 years. And measures to limit smoking abroad were set aside to be debated later.
Senator McCain called this "kicking the can down the road."
Despite the committee comity that Mr. McCain fostered, considerable opposition to his bill was expressed.
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said that his mother had died of lung cancer from smoking and that he had no tobacco interests in his state. But he said he worried that instead of concentrating on how to stop young people from starting to smoke, the committee was "engaging in a rush to see who can be the hardest on tobacco."
Senator Wyden said that the bill should "do more to help protect kids."
But in the end, the consensus was to save the attacks for another time. For example, Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, said that he had been prepared to vote against the bill on the ground that it was too soft on the cigarette companies. But he said he had changed his mind.
"We can only do the best we're able to do," he declared, expressing the sentiment that carried the day.

Chart: "CLOSER LOOK: What the Tobacco Measure Would Do"
 
These are the main provisions of the tobacco legislation:
 
COST -- Tobacco manufacturers would pay a fee to the Government that would be passed on to smokers, increasing the cost of cigarettes by 65 cents a pack in 1999, rising to $1.10 in 2003. The money raised, $506 billion over 25 years, would go into a Government trust fund. The legislation does not specify how the money would be spent.
 
CIVIL LIABILITY -- Damages would be limited to $6.5 billion a year. Claims exceeding that would be paid in later years. No further protection against lawsuits would be given.
 
MARKETING AND ADVERTISING Outdoor advertising would be banned as would advertising containing human images, animal figures and cartoon characters. Color advertisements would be outlawed except in adult publications. If the tobacco companies challenged these restrictions in court, the limit on liability would be eliminated.
 
YOUTH SMOKING -- The goals for reduction in the number of teen-agers who smoke would be 15 percent after three years, rising to 45 percent after 10 years.
 
PENALTIES -- If these targets are missed, the tobacco companies would be assessed penalties not to exceed $3.5 billion a year.
 
REGULATION -- The Food and Drug Administration would be given broad latitude to regulate tobacco, including advertising and youth access. If the agency decided to ban nicotine or a tobacco product, the ban would not go into effect for two years, giving Congress time to pass legislation overturning it.
 
INTERNATIONAL -- Federal money could not be used to promote tobacco exports. A nonprofit corporation would be established to oversee international tobacco control programs.
 
LEGAL FEES -- A three-member arbitration panel would decide the fees that lawyers for successful plaintiffs could receive.
 
FARMERS -- The Government would buy out some tobacco growers and compensate others who continued to farm if demand for tobacco dropped. Grants would be provided to offset economic losses in some communities and to retrain farmers and tobacco workers.

HEADLINE: Control Sought On Districts For Businesses

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY and THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
After years of questioning the powers of the city's private business improvement districts, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is about to propose some stringent measures that would give his administration significant control over the semiautonomous agencies.
The new rules would require the city's 39 districts, which provide services like street cleaning and security, to clear virtually every major undertaking with the Department of Business Services, from the staging of street fairs to the purchase of new computers, said several officials from the districts and others who know of the city's plans. 
 They would also prohibit anyone from serving as the president of more than one improvement district, a rule apparently aimed at Daniel Biederman. Mr. Biederman heads three districts, including two of the most powerful in Manhattan, the Grand Central Partnership and the 34th Street Partnership.
Mr. Biederman, who is also the president of the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, declined to comment yesterday. But several other district officials, speaking only under the condition of anonymity, said the proposed bureaucratic oversight would undermine the very purpose of the private organizations: to work more efficiently than city government can, and to augment government services.
The districts fulfill their mission by levying special taxes on property owners. The money is used for several purposes, including promoting businesses, hiring security guards, and picking up garbage.
"There is a fundamental point here," said a senior executive at a large Manhattan district. "BID's have been established so the private sector can step up to the bar and do what the government wasn't doing.
"I don't think property owners are going to want to pay these kinds of assessments to be a subagency of city government," the executive continued, adding that some improvement districts may go out of business rather than abide by the Mayor's new rules.
Administration officials declined to comment on the proposals, the language for which is still being worked out. But a person familiar with the discussions between the administration and the districts said the city plans to announce the proposal soon, possibly next week. It was unclear last night whether the plan would require approval of the City Council. The Council authorized the creation of such districts 15 years ago, and in recent months, Council leaders have also expressed concerns about the management practices of districts and their lack of oversight. In November, Council leaders introduced some proposals that would more closely regulate existing districts and make it harder to create new ones.
Officials of several of the business improvement districts said yesterday that they were informed last week of the Mayor's plan by the Department of Business Services, which told them that they would be receiving letters detailing the new rules within a day or two. But no letters have been received, leaving some BID officials frustrated and angry.
There have been several notable successes among the city's many improvement districts. The ones in Times Square and in lower Manhattan have been credited with helping to make those areas more appealing to tourists and developers. But others have received unflattering attention.
Several years ago, workers for the Grand Central Partnership were accused of harassing homeless people as a way of keeping them away from cash-machine lobbies and other locations. And last month, Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the Federal District Court of Southern New York ruled that the Grand Central and the 34th Street districts had violated minimum wage laws by hiring homeless people as guards and sanitation workers at $1 to $1.50 an hour.
The Giuliani administration has also prohibited improvement districts from selling bonds or receiving large loans to finance projects, arguing that the city might be held liable if the districts defaulted.
The question of the power of improvement districts resurfaced in February, after the Police Department agreed to put a substation near Wall Street, which would be financed in part by payments of $700,000 a year by the Alliance for Downtown New York, an improvement district in lower Manhattan. That agreement, which also included a plan for the improvement district to aid in the creation of a police museum, raised questions about the influence of the self-taxing agencies and the inequities between districts in rich and poor neighborhoods.
After a dispute arose about the substation, the Mayor directed Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington to study the guidelines governing improvement districts. Mr. Washington's inquiry has led to the guidelines now being hammered out by the administration.
The person familiar with those discussions said some suggestions have been incorporated and others rejected. For example, the city may require the districts to provide weekly logs of all contacts that they have with city agencies, on everything from potholes to 911 calls. But a proposal that the districts first inform the Department of Business Services before getting in touch with elected officials has apparently been dropped.
From their inception a decade ago, the districts have been a hybrid of governmental and private control and influence. Although they receive no money from the city, and are financed entirely by contributions from the property owners, the districts have contractual agreements that obligate the city to collect their assessments and return the money to them.
As part of its commitment to each district, the city promises to collect from property owners who fall behind in their assessments, and can use the same legal means in its collection procedures as it would if it were collecting back taxes. Decisions about how to spend the district's money are approved by boards composed largely of the property owner members in each district.
The proposed guidelines have unnerved several district officials, but only Peter Malkin, the chairman of the Grand Central Partnership and the 34th Street Partnership, would speak for the record.
"I would call for an appointment to speak with the Mayor to clarify what is going on, and come up with a workable solution," he said. But Mr. Malkin, a lawyer who, with Mr. Biederman, has been at the center of some of the controversies surrounding the improvement districts, said he did not intend to challenge the Mayor's new regulations in court.

HEADLINE: Public Works At Record Sum In House Vote

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
The House today overwhelmingly approved the largest public works bill in the nation's history, despite objections from both President Clinton and conservatives that the bill threatens the fiscal discipline of last year's balanced budget agreement.
The transportation legislation, which passed by a vote of 337 to 80, calls for spending $217 billion over six years on projects from highways and bridges to mass transit systems and bicycle paths. And it is packed with special projects, like $3 million for a public television documentary on "infrastructure awareness," or $7 million for transportation enhancements to a Pennsylvania waterfront development project that includes a brew pub. 
 Though strongly supported by the House Republican leadership, the bill still touched off a divisive debate among Republicans over whether their party stood for fiscal prudence or was simply practicing pork-barrel politics. The transportation bill breaks the spending limits set by last year's budget deal by at least $26 billion.
"I hope and pray that somehow this Republican majority finds its roots again," said Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican who serves on the budget committee, "because I believe that right now -- this is it -- we're losing it."
Other Republicans called the repair of the nation's decrepit roads and bridges a party priority, far more worthy than social programs favored by Democrats. "I am not a big spender," said Representative Bud Shuster, the Pennsylvania Republican who, as chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, did more than anyone to write the bill.
"I'm a fiscal conservative," Mr. Shuster said, "but there's a fundamental difference between spending money to build assets and pouring money down a rat hole."
With election-year projects spread through virtually every Congressional district -- and doled out with special largesse to members of Congress of both parties who are likely to face tough races -- the public works measure was considered irresistible.
Its approval signals that far more will be spent on highway and transit projects than could have been conceived of just a year ago, before the prospect of Federal budget surpluses began to appear. The Senate has already overwhelmingly approved similar legislation, which proposes spending $214 billion. The previous largest public works transportation bill was $151 billion, enacted in 1991.
Mr. Shuster said that all the money to pay for the highway projects would come from the Federal gasoline tax that Americans pay at the pump. "The cold-hard fact remains we are simply spending the revenue coming in," he said.
But since the balanced budget agreement had anticipated using some of that revenue to reduce the deficit, the spending called for in the bill would need to be offset by other domestic spending cuts -- or else would threaten the emerging surpluses.
House Republicans made no effort to identify those cuts, even though earlier this week they insisted on cutting domestic programs dear to Mr. Clinton to offset his own request for $2.9 billion in emergency disaster relief and peacekeeping operations in Iraq and Bosnia.
The White House expressed concern that the public works spending would crowd out other domestic programs. "It will not only squeeze out the President's priorities, it will squeeze out Congressional priorities," said Franklin D. Raines, the President's budget director. "You can't vote for all of this spending and still be able to vote for education in September."
But he stopped short of the threat of a Presidential veto, with the overwhelming support for the bill indicating that the President could not prevail in such a fight.
Only a small number of fiscal conservatives were willing to stand against the bill. Representative Lindsey O. Graham, a South Carolina Republican, sought to eliminate more than $9 billion for more than 1,400 special projects that were added to the bill for lawmakers' districts. His amendment failed by a vote of 337 to 79.
By a vote of 225 to 194, the House also defeated an amendment offered by Representative Marge Roukema, a New Jersey Republican, and supported by Speaker Newt Gingrich, to eliminate a Federal program that would set as a goal the award of at least 10 percent of construction contracts to women and minorities.
For the most part Republicans and Democrats alike took turns today praising the public works measure as an economic development project that would create new jobs and reduce traffic fatalities.
"I was called the king of pork because I got five bridges funded," said Representative James A. Traficant Jr., an Ohio Democrat. He said that attitudes changed, however, when one of the exiting bridges collapsed. "I don't apologize for any damn thing," Mr. Traficant said. "You could call me anything you want on this House floor. But if you don't take care of your district, no one's going to take care of your district."
A number of issues, including several of importance to New York, will now be resolved in a House-Senate conference committee that will reconcile the two versions of the bill. The Senate version contains about $41.3 billion for mass transit programs across the nation, while the House has $36.7 billion. New York receives 20 percent of the transit money.
The House, however, gave New York a somewhat greater share of the highway money than the Senate did. Under the House bill, New York would receive about 5.37 percent of the total $180 billion in highway money. The Senate gave New York 5.1 percent of the highway money.
The conference will also decide the fate of the $9 billion in projects added into the bill by the House. New York would receive $652.2 million of those projects.
The Senate bill also includes penalties for states that do not enact laws setting the legal limit for drunken driving to a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 percent, as opposed to most states' standards of 0.10 percent. The House version gives states incentives for imposing stricter levels. But House leaders would not allow a vote on an amendment like the clause in the Senate measure.
And only the Senate bill contains a change in the tax code that would make it easier for employers to offer their workers tax-free transit benefits of up to $65 a month.

HEADLINE: TESTING OF A PRESIDENT;
Federal Judge's Order Dismissing Jones Lawsuit Against the President

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: Washington, April 1

 BODY:
Following is the order of Judge Susan Webber Wright dismissing Paula Corbin Jones's lawsuit against President Clinton. Judge Wright released her decision today in Federal District Court in Little Rock, Ark. Footnotes and legal citations are omitted.
The plaintiff in this lawsuit, Paula Corbin Jones, seeks civil damages from William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, and Danny Ferguson, a former Arkansas State police officer, for alleged actions beginning with an incident in a hotel suite in Little Rock, Ark. 
 This case was previously before the Supreme Court of the United States to resolve the issue of Presidential immunity but was remanded to this court following the Supreme Court's determination that there is no constitutional impediment to allowing plaintiff's case to proceed while the President is in office.
Following remand, the President filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissal of the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Ferguson joined in the President's motion. By memorandum opinion and order dated Aug. 22, 1997, this court granted in part and denied in part the President's motion.
The court dismissed plaintiff's defamation claim against the President, dismissed her due process claim for deprivation of a property interest in her state employment, and dismissed her due process claims for deprivation of a liberty interest based on false imprisonment and injury to reputation, but concluded that the remaining claims in plaintiff's complaint stated viable causes of action.
Plaintiff subsequently obtained new counsel and filed a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, which the court granted, albeit with several qualifications. The matter is now before the court on motion of both the President and Ferguson for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Plaintiff has responded in opposition to these motions, and the President and Ferguson have each filed a reply to plaintiff's response to their motions. For the reasons that follow, the court finds that the President's and Ferguson's motions for summary judgment should both be and hereby are granted.
 
I.
This lawsuit is based on an incident that is said to have taken place on the afternoon of May 8, 1991, in a suite at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock, Ark. President Clinton was Governor of the State of Arkansas at the time, and plaintiff was a state employee with the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission (A.I.D.C.), having begun her state employment on March 11, 1991. Ferguson was an Arkansas State Police officer assigned to the Governor's security detail.
According to the record, then-Governor Clinton was at the Excelsior Hotel on the day in question delivering a speech at an official conference being sponsored by the A.I.D.C. Plaintiff states that she and another A.I.D.C. employee, Pamela Blackard, were working at a registration desk for the A.I.D.C. when a man approached the desk and informed her and Blackard that he was Trooper Danny Ferguson, the Governor's bodyguard.
She states that Ferguson made small talk with her and Blackard and that they asked him if he had a gun as he was in street clothes and they "wanted to know." Ferguson acknowledged that he did and, after being asked to show the gun to them, left the registration desk to return to the Governor. The conversation between plaintiff, Blackard, and Ferguson lasted approximately five minutes and consisted of light friendly banter; there was nothing intimidating, threatening, or coercive about it.
Upon leaving the registration desk, Ferguson apparently had a conversation with the Governor about the possibility of meeting with plaintiff, during which Ferguson states the Governor remarked that plaintiff had "that come-hither look," i.e., "a sort of sexually suggestive appearance from the look or dress."
He states that "some time later" the Governor asked him to "get him a room, that he was expecting a call from the White House and . . . had several phone calls that he needed to make," and asked him to go to the car and get his briefcase containing the phone messages. Ferguson states that upon obtaining the room, the Governor told him that if plaintiff wanted to meet him, she could "come up."
Plaintiff states that Ferguson later reappeared at the registration desk, delivered a piece of paper to her with a four-digit number written on it, and said that the Governor would like to meet with her in this suite number. She states that she, Blackard and Ferguson talked about what the Governor could want and that Ferguson stated, among other things, "We do this all the time." Thinking that it was an honor to be asked to meet the Governor and that it might lead to an enhanced employment opportunity, plaintiff states that she agreed to the meeting and that Ferguson escorted her to the floor of the hotel upon which the Governor's suite was located.
Plaintiff states that upon arriving at the suite and announcing herself, the Governor shook her hand, invited her in, and closed the door. She states that a few minutes of small talk ensued, which included the Governor asking her about her job and him mentioning that Dave Harrington, plaintiff's ultimate superior within the A.I.D.C. and a Clinton appointee, was his "good friend."
Plaintiff states that the Governor then "unexpectedly reached over to her , took her hand, and pulled her toward him, so that their bodies were close to each other." She states she removed her hand from his and retreated several feet, but that the Governor approached her again and, while saying, "I love the way your hair flows down your back" and "I love your curves," put his hand on her leg, started sliding it toward her pelvic area, and bent down to attempt to kiss her on the neck, all without her consent.
Plaintiff states that she exclaimed, "What are you doing?", told the Governor that she was "not that kind of girl," and "escaped" from the Governor's reach "by walking away from him." She states she was extremely upset and confused and, not knowing what to do, attempted to distract the Governor by chatting about his wife.
Plaintiff states that she sat down at the end of the sofa nearest the door, but that the Governor approached the sofa where she had taken a seat and, as he sat down, "lowered his trousers and underwear, exposed his penis (which was erect) and told her to 'kiss it.' " She states that she was "horrified" by this and that she "jumped up from the couch" and told the Governor that she had to go, saying something to the effect that she had to get back to the registration desk.
Plaintiff states that the Governor, "while fondling his penis," said, "Well, I don't want to make you do anything you don't want to do," and then pulled up his pants and said, "If you get in trouble for leaving work, have Dave call me immediately and I'll take care of it." She states that as she left the room (the door of which was not locked), the Governor "detained" her momentarily, "looked sternly" at her, and said: "You are smart. Let's keep this between ourselves."
Plaintiff states that the Governor's advances to her were unwelcome, that she never said or did anything to suggest to the Governor that she was willing to have sex with him, and that during the time they were together in the hotel suite, she resisted his advances although she was "stunned by them and intimidated by who he was."
She states that when the Governor referred to Dave Harrington, she "understood that he was telling her that he had control over Mr. Harrington and over her job, and that he was willing to use that power." She states that from this point on, she was "very fearful" that her refusal to submit to the Governor's advances could damage her career and even jeopardize her employment.
Plaintiff states that when she left the hotel suite, she was in shock and upset but tried to maintain her composure. She states she saw Ferguson waiting outside the suite but that he did not escort her back to the registration desk and nothing was said between them. Ferguson states that 5 or 10 minutes after plaintiff exited the suite he joined the Governor for their return to the Governor's Mansion and that the Governor, who was working on some papers that he had spread out on the desk, said, "She came up here, and nothing happened."
Plaintiff states she returned to the registration desk and told Blackard some of what had happened. Blackard states that plaintiff was shaking and embarrassed. Following the conference, plaintiff states she went to the workplace of a friend, Debra Ballentine, and told her of the incident as well. Ballentine states that plaintiff was upset and crying.
Later that same day, plaintiff states she told her sister, Charlotte Corbin Brown, what had happened and, within the next two days, also told her other sister, Lydia Corbin Cathey, of the incident. Brown's observations of plaintiff's demeanor apparently are not included in the record. Cathey, however, states that plaintiff was "bawling"and "squalling,"and that she appeared scared, embarrassed, and ashamed.
Ballentine states that she encouraged plaintiff to report the incident to her boss or to the police, but that plaintiff declined, pointing out that her boss was friends with the Governor and that the police were the ones who took her to the hotel suite. Ballentine further states that plaintiff stated she did not want her fiance to know of the incident and that she "just want ed this thing to go away." Plaintiff states that what the Governor and Ferguson had said and done made her "afraid" to file charges.
Plaintiff continued to work at A.I.D.C. following the alleged incident in the hotel suite. One of her duties was to deliver documents to and from the Office of the Governor, as well as other offices around the Arkansas State Capitol. She states that in June 1991, while performing these duties for the A.I.D.C., she encountered Ferguson, who told her that Mrs. Clinton was out of town often and that the Governor wanted her phone number and wanted to see her. Plaintiff states she refused to provide her phone number to Ferguson.
She states that Ferguson also asked her how her fiance, Steve, was doing, even though she had never told Ferguson or the Governor his name, and that this "frightened" her. Plaintiff states that she again encountered Ferguson following her return to work from maternity leave and that he said he had "told Bill how good looking you are since you've had the baby." She also states that she was "accosted' by the Governor in the Rotunda of the Arkansas State Capitol when he "draped his arm over her, pulled her close to him and held her tightly to his body," and said to his bodyguard, "Don't we make a beautiful couple: Beauty and the Beast?"
Plaintiff additionally states that on an unspecified date, she was waiting in the Governor's outer office on a delivery run when the Governor entered the office, patted her on he shoulder, and in a "friendly fashion" said, "How are you doing, Paula?"
Plaintiff states that she continued to work at A.I.D.C. "even though she was in constant fear that the Governor would retaliate against her because she had refused to have sex with him." She states this fear prevented her from enjoying her job. Plaintiff states that she was treated "very rudely by certain superiors in A.I.D.C., including her direct supervisor, Clydine Pennington, and that this "rude treatment" had not happened prior to her encounter with the Governor. She states that after her maternity leave, she was transferred to a position which had much less responsibility and that much of the time she had nothing to do.
Plaintiff states that she was not learning anything, that her work could not be fairly evaluated, and that as a result, she could not be fairly considered for advancement and other opportunities. She states that Pennington told her the reason for the transfer was that her prior position had been eliminated, but that she later learned this was untrue, as her former position was being occupied by another employee.
Plaintiff states that she repeatedly expressed to Pennington an interest in transferring to particular positions at a higher "grade" which involved more challenging duties, more potential for advancement, and more compensation, but that Pennington always discouraged her from doing so and told her she should not bother to apply for those positions. She goes on to state that her superiors exhibited hostility toward her by moving her work location, refusing to give her meaningful work, watching her constantly, and failing to give her flowers on Secretary's Day in 1992, even though all the other women in the office received flowers.
Plaintiff voluntarily terminated her employment with A.I.D.C. on Feb. 20, 1993, in order to move to California with her husband, who had been transferred. She states that in January 1994, while visiting family and friends in Arkansas, she was informed of an article in The American Spectator magazine that she claims referred to her alleged encounter with the Governor at the Excelsior Hotel and incorrectly suggested that she had engaged in sexual relations with the Governor.
Plaintiff states that she also encountered Ferguson in a restaurant during this same time and that he indicated he was the source for the article and that he knew she had refused the Governor's alleged advances because, he said, "Clinton told me you wouldn't do anything anyway, Paula."
On Feb. 11, 1994, at an event attended by the media, plaintiff states that she publicly asked President Clinton to acknowledge the incident mentioned in the article in The American Spectator, to state that she had rejected his advances, and to apologize to her, but that the President responded to her request for an apology by having his press spokespersons deliver a statement on his behalf that the incident never happened and that he never met plaintiff. Thereafter, on May 6, 1994, plaintiff filed this lawsuit.
Plaintiff's amended complaint contains several claims, three of which remain at issue. The first is a claim under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 in which plaintiff alleges that Governor Clinton, acting under color of state law, deprived her of her constitutional right to equal protection of the laws under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution by sexually harassing her.
The second is a claim under 42 U.S.C. Section 1985(3) in which plaintiff alleges that Governor Clinton and Ferguson conspired to deprive her of her rights to equal protection of the laws and of equal privileges and immunities under the laws.
The third is a state law claim in which plaintiff asserts a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrage against Governor Clinton, based primarily on the alleged incident at the hotel but also encompassing subsequent alleged acts.
 
II.
The President moves for summary judgment on the following grounds:
(1) plaintiff cannot show either quid pro quo or hostile work environment sexual harassment under Section 1983 because (a) the record plainly demonstrates that plaintiff did not suffer any tangible job detriment for purposes of establishing a quid pro quo claim, let alone one caused by her purported rejection of Mr. Clinton's alleged sexual advances, and (b) the alleged actions as described by plaintiff, even resolving all inferences and factual disputes in her favor, do not constitute severe or pervasive abusive conduct for purposes of establishing a hostile work environment claim; (2) if plaintiff's Section 1983 claim fails, so too does her Section 1985 conspiracy claim because (a), plaintiff has failed to show that any such conspiracy actually resulted in a deprivation of her constitutional rights, and (b), the undisputed facts do not show any agreement between Governor Clinton and Trooper Ferguson to deprive plaintiff of her constitutional rights; and (3) plaintiff's claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrage fails because (a), by plaintiff's own testimony, the conduct at issue does not constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrage under Arkansas law, and (b), plaintiff did not as a result of the alleged conduct, suffer emotional distress so severe that no reasonable person could endure it.
Ferguson, in turn, moves for summary judgment on grounds that (1) even if everything plaintiff has alleged were true, she does not have evidence to show either quid pro quo or hostile work-environment sexual harassment, and (2) there was no conspiracy between the President and Ferguson to violate plaintiff's constitutional fights by sexually harassing her. The President and Ferguson both argue that there are no genuine issues of material fact with respect to any of these issues and that they are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.
 
A.
Summary judgment is appropriate when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. As a prerequisite to summary judgment, a moving party must demonstrate "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case."
Once the moving party has properly supported its motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must "do more than simply show there is some metaphysical doubts as to the material facts." The nonmoving party may not rest on mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but must "come forward with 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.' " The inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. However, " w here the record taken as a whole could not lead to a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial."
 
B.
As a preliminary matter, the court rejects plaintiff's contention that this case involves equal protection claims based not only on sexual harassment, but also on sexual assault and offensive conduct in violation of laws other than Title VII. In its Aug. 22 Memorandum Opinion and Order, this court recognized that a sexual assault can be a constitutional violation under Section 1983, but concluded that plaintiff's allegations, even if true, were insufficient to state such a claim.
Notwithstanding the unequivocal ruling of this court, plaintiff, citing Fed. R.Evid. 413(d)(2), (3), and (5), now contends that she has an actionable claim of criminal sexual assault based on the Governor's alleged actions in the Excelsior Hotel and cites as authority for this proposition an Arkansas criminal statute proscribing sexual abuse in the first degree, Ark. Code Ann. Section 5-14-108.
The court finds plaintiff's attempt to restate her sexual assault claim in the guise of an equal protection claim to be no more meritorious now than when it was raised in the context of a due process claim.
Although the Governor's alleged conduct, if true, may certainly be characterized as boorish and offensive, even a most charitable reading of the record in this case fails to reveal a basis for a claim of criminal sexual assault as there is no alleged conduct that could be characterized as "forcible compulsion" or "sexual contact" for purposes of establishing a claim under the provision cited by plaintiff.
There being no actionable claim of criminal sexual assault under the facts of this case, the court will proceed to a determination of the issues relevant to plaintiff's claim of sexual harassment.
 
1.
The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment confers a right to be free from gender discrimination that is not substantially related to important governmental objectives. Applying this precept, courts have found that intentional sexual harassment of employees by persons acting under color of state law violates the 14th Amendment and is actionable under Section 1983.
A plaintiff wishing to sustain an equal protection claim of sexual harassment under the 14th Amendment must show both "sexual harassment" and an "intent" to harass based upon that plaintiff's membership in a particular class of citizens -- i.e., male or female.
An individual plaintiff may pursue a sexual harassment claim under the 14th Amendment based solely upon acts of harassment directed towards her, but such a claim must show an intent to harass because of her status as a female and not because of characteristics of her gender which are personal to her.
Although the President contends that plaintiff cannot establish that he acted under color of state law with the intent to discriminate against her on the basis of her gender, he states that he reserves those issues for trial, if necessary, and seeks summary judgment solely on the grounds of plaintiff's failure to prove that she was subjected to conduct that corresponds to sexual harassment under Title VII.
Before discussing that issue, however, the court must address plaintiff's argument that the essential elements of a sexual harassment claim under Section 1983 do not correspond to those under Title VII (although she acknowledges there is some overlap) and that her burden of proof is something less than that required under Title VII. The court rejects this argument.
Throughout the pendency of this lawsuit, this court and the parties have been operating under the assumption, based on the clear weight of authority, that a Section 1983 sexual harassment claim should be analyzed under the standards developed in similar Title VII litigation. Indeed, in her memorandum in opposition to the President's motion for judgment on the pleadings (filed July 29, 1997), plaintiff stated that " a sexual harassment claim brought pursuant to Section 1983 is similar to a Title VII sexual harassment claim" and cited King v. Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System., 898 F.2d 533, 537 (Seventh Circuit 1990), for the proposition that a Section 1983 sexual harassment claim generally follows the contours of a Title VII claim.
In this regard, plaintiff recognized that courts have separated sexual harassment claims into two categories -- quid pro quo cases and hostile work environment cases -- and represented to this court that her allegations, as analyzed under Title VII, were sufficient to state claims under both categories.
Specifically, plaintiff stated with respect to her quid pro quo claim that sexual harassment occurs when, among other things, "rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions," citing as support for this claim Title VII cases and guidelines promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (E.E.O.C.) and stated with respect to her hostile environment claim, again citing Title VII cases and E.E.O.C. guidelines, that " u nder section 1983, as under Title VII, it is unlawful to create a sexually hostile or abusive work environment."
Several of this court's discovery rulings in favor of plaintiff were premised on this court's understanding and plaintiff's representations (in her complaint and elsewhere) that she was asserting work-place harassment as understood in reference to Title VII standards, i.e., that she suffered tangible job detriments for her refusal to submit to Governor Clinton's alleged advances. Based on plaintiff's prior representations and the clear weight of authority, the court will look to Title VII in addressing plaintiff's quid pro quo and hostile work-environment sexual harassment claims.
 
a.
To make a prima facie case of quid pro quo sexual harassment, this plaintiff must show, among other things, that her refusal to submit to unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors resulted in a tangible job detriment. " A supervisor's mere threat or promise of job-related harm or benefits in exchange for sexual favors does not constitute quid pro quo harassment. . . ."
 
i.
Apparently recognizing the infirm ground upon which her assertion of tangible job detriments rest (which will be discussed infra), plaintiff first argues that a showing of a tangible job detriment is not an essential element of an action for quid pro quo sexual harassment under Title VII.
The court rejects this argument as it conflicts with the Eighth Circuit's requirement that a refusal to submit to unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors resulted in a tangible job detriment, and conflicts with the majority of the other circuits on this point as well, including the recent decisions cited previously from the Fifth Circuit in Sanders, 134 F.3d 331, and the District of Columbia Circuit in Gary, 59 F.3d 1391.
Even without benefit of the settled authority requiring a showing of a tangible job detriment in quid pro quo cases, the three cases upon which plaintiff relies in support of her argument do not obviate the need for a showing of a tangible job detriment under the facts of this case. First, Nichols and Karibian were "submission" cases in which the victims of sexual harassment submitted to the unwelcome sexual advances.
Plaintiff, by contrast, alleges that she resisted Governor Clinton's alleged advances and thereby suffered reprisals in her workplace. The court in Karibian recognized the distinction between so-called "submission" and "refusal" cases, noting that " i n the nature of things, evidence of economic harm will not be available to support the claim of the employee who submits to the supervisor's demands."
Both Nichols and Karibian were addressing the narrow situations before them in which the victim submitted to the demands for sexual favors and do not stand for the proposition that a showing of a tangible job detriment is unnecessary in a quid pro quo sexual harassment case where, as here, it is claimed that the alleged advances were resisted.
While it is true that the Seventh Circuit in Jansen concluded that a "clear and unambiguous" quid pro quo threat that "clearly conditions concrete job benefits or detriments on compliance with sexual demands" can constitute an actionable claim "even if the threat remains unfulfilled," plaintiff acknowledges that no one, including Governor Clinton, ever told her that if she refused to submit to his alleged advances it would have a negative effect on her job, that she had to submit to his alleged advances in order to receive job benefits, or that the Governor would use his relationship with A.I.D.C. Director Dave Harrington to penalize her in her job.
She merely states that "read ing between the lines,"she "knew what the Governor meant" when he allegedly indicated in the hotel suite that Harrington was his good friend. Be that as it may, the Governor's alleged statements do not in any way constitute a clear threat that clearly conditions concrete job benefits or detriments on compliance with sexual demands. Plaintiff's claim therefore would not survive a Jansen analysis, her "read ing between the lines" notwithstanding.
Based on the foregoing, the court finds that a showing of a tangible job detriment is an essential element of plaintiff's quid pro quo sexual harassment claim. It is that issue to which the court now turns.
 
ii.
As evidence of tangible job detriments (or adverse employment action), plaintiff claims the following occurred after she resisted Governor Clinton's alleged advances on May 8, 1991: (1) she was discouraged from applying for more attractive jobs and seeking reclassification at a higher pay grade within the A.I.D.C.; (2) her job was changed to one with fewer responsibilities, less attractive duties and less potential for advancement -- and the reason given for the change proved to be untrue; (3) she was effectively denied access to grievance procedures that would otherwise have been available to victims of sexual harassment; and (4) she was mistreated in ways having tangible manifestations, such as isolating her physically, making her sit in a location from which she was constantly watched, making her sit at her workstation with no work to do, and singling her out as the only female employee not to be given flowers on Secretary's Day.
The court has carefully reviewed the record in this case and finds nothing in plaintiff's employment records, her own testimony, or the testimony of her supervisors showing that plaintiff's reaction to Governor Clinton's alleged advances affected tangible aspects of her compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.
 
1.
Plaintiff's claim that she was discouraged from applying for more attractive jobs and seeking reclassification at a higher pay grade within the A.I.D.C. does not demonstrate any "tangible" job detriment as she has not identified a single specific job which she desired or applied for at A.I.D.C. but which she had been discouraged from seeking. When asked for such specific information, plaintiff merely testified that the unidentified jobs she sought were "a grade higher" but that her supervisor "would always discourage me and make me believe that I could grow within the administrative services, which in fact I didn't. I got degrade -- downgraded."
She further states that those "few" times that she would talk to her supervisor and receive discouragement, she "would go ahead and fill out an application maybe or something." There is no record of plaintiff ever applying for another job within A.I.D.C., however, and the record shows that not only was plaintiff never downgraded, her position was reclassified upward from a Grade 9 classification to a Grade 11 classification, thereby increasing her annual salary. Indeed, it is undisputed that plaintiff received every merit increase and cost-of-living allowance for which she was eligible during her nearly two-year tenure with the A.I.D.C. and consistently received satisfactory job evaluations.
Specifically, on July 1, 1991, less than two months after the alleged incident that is the subject of this lawsuit, plaintiff received a cost-of-living increase and her position was reclassified from Grade 9 to Grade 11; on Aug. 28, 1991, plaintiff received a satisfactory job evaluation from her supervisor, Clydine Pennington; on March 11, 1992, the one-year anniversary of her hire date with A.I.D.C., plaintiff received another satisfactory evaluation from Pennington and Cherry Duckett, deputy director of A.I.D.C., which entitled her to a merit raise.
In addition, plaintiff was given a satisfactory job review in an evaluation covering the period of March 1992 until her voluntary departure from the A.I.D.C. in February 1993. Plaintiff signed this review on Feb. 16, 1993, and would have received another merit increase one month later in accordance with this review had she elected to continue her employment at A.I.D.C.
It is plaintiff's burden to come forward with "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial, and the court finds that her testimony on this point, being of a most general and non-specific nature (and in some cases contradictory to the record), simply does not suffice to create a genuine issue of fact regarding any tangible job detriment as a result of her having allegedly been discouraged from seeking more attractive jobs and reclassification.
 
2.
Equally without merit is plaintiff's assertion that following her return from maternity leave in September 1992, she suffered a tangible job detriment when her job was changed to one with fewer responsibilities, less attractive duties and less potential for advancement. These matters do not constitute a tangible job detriment as it is undisputed that there was no diminution in plaintiff's salary or change in her job classification following her return from maternity leave and, further, that her last review at A.I.D.C. following her return was positive and would have entitled her to another merit increase had she not resigned her position in order to move to California with her husband. Changes in duties or working conditions that cause no materially significant disadvantage, such as diminution in title, salary, or benefits, are insufficient to establish the adverse conduct required to make a prima facie case.
Although plaintiff states that her job title upon returning from maternity leave was no longer that of purchasing assistant and that this change in title impaired her potential for promotion, her job duties prior to taking maternity leave and her job dudes upon returning to work both involved data input; the difference being that instead of responsibility for data entry of A.I.D.C. purchase orders and driving records, she was assigned data entry responsibilities for employment applications.
That being so, plaintiff cannot establish a tangible job detriment. A transfer that does not involve a demotion in form or substance and involves only minor changes in working conditions, with no reduction in pay or benefits, will constitute an adverse employment action, " o therwise every trivial personnel action that an irritable . . . employee did not like would form the basis of a discrimination suit." Whether or not the reasons given for the change were untrue, plaintiff's allegations describe nothing "more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities."
 
3.
The court also rejects plaintiff's claim that she was effectively denied access to grievance procedures that would otherwise have been available to victims of sexual harassment. Plaintiff merely states that from her "perspective," it "appeared very unlikely that any good would come from pursuing a grievance," and that "it was natural for her to conclude that invoking the grievance procedure would be futile and perhaps worse." As the court has previously noted, however, plaintiff acknowledges that she was never threatened with adverse employment action if she did not submit to the Governor's alleged advances, but that she was only "read ing between the lines." Such subjective perceptions and beliefs regarding the efficacy of invoking any grievance procedures are nothing more than "speculation and conjecture" and do not constitute a tangible job detriment.
 
4.
Finally, the court rejects plaintiff's claim that she was subjected to hostile treatment having tangible effects when she was isolated physically, made to sit in a location from which she was constantly watched, made to sit at her workstation with no work to do, and singled out as the only female employee not to be given flowers on Secretary's Day. Plaintiff may well have perceived hostility and animus on the part of her supervisors, but these perceptions are merely conclusory in nature and do not, without more, constitute a tangible job detriment. Absent evidence of some more tangible change in duties or working conditions that constitute a material employment disadvantage, of which the court has already determined does not exist, general allegations of hostility and personal animus are not sufficient to demonstrate any adverse employment action that constitutes the sort of ultimate decision intended to be actionable under Title VII.
Similarly, plaintiff's allegations regarding her work station being moved so that she had to sit directly outside Pennington's office and, at times, not having work to do, describe nothing more than minor or de minimis personnel matters which, again without more, are insufficient to constitute a tangible job detriment or adverse employment action.
Although it is not clear why plaintiff failed to receive flowers on Secretary's Day in 1992, such an omission does not give rise to a Federal cause of action in the absence of evidence of some more tangible change in duties or working conditions that constitute a material employment disadvantage.
 
iii.
In sum, the court finds that a showing of a tangible job detriment or adverse employment action is an essential element of plaintiff's Section 1983 quid pro quo sexual harassment claim and that plaintiff has not demonstrated any tangible job detriment or adverse employment action for her refusal to submit to the Governor's alleged advances. The President is therefore entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim of quid pro quo sexual harassment.
 
b.
The court now turns to plaintiff's hostile work environment claim. Unlike quid pro quo sexual harassment, hostile work environment harassment arises when "sexual conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment." To prevail on a hostile work environment cause of action, a plaintiff must establish, among other things, that she was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment based upon her sex that affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment.
The behavior creating the hostile working environment need not be overtly sexual in nature, but it must be " 'unwelcome' in the sense that the employee did not solicit or invite it, and the employee regarded the conduct as undesirable or offensive." The harassment must also be sufficiently severe or pervasive "to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment."
The President essentially argues that aside from the alleged incident at the Excelsior Hotel, plaintiff alleges only two other contacts with him, alleges only a few additional contacts with Ferguson, and contains conclusory claims that plaintiff's supervisors were rude. He argues that taken individually or as a whole, these contacts do not in any way constitute the kind of pervasive, intimidating, abusive conduct that courts require to establish a hostile work environment claim. The court agrees.
In assessing the hostility of an environment, a court must look to the totality of the circumstances. Circumstances to be considered include "the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employees work performance." No single factor is determinative, and the court "should not carve the work environment into a series of discrete incidents and then measure the harm occurring in each episode.
First, the court finds plaintiff's reliance on her assertions of tangible job detriment as establishing a hostile work environment to be misplaced. In its Aug. 22 Memorandum Opinion and Order, the court noted that although the President's argument for outright dismissal of plaintiff's hostile work environment claim had "some force," further development of the record was nevertheless necessary.
The court based this conclusion in large part on plaintiff's representations that her rejection of the President's alleged advances caused her to suffer adverse employment actions, including being transferred to a position that had no responsible duties for which she could be adequately evaluated to earn advancement and failing to receive raises and merit increases.
In this regard, the court determined that the "totality" of the allegations alleged in this case were such that they could be said to have altered the conditions of plaintiff's employment and created an abusive work environment. However, development of the record has now established that plaintiff's allegations of adverse employment actions are without merit, with her claim of failing to receive cost of living increases apparently having even been abandoned.
Plaintiff received every merit increase and cost-of-living allowance for which she was eligible during her nearly two-year tenure with the A.I.D.C., her job was upgraded from Grade 9 to Grade 11 (thereby increasing her salary), she consistently received satisfactory job evaluations, and her job responsibilities upon her return from maternity leave were not significantly different from prior to her taking leave and did not cause her any materially significant disadvantage. These facts are clearly established by the record and dispel the notion that she was subjected to a hostile work environment.
Plaintiff certainly has not shown under the totality of the circumstances that the alleged incident in the hotel and her additional encounters with Ferguson and the Governor were so severe or pervasive that it created an abusive working environment. She admits that she never missed a day of work following the alleged incident in the hotel, she continued to work at A.I.D.C. another nineteen months (leaving only because of her husband's job transfer), she continued to go on a daily basis to the Governor s Office to deliver items and never asked to be relieved of that duty, she never filed a format complaint or told her supervisors of the incident while at A.I.D.C., and she never consulted a psychiatrist, psychologist, or incurred medical bills as a result of the alleged incident.
In addition, plaintiff has not shown how Ferguson's alleged comments, whether considered alone or in conjunction with the other alleged conduct in this case, interfered with her work, and she acknowledges that the Governor's statement about him and her looking like "beauty and the beast" was made "in a light vein" and that his patting her on the shoulder and asking her how she was doing was done in a "friendly fashion."
While the alleged incident in the hotel, if true, was certainly boorish and offensive, the court has already found that the Governor's alleged conduct does not constitute sexual assault. This is thus not one of those exceptional cases in which a single incident of sexual harassment, such as an assault, was deemed sufficient to state a claim of hostile work environment sexual harassment.
Considering the totality of the circumstances, it simply cannot be said that the conduct to which plaintiff was allegedly subjected was frequent, severe, or physically threatening, and the court finds that defendants' actions as shown by the record do not constitute the kind of sustained and nontrivial conduct necessary for a claim of hostile work environment.
In sum, the court finds that the record does not demonstrate conduct that was so severe or pervasive that it can be said to have altered the conditions of plaintiff's employment and created an abusive working environment. Accordingly, the President is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim of hostile work environment sexual harassment.
 
2.
The court now turns to plaintiff's Section 1985(3) conspiracy claim. In order to prove the existence of a civil rights conspiracy under Section 1985(3), a plaintiff must prove, among other things, that another person was injured in his person or property or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen in the United States.
 Plaintiff does not have a viable Section 1985(3) claim in this case as the court has determined that her Section 1983 quid pro quo and hostile work environment sexual harassment claims are without merit and warrant a grant of summary judgment. Absent an underlying violation of federal law, there can be no actionable claim alleging a conspiracy to achieve that end.
 
3.
Finally, the court addresses plaintiff's state law claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrage. Arkansas recognizes a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress based on sexual harassment. To establish a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the defendant intended to inflict emotional distress or knew or should have known that emotional distress was the likely result of his conduct; (2) the conduct was extreme and outrageous and utterly intolerable in a civilized community; (3) the defendant's conduct was the cause of the plaintiff's distress; and (4) the plaintiff's emotional distress was so severe in nature that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.
The President argues that the alleged conduct of which plaintiff complains was brief and isolated; did not result in any physical harm or objective symptoms of the requisite severe distress; did not result in distress so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it; and he had no knowledge of any special condition of plaintiff that would render her particularly susceptible to distress. He argues that plaintiff has failed to identify the kind of clearcut proof that Arkansas courts require for a claim of outrage and that he is therefore entitled to summary judgment. The court agrees.
One is subject to liability for the tort of outrage or intentional infliction of emotional distress if he or she wilfully or wantonly causes severe emotional distress to another by extreme and outrageous conduct. The Arkansas Supreme Court stated that " b y extreme and outrageous conduct, we mean conduct that is so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in civilized society."
Whether conduct is "extreme and outrageous" is determined by looking at "the conduct at issue; the period of time over which the conduct took place; the relation between plaintiff and defendant; and defendant's knowledge that plaintiff is particularly susceptible to emotional distress by reason of some physical or mental peculiarity." The tort is clearly not intended to provide legal redress for every slight insult or indignity that one must endure. The Arkansas courts take a strict approach and give a narrow view to claims of outrage, and merely describing conduct as outrageous does not make it so.
Plaintiff seems to base her claim of outrage on her erroneous belief that the allegations she has presented are sufficient to constitute criminal sexual assault. She states that "Mr. Clinton's outrageous conduct includes offensive language, an offensive proposition, offensive touching (constituting sexual assault under both federal and state definitions), and actual exposure of an intimate private body part,"and that " t here are few more outrageous acts than a criminal sexual assault followed by unwanted exposure, coupled with a demand for oral sex by the most powerful man in the state against a very young, low-level employee."
While the court will certainly agree that plaintiff's allegations describe offensive conduct, the court, as previously noted, has found that the Governor's alleged conduct does not constitute sexual assault. Rather, the conduct as alleged by plaintiff describes a mere sexual proposition or encounter, albeit an odious one, that was relatively brief in duration, did not involve any coercion or threats of reprisal, and was abandoned as soon as plaintiff made clear that the advance was not welcome. The court is not aware of any authority holding that such a sexual encounter or proposition of the type alleged in this case, without more, gives rise to a claim of outrage.
Moreover, notwithstanding the offensive nature of the Governor's alleged conduct, plaintiff admits that she never missed a day of work following the alleged incident, she continued to work at A.I.D.C. another nineteen months (leaving only because of her husband's job transfer), she continued to go on a daily basis to the Governor's Office to deliver items and never asked to be relieved of that duty, she never filed a formal complaint or told her supervisors of the incident while at A.I.D.C., she never consulted a psychiatrist, psychologist, or incurred medical bills as a result of the alleged incident, and she acknowledges that her two subsequent contacts with the Governor involved comments made "in a light vein" and nonsexual contact that was done in a "friendly fashion."
Further, despite earlier claiming that she suffered marital discord and humiliation, plaintiff stated in her deposition that she was not claiming damages to her marriage as a result of the Governor's alleged conduct, and she acknowledged the request to drop her claim of injury to reputation by stating, "I didn't really care if it was dropped or not personally." Plaintiff's actions and statements in this case do not portray someone who experienced emotional distress so severe in nature that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.
Nevertheless, plaintiff submits a declaration from a purported expert with a Ph.D in education and counseling, Patrick J. Carnes, who, after a 3.5 hour meeting with plaintiff and her husband a mere four days prior to the filing of President Clinton's motion for summary judgment, opines that her alleged encounter with Governor Clinton in 1991, "and the ensuing events," have caused plaintiff to suffer severe emotional distress and "consequent sexual aversion." The court does not credit this declaration.
In Angle v. Alexander, 945 S.W.2d 933 (Ark. 1997), the Arkansas Supreme Court noted that absent physical harm, courts look for more in the way of extreme outrage as an assurance that the mental disturbance claimed is not fictitious. In that case, the plaintiffs offered their own testimony that they had experienced emotional distress, thoughts of death, fear, anger, and worry, but little else.
In concluding that there was no evidence of extreme emotional distress required to prevail on an outrage claim, the court found it significant that none had seen a physician or mental health professional for these concerns. The court did not allow the fact that one plaintiff "on the advice of her attorney, spoke to a psychologist," to overcome her failure of proof on this point.
Aside from other deficiencies with the Carnes declaration (including the fact that the substance of this declaration apparently was not disclosed in accordance with rules governing pretrial discovery), the opinions stated therein are vague and conclusory and, as in Angle, do not suffice to overcome plaintiff's failure of proof on her claim of outrage.
In sum, plaintiff's allegations fall far short of the rigorous standards for establishing a claim of outrage under Arkansas law and the court therefore grants the President's motion for summary judgment on this claim.
 
III.
One final matter concerns alleged suppression of pattern and practice evidence. Whatever relevance such evidence may have to prove other elements of plaintiff's case, it does not have anything to do with the issues presented by the President's and Ferguson's motions for summary judgment, i.e., whether plaintiff herself was the victim of alleged quid pro quo or hostile work environment sexual harassment, whether the President and Ferguson conspired to deprive her of her civil rights, or whether she suffered emotional distress so severe in nature that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it. Whether other women may have been subjected to workplace harassment, and whether such evidence has allegedly been suppressed, does not change the fact that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that she has a case worthy of submitting to a jury. Reduced to its essence, the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party and the court therefore finds that there are no genuine issues for trial in this case.
 
IV.
For the foregoing reasons, the court finds that the President's and Ferguson's motions for summary judgment should both be and hereby are granted. There being no remaining issues, the court will enter judgment dismissing this case.

UNITED AIRLINES EXPECTS REVENUE LOSSES LINKED TO ASIA

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation, said yesterday that its revenue for the first quarter and all of 1998 might fall below expectations as a result of reduced business in Asia. The Chicago-based airline asked employees in a phone message to cut costs to save money and said it must find more ways to make up the lost revenue. Asia's economic problems have led to reduced demand for air travel. United's Asia passenger traffic fell 11.5 percent in January and February. Route changes and low fuel costs have allowed United to save some money. To add to revenue, it recently asked its sales force to make up an additional $200 million in countries outside Asia. UAL shares fell $2.6875, to $90.25.

HEADLINE: PUTTING DREAMS TO THE TEST: A special report;
Elite High School Is a Grueling Exam Away

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
Few New York City spectacles radiate as much anxiety as the annual surge of eighth graders outside Stuyvesant High School, the educational Valhalla on the Hudson, for a one-shot, grueling entrance exam that many believe will determine the rest of their lives. The most recent test one icy winter day -- with scores released just last month -- was, as usual, full of held-back tears, stomachaches and dreams.
More than 1,000 students, from recent Chinese immigrants to girls from the exclusive Brearley School, huddled behind police barricades this past December as teachers with bullhorns told parents to "kiss your loved ones goodbye." Then they retreated to wait and worry. 
 Everyone knew that Stuyvesant, although bitterly criticized by minorities for a test they say benefits students from districts with white majorities, remains a nonnegotiable meritocracy. Connections, money or a dazzling interview will not help a student get in. The sole criterion for admission is still the two-and-a-half-hour entrance exam that Adam Robinson, the co-founder of the Princeton Review test-preparation service, considers more difficult than the Scholastic Assessment Test taken in 11th grade. The average college-educated adult, he said, could not be admitted to Stuyvesant without preparation.
What follows is the story of three talented eighth-graders, from different backgrounds, who took the Stuyvesant test in December for admission as freshmen this fall. Their stories show how Stuyvesant, a free public school in lower Manhattan, has been seen for nearly a century as an Ivy League dream-ticket for the poor, the rich and especially the immigrant. In some years, Stuyvesant sends more students to Harvard than any other public or private school in the nation. (Last year 21 of 700 seniors were admitted to Harvard, 20 to Yale, 47 to Columbia and 103 to Cornell.)
Jing Wang, 12, lives on the Lower East Side. She is shy, talkative once you get to know her, and academically relentless. She started studying for the Stuyvesant test on her own in sixth grade. She came to the United States from China when she was 4, and excels at Dr. Sun Yat-sen Intermediate School 131 in Chinatown, which in 1996 was shut out of Stuyvesant -- no one from the school passed the test. Jing's father was a radiologist in China but is now unemployed.
Heather McLeod, 14, lives in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. She is sunny, enthusiastic and determined, and has wanted to go to Stuyvesant since she was in fifth grade. She has a 94 grade-point average at Mark Twain Intermediate School for the Gifted and Talented, a magnet school in Coney Island that is one of the best public junior highs in the city. It is also one of Stuyvesant's biggest feeder schools. Heather's parents are separated, and her father lives in Jamaica. Her mother, a medical clerk, makes $27,000 a year.
Adam Bloch, 13, lives on the Upper West Side. He is, already, something of a wry intellectual, who can discuss Henryk Sienkiewicz, the Polish novelist, as easily as "The Simpsons," one of his favorite shows. He is a top student at the private Bank Street School on West 112th Street. He also applied for ninth grade to three private schools: Horace Mann, Fieldston and Dalton. His father owns a graphic design firm. His mother, who has stayed home, will soon start graduate school in social work.
For Jing, Heather, Adam and anyone else, getting into Stuyvesant is harder than ever. This year, 11,397 eighth graders competed for 850 spots, meaning fewer than one in 13 got in. In 1991, it was more than one in 12, when 6,675 eighth graders competed for 580 spots. Jinx Cozzi-Perullo, Stuyvesant's principal, says the applicant increase is largely a result of the luxurious, $150 million building that opened in 1992. (Statistically, getting into Stuyvesant is harder than admission to Harvard, which this month will accept 2,073 students from 16,818 applicants, or one in 8.)
Jing, Heather and Adam were recommended by their schools and interviewed before they received their test results. Their teachers said each had an excellent chance of getting in. But only two did.
 
Jing Wang
Excellence At English, Too
"I want to go to Harvard," said Jing Wang. "But then, a lot of people want to go to Harvard."
Jing was talking after school in her fourth-floor walk-up on East Second Street, in a cramped two-bedroom apartment with a big television set and stacks of Chinese videotapes. She was apprehensive at first, then pleased to be asked questions about herself and her views, and generally tolerant of her 5-year-old sister, who hovered around wanting to be interviewed, too.
Her teachers say Jing is one of the brightest students in a school that is 80 percent Asian, and where even those born in America have difficulty with English because they don't speak it at home, in Chinatown or with their friends at school. Jing's English is idiomatic, and rapid. "I have an idea I'm at the top of the class," she said matter-of-factly. She wants to be a pediatrician, or maybe a lawyer.
Jing's father, An Yin Wang, came to the United States in 1987 from northwest China, studied radiology at Mount Sinai Hospital, and worked as a sonographer at North General and then at a Chinese-run clinic on the Lower East Side. He was laid off from that job last fall, he said, because the manager hired cheaper Chinese help. His wife had joined him in New York in 1988, but Jing remained in China until her parents were able to send for her in January 1990. She cried with fear when she first saw them at the airport in New York. "They were like total strangers," she said. "I wanted to go back to China with my grandmother."
Jing does two to four hours of homework a night -- only then does she watch TV -- but last fall was also in a self-created total immersion course as she counted down to the Stuyvesant test. On Saturdays she took a test preparation course at I. S. 131, offered free to the best 30 students based on previous test scores. On Sundays she took a private preparation class given by the Kaplan testing service, at $700, which her father paid for before he was laid off. She also studied S.A.T. preparation books that she checked out of the library. To relax, she read horror fiction for young adults.
The Stuyvesant test is officially called the "Examination for the Specialized Science High Schools" -- Stuyvesant, the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Technical High School. The same test is given for admission to all three, and students simply list their first, second and third choice. Since a majority of students list Stuyvesant first -- 11,397 out of 18,524 eighth graders who took the most recent test -- the cutoff for admission to Stuyvesant is higher. This year students had to score 559 or better for Stuyvesant's admission, or get about 85 of the 100 questions right.
The test is divided into English and math sections, just like the S.A.T., and is prepared and graded by American Guidance Service, an educational publishing company outside Minneapolis-St. Paul. To make the test more fair to immigrants whose English lags, sections on sentence completion and word synonyms, antonyms and analogies have been eliminated. The English part of the Stuyvesant test emphasizes "logical reasoning," which educators say makes the test more difficult.
"It's an indication of a more sophisticated learner," said Carolyn West, an I. S. 131 teacher who helped prepare Jing for the test.
A sample question for the "logical reasoning" section goes like this:
Five students are in line according to height, from tallest to shortest. Liz is taller than Mickey but shorter than Fred. Mickey is shorter than Noah but taller than Judy. Noah is shorter than Fred. In which position is Noah?
A. first B. second C. third D. fourth E. cannot be determined from the information given.
To get the answer, Ms. West said, a student has to be able to think enough to draw a diagram for help, from tallest to shortest. But after plotting out the information in each sentence, all a student can learn of Noah is that he goes somewhere between Mickey and Fred. A student still doesn't know how Noah compares with Liz. The answer is E.
Jing headed off to Stuyvesant at 7 A.M. on Dec. 6, nervous. A week later, she talked to a reporter, whom her father later escorted to the neighborhood subway stop.
"I cannot make big money," he said quietly as he walked, describing the difficulties of a China-trained doctor in the United States. "But for my daughter, the future is important. After many years, she can be a specialist."
 
Heather McLeod
'I Want to Go To Harvard'
Heather McLeod was not nervous about the Stuyvesant test until her friend Justin told her that his life depended on passing it. "He said, 'If I don't make it to Stuyvesant, I can't get into a good college, and I can't make a lot of money and I'll live on the street,' " she recalled.
Heather laughed, but she had her heart set on Stuyvesant, too. "I want to go to Harvard, I really do," she said. "So many people from Harvard get someplace."
She and her mother, Sylvia, were talking the night before the test in their living room in the Jackie Robinson Apartments, a complex built over Ebbets Field. Lots of families like the McLeods live there, but Heather feels different. "The kids say, 'Come out and play,' and I'll say, 'I have a book report due.' And they'll say, 'You're a nerd.' "
Heather's parents -- her father worked in a boiler room, her mother has a high school education -- came from Jamaica 28 years ago. "Our children are going to do well in this country," Mrs. McLeod said firmly. She is pleased so far. Heather's two older brothers went to parochial schools, then Georgetown and Fordham. One is now a mid-level manager at the Federal Aviation Administration, the other a manager at a Marriott Hotel. Neither passed the Stuyvesant test, but Mrs. McLeod has always had bigger hopes for Heather. "She thought farther ahead than her brothers did," she said.
Heather gives her mother all the credit. "She read to me every night when I was little," she said later in the evening, her eyes growing moist, when her mother had left the room. "Golden Books, Cinderella, children's Bible stories. I don't know how she did it, but she made me want to excel."
Heather started studying for the Stuyvesant test last summer and by fall was spending her school lunch hours in a test prep course offered free by the Mark Twain School. "They drilled it into you," she said. She was well aware of how few black students pass the test, but said she was not going to think about that.
Blacks account for 4.1 percent of Stuyvesant's student body, Latinos 3.7 percent. (The rest of the student body is 47.7 percent Asian and 45.5 percent white.) The numbers outrage community advocacy groups like Acorn, which in 1997 released a report, "Secret Apartheid II," showing that private and parochial schools plus three public school districts provided more than half the students at Stuyvesant and Bronx Science.
The report found that the five districts that sent the most students to the schools were predominately white, and the five that sent the fewest were predominately black and Latino. The report also said schools in those districts offered few of the advanced courses that help in passing the test.
Acorn recommended suspending the test altogether, an idea rejected by Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew. But the Board of Education now has an 18-month prep course, the Math/Science Institute, housed at Stuyvesant, for 400 mostly minority students. Students are selected based on standardized test scores and principals' recommendations, and then by lottery. The institute is financed by the Board of Education at a cost of $1.2 million a year. Of the first Math/Science group, which started after sixth grade in the summer of 1995, 304 took the test and 45 got in -- 10 of them black and 11 Latino. "It has to start somewhere," said Bruce Ravage, the institute's director. The institute has just added three new sites in other boroughs, for 700 more spots.
 
Adam Bloch
Outsmarted By His Cleverness
Adam Bloch vividly remembers the last math question on his Stuyvesant test: i is a 28-consecutive number set. What is the maximum number of multiples of seven that can be in i?
"Four times seven is 28 -- you immediately think that," Adam said. He decided the answer was obviously four.
And yet, it seemed a little too obvious. His test-preparation teachers had told him to think, and this answer didn't seem worthy of the Stuyvesant test. Adam decided it must be a trick.
He skipped up to seven through 35, calculating that since seven plus 28 is 35, it was another 28-consecutive number set. And that got him the multiples of 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. The answer, he decided, was 5.
After the test he saw his mistake. Seven through 35 is in fact a 29-consecutive number set. The right answer, all along, was 4. "Looks like it's a double-trick," Adam said. "They try to trick you into thinking when you shouldn't think."
Adam talked easily at the dining table in his high-rise apartment, decorated with his parents' collection of Judaica, as his mother, Ofra, wandered in and out. She once worked in an art gallery in Tel Aviv, and came to the United States in 1980. Adam's father came from Poland in 1972.
Adam seemed amused to be interviewed, and offered many opinions about books, movies and history. Talking to him was a lot like talking to an adult, if the average adult had his discipline.
He said that when he arrives home after school, "I've always had this tradition: I say hi to my mother, and I rush into my room." There he always does his homework -- before a snack, before phone calls.
Adam loved studying Greek mythology and Minoan Crete at Bank Street last fall -- he read the Iliad and the Odyssey -- and the Middle Ages in the sixth grade. He said he is currently reading "American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson" by Joseph J. Ellis. "It's not a book I would dive into and read for several hours a day," he admitted. "But it's interesting."
For 10 weeks last fall, Adam took a private test preparation course, GRF, costing about $500, and was one of 26 students at Bank Street -- which goes only through eighth grade -- who applied to Stuyvesant. Adam's older brother goes to Stuyvesant. When he was taking the test, Mrs. Bloch said, money was a concern.
Adam said he thought private school tuition was $17,500 a year.
"No, it's 18 and a half," his mother told him gently. Then she sighed. "It's a stretch, of course it is."
 
The Results
'I Didn't Cry Or Anything'
The results came in the first week of March, delivered to the three by their schools: Adam and Jing got in, Heather did not.
"I didn't cry or anything," Heather said. "But I was disappointed." She scored 483, meaning she got about 70 of 100 questions right. Jing got a 584, or about 88 right. Adam got 625 and about 93 right, ranking 118 out of the more than 18,000 who took the test.
Jing, who was speechless when she got the news -- "I was like really, really happy" -- will go to Stuyvesant. Adam, who thinks his test-preparation course may have added 50 points to his score, was one of six students from Bank Street who made the Stuyvesant cutoff. Adam also got into his three private schools. After thinking it over, he decided that Stuyvesant, with its 3,000 students, was too big. He'll go to Dalton.
Heather did qualify for Brooklyn Tech, but next year will go to Bishop Ford Catholic Central High School in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, as her brothers did. "She'll do fine no matter where she goes," said Gary Goldstein, Heather's principal. "She'll be an exemplary student."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 8, 1998, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about three students' efforts to get into Stuyvesant High School misidentified the Brooklyn neighborhood for Bishop Ford High School, which one girl considered as an alternative. It is in Windsor Terrace, not Bay Ridge.

Chart: "FACTS AND FIGURES: Stuyvesant High School"
 
* Of graduating seniors, 99.9 percent go to college.
 
* Founded in 1904, it occupied a ramshackle Victorian building on East 15th Street until 1992. The new building, on Chambers Street at the West Side Highway, has five gyms, 12 science labs, a swimming pool, an 850-seat auditorium and unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty.
 
* Graduates include Roald Hoffman and Joshua Lederberg, Nobel laureates in science; Lewis Mumford, the critic, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, the director, and James Cagney and Tim Robbins, the actors.
 
* All male and predominately Jewish until 1969. By the early 1990's, Asians made up more than half the student body. By 1997, Asians were less than half, and whites had increased to nearly 48 percent, in part because of immigrants from Russia and Eastern Europe.
 
* The school does not rank most students. "It doesn't make any sense when you have dozens and dozens of kids with a 97.2 average," said Jinx Cozzi-Perullo, Stuyvesant's principal. But it does select numbers one and two as valedictorian and salutatorian. Ms. Cozzi-Perullo once suggested using a method other than rank; the students said no. "They haven't gotten here without being competitive," she said. (pg. B8)

HEADLINE: Sun Sets on British Car Makers

BYLINE: By RICHARD FEAST 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
WITH the announcement this week that BMW of Germany would buy Rolls-Royce Motor Cars for $571 million, the British auto industry has hawked its last valuable piece of family silver. What remains are some old kitchen utensils and sports equipment.
In purely business terms, the sale is not particularly important. The Rolls-Royce unit of Vickers P.L.C., a military supplier, sells fewer than 2,000 Rolls-Royce and Bentley automobiles a year, a pittance in an industry that produces 36 million cars annually. But here in Britain, the prospect of a foreign takeover of the last major indigenous auto maker, particularly one that is a symbol of national pride and that builds what are probably the world's most prestigious marques, cuts deep. 
 Whether Rolls-Royce is acquired by BMW or by Volkswagen, which has suggested that it may raise its competing bid, a German takeover will leave the British industry essentially foreign-owned. The remaining independents are a handful of sports car companies -- Caterham, Morgan and TVR, for example -- and a couple of taxi makers.
But while there is no longer a British car industry, there is a car industry in Britain. It is a subtle difference that masks a paradox: the country is producing more cars than it has in 20-some years. Foreign ownership is succeeding where the home-grown variety failed.
The failure had been remarkable. After World War II, British managers presided over the collapse of entire industries, from heavy trucks, buses and motorcycles to machine tools and auto parts. The auto business survived despite what now seems like concerted efforts to kill it -- by managers who insisted on producing poorly designed cars and by militant workers who advanced leftist causes.
In the early 1950's, the British auto industry was second in size only to that of the United States, and Britain was the leading car exporter. It looked so good partly because the auto industries of Germany, France and Japan were still picking their way out of the ruins of war. The deficiencies of British companies were soon exposed, especially after the country joined the European Economic Community in 1973.
British vehicles were once recognized, revered or reviled around the world. Today, their names are a roll-call of the glorious dead. Most were made in sprawling, grimy factories in the English Midlands -- "the Tin Triangle," J. B. Priestley called it. British car output reached a record 1.92 million in 1972; a decade later, it was less than half that much.
The once-proud Rootes Group, which had been bought by Chrysler, was sold to Peugeot of France. Four years ago, BMW bought the Rover Group -- only the latest name, after BMC, British Leyland and BL, for a collection of brands that dominated the industry in the postwar years. Ford now owns two quintessentially British companies, Jaguar and Aston Martin. Lotus was bought by General Motors, then by an Italian entrepreneur; it is now Malaysian.
While British auto makers withered, extensive auto operations were created in Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Spain. Ultimately, the British industry's salvation came as a result of decisions made halfway around the world. Japanese auto makers selected Britain for their first "transplant" operations in Europe. These modern, efficient plants proved the catalyst for fundamental changes at Ford and Vauxhall, the local subsidiary of General Motors.
By the early 1980's, Ford and Vauxhall were running at idle. Vauxhall lost its in-house engineering responsibilities to Adam Opel, its sister company in Germany. Ford, the market leader, imported as many cars into Britain as it made here. Neither company exported cars, even to the rest of Europe. The arrival of the Japanese changed that.
Britain was a surprising choice, given its history of bitter strikes, shoddy quality and low productivity. But the market reforms of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had transformed the nation, causing tremendous social pain but making the economy much more competitive.
Industrial disputes are no longer an issue, and British factories run by Nissan, Toyota and Honda are among the most productive and quality-conscious in Europe. "The Japanese were like an M.B.A. program for the Europeans," said Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at the Cardiff Business School in Wales.
There was another unexpected result. The upheaval created a pool of engineering talent that was harnessed by design and development contractors. Companies like Cosworth, Ricardo, Lotus, Mayflower and TWR work on secret contracts for the world's major auto makers. Daewoo of South Korea established its European technical center in southern England.
At the same time, Britain evolved as the center of a specialized industry: the design and manufacture of Formula One and Indy-car racers, through companies like Lola, McLaren, Penske, Reynard and Williams.

Despite a long tradition of auto design and production, the few remaining British-owned companies make highly specialized vehicles with minuscule sales. The best-known remaining marques, including Jaguar and Land Rover, are foreign-owned.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Dramatic Drop in Crime Puzzles the Experts" (news article, March 29): More significance should be attributed to increases in the minimum wage and low unemployment rates as providing hooks to young people who want to pursue legitimate employment.
And while schools may now provide overlap with certain family functions, as one expert you quote suggested, the perception of whether jobs are available and worthwhile is still formed in large part at home and on the street.

HEADLINE: For Want of Feed, Indonesia Is Losing Its Chickens

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BOGOR, Indonesia

 BODY:
People here are waiting to see which will go first, the chickens or the eggs. Either way, both foods may soon disappear from people's diets, heralding severe food shortages here in the world's fourth most-populous nation.
"We have almost no chickens left," said Ho Cu Ciong, who farms eggs here in Indonesia's poultry-breeding capital, 40 miles south of Jakarta. Already he has slaughtered or sold most of his 90,000 chickens because of the high cost of feeding them. His eggs have become an expensive luxury item. 
 "If you ask me which will be the first to go down, it is both of them," he said. "In the market the shelves are already empty, empty, empty."
With the cost of imported feed more than doubling because of the weakness of Indonesia currency, 90 percent of the poultry farmers have already gone out of business, said Karyoto, an industry analyst.
The United States Department of Agriculture predicted recently that Indonesia would soon run out of chickens entirely. The Government is trying to keep at least some large producers in business by helping them pay for feed.
Self-sufficient in rice for most of the past decade, Indonesia may have to import four million to five million tons this year -- more than 30 percent of the rice on the world market -- at a cost of at least $1 billion.
The country's worst drought in 50 years has deepened the prospects of a severe food shortage in this nation of 200 million people.
"For the first time in 30 years we're looking at two consecutive declines in food production because of the drought," said Ben Fisher, an analyst for the World Bank in Jakarta. "It was down by about 4 percent last year and quite possibly another 4 to 5 percent this year."
 The United Nations said recently that more than seven million people face "food insecurity" in the coming year. The World Bank predicts that Indonesia might need $3 billion in food aid to avert critical shortages. And President Suharto has acknowledged the growing problem, saying, "Even mothers can no longer be provided powdered milk for their babies."
The drought has caused immediate hardship to farmers, who make up nearly half the population. In some small plantations, farmers are cutting down their coconut trees to sell the wood. In some remote areas, people have been reduced to eating bamboo shoots and tubers. Malnutrition is expected to spread.
"I don't think we're facing mass starvation," said H. S. Dillon, an Indonesian who heads the private Center for Agriculture Policy Studies in Jakarta. "But going to have millions of people who are really hard up."
While inflation, unemployment and bankruptcies are squeezing the economy, it is food shortages that raise the most immediate fears of hardship and social unrest.
One worry is that shortages combined with unemployment could cause a surge of violent protests. In January and February, rising prices caused dozens of riots, mostly against shops owned by ethnic Chinese.
"When people get down to one meal a day, then you're looking at a fairly severe situation," said Ann Thomson, country director for CARE.
The World Bank calculates that there are enough basic foods here or en route to last through April. Beyond that, the future is uncertain.
Warning of a "serious food crisis," the bank is coordinating a food aid program with contributions from as many as 20 nations. The International Monetary Fund also appears ready to ease its demand that Indonesia end its expensive food subsidies as a condition for a $40 billion rescue package. But with the weakened currency, these continued subsidies could cost as much as $5 billion this year, said Rizal Ramli, a leading economist.
Though it is rich in farmland and natural resources, Indonesia imports large portions of wheat, sugar and soybeans, a staple here. These imports, sold at subsidized prices, have tempted Indonesians into dietary changes that will be painful to reverse. As one of the largest importers of wheat, for example, Indonesia has become dependent on bread and cake as common foods. Cheap wheat noodles now form the basic food for millions of the urban poor.
Imported milk powder has transformed the diets of children, who now crave milk throughout childhood. "I tell my son: 'There is an economic crisis. You must drink less milk,' " said Emmi, a shipping clerk who pays four times more for milk powder than she did in February. "But he just says, 'No, no, no.' "
The shortages are compounded by an emerging breakdown in the distribution system. With the increased cost of imported spare parts and lubricants, large numbers of vehicles have been sidelined for want of a tire or a clutch. Others have been taken off the road for fear they will be stolen.
In addition many ethnic Chinese, who form the backbone of the country's commerce, have shut their shops and warehouses for fear of more riots or raids on their stocks. And as import and transportation costs drive up their costs, some find it safer to stop selling than to raise their prices.
Here at the Trio Poultry Farm, Mr. Ciong said he was still producing a few eggs -- and losing money every day -- in the hope that things might get better. Most of his coops now stand empty, and most of his workers have already joined the millions of newly unemployed.
As for the chicken-and-egg question, he said, you can look at it either way. But either way, he said, "we're all going bankrupt together."

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Drop Sharply As Boeing Falls

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
Orders to American factories fell sharply in February, though the decline was caused by a big drop in the volatile aircraft industry, the Commerce Department reported today.
Though orders fell by nine-tenths of 1 percent, excluding transportation equipment, hurt by a drop in orders at the Boeing Company, they were up two-tenths of 1 percent. That indicated that the economy continued on a path of steady growth. 
 Adding to the picture, the Labor Department said that the number of people applying for state unemployment benefits fell by 5,000 last week, to 309,000, suggesting steady job creation.
"It's safe to say that we've got a very solid growth outlook right now," said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York.
With the economy robust but inflation still at bay, the Federal Reserve has consistently -- most recently at a policy-making meeting this week -- kept interest rates steady. At the previous meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee, on Feb. 3 and 4, Fed policy makers unanimously voted to leave rates unchanged, deciding to wait to see whether Asia's downturn slows the American economy, minutes from the meeting that were released today show. The committee also kept a neutral bias with regard to rates, instead of moving to a tilt in favor of raising rates, which some analysts had expected.
The factory orders report offered further evidence demand for American goods had not deteriorated as much as expected amid the Asian crisis.
For example, orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, rose 1.9 percent in February, marking the third monthly increase. In addition, factory shipments, a gauge of current demand, rose 1.2 percent in February, after declining nine-tenths of 1 percent in January.
The drop in overall durables orders came because Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, reported only 9 new orders in February, down from 62 in January. That was inflated by a 59-plane order from the Southwest Airlines Company, said Shawn Griffin, senior manager of public relations for Boeing's commercial airplane group.

HEADLINE: Indonesia to Sign 3d I.M.F. Rescue Pact

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
Indonesia is within days of signing its third accord in five months with the International Monetary Fund to try to rescue its collapsing economy, and the fund's leadership is already fending off criticism that it is giving in too much to the demands of President Suharto, the country's authoritarian leader.
The new accord greatly delays the imposition of earlier requirements that Indonesia end its subsidies on electricity, gasoline and a number of basic food items, according to American and fund officials familiar with its details. Indonesian officials insist that the fund's attempt to terminate those subsidies quickly, part of a January economic plan that has never been carried out, are stoking anti-Government protests that have broken out across the country. 
 Today, at another such protest, in Jogjakarta,where Mr. Suharto made his name as a military commander more than three decades ago, Indonesian policemen fired tear gas and threw stones to break up a student protest. Reuters quoted witnesses as saying 40 people were wounded.
Speaking in Washington today, Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the I.M.F., insisted that he would walk away from negotiations with Indonesia if it did not agree to a strong reform program. "The markets will not buy" a weak agreement, he said, a reference to the need to stop the flight of foreign money from Indonesia.
But as Mr. Camdessus spoke, his deputy, Stanley Fischer, was arriving in Jakarta to put the final touches on a new accord, one that American officials say Indonesia must begin adhering to before it gets its next installment of aid.
Some economists and Congressional critics of the monetary fund have said that the fund is easing too many of the terms of its $43 billion loan program in an effort to get Mr. Suharto to accept reforms.
Among other things, the fund and Mr. Suharto's Government have already agreed on new financial goals for the country's budget, which in turn will allow Indonesia to spend more than $1 billion on food subsidies and run relatively large budget deficits. The fund's new aid program also reflects the rapid deterioration of the Indonesian economy: inflation in the first quarter of the year was estimated to have run at 25 percent.

HEADLINE: The Mayor vs. the BID's

 BODY:
One of the engines of New York City's renaissance has been the business improvement districts. The BID's have been responsible for much of the cleanliness, improved security and revitalized spirit of commercial areas in all five boroughs. But now Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appears determined to emasculate the BID's by limiting their ability to plan and advocate on behalf of their members. This is a puzzling development that seems to go counter to Mr. Giuliani's own vision of government.
There are 39 BID's in the city, each financed by fees from local commercial property owners, including The New York Times. City law requires that the BID's operate as democracies controlled by the ratepayer, and that all their operations be open to city scrutiny. The city is responsible for making sure the BID's operate properly, and Mr. Giuliani has expressed concern that some BID executives are running the districts like petty fiefs, borrowing too much money or cutting ratepayers out of the decision-making process. 
 The Mayor has every right and duty to make sure the districts are following those rules. But he has reacted instead by throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The administration's new directives suggest that the city wants the right of prior approval over everything the BID's do. It has told district executives that from now on all ideas for new activities, contracts or expenditures must be vetted with the Department of Business Services, even before representatives of the ratepayers are brought into the discussion.
The department also wants to be informed before any discussion with other city agencies takes place -- an awful burden for BID staffs who are in constant contact with city employees on issues ranging from law enforcement to permits for street fairs.
Mr. Giuliani has identified a narrow problem, and attempted to solve it by smothering the BID's with a blanket of new bureaucracy. For a Mayor who preaches the gospel of lean government, privatization and keeping power and responsibility as close to the grass roots as possible, this is a strange and unwelcome development.

HEADLINE: A Would-Be Yeltsin Heir Faces Big Test in Siberia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: ACHINSK, Russia

 BODY:
Aleksandr I. Lebed stood in the Siberian chill in nothing more than a dark business suit and told the voters his iron hand could turn their region around.
The overflow crowd in the auditorium was bundled up in bulky coats and fur hats. Siberia may be rich in natural resources, but Achinsk is too strapped to pay its heating bills. 
 "It is not an economist who is needed today," Mr. Lebed declared. "It is an expert on crisis management. Nobody can tell me the name of an economist who has had any success in our huge country."
A year and half after he was dismissed by President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Lebed is running for governor of the huge Krasnoyarsk region in a bitter race that could make or break his political career.
Victory would give the former general a powerful base for his campaign to capture the presidency. Defeat could be cataclysmic. So far, it is very much an uphill battle.
"If I lose this election there is nothing for me to do in the Presidential elections," Mr. Lebed conceded in an interview. "And if I win the election and don't prove to be a good governor there will also be nothing to do at the presidential elections."
President Yeltsin's decision to dismiss his Cabinet has intensified the infighting over the 2000 presidential race. With two years to go, it seems as if the starting gun has already gone off.
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the stolid former Prime Minister, is a contender. Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow has been rushing around the country, striking nationalist poses.
The Communist leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, has been trying to revive his party's sagging fortunes by portraying Mr. Yeltsin's shake-up as a national crisis.
Then there is Mr. Lebed, a raw political talent who seems to speak with the dull roar of a Russian bear. Standing ramrod straight, Mr. Lebed looks a bit like his own bodyguard.
A shallow opportunist to his critics and a charismatic crusader to his supporters, Mr. Lebed became a national sensation by coming in third in the 1996 presidential race. He worked briefly as President Yeltsin's national security adviser before being cast out for coveting Mr. Yeltsin's job too openly.
Mr. Lebed, 47, is no stranger to adversity. As a Kremlin aide, he risked the wrath of Russian nationalists by negotiating an end to the conflict in Chechnya. But Siberia is proving to be his toughest test.
To understand why Mr. Lebed is putting a high-stakes gamble on a province 2,400 miles from Moscow, think of a region that extends from North Dakota to Texas. (Krasnoyarsk is one-fourth the size of the United States.)
Then imagine that the governor of the region is also a representative in the national legislature. (The governor of Krasnoyarsk is a ranking member of Russia's upper house of Parliament)
Also consider that the region has some of the nation's largest factories and richest resources. Krasnoyarsk has the country's biggest metallurgical complex -- Norilsk Nickel -- as well as chemical plants, aluminum factories and two closed nuclear cities, off-limits to Russians without special permission.
Further, imagine that it has often been a barometer of political trends. Krasnoyarsk only has a population of 3.4 million, but the 1996 voting results closely paralleled the national outcome.
The timing of the governor's race is also convenient for a politician with presidential ambitions. While Mr. Lebed was born in the southern region of Rostov and later served as a parliamentary deputy from the Tula region near Moscow, he did not have to worry about a residency requirement. To run for governor of Krasnoyarsk, a candidate simply has to produce a long list of voters' signatures.
Mr. Lebed, to be sure, has several things going for him. He is famous. Krasnoyarsk has an anemic economy, which is just beginning to turn around.
Mr. Lebed has retooled his image. He rarely growls like a nationalist. Instead, he has assumed the role of a decisive manager and populist, who promises, if elected, to hold visiting hours for disgruntled citizens twice a week.
His small motorcade races from town to town in politically-correct Russian-made Volga sedans and Lada compacts. The shiny Mercedes and BMW cars that prowl Moscow's streets are conspicuously absent.
Running for governor also seems to be kind of a family business. Mr. Lebed's older brother reigns over neighboring Khakassia, one of Russia's 20 ethnic republics. The Russian press has charged that he won thanks to his support of corrupt businessmen in the aluminum industry.
But Krasnoyarsk is a much tougher fight. The incumbent is Valery M. Zubov, a former sociology professor who spent two years teaching at the University of Oklahoma. He has painted Mr. Lebed as an outsider with dubious financial backers who views Krasnoyarsk as a stepping-stone on his march to the Kremlin.
Mr. Zubov is also supported by Mr. Luzhkov, a Lebed rival who subscribes to the axiom that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. He is planning a trip to Krasnoyarsk to stump for Mr. Zubov.
The Communists have been hammering away at Mr. Lebed, too. They would like to have the monopoly on the downtrodden and disaffected.
The Communist candidate is Pyotr Romanov, who was born in a prison camp after his father was jailed by Stalin but who became a Communist anyway. An experienced politician and former factory director, Mr. Romanov tells voters that if Mr. Lebed is elected "it will take him at least six months to understand the situation."
If no candidate wins a majority of votes in the April 26 balloting, there will be a run-off between the two leading candidates. Most observers expect the race to come down to Mr. Zubov and Mr. Lebed.
Mr. Lebed's meetings in Achinsk, a factory town 150 miles northeast of Krasnoyarsk, show the obstacles his campaign faces.
While wage arrears and layoffs are a big problem, weary resignation, not anger, seems to dominate. Data collected by the Lebed campaign also indicate that the voters tend to prefer the devil they know and that Mr. Zubov is ahead of the pack.
While Mr. Lebed sought to tap the voters' anxiety, he has no economic program to speak of and instead talks in vague homilies.
"Instead of giving you fish every day, I will give you a fishing rod," he told the voters here. "Catch as many as you can."
Mr. Lebed also brandished his patriotism and military service to counter the charge that he was a newcomer who does not have Krasnoyarsk's interests at heart.
Still, some questions here were as frosty as the weather. Workers and pensioners wanted to know what a military man could do about the economy. Others asked about reports that Mr. Lebed's campaign is being financed by Boris Berezovsky, as part of a strategy to draw votes away from Mr. Luzhkov, or by the magnates in Krasnoyarsk's aluminum industry.
Mr. Lebed was not always adept with his answers. He denied that Mr. Berezovsky was his financial backer but insisted he could not reveal his contributors because they cheated on their taxes and would be hounded by the tax police.
The comment seemed to inadvertently capture the moral ambiguities of Russia -- and of its politicians.
"It is so-called 'gray' money," Mr. Lebed told his listeners. "Like you, they are a little bit of a swindler."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
At an association meeting, agency executives survey competition from a host of challengers.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.

 BODY:
PROVOCATIVE and challenging examinations of the competitive threats to Madison Avenue dominated the general session here yesterday of the 80th annual meeting of the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
Speakers at the conference explored why rivals as disparate as management consultants, Hollywood talent agencies and brand strategists are gaining success at encroaching on the turf that has been traditionally been trod by advertising agencies. 
 "Adding value to clients' goods and services through application of ideas is a sort of alchemy," said Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP Group P.L.C., which owns agencies like Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide and the J. Walter Thompson Company. "That is what advertising and advertising agencies at best do well and at very best make a contribution that is priceless."
However, he added, there is what he termed a "marketing myopia" among agency executives that has "blinded them to the real nature of what they provide and has opened the doors to new and unexpected competitors."
As a result, Mr. Sorrell said, many advertisers "don't think we're smart enough" to hire for projects.
Agencies may not be making the case for their services boldly enough to fend off "rapacious consultants," Mr. Sorrell said, like McKinsey & Company and Deutsche Bank A.G.'s Bain & Company unit, as well as such other usurpers as Goldman, Sachs & Company and "flashy idea factories."
"Agencies need to be a lot more adventurous," he added. "At exactly the time traffic is getting faster and louder, the middle of the road may be an extremely uncomfortable place to find ourselves."
Mr. Sorrell suggested that agencies aggressively recruit M.B.A. students the way the consultants do, calling the present dearth of interest in them "pitiful." He also proposed that they cultivate relationships with creative talent at universities, theaters, special effects production companies and computer game design firms.
"If we don't do it," he said, "somebody else will -- and they'll probably be named Spielberg or Disney."
Mr. Sorrell also criticized agencies that "give away free with the layouts and storyboards" the expertise they have developed in "understanding the whole of a client's business" through studying consumer behavior and attitudes.
That was echoed by Ralph Rydholm, the 1997-98 chairman of the association, which is also known as the Four A's.
"I believe we do not value our work as much as we once did or as much as we should," said Mr. Rydholm, who is also chief executive of Euro RSCG Tatham in Chicago, a unit of Havas Advertising. "And therefore, we do not charge for our product the way we should."
"We are people who not only point out problems" the way consultants do, he added, "we solve problems, and that should be worth even more money."
"What we do is the single most powerful thing that anyone can do," Mr. Rydholm said, "and that is to create an idea that can move people to action."
"All too often, we don't necessarily look at ourselves with the same sharp eye that we look at a marketing problem with," he added, "or value ourselves the same way we value our brands. We are worth it. We are underpaid."
O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the association, whose contract was recently extended through 2002, also addressed the issue of how agencies are valued.
"Given the recent earnings reports from the publicly traded advertising agency holding companies," Mr. Drake said, "one might think I've got a hell of a nerve talking about increasing agency profits and margins. Yet I can assure you that we have to do this if this industry is going to survive as we know it."
"Ideas that grow brands and generate sales for clients will continue to be the most important contribution agencies make to a client's business," he added. "To achieve that, agencies need to be fairly paid and they must not sacrifice their right to look after the health of their own business."
To help accomplish that, Mr. Drake said, the association is "working on a number of initiatives, including a major study by experts outside our industry as to just what constitutes a fair margin and return on investment in an increasingly complex, global and technology-driven business."
Mr. Drake also outlined a proposal to increase attendance at the annual meeting, which has declined this decade to a range of 400 to 450 people a year. An estimated 440 are attending the 1998 management conference, being held at this desert resort through tomorrow.
Mr. Drake proposed to combine the annual meeting of his association with that of its corresponding marketers organization, the Association of National Advertisers.
"The economics of running a first-class meeting like this, with top-notch speakers and entertainment, look a lot better when you have 700 attendees than when you have 400," Mr. Drake said.
However, Mr. Drake deflated his own trial balloon when he disclosed that the executives of the advertiser association had not embraced his proposal.
Indeed, John J. Sarsen Jr., president and chief executive of the advertiser association, who was here for the Four A's annual meeting, said in an interview after Mr. Drake made his proposal: "It's an area we'll continue to discuss, but I don't see it happening in the short term. We do a number of things together in areas like media and new technology. But we have separate and distinct agendas."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Investors Push Dow Near 9,000 as Inflation Fears Wane

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Waning fears of rising inflation helped major stock market indexes charge to record highs yesterday for the second consecutive day and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to within three points of breaking 9,000.
Much of the gain came toward the close of trading. After moving as high as 8,997.11 within the last 10 minutes, the Dow closed at 8,986.64, up 118.32 points, or 1.33 percent. 
 So far this week, the blue-chip index has risen 190.56 points, with more than 186 points of the gain coming in the last two days.
In taking stocks higher, investors seemed to indicate that they expected few surprises from today's employment report, analysts said.
"The market's not worried something is going to come out of left field," Andrew M. Brooks, vice president in charge of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates, said.
"Our view hasn't been gyrating the way the market has," George M. Cohen, a principal at Cohen Kligenstein & Marks, a New York-based investment management firm, said. "Corporate profits are still strong, the economy is healthy and inflation is low. The situation is really O.K."
Bonds also surged late in the day on optimism that the unemployment data would not signal higher inflationary pressure. Such a strong move "shows a lot of bravado on the part of the bond market ahead of the report," Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko International in New York, said.
"It's not really the strength of the report that matters, what's really important here is inflation," Mr. Brusca said. "If we don't get evidence of inflation, I think the market will do well."
Stocks and bonds may also have gained some strength from midafternoon comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, at a meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in Washington.
Asked about the current level of stock prices, Mr. Greenspan said that they were not out of line and that they reflected investor expectations of improved productivity and rising corporate profits. The tone of his remarks contrasted with his now-famous "irrational exuberance" assessment of investor psychology in December 1996, which briefly sent stocks falling sharply.
Besides the Dow average, the Standard & Poor's 500 index also hit a new high yesterday, rising 11.86 points, or 1.07 percent, to 1,120.01.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite picked up 5.30 points, to a record 1,852.96, a 0.29 percent gain.
The buying spree aided a number of issues. Cor Therapeutics rose 78 percent after the biotechnology concern received news that regulators are close to approving its new heart drug. Speculation that Mattel could begin distributing the Ohio Art Company's toys such as Etch A Sketch sent shares of the toy maker, based in Bryan, Ohio, up 53 percent. Ohio Art closed at 33 1/2, up 12.
Despite the strong gains yesterday, investors also showed they could react swiftly to negative news, as they did in taking down the prices of several stocks which forecast earnings disappointments yesterday.
"If you come in light, the market's taking no prisoners," Mr. Brooks said. "Expectations are pretty high, so if you don't deliver people are quick to say, 'Let's move on to something else.' "
Stocks such as Security Dynamics Technologies and Respironics were examples of this. Security Dynamics fell nearly 37 percent after the computer security software concern said first-quarter earnings will fall short because sales did not match forecasts. Respironics also fell nearly 37 percent after the respiratory medical product designer said quarterly profits would falter on low demand and Medicare reimbursement issues.

Treasuries Rise in Price
 
 The prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday, as investors expected that today's report on employment in March would contain favorable numbers from the bond market's standpoint.
The 30-year bond was up 17/32 , to 104. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.84 percent, from 5.88 percent on Wednesday and represented its lowest level since 5.83 percent Feb. 18. Traders apparently expected that the employment report might show some slackening of the job market; such news often buoys the bond market, where inflation fears are paramount.
Elsewhere yesterday, the Philippines sold $500 million of 10-year notes, the first public bond sale by an Asian country since the financial crisis there deepened last year. The Government sold the notes at a yield of about 8.9 percent, or 3.375 percentage points more than 10-year Treasuries, with orders for twice as many bonds as were available.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Dream for Africa: Many Snags to Overcome

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal, April 2

 BODY:
Quite apart from the good legal news he received here, President Clinton has had an African trip to remember.
In a speech today on Goree Island, where for centuries Africans were crammed into the holds of ships for awful voyages into slavery, Mr. Clinton said he believed more than ever that a renaissance was sweeping this continent. Echoing the "I have a dream" cadences of Martin Luther King Jr., a descendant of slaves, he waxed rhapsodic about the "beauty and intelligence, energy and spirit" that he had seen in African faces, "the faces of Africa's future." 
 With the waves of the Atlantic at his back, the President insisted that "democracy is gaining strength" and "peace is making progress" here, and vowed to build "a bright common destiny" with the countries of Africa.
He has been greeted warmly by Ghanaians in a city square and Senegalese on dusty byways, by East African leaders little known outside their own countries and by a South African leader, Nelson Mandela, known in the world's every nook and cranny. Those whom he talked with told him that they were amazed and pleased that an American President had invested 12 grueling days in their continent.
Patrick Lekota, the chairman of the Council of Ministers in South Africa, spoke for many when he said of the President's visit, "An event of this nature gives us a sense of how far we Africans have traveled." Mr. Clinton, for his part, talked about American companies earning 30 percent a year on their investments and said that that showed the benefits of real partnership.
Now it remains to be seen how the trip pays off -- whether or not ordinary Americans, who have seen and heard more about Africa than ever before, much of it positive, will demonstrate the short attention spans for which they are famous, and forget all about the place; whether or not the African resurgence of which Mr. Clinton spoke so enthusiastically will gain momentum and come to involve more leaders of more nations; whether or not more American business executives will take the risk of investing in countries still beset with problems.
The President's men and women have ambitious plans for following up his work here. Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater and Commerce Secretary William M. Daley both plan to return to Africa at the head of trade delegations later this year, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, a former chairman of Goldman, Sachs, and as such a symbol not only of Washington's power but of Wall Street's, is reportedly considering adding other stops to a trip to South Africa.
Susan E. Rice, the 33-year-old Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, a former Rhodes Scholar who has shaken up a dozy corner of the bureaucracy, will work to keep African issues on the front burner.
But passage of the African trade bill by the Senate is far from certain, especially since Mr. Mandela pronounced it unacceptable. The President's pledge to increase aid levels will be equally difficult to fulfill, given the tenor of Congressional sentiment. And many things lie beyond American control.
The world economy will inevitably encounter another recession one day, like the one that hit in the 1970's, when oil prices shot up, penalizing energy-poor African countries more than most. Because Africa exports mostly raw materials and imports mostly finished goods, it remains highly vulnerable when demand for commodities like copper and palm oil sags, driving down prices.
Mr. Clinton and his advisers believe, however, that Africa is starting to build a solid foundation that will make it easier to weather global economic storms. Among the positive developments that they discerned here are the emergence of a new generation of leaders who understand the need to participate in free markets; the decline of once-pervasive corruption in some countries; the muting of the North-South and East-West polemics that once absorbed so much of the continent's energies, and a waning of the psychological and financial dependence that shackled the former colonies here in their first decades of independence.
The need for regional cooperation -- or, better, unification -- remains one of the continent's pressing needs. Most countries are too small to support industrialization on a competitive basis.
It is true enough, as Mr. Clinton noted in his speech today, that the United States now imports more oil from Africa than from the Middle East and exports more goods to Africa than to the nations that once formed the Soviet Union. But that trade accounts for only 0.9 percent of total United States exports and only about 2 percent of total United States imports; furthermore, it is confined to a few countries, while the rest remain economic backwaters.
South Africa alone produces a third of the continent's gross domestic product and generates no less than half of its electricity.
Poverty remains a plague, not only in poor countries like Mali, east of Senegal, whose liberal-minded leaders complain bitterly of the difficulty of making democracy stick when there is not enough to eat, but in comparatively well-off places like Senegal and Botswana.
Forty years ago, African countries like Congo, with fabulously rich mineral resources, had per capita incomes roughly equal to Asian countries like South Korea. Now South Korea's is more than 50 times as large as Congo's, and Congo's leader, Laurent Kabila, strikes Americans who know him as a frightened man, over his head in his new responsibilities. Mr. Clinton talked privately with him for an hour in Entebbe, Uganda, trying to persuade him, as one member of the President's entourage said, "to change his stripes and pursue democracy."
Congo is one of Africa's big potential winners. Another is Kenya, a success story when Uganda was a mess, a mess now that Uganda is a success story. And then there is Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which along with Gabon and Equatorial Guinea supplies a quarter of the oil imported by the United States.
Mr. Clinton talked about Nigeria with almost every leader he met this week, seeking advice. They all said that "if Nigeria explodes, it's a disaster for every country in Africa," reported Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, but they disagreed on how to persuade the country's military dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, to hold honest elections and free political prisoners. Some favored a tough line, some favored appeasement.
"Every avenue we have tried to deal with the Government of General Abacha has been frustrating to us," Mr. Clinton confessed at a meeting with human rights activists this morning. "What should we do? It is an incredible tragedy. You have this huge, diverse, rich country being driven into the ground by political oppression and mismanagement."
Only South Africa, among the big countries, has taken the path of economic liberalism and political pluralism followed by such smaller nations as Mali, Senegal, Ethiopia, Uganda and Botswana. And even there, one person in three, according to some figures, is out of work, with the predictable consequences of high crime and social disorder.
"Mandela is trying hard, and Clinton said good things -- mostly platitudes, but very good platitudes," said Helen Suzman, an admirer of both men and a longtime voice for human rights in South Africa. "The problem is, high birth rates and people flooding in from neighboring countries mean that we need foreign investment and foreign aid, both in large quantities, and quickly."

HEADLINE: Republican Puts New Hurdle In Path of I.M.F. Financing

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
In a new threat to one of President Clinton's top foreign policy goals, the House majority leader today urged fellow Republicans to reject the Administration's request for $18 billion in new financing for the International Monetary Fund.
In a seven-page memorandum sent to lawmakers, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the second-ranking House Republican, said the financing would encourage an unchecked expansion of the fund's lending that would cost the United States billions of dollars and weaken financial systems worldwide. 
 "If, under the Clinton Doctrine, we sanction a policy of ever-expanding bailouts and futile and inept attempts to manage other economies, the resulting system will be fragile, susceptible to sudden economic stops and starts, crashes and panics," he said.
Mr. Armey, who acknowledged that his view "may well be a minority position in the House," proposed delaying a vote, expected later this month, on the $18 billion increase. A delay would undercut I.M.F. supporters who are trying to attach the financing to a popular disaster-relief bill.
His memo offers the latest evidence of divisions among Republicans over whether to support the new financing, which the Administration says the fund needs to refill a treasury strained by the Asian financial crisis.
Much of the Republican leadership favors the new financing. Speaker Newt Gingrich said in an interview today that the House needs to hold more hearings on the issue, but he disagreed with Mr. Armey's memo, saying, "I don't think you should just dive into it."
Senate Republicans, with most of their Democratic colleagues, overwhelming approved the $18 billion last week; Republicans backed the measure by nearly three to one.
Mr. Armey sent his memo just as House members headed home on a two-week recess, during which many legislators will undoubtedly hear concerns from farmers and businesses who may support the I.M.F. request because they are worried about losing markets overseas.
Mr. Armey said he would consider supporting the new financing only if the fund first made make public its documents and decision-making procedures, and stopped offering loans at below-market rates.
These arguments parallel those made by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. But Mr. Rubin has said the United States cannot impose its will on the 182-member organization, and that doing so would jeopardize the fund's ability to cope with the Asian crisis.
"The United States is working actively to strengthen the architecture of the international financial system," said Mr. Rubin's spokesman, Howard M. Schloss. "The key is not to put at risk the plans in place in Asia, or put at risk U.S. jobs and businesses."
The Senate bill would require the Treasury Secretary to certify that the Group of Seven leading industrial nations insure that borrowing countries live up to their trade obligations and eliminate subsidies. The House bill would impose tighter restrictions that the Administration says are unworkable. Mr. Armey's conditions would be even more restrictive.
In a speech here today, the fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, said, "I am confident that your great country, as our largest shareholder, will maintain its leadership by supporting the I.M.F."
Aides said Mr. Armey's memo was inspired by a recent meeting with such prominent critics of the fund as George P. Shultz and William E. Simon, both former Treasury Secretaries. It is both an analysis by a former college economics professor, Mr. Armey, and a rallying cry for party conservatives who distrust American involvement in international organizations.
Since it was established 50 years ago, the I.M.F. has been forced to change to meet the needs of the fast-moving global economy.
"No longer are they providing needed cash to basically sound enterprises," Mr. Armey said. "They are bailing out the bankrupt."
This trend, he continued, only encourages more risky investment. Secretary Rubin shares this concern, but has said the repairs cannot be made at the expense of the aiding troubled Asian nations.

HEADLINE: Auto Makers Seeking to Avoid Fines Over Mileage Rules

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 2

 BODY:
With full-sized sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks increasingly popular, auto makers are falling short of Federal fuel-economy standards and scrambling for ways to avoid the embarrassment of paying millions of dollars in fines.
Regulations imposed two decades ago to reduce reliance on imported oil require an average of 20.7 miles per gallon this year for each auto maker's fleet of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans, known collectively as light trucks. Auto makers are subject to fines if their mileage average over seven years is below the Government standard. 
 The light-truck standard is much easier to meet than the 27.5 miles per gallon required for cars. But the popularity of big sport utilities and pick ups that manage only 15 miles or less per gallon has created serious problems for the Big Three auto makers.
The Ford Motor Company is predicting an average fuel economy of 20.1 miles per gallon for the 1998 model year and the Chrysler Corporation is forecasting an average of 20 miles per gallon, according to a new Federal statistical report. Both auto makers are close to falling below the Government standard for the last seven years, but officials at both companies said they would not actually fall below or pay fines.
The General Motors Corporation has had the most fuel economy problems in recent years and is the closest to paying fines. But according to the Federal report, G.M. is predicting that its light trucks will have an average fuel economy of 21.2 miles per gallon this year, beating the Government standard and up from 20.2 miles per gallon in 1997. Sam Leonard, a senior G.M. fuel-economy official, said the jump in 1998 fuel economy would allow G.M. to avoid paying fines for now.
But to achieve its increase from 1997, G.M. has resorted to some unorthodox moves that improve its average without actually raising the fuel efficiency of its vehicles.
For example, G.M. has already cut short its 1998 model year for its biggest sport utility vehicles -- the Chevrolet Tahoe, the GMC Yukon and the Chevrolet and GMC Suburbans -- after less than six months of production. The company declared all such vehicles built after Jan. 31 to be 1999 models. Because fewer large vehicles with poor fuel economy are counted as 1998 models, the average mileage for G.M.'s light trucks rises.
G.M. plans to introduce large pickup trucks for the 1999 model year that are slightly more fuel efficient than the models they replace. This would allow the company to sell more of the four full-sized sport utility models that it has converted early to the 1999 model year. Ford and Chrysler have not moved any vehicles early into the 1999 model year.
G.M., the world's largest auto maker, is taking several other actions. It quietly notified dealers last month that it planned to extend the 1998 model year for its mini-vans and small pickup trucks, which tend to increase the fuel-economy average.
Last autumn, the company also quietly strengthened the suspensions on even the smallest Suburbans with four-wheel drive. The stronger suspensions give the Suburbans the capacity to carry enough weight to qualify as medium-duty trucks. Medium-duty trucks are exempt from fuel-economy calculations, so the four-wheel-drive Suburbans no longer drag down G.M.'s average. Mr. Leonard said customers were demanding more heated seats and other options on Suburbans, so the stronger suspension was needed.
All three auto makers are looking at ways to install more diesel engines, which improve fuel economy by up to 30 percent.
But environmentalists remain leery of diesels. While the cleanest diesels now meet Federal clean-air standards for light trucks, and may soon even meet the standards for cars, they cannot be made as clean as the cleanest gasoline engines. Widespread adoption of diesel engines could prevent regulators from tightening standards someday, said Roland J. Hwang, director of the transportation program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a research and lobbying group in Washington.
Chrysler is selling light trucks that can run on both gasoline and ethanol; Ford plans to follow suit soon. Such vehicles, because they can run on ethanol, an alcohol commonly made from corn, qualify for Government credits that allow the auto makers to sell more gas-guzzling light trucks. Yet only 44 service stations nationwide sell ethanol.
Fuel economy averages used by the Government are calculated by driving a vehicle on a test track under ideal conditions, not on roads where mileage would be lower. By this method, 20.7 miles per gallon on the test track translates to about 18 miles per gallon on the road, the number used on window stickers, according to regulators.
United States auto makers have never been fined for fuel economy violations. They have consistently met the fuel economy standard for cars and forecast that they will continue to do so, while Japanese auto makers consistently meet the car and light truck fuel-economy standards, according to the report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Many European auto makers have fallen short of the car standards and paid penalties.
Federal law sets the fines at $5 per vehicle for every tenth of a mile per gallon that a company's average fuel economy falls below the standard. If G.M. fell a tenth of a gallon below the standard, as would have been possible if nothing were done, it would have owed close to $10 million -- a pittance for G.M., the world's largest company, with $177.68 billion in sales last year.
But the American auto makers worry that paying any penalties would be perceived as having flouted the law. This could hurt their image and increase political pressure to improve fuel efficiency. They also worry that they could be vulnerable to lawsuits by American shareholders if they knowingly violate a Federal law.
Environmentalists and some members of Congress say the auto makers should do more to improve fuel economy, particularly for sport utility vehicles, which are used much more than pickups simply for shopping and commuting.
"That is an area where the industry can and should do much more," said Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada.
Concerns about American dependence on foreign oil prompted Congress to enact the fuel economy rules in 1975, but the impact of growing gasoline consumption on global warming is now a major issue.
Auto makers respond that they are working on electric vehicles and other technologies that may improve fuel economy early in the next century. Auto executives and many economists also contend that the fuel-economy rules are a highly inefficient way to reduce gasoline consumption, forcing auto makers to sell small cars and small light trucks at a loss to meet the overall averages. They also point out that unlike gas taxes, the rules do nothing to discourage Americans from driving ever more miles and burning ever more gasoline.
The system of fuel economy regulation "just introduces distortions to the marketplace, and that's disastrous for the auto companies," John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said in a recent interview.

HEADLINE: Albany Legislative Leaders Quickly Agree on Most of Budget

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 2

 BODY:
Moving with remarkable swiftness for a Legislature notorious for its slowness in producing budgets, legislative leaders reached tentative agreement today on almost every part of the state budget, including the contentious areas of school construction and tax cuts.
Just eight days after opening budget negotiations to the public for the first time, Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker, said late this afternoon that they had agreed to include $743 million in tax cuts more than what Gov. George E. Pataki recommended in his $71.6 billion election-year budget plan. And they agreed to add $500 million to the $858 million Mr. Pataki proposed spending on school construction and renovation. 
 Mr. Bruno, a Republican, and Mr. Silver, a Democrat, said they hoped to complete their budget plan by early next week, after nine legislative conference committees work out the details of spending in areas like education and economic development.
The bipartisan committees, which include members from both houses, were created last week in an unusual attempt to open New York State's notoriously secretive budget process to the public and speed it up. In the past, the process was subject to long delays as the Governor and the two top legislative leaders negotiated behind closed doors. But legislative leaders, facing election-year pressure and frustration among rank-and-file members who have long been excluded from the negotiations, abandoned that much-maligned process.
While the two houses have all but agreed on a plan just two days into the new fiscal year, it remains unclear whether Mr. Pataki will go along with it. The Governor has repeatedly said that the Legislature is overestimating revenues and underestimating expenses by $600 million. Mr. Pataki, who lost considerable power over the budget process when the Legislature decided to form the conference committees this year, has vowed to reject any plan that spends more than his proposal of $71.6 billion. That proposal is 7 percent larger than last year's, with a substantial increase in education spending.
Mr. Pataki has line-item veto power over budget bills, and legislative leaders said today that they did not have enough votes to override a veto. Although he would not comment on specific details of the Legislature's spending plan, the Governor again threatened to veto the plan in a statement tonight.
"If the budget the Legislature sends me spends even one dime more than I have proposed, I will veto it," he said. "I urge the Legislature to complete its deliberations and send me a fiscally responsible budget that continues to build on our success in cutting taxes, controlling spending and insuring the fiscal soundness of the state."
Mr. Bruno insisted that the Legislature's budget plan would not be more expensive than Mr. Pataki's, even though it adds several hundred million in spending. But until all the details are put on paper, it is impossible to know whether that will be the case.
Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver approved requests from the conference committees to spend $243 million more than what the legislative leaders recommended earlier this week in nine categories. That includes an extra $30 million for education, $6 million for mental health and $31 million for human services. They said the extra money would come from a reserve fund that they estimated to be worth $350 million.
Most of the remaining work will fall to the conference committees that oversee education spending and tax cuts, Mr. Bruno said. While legislators know how much they want to spend on school aid to local districts -- they are proposing an increase of about $1 billion, nearly double the rise Mr. Pataki is recommending -- the education committee must decide how to divide the funds between school districts' general budgets and special programs like pre-kindergarten and bilingual education.
The $500 million for school construction and renovation would not be included in the $1 billion school aid amount. Legislative leaders said the construction money would be distributed based on student enrollment, which means that New York City, which enrolls about 37 percent of the state's public-school children, would receive about $190 million of the $500 million.
Meanwhile, the committee in charge of taxes and economic development must decide over what period the $743 million in tax cuts would be phased in. Mr. Bruno said he expected the cuts to be phased in over four years. They include a $50 million personal income tax cut, a $250 million corporate tax cut and a $105 million clothing sales tax cut that would include a repeal of the sales tax on shoes.
(In the best example of the theatrics of today's meeting, Mr. Bruno played down the hole in the bottom of his worn-out shoe to demonstrate his support for the repeal of the shoe sales tax.)
While the proposal for school construction spending was the subject of heated debate earlier this year, only one member of the general budget conference committee run by Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver criticized the proposal today. That member, Republican Assemblyman John Faso of Kinderhook, said legislative leaders were being overly optimistic in their prediction of extra state revenues.
"I've made my point all along that I'm skeptical about some of the numbers," Mr. Faso, the new Assembly minority leader, said.
But Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno waved away the criticism and declared the new budgeting process a smashing success. Ignoring the possibility of opposition from the Governor, they predicted that the Legislature could vote on a final budget by April 13.
"From all that we've accomplished together at this point, it's clear that we should reach closure shortly," Mr. Silver said. "The committees have worked, this is how the budget should be done and I can say with some confidence that hopefully, we will never go back to three men in a room."

HEADLINE: Everest, and Sherpas, Are in Vogue;
New York's Cool New Guys, Thanks to Books and Films

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The Sherpas are bemused.
When they began settling in New York City, the famously trustworthy mountain people from Nepal who have hefted supplies (and not a few Western climbers) to the summit of Everest, fully expected the immigrant's struggle of hard work and homesickness. 
 But they never expected to be cool.
"Thanks to the new Everest boom, the Sherpas are very much in vogue," said Dr. Vincanne Adams, a Princeton University anthropology professor who has been studying them since 1982. "After all the books and movies, there is kind of a celebrity aspect to being a Sherpa."
This has provoked no little astonishment and a measure of delight among the nearly 500 Sherpas living in New York City, the largest settlement in the United States. Until now, the city's newest microcommunity had grown so quietly that it was off the scope of most demographers.
But in recent weeks, Sherpas have loomed large in the glow of The Movie, as they call it: the Imax film "Everest," which chronicles an expedition to the 29,028-foot summit of the world's tallest mountain. The film has racked up the highest per-screen attendance gross -- $54,099, according to Variety -- of any film playing in the country. Thus far, "Everest" has taken in a record $662,000 at the Imax theater at Sony Lincoln Square in Manhattan as of April 1.
The film is just the latest manifestation of Everestmania. There is also the book "Into Thin Air," by Jon Krakauer, which chronicles the May 1996 blizzard that claimed the lives of eight climbers. It has been on the best-seller list of The New York Times for 47 weeks and became an ABC Sunday Night Movie. And the National Geographic Society's $35 coffee-table book on the Imax expedition, "Everest: Mountain Without Mercy," has sold 150,000 copies since October.
"The Imax film is a very big event for us," said Dhamey Norgay, a Sherpa who works in Manhattan as a program coordinator at Philip Morris. "It was very moving for so many of us to see our mountains again, and our culture portrayed on the big screen."
The 28-year-old Mr. Norgay is the youngest son of the most illustrious Sherpa, the late Tenzing Norgay, who made the first ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary on May 29, 1953. The younger Norgay remembers the cold and the wind of Everest more than 20 years later, when he hiked there at age 9 with his father up to the 13,000-foot level. "We've lost a lot of family members on that mountain," he said. All told, 53 Sherpas have died on Everest.
"People have been coming to the store and talking about the movie," said Gelmu Sherpa, the owner of Tibet, a tiny, artifact-rich Himalayan gift shop on West 80th Street in Manhattan. "I think there is much curiosity about Sherpas now. I'm thinking of opening a second store."
Paradoxically, most of the city's Sherpas have no Everest experience. "When people hear that I'm a Sherpa, they ask how many times I've climbed Everest," said Tsewang Sherpa Lama, president of the United Sherpa Association in New York. He laughed gently. "They're disappointed when I tell them that I've seen Mount Everest -- from a very long distance."
Mr. Norgay and Mr. Sherpa Lama spoke on a recent evening in a rented banquet room at St. Vartan's Armenian Cathedral on East 34th Street in Manhattan. They and 600 other Sherpas from across the land -- nearly all the current population in America -- had gathered to celebrate Lhosar, the Sherpa equivalent of the Chinese New Year.
A red, yellow and green banner proclaimed "Happy Lhosar 1998, Year of the Earth Tiger 2125." Standing before it was Ang Babu Lama, a Buddhist monk in saffron shirt and maroon robes who chanted Tibetan prayers invoking the presence of the Buddha and other deities, and asked for blessings in the new year.
"I came for a short visit last month and the Sherpas won't let me go," Mr. Babu Lama said with a broad smile, after the ceremony.
In New York, there are no monks to perform birth-and-death services, and the nearest Buddhist monasteries are hours away in the Hudson Valley. The Sherpa association is now looking for space and contributions to create their first monastery in New York City.
"When I came to New York, I was the only Sherpa in the phone book," said Lakhpa Thundup Sherpa, who arrived in 1979 and now works as a clerk in the Australian Consulate in Manhattan.
By 1982, "there were only four Sherpas in New York, and perhaps 15 in all the country," said Mr. Sherpa Lama, the association president, who arrived that year as a student with financing from a trust set up by Sir Edmund Hillary. "The community began growing dramatically only after 1990."
"These days the joke is that if you're looking for a Sherpa in Nepal, you'll find him in New York," said Sonam Sherpa, who has been here for 13 years and works as a treasury analyst at Metro North. "Thanks to the movie and the books, people look at us with new attention when they hear we're Sherpas."
Sherpas are scattered throughout the boroughs, though there are concentrations in Queens and Brooklyn, and for some it can be a lonely life. As they work in the United States to save money to buy land or businesses back in Nepal, they are separated from spouses and children.
"Many Sherpas here miss their families at home," said Lakhpa Sherpa Pinasha, a computer-science student at Hunter College who has been in the United States for the last year and a half. "I certainly do. After I graduate, I intend to return to look for a job."
As in Nepal and in Darjeeling (where there is a large Sherpa community), "the Sherpas in New York tend to stick together," said David Breashears, the veteran Everest climber who directed the Imax film. "Pretty much literally, since they often cluster five or so to an apartment."
Amid the struggling economy of Nepal, "the image of America is of a place where you can pick money off the sidewalk," said Jangbu Sherpa, 26, who helped carry the Breashears team's cameras and film up through the final 3,000 feet, the "death zone" to the Everest summit. "I think more Sherpas would like to move here."
But many work for a while and leave. "I lived in the United States for nine years," said Jamling Tenzing Norgay, "but I decided to go back to my homeland because I missed my people."
Mr. Norgay, at 33 the second-oldest son of Tenzing Norgay, is a focal point of the Imax film as he assaults the Everest summit to honor his father, who died in 1986. Now Mr. Norgay runs an adventure-travel business in Nepal, and visits the United States three times each year.
Sherpa means "Easterner," and refers to an ethnic group that began migrating to the Everest region of Nepal from eastern Tibet nearly 500 years ago.
As a group, New York City's Sherpas are accomplished polyglots: in addition to Sherpa, they know Nepalese, English and Hindi, and even French and Japanese if they worked in international tourism back home.
Mountain bumpkins they are not. "In Nepal many live and work with elite and wealthy climbers from America, Europe and Japan," Dr. Adams said. "They form close bonds with them, and they know of every trend from cell phones to the Internet."
Required to take the name Sherpa on Nepalese passports, many have used the designation here on drivers' licenses and credit cards. But all Sherpas have other clan, village and family names.
Many Sherpas have clustered in the health-food store business and city construction work; some drive taxis and do domestic work and others toil here in the trekking business.
Mr. Sherpa Lama got his first job at a health food store in 1982 by offering to work free for two weeks. "After the second week," he said, "the owner began paying me and then asked if I knew any other Sherpas so he could hire them." He did and the owner did. Now Mr. Sherpa Lama is the manager of Healthy Pleasures, believed to be the largest health food store in the city, on University Place in Greenwich Village.
Although Sherpas' mountain upbringing stresses humble generosity, many express a pride that "we do things that others cannot do," as several Sherpas put it.
Their culture and Tibetan Buddhist religion have long attracted intense interest in the United States. "I think Americans have always been interested in the Tibetan peoples -- you know, the land of Shangri-La," said Dawa Tsering, the United States representative of the Dalai Lama. "But the 'Everest' film and the recent books, and movies like 'Kundun' and 'Seven Years in Tibet,' have created a new wave of interest in the culture and traditions."
Those traditions are up for grabs here and in Tibet, where "the Sherpas and Tibetans share a common danger that their culture is being assimilated," Mr. Tsering said.
This hardly seemed an issue at the Lhosar party in the Armenian Cathedral. Volunteers passed around plates of khapsey, sweet little New Year's cakes fried in butter. And hundreds of Sherpas imbibed chaang, a rice wine similar to sake.
Married women wore intricately colored pangden, traditional aprons of lamb's wool, and many women wore coral and agate "dze beads," necklaces passed from generation to generation, some of them worth tens of thousands of dollars. Soon, three dozen revelers joined in a rendition of "Happiness and Prosperity."
Their admirers wish them both. "You cannot but have a sense of awe about these indomitable mountain people who have been the backbone and engine of every Everest expedition since the 1920's," Mr. Breashears said. He employed 24 Sherpas during his ascent to the summit of Everest, and he was instrumental in organizing rescue efforts after the 1996 tragedy.
"I would trust them with my life," he said, "and have."

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES BUDGET BLUEPRINT CURBING TAX CUTS

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
After calming recalcitrant conservatives, the Senate tonight approved a Republican budget blueprint for the new fiscal year that would hold tax cuts to $30 billion over five years and reject nearly all of President Clinton's proposals for new spending.
The $1.73 trillion spending plan, approved on a near-party-line vote of 57 to 41, provides the chamber's guideline for spending and taxes for the 1999 fiscal year as the parties look for new footing in dealing with the first Federal budget surpluses to appear in a generation. 
 The week of debate -- and scores of amendment efforts -- leading to tonight's vote showcased not just the differences between the two political parties but also internal Republican divisions over how to approach fiscal policy in the new era of surpluses.
Conservative Republicans have sharply criticized the Senate for abandoning their party's signature issue of tax cutting at a moment when surpluses allow new boldness. Even Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, has said he would like to see at least $45 billion in tax cuts by the time the year's budget drafting is complete.
The passion for tax-cutting is running much higher in the House, where Republicans will be fighting in the November elections to keep majority control. The majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas has said the House would look for tax cuts in the range of $60 billion across five years when it starts assembling its budget proposal in late April or early May.
The two visions of the House and Senate will still have to be reconciled, and President Clinton has the power, should he choose, to veto the tax and spending bills that will be drafted this year to put the final budget plan into place.
The plan approved by the Senate reflects in part how successfully Mr. Clinton boxed in Republican tax cutters by calling in his budget for the preservation of surpluses until the nation agreed on a way to shore up the Social Security system, which will run short of money once the baby boom generation begins to retire early in the next century.
The Senate plan, drafted primarily by Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, accepted Mr. Clinton's call to protect the surplus. The plan envisions only slightly more in tax cuts than the $24 billion called for by Mr. Clinton in his own budget. It also projects steady surpluses beginning with $8 billion this year and growing to $59 billion in 2003.
But while Mr. Clinton counted on revenues from any tobacco settlement to pay for new programs in education, child care and health care, the Senate plan eliminates those initiatives and sets aside any tobacco money for Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly.
Mr. Domenici said Senate Republicans looked for what programs they thought most needed money.
"They are Social Security and the Medicare system," he said.
His stance would allow Republicans to head off traditional efforts by Democrats to campaign as the protectors of programs dear to retirees.
Democrats opposed the Senate plan after their effort to restore money for education, child care and health care initiatives failed in an afternoon of voting. Sounding likely election themes, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said the Republican budget said "no to education, no to child care, no to comprehensive solutions to teen smoking."
With Democrats planning to vote against the blueprint, Senator Lott, a Mississippi Republican, had to work to quell a brief rebellion by as many as six conservatives, led by Senator John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican who is likely to seek his party's Presidential nomination. Seeking sweeping tax cuts, the Republican defectors could have handed their leaders an embarrassing defeat.
But the conservatives agreed to vote for the Senate plan after Republican leaders assured them that when it came time to negotiate the differences between the House and Senate the party would accept the proposal with the higher tax cuts. The rebels said that one of their group, Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota, was promised a seat on the committee that would reconcile the two proposals.
Voting for the measure were 54 Republicans and three Democrats, Senators Max Cleland of Georgia, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Charles Robb of Virginia. Senators Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Daniel Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, did not vote. All 41 other Democrats voted no.
How much of the Senate budget plan survives the next few months is far from clear. The Senate Commerce Committee has already come up with an alternate plan for using money from a tobacco settlement.
In the House, the chairman of the budget committee, Representative John Kasich, Republican of Ohio, has said he will use proceeds from a tobacco settlement to cut taxes. But the House's desire for tax-cutting has also been made more difficult by the passage tonight of a massive $217 billion public works bill that breaks the spending limits set in last year's balanced budget agreement by at least $26 billion.
After the two houses pass their budget resolutions, they have to reconcile the plans and then begin the months-long process of devising individual tax and spending bills that put the budget in place. The President cannot veto the budget plan but he can veto the individual bills.
No matter how much of the Senate budget plan is ultimately embraced, the week of voting on amendments allowed both parties to position themselves for the campaigns ahead. In one such nonbinding test vote, the Senate voted 59 to 48 today to support a Republican plan to cause the Federal income tax code to expire after 2001. The proposal also called for the revamping the Internal Revenue Service.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "At a Glance: Highlights of the Republicans' Budget"
These are the main provisions of the Senate budget plan:
 
SPENDING -- Would rise from $1.67 trillion in 1998 to $1.73 trillion in 1999 and to $1.95 trillion in 2003. Under President Clinton's plan, it would grow from $1.75 trillion in 1999 to $1.98 trillion in 2003.
SURPLUSES -- $8 billion in 1998, $8 billion in 1999, $59 billion in 2003. Mr. Clinton has projected surpluses of $4 billion in 1999, growing to $43 billion in 2003.
TAX CUTS -- At least $30 billion in tax cuts over the next five years. Mr. Clinton proposes $24 billion.
HIGHWAYS -- $26 billion in highway and mass transit spending beyond levels agreed to in the five-year balanced-budget deal.
PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVES -- It rejects plans to expand child care, hire teachers, build and repair schools and let people age 55 to 64 buy into Medicare.

Economic Realities

 BODY:

To the Editor:
If John M. Ellis (Op-Ed, March 28) would like to see more humanities majors, I suggest that he consider the financial realities of students' lives.
The students I teach in a community college in Southern California are not driven away from the liberal arts by trends in scholarship. What drives them away is a brief trip to the campus career center. There they compare the cost of transferring to a four-year university with the financial aid available (mostly loans), the salaries they can expect to earn and the majors that employers commonly require for entry-level positions. 
 Very few are willing to risk a major that virtually guarantees a more difficult job search -- and a lower income -- than one more obviously vocational.

HEADLINE: The Clintons as Teammates, Dovetailing in Africa

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: GOREE ISLAND, Senegal, April 2

 BODY:
Over the last 12 days, Bill and Hillary Clinton have treated Africans -- and Americans watching from home -- to a full dose of the buy-one-get-one-free Clinton partnership, sprinkling images of a fun-and-policy-loving First Couple across the continent.
This trip, which was longer in gestures than new proposals, was intended to produce a partnership "that will outlive my Presidency," Mr. Clinton said before flying home today. But the partnership most vividly spotlighted here was not between Africa and America but that of the Clintons. And it was shown to a degree not seen since Mrs. Clinton presided over her husband's failed health care plan in 1994. 
 Together, the Clintons danced with schoolchildren in a sun-splashed Ugandan meadow; together, they roamed the Kalahari, pointing out the big game to one another and merrily describing their adventures to reporters; and today, they stood hand-in-hand in a former slave house here, gazing somberly out through a gaping doorway at the gray Atlantic and the forced route of Africans to the New World.
Not just the symbol-conscious but the substantive Clinton & Clinton was on display today. This morning, the Clintons met in Dakar with activists from across Africa to discuss democracy and human rights. It was the last of what seemed an unbroken stream of transcontinental round-table talk, during which the Clintons discussed recovering from genocide with Rwandans, fighting poverty with South Africans, and protecting the environment with Botswanans.
"I look forward to the conversation," Mrs. Clinton said, in greeting the group today.
On this tour, one Clinton adviser said, "There's been one schedule, rather than two."
On Wednesday, the Clintons appeared in the isolated village of Dal Diam, swept with dust by the hot wind off the encroaching desert, to admire work done there over four years by the Agency for International Development and private groups: a well dug, cattle bought, reading taught, and a village store started with a small loan.
Taking a microphone to perform an introduction for the villagers, Mrs. Clinton referred to a song some of them had just sung. "I liked the song very much where he was called Hillary's husband," she said, "but, usually, we call him the President of the United States."
In return, Mr. Clinton, wearing an ankle-length silver gown over his shirt and tie, invoked his wife's book, "It Takes A Village," which took its title from an African proverb. "Your village has lifted our hearts," he told the crowd.
On Wednesday night, the Clintons received word that Paula Corbin Jones's sexual misconduct case against the President had been thrown out. The news provided an unexpected personal and political lift, helping Mr. Clinton to return to the United States on a high note, his aides said. But for the most part, such matters did not intrude on the African trip; watching this couple tour Africa, one would have little idea that back in the United States, the husband was being buffeted with new charges of extramarital affairs, which the White House has angrily denied.
White House aides acknowledged that the Clinton partnership had been more visible in Africa than it had been since 1994. Mrs. Clinton kept a lower profile at home after the health care plan collapsed, concentrating on less hotly debated issues like foreign development and education. But in her foreign travels, Mrs. Clinton never stopped campaigning on behalf of women, declaring over and over that women's rights were also human rights.
Like the trip itself, the display of the strength of the Clintons' marriage came at a propitious time, with accusations about the President's personal conduct still at a boil in Washington despite the decision in the Paula Jones case. But White House advisers said Clinton & Clinton became more prominent on this trip simply because, in Africa, Mrs. Clinton's cherished issues moved to the fore. "She clearly has been a primary tutor of him" on Africa, said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary.
Mrs. Clinton, who traveled in Africa a year ago, lobbied her husband to make this trip and guided him to sites she visited before, like a South African housing cooperative and this small island of sandy lanes and pastel-colored colonial houses. "It was so important for her to have him do this," said one of her advisers.
Staff members who have watched the Clintons in private over the last two weeks said they continued their policy chatter away from the cameras, swapping impressions and ideas. "There are times you can see tension between them, when they're not agreeing," one Administration official said. But in Africa, this official added, "the two of them seem incredibly happy with each other."
As is generally the case abroad, Mrs. Clinton has been a political asset to the President here, partly because of her previous trip and her advocacy of foreign development. "Thanks for visiting us Hillary," read one sign in the Senegalese village on Wednesday.
The President has been invoking Mrs. Clinton since his arrival in Africa, in Ghana on March 23. "We need to come to know Africa as a place of new beginnings and ancient wisdom from which, as my wife, our First Lady, said in her book, we have so much to learn," he said in a speech to hundreds of thousands there.
Mrs. Clinton accompanied the President to nearly all of his public events. While she spoke at many of the same events as the President, Mrs. Clinton also spoke on her own, always to highlight women's issues. At a day care center in Ghana, she declared, "We must speak out to insure that no girl is ever denied an education" and "to end violence against women in all forms."
Today, Mrs. Clinton met with a group of activists here to condemn the practice of female genital cutting.
In the village of Dal Diam on Wednesday, the Clintons, in the presence of reporters, lingered despite staff protestations to have their pictures taken with the family of Amadou Sou, whose compound of thatched huts they were visiting. "Should we take pictures with each group?" Mrs. Clinton asked.
"We can if you like," Mr. Clinton replied.
With his wife beaming nearby, Mr. Clinton was then presented with a baby goat, which he cradled in his arms and kissed repeatedly on its forehead, baahing back as it cried to him. "What's the name of this goat?" he asked, and was told, inevitably, that it was Bill Clinton -- a Billy goat.
"You must take very good care of this goat!" Mrs. Clinton declared.

HEADLINE: Companies Oppose Disclosure of Detail On Gifts to Charity

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
Big publicly held companies are bridling at proposed Federal legislation that would require them to disclose how much money they give individual charities, warning that such a law would have a chilling effect on corporate philanthropy.
In letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is studying the potential effect of the bill, dozens of companies and many not-for-profit organizations say that such a requirement would add costs and invite pressure from special interest groups and shareholders, both of which would result in less giving. 
 Disclosure "would dangerously expose corporate philanthropy to a broad range of special-interest groups, which could be expected to descend like locusts on such an opportunity to pursue their singularly focused agendas in this new arena," Federated Department Stores wrote in a typical letter.
Representative Paul E. Gillmor, Republican of Ohio, introduced the bill a year ago, but only in recent months has the request for comments from the S.E.C. drawn dozens of new letters, most of them critical of the bill. Representative Gillmor said that shareholders had a right to know how managers were distributing corporate assets and that disclosure would discourage managers from making hard-to-justify donations to pet charities. He added that his interest in the subject stemmed from many years of investing his own money and serving on the boards of several private companies, and that he had noticed a tendency on the part of some other companies' management to ignore shareholders.
Many experts in corporate law agree that companies should disclose their charitable donations. "The problem with today's corporate philanthropy is that it sometimes functions to promote and aggrandize corporate management, who generally take credit for the donations," wrote Charles M. Elson, a professor at Stetson University College of Law in St. Petersburg, Fla., which conducted a symposium on the topic in November. In cases where there is no clear benefit to the company, he added, "it is a waste of corporate property and constitutes self-dealing."
Companies donated $8.5 billion, or 5.6 percent of the $150.7 billion in total charitable donations in 1996, according to Giving USA, a report from the AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy, an arm of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel.
Many companies give through foundations, which offer tax benefits to the corporation, and details of those donations are disclosed in tax filings that are available to the public. Typically, though, companies make most of their donations to philanthropic organizations directly, and there is no requirement to disclose those gifts.
Whether companies should disclose their donations is part of a broad and long-running debate about the role of corporations in society.
Some economists and corporate executives believe, for example, that companies should give nothing to charities. They argue that the role of managers is to maximize returns for shareholders, who can then donate their money as they wish. They add that if top executives want to give to their favorite charities, they should use their own money, not that of their companies.
"Corporate charity exists so that C.E.O.'s can collect awards, plaques and honors, so they can sit on a dais and be adored," Albert J. Dunlap, chairman of the Sunbeam Corporation, wrote in his book "Mean Business" (Simon & Schuster, 1996). "That is not what the shareholder is paying them a million bucks a year -- plus stock options and bonuses -- to do!"
But many executives say that corporate contributions are both good business and are a hallmark of corporate citizenship. Computer manufacturers and software companies like I.B.M. and Microsoft, for example, donate tens of millions of dollars' worth of products each year to schools, both to improve the quality of technology education and to attract new customers.
Many companies have also long embraced the notion that they have a duty to many "stakeholders" beyond their investors -- including the communities in which they operate.
"Corporate contributions often represent the key to new approaches for community problems," the CSX Corporation wrote in one of more than 180 letters submitted to the S.E.C. by a variety of companies, organizations and individuals. Its donations, the transportation company noted, have included seed money for a program to help recovering drug users in Richmond, where it is based. CSX wrote that it was opposed to the disclosure bill because the total amounts of its charitable giving were not material to the corporation's business, and therefore shareholders would not benefit by having the information disclosed to them.
Yet while many companies told the S.E.C. of their pride in their charitable programs, almost all, for a variety of reasons, denounced Representative Gillmor's suggestion that they disclose them to shareholders.
Some said such contributions were business decisions best left to management. One company, Anheuser- Busch, said disclosure would give competitors insight into its strategy.
One commonly mentioned concern is that such a requirement would create a costly administrative burden to gather the information and that those costs would come out of their donations. Proponents of the bill and many corporate executives noted that companies already gathered the data for tax deductions.
Another concern cited by many companies was that disclosure would provide new fodder to special-interest groups. Some corporate gifts have drawn criticism from advocacy groups in the past. In 1990, for example, the AT&T Corporation ended 25 years of donations by its foundation to Planned Parenthood, a decision prompted largely by a letter-writing campaign and boycott threat by anti-abortion groups.
The Capital Research Center, a conservative group in Washington, has for years studied data disclosed by companies about their charitable giving. It concluded after analyzing data gathered from 142 large companies that they gave three-and-a-half times as much to what it termed "liberal and left-of-center advocacy groups" as to "right-of-center and pro-free market groups." The center's latest findings were detailed in its 1996 book "Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy," the subtitle of which is "Funding Enemies, Forsaking Friends."
Many not-for-profit organizations wrote to the S.E.C. to express concern that the bill, if it became law, would prompt companies to pull back from contributing to smaller organizations in favor of national charities less likely to stir controversy. "Just because all stockholders do not see the value to the community of some causes does not mean that they should not be funded," wrote Sharon M. Gilbert, executive director of the Caring Place, which assists victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse in Valparaiso, Ind.
Sometimes, though, disclosure has allowed shareholders to police what they consider excesses in corporate largess. In 1988, for example, Armand Hammer, the chairman of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, announced that he intended to build a museum to house his well-known art collections. Only later did Occidental shareholders learn that tens of millions of company dollars were used for construction. Many shareholders filed lawsuits against the company, which Occidental settled in part by placing a cap on contributions to any charities affiliated with Dr. Hammer.
Nor was that the only case of shareholders objecting to a corporation's donations. In 1995, Merck & Company announced that it would donate $20 million over 10 years to the United Negro College Fund, of which Merck's chairman continues to be a director. The next year, Alan M. Rice, a shareholder, placed a resolution in Merck's proxy that would have required shareholder approval for any donation over about $25,000. The measure won little support.
"This has nothing to do with the merits of the college fund, nor is it about race," Mr. Rice, a full-time investor, said in a telephone interview. "But it has everything to do with propriety of making such a sizable donation to a single charity."
Many companies wrote to the S.E.C. that legislation was unnecessary because they provided detailed information about their contributions to anyone who requested it. Some companies even publicize the data in annual reports or on the Internet. The J. C. Penney Company, for example, provides details in its 1996 annual report about the $30.7 million it gave away that year. And Chevron publishes information on its Web site about the approximately $25 million it donates each year. Both companies said that shareholders had never complained about their donations.
But such policies are far from universal. Some investors complained to the S.E.C. that all their efforts to get such information were turned away. One company mentioned in those letters, Delmarva Power and Light, which is now known as Connectiv, said it was not the utility's policy to disclose the data.
"While you have to respect the interests of one investor, we do have a board of directors that looks after the interests of all the shareholders," said Michael Ratchford, a spokesman for the utility.
Although they were in the minority, some companies and charities did write in support of Representative Gillmor's bill. The American Red Cross, for example, said that it supported disclosure as a matter of public policy. The National Society of Fund Raising Executives said disclosure would improve the credibility of the philanthropic community, which has been hurt in recent years by scandals involving top executives of organizations like the United Way of America.
Strong support for disclosure came from Warren E. Buffett, the investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, who wrote that he thinks managers "should be held accountable for the charitable dollars they dispense."
Berkshire Hathaway is unusual in that it lets shareholders pick which charities will receive their respective share of the money the company sets aside each year for donations.
Representative Gillmor introduced a second bill last year that would give shareholders a similar right at all publicly held companies, though he acknowledged that such a system might be unworkable for most large companies, which typically have far more shareholders than Berkshire Hathaway. Indeed, in their comments to the S.E.C., most corporations were sharply critical of that proposal.
In any event, Representative Gillmor, who is vice chairman of the House Commerce Committee, said his real focus was on disclosure. "I don't think companies get much sympathy if they can't defend what they're doing with shareholders' money," he said. His disclosure bill is co-sponsored by Representative Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio, and Representative Thomas Manton, Democrat of New York.
Part of the controversy surrounding the bill stems from its intentionally vague wording, which raises the possibility that donations to "local charities" could be exempted from disclosure but fails to precisely define a local charity. Nor does the bill set a minimum for the size of donations that would have to be disclosed.
The S.E.C. is considering such details now and is expected to file a report to Congress later this year. Although the official comment period on the disclosure bill has ended, the S.E.C. said it was still accepting letters on the issue.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Tracking the '68 Parallels Of King and Kennedy

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
The public journeys of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy come together tomorrow in "Assassinated: The Last Days of King and Kennedy." As the unequaled black leader and the untested white politician moved toward their early deaths, they found themselves united in the causes of peace, racial equality and economic uplift.
The men emerge through the memories of those who worked with them, were inspired by them, loved them. They may not be the coolest historians, but for millions of others, too, King and Kennedy represented a hope of reconciliation even as the nation seemed to be unraveling. This first documentary by Oliver Stone's new television production team establishes their place amid the drama and turmoil of the times. (Rest easy; despite Mr. Stone's reputation, no conspiracy theories are promoted in these two hours.) 
 Moving back and forth between King and Kennedy, "Assassination" brings back the events that shook the nation and transformed the men: the murder of John F. Kennedy; the war in Vietnam; the race riots. As the war kept escalating, King divided the civil rights movement by attacking the Johnson Administration. Robert Kennedy found his cause in visits to impoverished sections of Mississippi.
From family members, we get King's shifting moods of exhilaration at the victories of nonviolence and depression at mob riots, and Kennedy's energy and passion once he was caught up in a cause. If King was a prophet, Kennedy was a crusader. The young politician's calculations for entering the 1968 Democratic primaries are played down by these friendly observers; his aspirations to moral leadership are emphasized and perhaps exaggerated.
The documentary is particularly sharp at catching the perilous times, the high emotions, the craziness in the air. Both men knew the risks they courted in their public appearances. Warned of threats, Kennedy insisted on carrying on with his Presidential campaign. King's reflections turned to mortality; in a famous speech that only increases in power with the years, he tells his followers of seeing the promised land: "I may not get there with you."
In the program's inspiring ending, Kennedy is seen walking behind the mule wagon in the King funeral procession. A few weeks later, mourners are lined up along the 200-mile train route of his own last journey.
A mourner for both men says, "Suddenly within a few weeks the two bright lights that were shining in this country had gone out, and hell, we were in the dark."

HEADLINE: Oscar Awards to Get Their Own Theater

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, April 3

 BODY:
A permanent home for the Academy Awards show has been announced by Mayor Richard J. Riordan and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
The 3,300-seat theater, designed by the New York architect David Rockwell, is to be in the heart of Hollywood, on Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. It is part of a $350 million development project by the TrizecHahn Corporation that is to include restaurants and retail stores. Groundbreaking is scheduled for this summer, although the complex does not have all the permits it needs to go forward. Mayor Riordan said he hoped the new theater would be ready by 2001. 
 "I'm proud to welcome the Academy Awards back to their birthplace, he said on Thursday at a news conference at the Hollywood Roosevelt, where the academy had its first awards dinner on May 16, 1929. He added: "Hollywood is not just back. It's better."
Since their founding, the Academy Awards have had no permanent site, switching in recent years between the Shrine Auditorium, near the University of Southern California campus, in South-Central Los Angeles, and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in downtown Los Angeles. Academy officials said there was a possibility that the new theater would also be used for theatrical shows like Broadway musicals.
Mr. Rockwell's company, the Rockwell Group, is known for its entertainment architecture and the notion of architecture as theater. Clients have included Disney, Sony, Radio City Music Hall and the Bronx Zoo and restaurants like Nobu, Vong and the Monkey Bar.
The Hollywood Boulevard area, once glamorous, has been crumbling in recent years, resembling the Times Square area in the 1970's and 80's before its recent redevelopment. Los Angeles officials have pointed to $1 billion in planned development in Hollywood as part of the effort to revive the area. They say the Academy Awards theater is a further sign of that planned revival.
"This is a historic day, the beginning of a new era in Hollywood history," Robert Rehme, president of the academy, said shortly after the announcement.
Although more city approvals are needed, Mr. Riordan and Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents the area, said that they expected no major opposition.

HEADLINE: From the Ground Up in East New York

BYLINE: By Samuel G. Freedman; Samuel G. Freedman is the author of "Upon This Rock: The Miracles of a Black Church."

 BODY:
Nearly 20 years ago, a visiting mayor walked through the slums of Brooklyn's Brownsville neighborhood. The abandoned blocks along one main street, Blake Avenue, were lined with fields of scrub grass and saplings. Concrete blocks and plywood planks boarded up the few tenements along the fringes to keep out vandals, squatters and thugs. "I have seen," the mayor declared, "the beginning of the end of our civilization."
Those same streets today throb with life -- life restored by tidy row houses built under the Nehemiah program, which makes home ownership affordable for the teachers, parole officers, subway motormen, nurse's aides and other members of the nonwhite working and middle classes. Why, then, is Mayor Rudolph Giuliani preventing this urban renewal from spreading to other parts of New York? 
 The Nehemiah program has erected more than 2,700 homes in Brownsville, East New York and the South Bronx over the last 15 years -- with the foundation already laid on 300 more -- and it has done so with only a small proportion of public money. Religious organizations and socially aware banks have lent the entire $12 million construction fund.
So one might assume that Mr. Giuliani would gladly honor his own administration's commitment to spend $10 million on building sewers in the undeveloped Spring Creek area of East New York, which would allow the construction of 500 more Nehemiah homes. But Mr. Giuliani has cut the development of Spring Creek out of the budget, even though that $10 million, plus another $10 million already pledged by the city to subsidize construction, would have the potential to generate $46 million worth of private houses, which in turn could bring the city millions of dollars in property taxes.
Evidently, it matters little to Mr. Giuliani that the Nehemiah homes embody the values of religious belief and social conservatism -- ideals he espouses.
The Nehemiah program is run by local affiliates of the Industrial Areas Foundation, which since the days of its founder, Saul Alinsky, has been based in urban churches. To the consternation of more leftist community groups, the Alinsky organization embraces the virtues of piety, property and familial obligation. And a sizable share of Nehemiah homeowners have moved directly out of public housing, a symbol of the failures of big-government liberalism.
The Nehemiah program relies on the city and state only to provide subsidies and low-interest mortgages and to condemn and clear property. A Nehemiah home costs one-third less per square foot and uses a smaller public subsidy than houses built by the New York City Partnership, a much-ballyhooed nonprofit group.
The city government owes its citizens the rejuvenation of slums it played a part in creating. Not only the ravages of street crime and drug abuse turned Blake Avenue from a vital enclave of the working poor into a miserable ghetto. Changes in public policy in the 1960's meant that welfare families were dumped into a neighborhood already unsettled by sudden integration. In the 1970's, under the policy of "planned shrinkage," the city reduced municipal services, driving away decent families.
The Nehemiah program, supported by the administration of Edward Koch, helped return a measure of stability and social order to Blake Avenue and its like. In budgeting the $10 million that will allow ground to be broken in Spring Creek, Mayor Giuliani could continue this legacy and elevate New York's quality of life in a way that is literally and figuratively concrete.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow Crosses 9,000 for the First Time, Then Backs Away

BYLINE: By Bridge News 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average passed 9,000 points yesterday before retreating and ending slightly lower as investors took profits.
The Dow, which rose as high as 9,030.49, closed down 3.23 points, at 8,983.41. For the week, the Dow was up 2.1 percent. 
 Weighing on the Dow were Chevron, which dropped 1 1/2, to 8115/16 . Procter & Gamble fell 17/16 , to 88 1/8, and Eastman Kodak dropped 1 13/16, to 64 9/16 .
But broader market measures eked out small gains and finished at record highs. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.69 points, to 1,122.70, and the New York Stock Exchange composite gained 1.04, to 583.08. Although the gains in technology stocks were modest, the Nasdaq composite index, which is laden with technology issues, edged up 2.44, to a record 1,855.40.
The market opened modestly higher this morning, quickly gaining enough momentum to cross through the 9,000 milestone. But the Dow ran into some resistance.
"It looks like it's having some trouble with the 9,000 number," said Jim Benning, a trader at BT Brokerage. "I think it's just a question of someone seeing a round number and saying it's time to take some profits."
The stock market was bolstered by the March employment report, which suggested that the job market was cooling down. The data pointed to continued restrained inflation and steady interest rates.
The Labor Department reported that employers cut payrolls by 36,000 last month, the first decline since January 1996, and much less than the 235,000 gain that economists expected.
"We had pretty good economic news here this morning, and we're dealing with the psychological barrier of 9,000," said Bill Allyn, director of listed equity trading at Jefferies & Company in Short Hills, N.J. "We're going to get through it. I just think there's going to be some backing and filling before we do get through. There's no reason other than profit taking for it to be down."

Treasury Prices Surge
Treasury securities rallied sharply yesterday on news of the surprising drop in employment last month.
"The jobs report is likely to convert many Asian-slowdown disbelievers into ardent supporters of this view and ignite fresh hope that the central bank is not likely to even think of raising rates any time soon," said Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio.
Indeed, Mr. Chan said, Fed policy makers are now likely "to open debate on when, not if, they should consider lowering short-term rates."
The price of the 30-year bond rose 23/32 , to 104 23/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 5.79 percent, from 5.84 percent on Thursday -- the lowest since 5.79 percent on Feb. 17.
Jack Ablin, president of Barnett Capital Advisors Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla., said market concerns heading into the second quarter had been over the Asian crisis and wage pressures. "The issue the market needed to grapple with was whether the Asian crisis was going to be enough to help offset the wage and inflation pressures we were facing," he said. "To date, while the Asia situation is still there, the employment numbers today went a long way to alleviate those concerns."
Elsewhere in the market, in when-issued trading yesterday ahead of next week's $8 billion auction of 30-year inflation indexed bonds on Wednesday, the bonds were being offered at a price to yield 3.64 percent, down 3 basis points from the previous day. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

HEADLINE: U.N. Teams Find Nothing At Iraqi Sites

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 3

 BODY:
United Nations arms experts inspected each of the 1,058 buildings inside President Saddam Hussein's eight presidential compounds but found no prohibited material during eight days of searches, an American weapons inspector said today.
The inspectors, however, had not expected to find much at the sites and repeatedly said they wanted to set a precedent of entering sites that Iraq had long said were off limits as symbols of national sovereignty. 
 The visits, which began on March 26, were a key test of the accord between the United Nations and Iraq intended to "establish our right to unrestricted access," said Charles Duelfer, the deputy chairman of the United Nations Special Commission, which is charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
Iraq said the fact that nothing was found contradicted American and British accusations that the sites contained stockpiles of illegal weapons. It urged the Security Council to lift the sweeping United Nations sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
"What has been achieved is a triumph for the truth over falsehood," Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz was quoted as saying by the official Iraqi News Agency. "The visit has verified Iraq's credibility."
The work of the inspectors at other, less sensitive sites is far from over. Richard Butler, the chief arms inspector, has said Iraq still needs to provide more proof to back its claim that it has destroyed all of its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
Until the inspectors confirm that Iraq has destroyed or has dismantled all its long-range missiles and major weapons, the Security Council will not lift the economic sanctions.
The inspections began with a visit to the Radwaniyah palace in Baghdad. They continued in the north and south and ended in the capital with inspections on Wednesday and Thursday of the Sijood Palace and the Republican Palace, which serves as the seat of Government.
Most of the buildings were empty except for a few in the main Republican Palace compound, Mr. Duelfer said. There, inspectors came across furniture and office supplies, he said, but he declined to be more specific.
Mr. Duelfer also refused to speculate on why the buildings were bare. But Iraqi officials said many of the buildings were emptied months ago when tension rose over Iraq's refusal to grant access to the palaces and Iraq feared an attack on the sites.
The 71 United Nations arms monitors who took part in the survey had "access to every building that we wanted," Mr. Duelfer said.
The most sensitive site was the Republican Palace, a one-square-mile compound that houses Mr. Hussein's main office, overlooking the Tigris River.
The Iraqis opened parts of the compound only to Mr. Duelfer, two other senior arms experts and Jayantha Dhanapala, the leader of a diplomatic group monitoring the visits, Mr. Duelfer said.
High-ranking Iraqi officials, including Mr. Aziz, were present during most of the inspections, he added.
Under the agreement, reached on Feb. 23, Mr. Dhanapala's diplomatic group had to escort the inspectors, who spent about 10 hours at each site. Mr. Duelfer said their presence was essential to solving "a number of problems," but he did not elaborate.
The United Nations Secretary General's envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah, said that "some blips did occur" during the inspections, but that they were sorted out in the presence of the diplomats.
The diplomats are to leave Baghdad on Saturday after completing a report that Mr. Dhanapala will submit to Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York next week. The inspectors are also to leave on Saturday, and no date has been announced for future visits.
Mr. Butler is to present a progress report to the Council next week.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Rises (With an Asterisk)

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
After months in overdrive, the great American jobs engine seems suddenly to be idling.
In March, for the first time in more than two years, the economy added no new jobs, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Payrolls actually edged down by 36,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate, which had been at a 24-year low, ticked up from 4.6 percent, to 4.7 percent. The department also reported that February's stunning job gain was revised sharply downward. 
 Even though most economists were expecting job growth to moderate, the sharply different job market picture conveyed by yesterday's report caught them by complete surprise.
The Labor Department warned, however, that the report was somewhat suspect. Last month's dip in jobs -- the first since January 1996, when snowstorms shut down businesses in the Northeast -- may reflect the abnormal weather patterns of the last few months more than actual changes in the labor market. Unseasonable cold during the survey period last month, following unusually warm temperatures in January and February, may have skewed the seasonal adjustments the Labor Department makes to raw job survey figures.
Katherine Abraham, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said, "There's a lot in this report that you have to discount."
The jobs report nonetheless warmed the hearts of investors who welcome any sign that the labor market is finally cooling. The economy had been adding jobs at a pace of more than 300,000 a month, fanning fears that the economy was running out of workers and the Federal Reserve would move to raise interest rates.
Now, such threats seem more remote and stock and bond prices responded accordingly. Stocks finished mostly higher, while a rally in bonds pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury to 5.79 percent, the lowest since Feb. 17.
"It's further reason for the Fed to do what it does best: absolutely nothing," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's DRI.
On the other hand, few believe that the job market is cooling as abruptly as the Labor Department's data seemed to imply.
"This is nothing to worry about," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
Just as El Nino and unseasonably warm temperatures in January and February exaggerated the job market's strength in the winter, the unseasonable cold is probably exaggerating the weakness now.
"Large numbers of construction workers normally are laid off during the November-to-February period," Dr. Abraham said. "During the recent winter, however, fewer workers than normal were laid off. With so many construction jobs already filled, early spring hiring fell short of its usual pace."
Job growth averaged 205,000 jobs a month in the quarter ended March. That was not as strong as the 356,000 rate of last quarter of 1997, but it was still robust by any measure.
"We're still probably growing above trend," said President Clinton's chief economist, Janet L. Yellen. Like most private forecasters, she said, the Council of Economic Advisers expects job growth to be more moderate than last year. "As we go toward the end of the year we'll be looking at numbers more in the 100's," she said. "We've gotten a little spoiled." A pace of 125,000 new jobs or so a month would keep the jobless rate about where it is now.
The Labor Department reported that in March, after seasonal adjustment, 88,000 jobs were lost in construction, 43,000 in restaurants and 16,000 in temporary-help firms. Business tells a different story.
Mitchell Fromstein, head of Manpower Inc., the largest temporary-help service, confirmed this. "The demand for people is still very high at every level," he said. "We don't sense any downturn in our business."
Similarly, home building and office construction are still booming. "We've had more and more reports from builders that their big problem is finding qualified labor," said Michael Carliner at the National Association of Home Builders. "We have no inclination that there's been a decline in employment."
And while McDonald's recently announced that it would invest in labor-saving technology and Pepsi is spinning off its restaurant chains, help wanted signs are still much in evidence at drive-in counters around the country.
Indeed, the National Federation of Independent Business, which issued its monthly survey yesterday, still reports that the No. 1 problem facing small businesses is finding qualified workers. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents, a near record, said that they had job openings they could not fill.
The Labor Department reported strong job gains in computer and data processing, engineering and management services and financial services, which are benefiting from a boom in home buying and stock investing.
Manufacturing hiring remained surprisingly strong, suggesting that the Asian crisis has not yet made its full impact felt. Manufacturing employment, vulnerable to weakness in Asian markets and more intense competition from Asian imports, actually rose by 3,000 last month.
Total hours worked declined 0.7 percent from February. But, for the quarter, they were still 4.9 percent above the previous quarter's level. That suggests that economic growth in the first three months this year was fairly solid.
Despite the rise in unemployment, there were still classic signs of tightness in the labor market. Long-term unemployment -- defined as joblessness among those who are out of work for 27 weeks or longer -- was at its lowest since the current economic expansion began in 1991. And the average duration of unemployment declined sharply, from 7.2 weeks, to 6.8 weeks.
Hourly earnings rose 4 cents last month, to $12.63. But the previous month's increase, originally reported as 8 cents, was revised down to 6 cents. "Wages aren't accelerating as fast as was feared," Mr. Wyss said.

HEADLINE: Campaign Ad By Kennelly Stresses Schools

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 3

 BODY:
With education emerging as the pivotal issue in the state elections this year, United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, a Democrat running for governor, has made "Education comes first" the slogan of her campaign's first television commercial, which began appearing today.
The 60-second advertisement tries to define the candidate while focusing on an issue on which Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, appears to be vulnerable. With crime rates going down and the economy improving, education stands out as an issue that can benefit a challenger. 
 "I've taught my four children that education was the key to success," Mrs. Kennelly, who has served eight terms in the House, said in the ad. "I've spent a career working to improve education, and as your governor, I'll make our education system the model for the country."
Mr. Rowland's campaign disputed this image of Mrs. Kennelly. "Her sudden interest in education is very interesting given her lack of interest in the past," said Fergus P. Cullen, Mr. Rowland's deputy campaign manager. "In 16 years, Barbara Kennelly introduced not one piece of legislation having to deal with primary or secondary education."
But in a news release accompanying the text of the commercial, the Kennelly campaign described a record of efforts to improve education. It said that Mrs. Kennelly, 61, had worked to obtain more money for Head Start, lobbied for increased Internet access for classrooms and fought for President Clinton's effort to reduce class sizes in early grades.
Records from three Connecticut television stations showed that Mrs. Kennelly spent at least $81,700 to have the commercial televised through April 13. The amount would pay for roughly 50 spots, and it could increase in the next few days if the campaign elects to buy even more television time.
The broadcast of the commercial is another sign that the governor's race here remains competitive, one of the few such races this year in which a Republican incumbent faces a serious challenge. Although polls show Mr. Rowland with a substantial lead, his position is not as strong as those of Republican incumbents like Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, said Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter in Washington that handicaps races.
The commercial was a critical step for Mrs. Kennelly. Mr. Rowland began advertising about five months ago and has widened his lead since last fall, when he and Mrs. Kennelly were in a virtual dead heat in polls.
A Quinnipiac College poll of 1,014 Connecticut residents who said they were registered voters was released Wednesday, and it showed that 55 percent supported Mr. Rowland and 31 percent supported Mrs. Kennelly. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
The poll also found that about 4 of every 10 of those polled said they had not heard enough about Mrs. Kennelly to form an opinion. The ad was clearly intended to change that.
Mrs. Kennelly narrates the ad, talking about the need for smaller and safer classes, tougher academic standards, greater classroom access to the Internet and college scholarships for all students who graduate in the top fifth of their class.
The commercial makes no mention of Mr. Rowland.

HEADLINE: DEMOCRACY TO DESPOTISM: A special report.;
Nigeria, in Free Fall, Seethes Under General

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ABUJA, Nigeria

 BODY:
From the eerily calm streets of this newly created capital, a visitor might be excused for concluding that Nigeria's President, Gen. Sani Abacha, is a revered figure.
Army officers and office workers alike sport lapel pins bearing the likeness of the general, smiling benignly, but as always peering at the world from behind tinted glasses. Billboards proclaim "Abacha Is the Answer!" And a proliferation of street names, housing developments and public works projects carry the name of the President or his wife, Maryam. 
 Few Nigerians would openly contest this carefully created image of adulation, especially in this minutely policed town, where any conversation might be monitored, where plainclothes agents haunt every hotel and restaurant, and where crack troops are never more than a moment's call away.
But it takes little time to discover, in talks with dozens of Nigerians from the streets of Lagos to cities like Abuja and Enugu in central and southeastern Nigeria, that the people of this country, Africa's most populous, are seething with discontent.
"The generals seem to want to stay in power forever," said Adimabua Obafemi, an angry motorist in Lagos who had spent the night in his car waiting for gasoline because of an acute shortage in one of the world's largest oil-producing nations. "Some of us would gladly grant them that if they could point to one thing they have done for this country. All they have proven is that they know how to arrest people and to steal."
General Abacha, 54, seized power in 1993, at the head of the third successful army coup in which he had played a key role. His predecessor had annulled an election widely believed to be the most democratic vote ever organized in Nigeria. The general jailed the presumed winner, suspended the Constitution and declared a state of emergency. He pledged that he would hand over power to a civilian government, and even set a date to do so.
But he has violated that promise and is now poised to become the elected President in carefully scripted elections set for Aug. 1, running against two little known candidates who many Nigerians suspect were encouraged by the military to provide symbolic opposition.
He will win not because he is widely popular, Nigerians and diplomats say, but because he exercises absolute control through a reign of terror.
General Abacha has detained, jailed and on occasion executed most of the leading Nigerians who could form a credible opposition, including members of his own Government. Many prominent Nigerians, from journalists and Nobel Prize-winning authors to dignitaries of past governments, have been forced into exile.
He operates a 2,000-man personal security service that inspires deep fear. Nigerian rights groups charge that more people have been arrested in his four years in power than during five decades of British rule.
In the 1980's Nigeria was hailed as a model of African democracy and prosperity. But now it is a country in steep decline. Electricity and water supplies in most cities are unreliable at best. Unemployment, though difficult to measure, is sky-high, and inflation has reduced the purchasing power of most people to bare subsistence.
Nigerians who look back over a history dominated since independence by military rule often remark that there has never been a leader like General Abacha.
 Inaccessible even to his own ministers and senior army staff, the President rarely ventures out of his marbled official mansion, known as Aso Rock. He is said to work through the night and sleep much of the day, summoning officials only as he needs them.
Obsession with security to the point of paranoia is another watchword of General Abacha's rule. While Lagos, the bursting-at-the-seams former capital, remains a place of surprisingly outspoken criticism, Abuja is heavily guarded by soldiers and thoroughly policed by plainclothes agents.
To help guarantee his control, General Abacha commands his own parallel security service. These Special Bodyguards, who diplomats say were trained by North Korean and Libyan experts, fall outside the normal army chain of command, answering directly to the President and a single trusted aide, Maj. Hamza el-Mustapha.
"The thing that distinguishes Nigeria is the extent to which this is a military regime unlike any other," said Walter Carrington, until last year the United States Ambassador. "Abacha has less support than any previous military leader, but he manages to run things tightly."
 
A Precipitous Turn
Liberty and Riches Quickly Fell Apart
Beyond the artificial calm of Abuja, Nigerians say that by almost any measure, General Abacha's rule has been an unmitigated disaster for a country accustomed to thinking of itself as Africa's richest and most powerful nation.
Rebounding quickly from a devastating civil war that nearly broke up Nigeria in the late 1960's, in the space of 10 years the country became a confident and even boastful society eager to claim what its leaders liked to say was the rightful place on the international stage for the "world's largest black nation."
Of its own accord, Nigeria was experimenting with one of the most freewheeling versions of democracy in modern Africa. Nigerian arts were the envy of the continent. Its press was among the freest anywhere.
Nigerian diplomacy, strengthened by the nation's emergence as a leading oil producer, forcefully challenged the United States and Britain over issues like apartheid and support for guerrillas in Angola.
Nigeria in the oil boom of the 1970's had the 33d-highest per-capita income in the world, but by last year it slipped to the 13th-poorest nation, according to United Nations figures. At the same time, foreign diplomats and Nigerian critics of military rule say the top generals have siphoned off billions of dollars in oil revenue for personal profit.
In the late 1970's, the national currency, the naira, was worth twice as much as the dollar. Nowadays, it is worth about one cent. In business surveys, the country ranks as one of the most corrupt.
Nigeria's economic decline may have begun with the shoddy management and corruption of the democratic period, which lasted only from 1979 to 1983. But the country's free fall began in earnest under the generals who seized power promising to set things right.
With its large army, Nigeria still throws its weight around its immediate region, but its interventions in Liberia and Sierra Leone have been supported only grudgingly by neighbors, which shudder at the risk of a political breakup of Nigeria.
"It is not because we like what is going on in Nigeria that we try to be supportive," said one senior official in Ghana, Nigeria's closest friend in the region. "But if things start to fall apart in Nigeria, we and every other country in this region will be submerged with their people fleeing and their problems."
 
A Security State
Enemy List Reads Like a Who's Who
The list of supposed enemies who have been neutralized during General Abacha's rule reads like a Who's Who of distinguished Nigerians. In 1995, the President announced that he had uncovered a plot involving a past military President, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, and his Vice President, Gen. Shehu Musa Yar'Adua -- both long retired from the army. General Obasanjo is a respected figure who handed power over to a democratically elected government
Few foreign diplomats or well-informed Nigerians give any credence to the charges, but say General Abacha is haunted by the specter of a coup and is intolerant of anyone who could cast a shadow over him.
Starting with the imprisonment of the presumed winner of the country's 1993 elections, General Abacha's rule has been widely seen as the expression of hard-line northern military elite bent on maintaining its longtime hold on the country's politics.
General Obasanjo, a Yoruba who is the only southerner to have enjoyed executive power in the country, was a logical target, given his criticism of General Abacha's rule.
General Yar'Adua, however, was a member of a distinguished northern elite family, and even in retirement enjoyed the strong respect of northern officers and politicians. His fate was sealed when, as a leading member of General Abacha's Constitutional Conference, he pushed for an early handover date to civilian rule and for other restrictions on the President's power.
When he convened the conference in 1994, General Abacha pledged to the delegates, "We in the present Government in Nigeria are committed to ensuring that there is speedy and uninterrupted transition to a civil democratic rule in which we shall not be participants."
General Yar'Adua, who was the first prominent convention member to warn that these goals were being subverted, died in detention on Dec. 6. Human rights groups and newspaper reports here said he had repeatedly been refused medical care.
A leading human rights lobbyist, Beko Ransome-Kuti, was arrested in the same purported plot and remains in jail, as do several journalists, including Chris Anyanwu, who was convicted of being an accessory to the plotters after publishing articles debunking the idea of a conspiracy.
Meanwhile, the presumed winner of the elections of 1993, Moshood K. O. Abiola, remains in detention, largely shut off from visitors. Mr. Abiola's senior wife, Kudirat, who was an outspoken critic of the Government, was gunned down in Lagos in an execution-style killing in June 1996 that has gone unclaimed and unpunished.
A few months earlier another prominent critic of the Government, the noted playwright and community rights advocate, Ken Saro-Wiwa, was executed on charges stemming from his campaign to have Nigeria's huge oil revenues shared with the communities where petroleum is produced.
"Can you mention one constituency that Abacha has not offended?" asked Kola Ilori, an editor of the weekly Tell. "Abacha has desecrated the military, he has desecrated the office of head of state, he has mercilessly persecuted the south, but he has also deeply offended the north. It is hard to see how a man like that could safely retire."
Like many other newspapers and magazines, Tell is no longer published out of a conventional office, but instead holds clandestine editorial meetings in mosques, churches and taxis so its editors and reporters can avoid the constant threat of arrest.
On Dec. 21, General Abacha's purges reached his own innermost circle, with the arrest of his own second-in-command, Lieut. Gen. Oladipo Diya, the last senior southerner in the ruling military council, on charges of plotting a coup. Dozens of other officers, many of them Yoruba, were also held.
The extraordinary extent of the President's security apparatus became widely known for the first time when, reacting to widespread doubts that there was a coup plot at all, the Government arranged special screenings for selected traditional leaders, diplomats and journalists of scores of audio and video tapes painstakingly recorded over a period of weeks in which the alleged conspirators could be seen or heard discussing General Abacha's overthrow.
In one of the tapes, a sobbing General Diya can be seen begging, prostrate at General Abacha's feet, to spare his life.
By the opening of his trial, however, a composed General Diya was accusing his accusers of concocting a fake coup in order to entrap him and scores of other officers distrusted by General Abacha.
"This is a clear case of setup," General Diya said. "I am the target, and it is organized right from the top." From that point, the trial, which was recently concluded, was conducted behind closed-doors.
Those who have seen them say the tapes suggest that there may indeed have been a plot against General Abacha.
 
Manipulating the Vote
Opponents Survive Steamroller Tactics
Not even open fissures in his army appear to have deterred General Abacha from a program that seems determined to insure that the general succeeds himself in the elections this year. Throughout his rule, Nigeria has been under limited economic sanctions imposed by the United States and others, and an election victory could give him an argument to bolster his regime's legitimacy..
In addition to Abacha lapel pins, now considered obligatory for army officers, the President's campaign has begun distributing deeply discounted color television sets and sacks of rice emblazoned with the general's name and image.
New publications have begun weaving tales of the miraculous birth and heroic deeds of the President, while billboards bearing the slogan "Abacha Is the Answer" have been cropping up here and in other cities.
In recent weeks, well-funded groups sporting names like Youths Earnestly Ask for Abacha have begun organizing rallies seeking to create the appearance of a popular draft. One of the marches flopped badly, however, when after promising to turn out two million people with the help of hired buses and free food and drink, fewer than 100,000 people showed up in Abuja.
When opponents of General Abacha from a variety of political and rights groups began organizing a countermarch in Lagos the next week, the Government responded by banning "unauthorized" political gatherings and dispatched rapid-response police units known as "kill and go" squads to patrol the streets.
"We cannot guarantee the life of anybody who takes part in the Lagos rally," warned the Lagos State Police Commissioner, Abubakar Tsav. "We will deal with them crudely."
For now the steamroller tactics may have stopped people from demonstrating in the streets against the President. But they have already begun to generate opposition in other forms, many times from constituencies that collaborated with the general in the past.
An open letter to the President published in March by a number of citizens who had served as his ministers or associates reminded General Abacha of his own pledge to step down, warning that his candidacy would be "morally unjust and ethically dishonest."
Some previous ministers who have broken with General Abacha have been shot or otherwise attacked, and, as one of the signers explained, "our hope in being so blunt, was that there would be safety in numbers."
"All of Nigeria has become aware of the danger of a continued Abacha presidency," said Emma Ezeazu, a leader of a rights group known as Democratic Alternative, who arranged for friends to trail him to a secret meeting place with a journalist in case he was kidnapped. "All of Nigeria will have to come together to stop it."

HEADLINE: Clinton Warns Japan: Fire Up Economy to Stem a Decline

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
President Clinton warned in unusually explicit terms today that Japan must change course if it hopes to pull its economy out of a long-running decline that has worsened markedly in recent weeks.
He made his comments as evidence mounted that Japan, already languishing in recession, is headed into one of its worst downturns since the end of World War II, and the yen fell to a six-and-a-half-year low against the dollar. 
 While Mr. Clinton issued his warning to Japan in response to a question at a news conference, he was clearly ready to send a strong message, saying, "You simply can't stay with a strategy that is clearly not appropriate to the times and expect it to get the results that are needed for the country."
For months American officials have become increasingly specific about what they believe Japan must do, advocating huge tax cuts and old-fashioned deficit spending to spur an economy that many experts say could shrink by 2 percent this year.
The President was careful to praise Japan's embattled Prime Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, as "an able man," but he said there was clearly "an ongoing struggle" with an entrenched bureaucracy.
His comments stepped up the pressure from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and leaders from several of the world's biggest economic powers, who have said repeatedly that Japan's economic decline and its inability to absorb imports from neighboring countries threaten to hurt Asia's fragile recovery.
American officials have a more specific concern: the risk that a collapse of more major Japanese banks and securities dealers could imperil Wall Street, just as the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 9,000 for the first time.
That is hardly a foregone conclusion. But American companies are already reporting that their exports to Asia are dropping drastically, and a collapse in Japan, many say, could start a new round of economic contagion that could reach further than the crises in Southeast Asia and South Korea.
In London today at a summit meeting of Asian and European leaders, Mr. Hashimoto once again promised that that would not happen and that Japan would take strong action. But he offered no specifics. While he expressed some optimism that the rest of Asia had seen the worst of its troubles, he said Japan's economy was "probably facing some of the worst factors since World War II."
Administration officials made clear that Mr. Clinton's comments today had been carefully planned.
"He's been building to this for a long time," one senior official said. "We're looking at an economic actor, the world's second-largest economy, whose decisions affect the globe, and there is a growing sense that they are not up to the task, that they do not understand the gravity of the situation for Japan and the rest of the world. There is simply a loss of confidence."
On Thursday the chairman of Sony Corporation, Norio Ohga, warned that Japan's economy "is on the verge of collapsing," and compared Prime Minister Hashimoto to President Hoover on the eve of the 1929 stock market collapse.
But the sharp reactions in Japan's stock and currency markets seem to have been driven by two different events. The first was the end of the Japanese fiscal year on Tuesday. For days before that deadline, the Japanese Government was investing heavily in the country's stock market, trying to boost the price of stocks held by Japan's banks, which are burdened with hundreds of billions of dollars of bad debts.
The goal was to make year-end balance sheets appear far sounder than they really were, so banks would meet international requirements for lending around the world. But the stock prices never rose as far as Japanese officials had hoped, and as soon as the deadline passed, prices dropped steeply.
The second alarm came from Moody's Investors Service, one of the world's leading financial rating agencies, which issued an unusual warning about Japan today.
While Moody's did not drop the Japanese Government's triple-A rating, the highest it grants to any country, it altered its outlook to "negative." Although there is virtually no fear that Japan could default on its Government debt -- the country has hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves -- the warning made investors who fear rising bankruptcies extremely skittish.
The United States has been warning Japan to take far stronger economic action for more than 18 months now. A year ago, when Mr. Hashimoto visited the White House, he made a detailed economic presentation to Mr. Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and top economic officials, arguing that a 3 percent tax increase that Japan was imposing would not send the economy into a tailspin.
He was wrong. In November, Mr. Hashimoto admitted that the tax increase, which had been pressed by bureaucrats in Japan's Finance Ministry, had been a major mistake. But he has not moved to repeal the tax, and so far the economic programs he has announced to spur the economy have been a murky mixture of new and previously announced ones.
Japan's Ambassador to Washington, Kunihiko Saito, said today that he had no problem with the mounting pressure from Mr. Clinton. "We Japanese now realize that the old system that worked in the past doesn't work anymore," he said today. "We have to reform ourselves, and change our system." But, he added, "sometimes public statements can be counterproductive, and we have been asking U.S. officials to be careful in their public statements."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
What the World Needs Now

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
You can learn a lot about President Clinton's predicament by studying the news conferences he recently held with two other world leaders, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and President Nelson Mandela of South Africa.
The Blair-Clinton press conference was held a few weeks ago in the East Room of the White House. The contrast between the two men was most telling. Tony Blair was so relaxed. He was smart, articulate, assertive, with an obviously masterly grasp of a wide range of domestic and international issues. Mr. Clinton, by contrast, was edgy, tight, defensive, treating every question with all the relaxation of a man catching live grenades. 
 It was hard not to look at Mr. Blair and think: "There goes Bill Clinton -- without Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, Kathleen Willey, Whitewater, Travelgate . . ." That is, Tony Blair reminds us of the President Bill Clinton could have been, could have looked like, had he not been weighed down, scarred and wounded by so many self-inflicted moral gunshots.
Lord knows, Mr. Clinton has his political shortcomings. He has never had much feel for traditional, balance-of-power security issues. But he intuitively grasped, far better than any of his challengers, the issues involved in the great transition we're now in from the industrial age to the information age to the global age, which is changing everyone's job, workplace and community. With his political skills, and the strong economic winds at his back, Mr. Clinton could have been spending all his time, energy and the peace dividend retooling the New Deal welfare state into one fully designed for this new era. He could have been presiding over one of the most exciting and prosperous turning points in American history. Now, instead, he will be lucky to limp out his term. It's hard to use the bully pulpit from the witness stand.
Still, if Tony Blair reminded us who Mr. Clinton could have been, Nelson Mandela reminded us who Mr. Clinton still needs to be: President of the United States. As the South African leader said, in gently chiding Mr. Clinton at their meeting in Cape Town to reach out to America's foes, "The United States, as the leader of the world, should set an example to all of us to help eliminating tensions" by saying to its enemies, "let's sit down and talk peace."
Whether or not one agrees with Mr. Mandela about the wisdom of the U.S. reaching out to Libya or Iran, his basic point is indisputable. The U.S. President today is, in many ways, the President of the world. At a time when most members of Congress don't even hold passports, when many senators really did learn their foreign affairs at the International House of Pancakes, and when the Republican Party has no foreign-policy vision or leadership whatsoever, there is a foreign-policy vacuum in America. In that context, strong Presidential direction is vital -- not only for U.S. interests, but for world stability. Nothing important happens today without U.S. leadership.
Whatever his personal flaws, the President still has the ability to make things better for a lot of people. But if Mr. Clinton doesn't assert U.S. leadership -- in assisting China in its transition from Communism, in expanding Nafta, in advancing the Arab-Israeli peace process, in bolstering reform in Russia, in increasing funding for the I.M.F., in supporting the U.N. and in taking up Mr. Mandela's challenge (but in a more subtle way), by sorting out which of the formerly oppressed nations really merit a U.S. handshake (Cuba) and which are just evil meddlers who merit a fist (Iraq) -- no one else will.
On a lot of foreign-policy issues, Mr. Clinton has the right instincts. But those who deal with him regularly say he clearly is not focused -- even with Paula Jones out of the way. And who can blame him? If I were accused of everything he still is, I would be hiding in the closet. Though Mr. Clinton is not hiding, the affair surrounding his affairs has clearly produced a tentativeness, as in: "If I push expansion of Nafta to Chile, will Democrats in Congress abandon me? If I push hard on the peace process, will American Jews abandon me? If I bomb Iraq, will I squander my approval ratings when I need them the most?"
Bill Clinton can't now remake himself as a fresh young messenger. But as President, he's still the only one who can carry the message of America into the world. It may be too late for him to inspire, but it's not too late for him to lead.

HEADLINE: Clinton Signals Showdown With G.O.P. Over Budget

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
Eager to shift the spotlight from Paula Corbin Jones back to the business of government, President Clinton today lambasted the Republican Senate budget proposal and warned tobacco companies to go along with a proposed settlement.
Tired but buoyant in his first day back at the Oval Office after 12 days in Africa, Mr. Clinton immediately assembled his economic team in the White House Rose Garden this morning and signaled an election-year showdown with Congressional Republicans over the budget for the 1999 fiscal year. While clearly emboldened by a Federal judge's dismissal of Ms. Jones's sexual misconduct lawsuit on Wednesday, the President vowed not to be distracted by such matters, saying, "I am going on with my business." 
 Instead, Mr. Clinton castigated Senate Republicans for approving a $1.73 trillion spending plan on Thursday night that calls for modest tax cuts and excludes virtually all of the President's proposals for new spending. And Mr. Clinton scolded members of the House for passing a six-year, $217 billion transportation bill packed with projects for almost every Congressional district.
"I am very concerned that the budget plan now working its way through the Senate will squeeze out critical investments in education and children," he said.
"I'm also determined that highway spending, though it is quite important and though our budget provides for a very impressive increase in investment in highways and mass transit, must be within the balanced budget and not crowd out critical investments in education, child care, health care or threaten our budget discipline."
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, dismissed the President's comments, asserting: "We have our priorities, he has his priorities. Education is a high priority for us." Asserting that it was Republicans, not Mr. Clinton, who sought more money for education training, Senator Lott said, "He needs to check his figures before he starts complaining."
Moving from one domestic priority to another, the President called on tobacco companies to go along with the bill that was approved this week by the Senate Commerce Committee, even though it was tougher on the companies than the proposed settlement they agreed to last summer.
"I am determined to seize this historic opportunity to pass bipartisan legislation to protect our children from the dangers of tobacco," Mr. Clinton said. "This Congress can be the Congress that saves millions of children's lives."
The cigarette companies, he said, need to "reverse the record of the past, to try to put this unforgivable chapter behind them."
Mr. Lott, meanwhile, said that if the tobacco settlement did not reach the Senate floor by June 1, "it's going to be pretty hard" to bring it to a vote this year. "I'm not saying it's impossible," the Senator said. "But I think that the best time to do it would be before we go out for the Memorial Day recess."
Mr. Clinton was unusually jaunty at his White House homecoming event. Trying to put the best face on figures showing a slight rise in unemployment, made public shortly before his Rose Garden appearance, he said, "While there will be ups and downs, our economy continues to be one of the strongest in history."
White House officials said today's appearance was the prelude to a number of events next week -- on such diverse issues as Social Security, crime and school construction -- to showcase the President's domestic agenda and turn the focus from allegations about sex and cover-up at the White House.
"The American people want us to use this sunlit moment not to sit back and enjoy, but to act," Mr. Clinton said firmly. "We were hired by the American people to act."
Questioned about Monica S. Lewinsky, the former White House intern suspected of having a sexual relationship with Mr. Clinton, he said: "I am not going to comment on that. I am going to try to do what the Supreme Court said I should do, which is not to be in any way deterred by this."
The President was in such high spirits that he teased Vice President Al Gore, who turned 50 while Mr. Clinton was in Africa.
"I hope all of you noticed the increased gravity and maturity of his aura," Mr. Clinton said. "I personally am greatly relieved. Not long before he turned 50, as I told him when I called him, an elderly lady came up to me and said, 'I think you and that young man are doing such a good job.' And it's nice to have a middle-aged team now at the White House."
Soon after the event, the President took an early slide and went golfing with his wife's brothers, Hugh and Tony Rodham.

HEADLINE: China Arrests Another Prominent Democracy Advocate

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Saturday, April 4

 BODY:
One of the most outspoken democracy advocates remaining in China was arrested at his home in southern Beijing early on Friday morning and held for more than 20 hours before he was released this morning with a warning to restrain his activities.
The detention of the dissident, Xu Wenli, 54, came just two days after American officials said China had agreed to release another dissident, Wang Dan, and during a period in which Washington has cited several small signs of progress by China on human rights issues, including the release last fall of another important prisoner, Wei Jingsheng. 
 Speaking to reporters by telephone from his Beijing home this morning, Mr. Xu said the police had not accused him of any wrongdoing. "They clearly warned me not to cross the line, for instance telling me not to publish my materials without first seeking approval," Mr. Xu told Reuters.
Mr. Xu, who has recently made public calls for free labor unions and an independent human rights monitor in China, was detained by agents of the Public Security Bureau who rifled his home and took his computer, fax machine, copier and political books, his wife, He Xintong, said. His belongings were not returned today.
"They said he has been engaged in illegal activities," Ms. He said in a telephone interview.
While Mr. Wei's release and other developments emboldened dissidents like Mr. Xu to speak out, those who did have often been harassed by the police, and several have been jailed. Mr. Xu spent 12 years in prison, from 1981 to 1993, for his role in the Democracy Wall movement of the late 1970's, in which large wall posters were put up in central Beijing criticizing the Government and calling for political freedom.
The movement was briefly tolerated, then suppressed.
American officials preparing for President Clinton's visit to Beijing in late June have taken steps to support what they describe as China's progress on human rights. Most notably, at an annual United Nations meeting in Geneva last month the United States agreed to drop sponsorship of a resolution condemning China's human rights performance.
The plan to release Mr. Wang, a student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations, into exile for medical reasons was part of that agreement. He is serving an 11-year prison sentence for subversion.
Among the signs of progress the United States cited were China's announcement that it would sign a United Nations covenant on civil and political rights, and its apparent tolerance of more "open letters" from scores of democracy advocates here that are generally faxed abroad for distribution to the news media.
But some crucial elements of the Chinese system remain unchanged. The security forces can still arrest anyone considered a threat to Communist Party rule at any time and imprison them for up to three years without trial.
Mr. Xu had issued strong protests recently about the sentencing of Yang Qinheng, 44, an engineer in Shanghai, to three years in a labor camp. He was accused of "disturbing public order" for writing a public letter to national legislators about the treatment of laid-off workers.
Mr. Xu and another veteran of the Democracy Wall movement, Qin Yongmin, from Wuhan, in central China, have led a small movement here to hold China to the spirit of the United Nations human rights covenants that China says it will adopt.
This winter, noting that China had signed the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights, which calls for free labor unions, Mr. Xu, Mr. Qin and several others inside and outside China started publicizing the covenant through the Internet and calling on the Government to allow independent unions. Currently, the only legal workers' organizations are run by the Communist Party.
Mr. Qin has since defied a warning from security officials that he should leave China, and last weekend he was held for questioning overnight.
Last month China said it planned to sign another international covenant on civil and political rights, which calls for freedom of assembly and speech. Mr. Xu soon issued his own request for permission to form an independent human rights group to monitor compliance. China has not said when it will sign and ratify the accord on civil and political rights, and has said it will file reservations in areas where the covenant is inconsistent with Chinese law.
In a recent interview, Mr. Xu said that after so many years of political activity, he felt he had a "special feeling" for when it was safe to speak out. He said that in the interval between President Jiang Zemin's visit to Washington last fall and the expected Clinton visit to Beijing this summer, "things seem to be a little looser." Asked about the plan of some exiles to form a clandestine political party inside China, Mr. Xu said: "I don't approve of secret organizations. Democracy should be open: you should let your opponent know what you are doing."

HEADLINE: Astoria Financial to Buy Long Island Bank in $1.8 Billion Deal

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Seeking to expand its presence in the New York metropolitan region, the Astoria Financial Corporation has agreed to buy Long Island Bancorp Inc. in a $1.8 billion stock swap, a rich price that provides yet another barometer of how eager banks of all sizes are to merge.
The acquisition would give Astoria Financial, the holding company for the Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, $16.6 billion in assets, making it the second-largest savings institution in New York State, behind Dime Bancorp Inc. and ahead of the Greenpoint Financial Corporation. 
 In terms of market share in affluent and densely populated Long Island, the transaction would make Astoria Financial the second-largest bank in Nassau County and the fourth largest in Suffolk County, according to SNL Securities, a research firm in Charlottesville, Va.
The leading bank in Nassau County is the Chase Manhattan Corporation, with 13 percent of the market. In Suffolk County, the leader is Fleet Financial Group, with 20 percent of the market.
George L. Engelke, Astoria's chief executive, said the bank planned to increase its focus on "providing banking and home mortgage expertise to better serve the financial needs of low-to-moderate-income families and individuals."
Astoria, based in Lake Success, N.Y., said that the merger would lead to layoffs but that it had not yet determined how many jobs would be lost.
Analysts expect the agreement to touch off a new round of consolidation among savings banks in the New York region as the industry struggles to compete with more aggressive retail banks like Chase and Citicorp.
"It really sends a signal that in order to compete you have to be larger and have economies of scale," said Martin Friedman, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Company.
Some unusual jockeying for Long Island Bancorp, the Melville, N.Y., parent of the Long Island Savings Bank, preceded yesterday's agreement. North Fork Bancorp, also of Melville, sent a letter to Long Island Bancorp's board on Thursday offering to pay about $74 a share for the bank, higher than the $69.30 a share offered by Astoria Financial.
North Fork, which lost out to Astoria last year in a bid for the Greater New York Savings Bank, declined to comment on its offer. Long Island Bancorp did not return phone calls seeking comment on why the higher offer was rebuffed.
North Fork owns about 4.6 percent of Long Island Bancorp stock, and North Fork's chief executive, John A. Kanas, said "it was under study" whether his bank would contest the merger.
Mr. Kanas is known as a determined cost-cutter, a reputation that has not sat well with some banks, like Greater New York Savings, that have avoided merging with North Fork.
It was not clear whether Mr. Kanas's cost-cutting proclivities played a role in scuttling his overtures toward Long Island Bancorp.
The battle to take over Long Island Bancorp began in mid-February when North Fork asked the New York Federal Reserve to permit it to raise its stake in the bank to 9.9 percent, a clear sign that it wanted to play a more significant role in the bank's future.
For now, however, it appears that Astoria Financial will take over Long Island Bancorp. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter.

HEADLINE: Stuyvesant Needs Equal Admissions Policy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The most disturbing thing about your April 2 front-page article on three students who tried to get into Stuyvesant High School is not the fact that the Asian and white students passed while the black student did not. It is the fact that the two students who passed paid $500 to $700 for preparatory courses while the student who received free preparation from the Board of Education did not. 
 Maybe Stuyvesant and the other elite public high schools need to change their system to be more accommodating to people with different cultural and economic backgrounds.

Class Struggle
 What's Wrong (and Right) With America's Best Public High Schools.
 By Jay Mathews.
 312 pp. New York:
 Times Books/Random House. $25. 
 There's a wide achievement gap between public school students in middle-class communities and those in poor urban neighborhoods. Many Americans believe that inner-city schools fail to bring out the best in disadvantaged youth because of bureaucracy, lack of resources, inadequate curriculums or low expectations. Others argue that students' learning potential is largely determined by their parents' child-rearing practices, education and socioeconomic background, and that schools have little impact. The debate has largely centered on the performance of the nation's worst schools, but in "Class Struggle," a Washington Post reporter, Jay Mathews, approaches the subject from an entirely different angle: he looks at "elite" suburban high schools -- "brain farms" in places like Scarsdale, N.Y., New Trier Township, outside Chicago, and Beverly Hills, Calif.
Mathews can't quite decide if nature or nurture is responsible for these schools' success but his ambivalence is just as well. He has provided rich reporting about the texture of the nation's suburban systems, detail that will be news even to many well-informed readers. Although these schools are known for their challenging courses, ambitious academic projects, advanced placement classes and their high admission rates to Ivy League or comparable liberal arts colleges, less publicized are their not-so-successful students, warehoused in classes like "photography" or basic math, who are bound for lower-middle-class jobs upon graduation, or at best junior college.
These young people, Mathews insists, would do better if only the schools demanded more of them. Yet any attempts by progressive educators to integrate them into a more demanding program is met with fierce resistance from administrators. They are accountable primarily to school boards representing upper-middle-class parents who block any move they believe (wrongly, Mathews argues) will dilute the college preparation programs for their successful progeny. Indeed, many of these school officials see their roles as "gatekeepers," who must exclude youngsters with lesser destinies from honors programs. Mathews estimates that each year nationwide, 100,000 students who could thrive, given the opportunity, are either denied admission to advance placement courses or discouraged from enrolling because schools are unwilling to take chances on those whose backgrounds and records don't guarantee success.
He makes a straightforward argument for "detracking" at the top, giving an honors curriculum to all students who can be persuaded to sign up for it. He devotes considerable attention and praise to a controversial multidisciplinary curriculum for the ninth grade at Mamaroneck High School, outside New York City, where "honors" students excel by the strengths of their research projects while remaining integrated with their less accomplished peers, who are also challenged to pursue project-based research. And Mathews cannot disguise his disappointment in a compromise -- worked out with some parents who feared their Ivy League-bound offspring might be insufficiently challenged if thrown together with regular students -- to retain a small and selective honors class for those who refused to be part of the new program.
In a previous book, Mathews profiled Jaime Escalante (the model for the character played by Edward James Olmos in the movie "Stand and Deliver"), who led a surprising number of Mexican immigrant youths in a poor East Los Angeles high school to passing scores on the College Board's Advanced Placement calculus test. In the current book, he argues that Escalante's achievement is attainable in far more schools than most Americans believe. Mathews has painstakingly compiled a "challenge index" of the public high schools in the United States that administer at least one advanced placement test per graduating senior. (Because many elite students take this test in more than one subject, a school's place on the index does not necessarily mean that each of its students has access to a high quality curriculum, but Mathews's list is a first approximation of such an indicator.) On the list are not only predictable upper-middle-class suburban high schools, but also Newman Smith High School in Carrolton, Tex., which alone accounts for 10 percent of black students in the entire state who pass the advanced placement calculus test, and several inner-city schools that drill their advance-placement students "as if they were football teams preparing for the homecoming game."
But Mathews's reporting also suggests that there is more to the story than the failure of public schools to challenge more students. He claims that it is "difficult to justify pedagogical segregation in elite schools where there are no significant differences in the family backgrounds of the lower-track and upper-track children," but his narrative reveals that things are not so neat. In Mamaroneck, for example, a disproportionate number of students in the "dumbed down" courses come from a low-income neighborhood known as the Flats, where parents have working-class jobs. And not surprisingly, a disproportionate number of students in the honors program come from families in which college-educated professional parents with six-figure incomes consider their real estate taxes and big mortgages the equivalent of private tuition, helping to assure their children's admission to Ivy League schools.
Mathews argues forcefully that we can do a better job of making high levels of academic achievement accessible to even the most disadvantaged students, fulfilling, for at least some of them, the dream of education as an engine of social mobility. But then he jumps to the conclusion that we should make four-year college degrees a reality for all students.
Yet no school with a working-class enrollment has succeeded in this goal for all or even for most of its students. No matter how "detracked" our high schools become, differences in family ambition and comfort will still result in different average achievement for rich and poor children. Contemporary education debates often assume that, if only schools did it right, they could bequeath to us a classless society. Mathews shows how schools can get us closer to that goal, but unanswered is the question of exactly how much closer.

THE MINISTRY
 How Japan's Most Powerful Institution
 Endangers World Markets.
 By Peter Hartcher.
 310 pp. Boston:
 Harvard Business School Press. $24.95. 
 While we cannot express Schadenfreude in a single English word, Americans certainly know how to wallow in it when the talk turns to Asia's economic crisis. This is particularly true in the case of Japan, where stock market and land prices have collapsed, bad debts and bankruptcies have soared and growth has leveled off at near zero. American triumphalism has rarely had a larger following. "The Ministry: How Japan's Most Powerful Institution Endangers World Markets" gives more cause for that sort of perverse celebration.
Peter Hartcher is an Australian economic journalist who was in Japan just as the economic bubble burst in the early 1990's. His book's Grishamesque title masks a sober presentation of how Japan's elite Ministry of Finance bureaucrats bungled management of the world's second-largest economy.
Did they ever. By 1996, Moody's Investor Services gave Japanese banks an average rating of D, a grade usually reserved for third-world financial institutions. And today Japan's fiscal deficit is the highest among industrial democracies.
At one level, "The Ministry" is the well-known story of high-powered bureaucrats who "descend from heaven" to control the Japanese economy. There is nothing new here in the depictions of "administrative guidance" or the grooming of Tokyo University mandarins, but Hartcher's narrative unfolds inexorably. After beginning as a rather tired chronicle of familiar Japanese practices, it builds momentum through its often stunning accounts of betrayal of the public trust to become a searing indictment of Japanese bureaucrats lost in deep denial.
Hartcher provides a fairly intimate description of how the Ministry of Finance designed a macroeconomic machine that first inflated and then punctured Japan's economic bubble. He explains how Ministry policies encouraged imprudent behavior by insouciant firms convinced of their own insulation from market forces. The banks the Ministry supervised were allowed to collude in setting rates. The brokerage firms it regulated guaranteed the investments of large clients. Insurance companies were permitted to slice pension fund payouts.
Hartcher gives this giant shell game a human face. He tells of one particularly venal bubble surfer, Harunori Takahashi, whose personal connections got him a blank check for billions of dollars from an underregulated bank to build an empire of hotels, golf courses, personal jets and French paintings. Takahashi stands as the personification of Japan's collective excesses in the 1980's. Then there are Hartcher's accounts of Ministry bureaucrats bullying Singaporean and American stock exchange officials, refusing to report violations of United States law by Japanese firms operating in New York and openly threatening American Congressmen and the Secretary of the Treasury with economic warfare.
Its picture of greed and arrogance aside, Hartcher's story shows that laissez-faire never meant much in Japan. By his account, the Ministry of Finance has relentlessly and reflexively resisted market forces. Its bureaucrats, he says, are more comfortable with cartels than with competition; they prefer collusion and control. It has never been an article of Japanese faith to trust markets to deliver the greatest good for the greatest number.
But if economic management is at base a matter of ideas, the Ministry of Finance may have run out of them. In late 1996, with the London of Margaret Thatcher in mind, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced plans for a sweeping Big Bang liberalization to make Tokyo financial markets globally competitive by 2001. This may work, but skepticism surrounds any Japanese declaration of imminent reform, and many who understand the Ministry of Finance's ideas are anticipating a Big Whimper instead.
The Ministry has regularly substituted half measures for serious change. Its formal interventions have repeatedly morphed into cartel-based regulation. Hartcher coins an apt term: "virtual regulation." But he misses the larger point about Japan's economic ideology: bureaucrats at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and elsewhere, have been intervening and faking liberalization for just as long as bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance. Adam Smith's invisible hand has always been visible in Japan.
Hartcher's subtitle notwithstanding, he never seems quite sure where power resides in Japan. He presents the case for a powerful financial bureaucracy, but he also tells how politicians have moved to make the central bank more independent and to relocate some of the functions of the Ministry of Finance in the Prime Minister's office. His larger contribution is his insight into how the Ministry develops strategic plans and mobilizes political attacks, how its "guardians" protect their fiscal castle -- though if they were truly indomitable, they might have avoided the recent humiliating visit by prosecutors, who crossed the moat to arrest several of their number for bribery and force the resignation of both the Minister and the Vice Minister.
Hartcher's book works best for those who are willing to ignore an important part of his central thesis. For the finance mandarins cannot be as foolish as they are influential. They cannot be as incompetent as they are prescient. Hartcher concludes that they have lost their way. He might have done better to recognize that they remain on the same path they have always sure-footedly trodden, but that this path is currently leading them into uncharted and dangerous territory. Nonetheless, it is best to hold the Schadenfreude for now. These "guardians" are more resourceful than they are corrupt.

False Hopes
 Why America's Quest for Perfect Health Is a Recipe for Failure.
 By Daniel Callahan.
 330 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $24. 
 Daniel Callahan's analysis of the American health care crisis is uncannily timely. Precisely 200 years ago, Thomas Malthus, the first great modern prophet against progress, exploded human perfectibility as an impossible dream. Against the French Revolution's utopian hope that a free and fair society would infinitely improve and prolong human life, he countered that rising living standards would lead to population growth, which would inevitably breed new poverty. No escape was possible from the Malthusian trap. Malthus turned out to be wrong, and mistakes like his arouse suspicions against doom-mongers: maybe they don't actually want progress, or perhaps they suffer from gut misanthropy.
 Callahan would, I am sure, hate to be linked with such Jeremiahs, but "False Hopes" certainly pours cold water on expectations of ever-improving health. Lethal epidemic diseases are back with a vengeance: not just AIDS and superbugs but tuberculosis and pneumonia. What is more, it is unlikely that the foreseeable future will bring major victories in the struggles against cancer, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other chronic killers. Despite past successes and present cheerleaders, there are thus, he contends, no good biomedical grounds for anticipating dramatic increases in longevity soon.
Of course, high-tech procedures save lives, but mostly they don't actually cure diseases. And "Band-Aid" medicine is always inordinately expensive. In 1970, the United States was channeling a little more than 7 percent of its gross national product into health care; the figure has leapt to nearly 14 percent. Given no clear correlation between health and health care spending, before it doubles again, throttling other sorts of vital social investment, isn't it time to say enough is enough?
Writing as a philosopher, Callahan maintains that the root of the problem lies in mistaken mentalities: healthy perfectionism, the technological imperative, the Promethean drive to conquer death. He calls us back to basics. Since we all die sometime, it makes sense to map out limits. Today's average life span, already exceeding the biblical threescore years and ten, is quite enough for us to accomplish our reasonable life wishes. Hence our first priority should be to insure that as many citizens as possible make it to that age threshold in good health. And the best way to secure that, given limited funds and scarce medical resources, is to turn our attention from late-stage interventions to prevention, above all to public health in its widest sense (e.g., campaigns against smoking) and to personal responsibility (prudent life styles).
If people are urged, financially induced and occasionally even forced to lead healthier lives, no crippling increases will be needed in the prosperous societies of the West to secure for most of them long, healthy lives. Callahan, the director of international programs at the Hastings Center, questions the need for the huge outlays on research called for by scientists and by medical interests and fueled by the logic of "healthism" and competition (which in medicine, at least, has always served to increase, not pare, costs). In place of such a spiral of demands and dollars, he proposes what he terms -- by analogy with environmentalist thinking -- a "sustainable" health policy, one that would be both equitable and efficient.
FOR someone who lives in the Old World, as I do, it is easy to cry "Amen" to Callahan's prayer. A European cannot help noticing that the United States sinks almost twice as much of its G.N.P. into health as most Western European nations. While this may betoken a touching commitment to well-being, it doesn't result in a significantly healthier nation. The populations of the Netherlands and Scandinavia live longer, and most European states have notably better neonatal mortality rates. Money may buy health for some, but it doesn't look from this side of the ocean as if Americans at large are getting value for money.
Callahan gives qualified approval to European health care, with its rationale of a centrally directed equitable provision of basic health for all. He expresses the fear that the philosophy of welfare states is being eroded by fiscal pressures and political change. He need not worry too much. Even Margaret Thatcher, that great worshiper of Reaganomics, recognized it would be political suicide to dismantle the National Health Service; and it is significant that in Tony Blair's Britain, even financial stringency and growing waiting lists result not in calls for privatization but in rallying round the existing system.
"False Hopes" offers a voice of sanity, but for all its persuasive reasoning, it is somewhat disappointing. It weakens its argument by being needlessly silent about costs. There's not a table or a graph in the whole volume, and scarcely a single hard-cash sum is mentioned. How much money actually goes to tobacco advertising, antismoking education and terminal care for lung cancer? Money talks, and balance sheets would surely strengthen Callahan's case. And far too little is said on how to bring change about. As we are reminded several times, many key players seemed to want reform in the early 90's, yet Bill Clinton's much-vaunted schemes came to nothing -- and since then the tally of the uninsured has risen from more than 36 million to 41 million. So what is needed? A truly gigantic crisis -- or an act of public will far greater than Clinton could command? Unless the practical politics of reform are addressed, all else will indeed remain yet another bubble of well-meaning false hopes.
All too often exposes just create fresh anxieties, giving another twist to the macabre merry-go-round of panic and futile medicine. Callahan's forte lies in soberly addressing how much health we can reasonably expect to buy. Here he squarely faces a fact of life pointed out years ago by the English politician Enoch Powell: "There is virtually no limit to the amount of health care an individual is capable of absorbing."
Callahan is no Luddite, no professional pessimist in the Malthusian mode. Negotiating sensible limits is central to his plea for sustainable medicine. He talks straight about priorities. He writes with clarity and humanity. He deserves a hearing.

 BODY:

TURNING STONES: My Days and Nights With Children at Risk
By Marc Parent. Fawcett Columbine, $13.95.
The author is a former caseworker for Emergency Children's Services in New York, the agency that responds to reports of suspected abuse. His memoir reveals how overburdened the system is, and how the best intentions do not always save the helpless. "The only weapon we have against failing our children is consciousness," Kathryn Harrison wrote here in 1996. This book "is an admirable step toward" it.
 
AMERICAN PASTORAL
By Philip Roth. Vintage International, $14.
The tale is told by Nathan Zuckerman, Roth's recurring fictional spokesman and an unreliable narrator at best. But it is the kind of story that could easily be true. The subject is Swede Levov, Zuckerman's former high school classmate, a man so blessed with good fortune that God seems to have been tempted to wreak horrible revenge. Swede's undoing is his only child, Merry, who as a teen-ager in 1968 takes part in a terrorist bombing that kills a man and ruins the life her parents had built. Selected as one of the best books of 1997 by the editors of the Book Review, the novel offers a "mixture of rage and elegy," Michael Wood said in these pages. "You have only to pause over the prose to feel how beautifully it is elaborated." The same publisher has also reissued Roth's first novel, LETTING GO ($15), which explores the life of a young Korean War veteran and his efforts to connect emotionally, especially with the troubled couple he befriends. In 1962 our reviewer, Arthur Mizener, called it "a powerful book as well as an often brilliantly perceptive one."
 
LIFE ON THE LINE
By Faye Wattleton. Ballantine, $14.95.
In her autobiography, the former president of Planned Parenthood, the daughter of a fundamentalist minister, reflects on her struggles to maintain the rights to birth control and abortion. In 1996 our reviewer, Samuel G. Freedman, said, "The strongest pages . . . show Wattleton's internal campaign to reshape Planned Parenthood." Another outspoken advocate gives her history in JOYCELYN ELDERS, M.D.: From Sharecropper's Daughter to Surgeon General of the United States of America, by Joycelyn Elders and David Chanoff (Avon, $13). Elders relates her journey from an Arkansas farm to the Government with "appealing humility," Freedman wrote in the same review.
 
LOVE WARPS THE MIND A LITTLE
By John Dufresne. Plume, $12.95.
Lafayette (Laf) Proulx, the feckless narrator, has just left his job and his wife, hoping to succeed at writing fiction. But after his girlfriend is told she has cancer, Laf learns the real power and limits of love and the imagination. This is a "funny, wise and powerful novel," Karen Karbo said in the Book Review last year.
 
DEAD SEASON: A Story of Murder and Revenge
By Alan Berlow. Vintage Departures, $14.
A correspondent for National Public Radio examines the circumstances surrounding the massacre of several members of a poor farm family on the Philippine island of Negros in the late 1980's. He concludes that the political and economic climate that led to the deaths is not so different from the one produced by the former government. This is "the kind of book . . . that so many reporters wished they could leave their daily routines to write," Seth Mydans wrote here in 1996.
 
ALLIGATOR DANCE: Stories
By Janet Peery. Picador USA, $12.
These tales take place mostly in the Southwest, often among blue-collar people who do not have a wide knowledge of the world but display a remarkable understanding of how they fit into it. In 1994 our reviewer, Dorothy Allison, called this book "one of the best first collections I have ever read."
 
MUSORGSKY: Eight Essays and an Epilogue
By Richard Taruskin. Princeton University, $19.95.
This book re-evaluates the career of Modest Mussorgsky (1839-81), finding in the Russian composer less a champion of the common people than an aspiring patrician. "It is unlikely that this year will see the publication of a more engrossing or a more valuable book about music," Donal Henahan wrote in these pages in 1993. Another important study of music, THE CLASSICAL STYLE: Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, by Charles Rosen (Norton, $17.95), has also been reissued. This expanded edition includes a new preface and a new chapter on Beethoven. It is "a book for which both musicians and music lovers should be grateful," Edward T. Cone said in the Book Review in 1971.
 
PEERLESS FLATS
By Esther Freud. Ecco, $14.
The scene is London in the 1970's, and Lisa, this novel's 16-year-old heroine, lives in public housing with her little half brother and irresponsible mother. But although Lisa seems to be following a path of total freedom, she soon realizes that there is something to be said for restraint. The author (yes, she's one of the Freuds) has a "deft and gentle comic touch," Zophia Smardz wrote here in 1993. Ecco has also reissued Freud's first novel, HIDEOUS KINKY ($13), whose plucky narrator is only 5. In Marrakesh with her sister and hippie mother, she survives the 60's with more sense than the adults. "The book evocatively renders the breathless static of vagabond life," Sarah Ferguson said in these pages in 1992. Laurel Graeber

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Shopping Spree

BYLINE: By DAVID HOCHMAN; DAVID HOCHMAN, a senior writer for Entertainment Weekly, lives in Los Angeles.

 BODY:
FOR a few minutes in January, it seemed to really matter that my right shoulder leans forward slightly more than my left. I was in Hong Kong, being fitted for a suit at W. W. Chan and Sons, one of the last of the city's great custom tailoring shops. As soon as I announced I wanted a suit made, it appeared that neither chicken flu nor crashing stock markets nor the return of the Chinese Government could keep these master craftsmen from working their measuring-tape magic. Suddenly, I was at the center of a storm of white chalk, straight pins and perspiration. Tang Yan Choi, a stout, tough-looking man, who -- like many of the best Chinese tailors -- claims Shanghai as his place of origin, tapped me in eight or nine places and grunted out something in Cantonese, while Raymond K. K. Kiang, the manager of the 41-year-old shop, took furious notes.
"That's his secret method," Mr. Kiang told me. "He reads your body." 
 Thirty-one measurements later, I was ready to receive Mr. Tang's assessment: my chest is full, my stomach is flat, I have a rounded right calf and I tend to wear my trousers two inches lower at the waist than I should. The hardest news to hear, though, was that my right shoulder stoops forward ever so slightly. "But we take care of that," Mr. Kiang promised. "That's why you've come to us."
If truth be told, I never really intended to come to Hong Kong at all. But when my girlfriend, Ruth Kennison, arrived home one December night ecstatic over a two-for-one Super Saver package on Cathay Pacific Airways for $999 -- one week, hotel included -- we set our sights on Asia. We knew that the handover of the former British territory to the Chinese, combined with the general economic crisis in Southeast Asia, has not been kind to Hong Kong. Tourism is down sharply, several banks have collapsed, unemployment is rising, and real estate development is virtually stalled. But the city's problems can be a boon, albeit a bittersweet one, for American visitors. And shopkeepers, we believed, would probably be glad to have eager customers like us.
With that in mind, shortly after checking into our plain room at the vast, modern Regal Riverside Hotel in the New Territories, we set out for the city's fabled shopping districts, calculator in hand, to see if the gods of retail still smile on this crowded little megalopolis on the South China Sea.
If you work your way to the end of Hollywood Road in Central, past the curio shops selling vintage foot-binding shoes and Maoist insignia badges, past the high-end antiques dealers with their $20,000 Ching Dynasty bowls and $100,000 jade rats, past the weather-worn Man Mo Temple where three-foot-long coils of incense smolder for weeks on end, you'll arrive at a dusty, packed-to-the-rafters shop, right next to the coffin factory, called Wing Tei Curios and Carvings. Peter Lee, the smiling proprietor, will tell you that the wooden grates, doors and archways, with their impossibly intricate pastoral scenes and screaming dragons, were salvaged from Buddhist and Taoist shrines built before the Cultural Revolution of the 1960's. The objects now range in price from $25 to more than you can believe. Two browsing antiques dealers from San Francisco said they buy these pieces by the boatload because the quality of the craftsmanship simply does not exist anymore.
Luckily, by that point on our trek down Hong Kong's wallet-clobbering antiques row, we had come to our senses. Hollywood Road, we realized, has a supernatural effect on one's shopping impulses. Things we never realized we wanted suddenly began looking like must-have objects: the lacquered cricket cage at the antique bird-cage shop around the corner at 55A Peel Street; the handpainted snuff bottles at True Arts and Curios at 89-91 Hollywood Road; the grimacing Chinese puppets from nearby Arch Angel Antiques (we bought one for $45, after some haggling), not to mention the dried shark fins, wall-sized propaganda posters and centuries-old opium pipes.
The embroidered Chinese baby hats finally brought us to our knees. Upstairs at Windsor House, nearby on Po Hing Fong, we knelt before a chest full of them, convincing ourselves that a tiny hand-sewn cap shaped like a puffer fish or a Bengal tiger was exactly the life-affirming, home-altering purchase we needed to take back to Los Angeles. Plus, they were marked down from $200 each to $40, so how could we refuse? We carefully picked four, handed over our money to the expatriate British owner, Beatrice Owen, and walked away, giving ourselves high-fives on what we thought was the deal of the century.
Heading up the stairs to W. W. Chan's became a morning ritual during our weeklong stay. Mr. Kiang said he needed to see me each day for fittings, and now Ruth, who became jealous watching me get so much attention, was in the adjoining room at Irene Fashions, Chan's women's division, having a jacket made. She had brought a favorite blazer to have copied, but Tommy Liu, the tailor at Irene's, placed the jacket on a chair, winked and quickly sketched a garment that put Ruth's Donna Karan blazer to shame. The sketched version was tapered and pleated in all the right places (as well it should be, for $560), and soon Ruth was being lassoed by Tommy's tape measure.
Over on the Chan side, I was having heart palpitations. Like most upscale shops, W. W. Chan's had not lowered its prices when we were there; and we did not try to negotiate. The dark cashmere-and-wool suit they had whipped up overnight, and which, at $875, would be the most expensive garment I'd ever purchased, still had chalk-marked lapels, no lining, no buttons, pins everywhere and only one sleeve. Mr. Tang, friendly as ever, poked and tapped me unceremoniously, while Mr. Kiang politely reminded me to return the following morning.
With my first bespoke suit under construction, I felt I needed a few great-fitting shirts to go with it. I walked two blocks to David's Shirts, a place my Uncle Sam visited years ago and had spoken about with reverence, and soon the measuring game was happening all over again. As with every custom-made garment, there were endless and perplexing questions: French paneled pleats or flat? Spread collar or point? And should the shirt be made of poplin or gingham, or maybe crepe de chine? I settled on Sea Island cotton -- one white, one blue, one checked. At $90 and up, I only hoped the shirts would absorb the sweat when I got the credit card bill.
A 10-minute walk away, nearer to Victoria Harbor, is Granville Road, Hong Kong's answer to Filene's Basement. It was Sale Week, a twice-annual buyer's bacchanal, and everywhere rabid shoppers, mostly locals, were scavenging through sidewalk bins for cut-rate Tommy Hilfiger overruns and imitation Prada bags. But since neither of us was particularly desperate for a "Rotex" watch, we thought we'd save our money for the more authentic goods.
In the late afternoon, we took a 15-minute double-decker bus ride inland to the madness that is the bazaar district. Promptly at 6 P.M. on Temple Street, a thousand dai pai dong -- market stands -- magically materialized. Hawkers with their rickety card tables gridlocked the street, selling everything imaginable: Little Mermaid bubble watches, ginseng tinctures, $800 abalone meat, whistling laser pointers, snake soup. While true bargains could be found on Temple Street (we saw chenille turtlenecks for $3), the more interesting, exotic part of the night market was on adjacent Market Street, where amateur opera singers, fortune tellers and sidewalk feng shui masters set up shop. I thought about getting a belt made there by an ancient-looking streetside cobbler, but the river of people wouldn't let me stand still long enough.
Wo On Lane is a perfect Hong Kong street. The dead-end alley in the Central district near trendy Lan Kwai Fong Street, off D'Aguilar Street, crams more into several hundred feet than most cities squeeze into an entire downtown. It is best to arrive, as we did the following day, around noon, when it's most active. On the corner, a sidewalk barber cut hair with a straight-edge under a makeshift sun canopy. Across the street, a Chinese herbalist offered his services next to a modern stationery store. At number 12 1/2, there was a yuppie (they're called chuppies here) jazz bar. At No. 14, a Vietnamese restaurant called Papillon was bookended between a Cuban cigar shop and an old-fashioned refrigerator repair place. The block ends at a Taoist Earth God shrine, and the whole lane smells faintly of incense.
One of the more intriguing shops in Hong Kong is also there. Mountain Folkcraft, at No. 12, specializes in handmade arts and crafts, new and old, from all over Asia: Tibetan chests, Mongolian horses, Silk Road batik, paddle-shaped Chinese wooden cake molds, intricately carved with deeply set images of cuttlefish, lotus flowers and Buddhas (we bought four for $40 each), tribal costumes, musical instruments, folk toys, jewelry and, much to our satisfaction, embroidered Chinese baby hats, slightly more expensive than our steals on Hollywood Road. The women who run the store are friendly and knowledgeable, and prices are fixed, a rarity in a city where prices are negotiable on everything -- especially now.
Leaving Wo On, we descended into the soul of old Hong Kong. Under the row of ragged tenements on Pottinger Street, a steep and crowded alleyway crammed with hawker's stalls, we saw live frogs for sale in mesh bags, and hair ribbons available for the equivalent of a penny. It was hard to fathom that some of the world's highest retail rents are just around the corner on Pedder Street. We plowed past the jackhammers and delivery scooters to Shanghai Tang at 12 Pedder Street, unquestionably the hippest store in town. If Hong Kong's economy is suffering, it wasn't evident here. Tourists and Hong Kongers alike were snatching up every Suzie Wong jacket and satin samfu shirt. The $35 dim sum watch we bought features a knife and fork pointing to pork buns and steamed dumplings. Our $45 Deng Xiaoping alarm clock shows the Communist leader smoking away the hours. After Shanghai Tang, I felt as if I'd done enough shopping for a lifetime, but Ruth forged on, tackling all nine floors of the adjoining Pedder Building, a bargain-hunter's nirvana where shops have names like Labels Plus and Sample Sale Warehouse. Miraculously, she emerged without any shopping bags, and aside from a few discoveries -- the Ann Klein II outlet and chic Blanc de Chine store among them -- she seemed more impressed by the stairway Buddhist shrines.
We felt a touch of sadness heading over to Chan's that final afternoon to pick up our suit and jacket. Even in our shopping stupor, it was impossible to ignore the depth of Hong Kong's distress. The week we were there, another major investment bank, Peregrine Investments Holdings, collapsed. The upcoming Chinese New Year was looking bleak without the prospect of fresh chicken for traditional feasts, as the territory's chickens had been slaughtered to impede the spread of a flu virus.
Mr. Kiang helped me into my wonderful new suit jacket, but even he couldn't contain his uncertainty this time. "Business is not so good," he said. "Next generation of tailors is not being trained, and I wonder if business can last much longer." Traditional tailoring houses like Chan's, where all the work is done on the premises, are rapidly being replaced by less exacting shops, which send out garments piecemeal to factories in mainland China. Of course, a proud man like Mr. Kiang would never permit such an arrangement.
He handed me his business card with two hands, as is the Chinese tradition, and promised he would visit the United States twice a year for new suit fittings and to make alterations on this one. Ruth joined me in her new chocolate brown outfit, and both of us, dizzy from a week on the streets, said goodbye to our tailors and to Hong Kong itself -- pondering, as we would a Zen riddle, how a "Super Saver" vacation could have cost so much money.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Elena deMurias;
Banker to Museum Director With a Mission

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
WHEN the Discovery Museum in Bridgeport sought a new director in 1995, a startling 85 candidates applied. Only one did not have any prior museum experience. That was Elena deMurias, who landed the job.
Ms. deMurias, whose name reflects her Cuban roots, had worked overseas for many years as an international banker. She lived and traveled throughout Asia, Europe and Latin America. Three years ago the intrepid Ms. deMurias and four other women sailed a sloop from southern Maine to Connecticut during Hurricane Felix.
The trustees wanted someone energetic and creative to shake up the 36-year-old science and art museum. "What they wanted was a change agent who could move the museum into the next generation," Ms. deMurias explained. They got that, all right. 
 Dozens of programs fill the museum. A Challenger capsule attracts teachers and students captivated by space. Occasionally Girl Scouts can be heard whispering through the wee hours as they bed down in sleeping bags for a museum overnighter. Every Tuesday elderly men and women visit the museum to hear a Metropolitan Museum traveling lecture on art. And planning is underway for eight different summer camps.
Her most recent accomplishment was securing accreditation for Discovery Museum, only 1 of 18 in the State of Connecticut to achieve this distinction. In practical terms accreditation makes it easier to borrow colleagues' holdings, obtain grants and participate in professional programs.
The Discovery combines a children's museum with art and science. "The Discovery Museum is all three and we belong to all three professional associations," explained Ms. de Murias. "We try to do programs that incorporate all three, very much like the Leonardo DaVinci model."
Ms. deMurias has many dreams for the museum, some of which she shared in a recent interview. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. Do you find suburbanites resistant to coming into the city to visit Discovery Museum?
A. The flip side of that is the reluctance that Bridgeport parents feel about sending their children to the white suburbs. Having the museum as a neutral zone makes it safe, easy and acceptable for both groups.
It is difficult when people look at our address and see Bridgeport. However, right off the Merritt Parkway, we find we have a positive geographic location. We get a lot of schoolchildren who go home and tell their parents about coming to the museum. The parents then feel it is safe to come back again.
A lot of parents also come as chaperones. Word of mouth is very important for us. We have a stable 93,000 visitors each year, about half schoolchildren and half general public.
We are the only space-oriented museum with a planetarium and a Challenger Learning Center.
Q. What is the Challenger Learning Center?
A. The Challenger Learning Center was founded by the seven families of the Challenger astronauts to continue the crew's education mission. What they wanted to do was "to prepare youth to live wisely and productively in a technological society." They felt that through a mock-up of the capsule and mission control, students would learn to understand the concept of space exploration and also the different scientific principles behind the experience and the communications that go into having a space mission.
There are only 25 in the United States and Canada. Students come from New York and all over New England to do the Challenger mission. One day recently we had a school from the Bronx and one from Rhode Island. This is a program for fifth grade and above.
We are working with NASA and the Connecticut Museum Collaborative for Science Education to start a teacher resource room for space science. Recently we received 1,700 pounds of CD-ROMs and other things to set up a new library. Teachers can use the resources. With Mir and the different space shuttles there is a tremendous amount of interest.
Q. Have you changed the art program?
A. We have upgraded the art programs I think a 1,000 percent, particularly, by bringing in an internationally renown curator, Ben Ortiz.
We have two main shows a year which are public shows. We have established the Partnership in Arts and Learning between the suburbs and inner city Bridgeport where we team up schools from each area to come to the museum and get to know each other.
We have 800 students coming in twice a year for this program from Bridgeport, Trumbull, Fairfield and New Haven.
We base the program on the public art show. We have art, dance and science components. Now they are using the Barnum Show.
Q. What outreach efforts does the museum have?
A. We have a whole team who go from Greenwich to Stratford two or three days a week. They usually fill up the whole back of a car. They may teach a course in physical sciences -- for example, electricity or bubbles. We also have a number of community centers like the McGiveny Center and Family Services Whitfield who bring their students here for after school programs.
Another piece of our outreach program is in the arts. We just finished an AIDS mural. We had child artists ages 9 through 12. Our teachers coordinated it. It's on the McGiveny Center wall. We worked with a group called Spanish Fly, a Hispanic group of young people in their early 20's who promote the arts in Bridgeport and the Hispanic community.
Q. Where does the museum's money come from?
A. Our money is mainly private. We get no money from the city or state except for program-oriented money. For example, the City of Fairfield has an escrow account of $25,000 for the use of their school children. Bridgeport has a $30,000 account for the schools.
Our school programs really drive what we do here. The admission and the fund-raising fall into place after that. We get some grants and private money. An enthusiastic group of volunteers called the Benefits Committee led by Martha Gesswein from Fairfield raises more than half.
We started a new program called Sunday Celebrations. It is funded partly by the Connecticut Commission on the Arts and Chase Manhattan Bank. It is a program to bring diversity to the museum on the weekends. Every three weeks we bring in an artists from different cultures to entertain and to provide a Sunday afternoon festival. Recently we had Senagalese drummers and Chinese instruments for 600 people.
We had blacks, Asians, whites, Hispanics; we had young, we had old. It was what I want to turn the museum into, a place where everybody in the community feels comfortable to be a part of what we do.
Q. Is the museum planning to move to the Harborplace redevelopment on the waterfront?
A. We think it is important for the Discovery Museum to be part of this cultural and economic development. We have begun to talk to the developers who won the project, Alex Conroy from Fairfield and ERE Yarmouth of Australia. They are very excited about having the Discovery Museum be part of the complex.
It is a huge commitment. In order to do this we would have to raise a great deal of money. We would go from 30,000 to 120,000 square feet. It is an opportunity to take all the pieces we do in a small way and be able to offer them in a much larger way.
We would have to raise between $30 million and $40 million. (Now we raise about $300,000 each year.) It is absolutely huge but the excitement is there. People love to give to a dream and to something they had a part in building. There is excitement in the suburbs as well. For Bridgeport it is exciting because it would be much more accessible. Kids would be able to walk to us after school.
What we are doing right now is talking to people to find out what dreams other places have had and been successful with. We've been to the Legislature and presented our plan to the Commerce Committee.
The designers who we are working with must think in a completely different way. They have to think of exhibits that cross our three areas -- the children's museum, art and science. If for some reason the move doesn't happen, we will be able to bring all this expertise and new excitement into the Discovery Museum right here.

HEADLINE: The View From/Pleasantville;
U.N. Women Help 'Poorest of the Poor' of World's Children

BYLINE: By LYNNE AMES; PLEASANTVILLE

 BODY:
A GROUP of articulate, intelligent women were gathered around a table decorated with ornaments from India, speaking in the accents of various countries: Ecuador, Austria, Japan, India and the United States. The wives of employees or consultants to the United Nations, they could simply have been enjoying themselves on a lovely spring afternoon at the home of Uma Banerjee.
But Mrs. Banerjee, who is from New Delhi and whose husband, Ajit, is a senior technical adviser to the United Nations, and the others were not just having fun at a pleasant social lunch. They are members of the United Nations Women's Guild, and they were planning a fund-raising, 50th anniversary gala, which will raise money for, as Mrs. Banerjee put it, "the poorest of the poor" of the world's children. The event, to be held May 1 at Tappan Hill in Tarrytown, will feature a fashion show of native costumes by the wives of various ambassadors. It is open only to those members of the public -- private individuals or businesses and corporations -- who can pay several thousand dollars for a page in the fund-raising journal; otherwise, guild members will pay for their own tickets at $100 a person. 
 They pay -- or in more subtle terms -- contribute -- in other ways as well. Members of the guild raise about $160,000 a year; they not only put their own money into their projects but also put in time and effort. These women do not delegate jobs to staff members -- there are no staff members of the organization. They do virtually everything themselves, from contributing money to taking trips to far-flung places to visit people in need. Mrs. Banerjee, a sophisticated woman with high cheekbones and lively eyes, went, for example, to the Little Flower School in the foothills of the Himalayas. The main wall of the school had been swept away by a mud slide during the rainy season. The children there are disabled. They need prostheses and medicine and, often, simply a place to live. She presented them with a check and talked to them about what the guild does.
"It is very grass roots," she said. "No administrative costs. We go and we give."
Money comes from special events, fund-raising drives and the sale of T-shirts and souvenirs with the guild's logo at the United Nations gift shop. The organization supports 160 projects a year in 82 countries, said Ilsa Reynolds, an Austrian who lives in Scarsdale with her American husband, Philip, a senior officer with the United Nations Development Program.
The poverty in some developing countries, the women added, is mind boggling, even compared with the worst poverty in the United States. In these countries there is no running water, not enough vaccination medicine and many diseases that are virtually unheard of here. There is also a different mood: the violence one tends to associate with severe poverty in American cities is absent; children, despite their dire conditions, seem relatively content and will smile at the smallest things -- a wooden toy, a friendly visitor.
Connie Vegega, an American who lives in Dobbs Ferry with her Argentine husband, Carlos, vice chairman of the International Civil Service Commission for the United Nations, has visited Hugar de Nino Dre Zanocchi, an orphanage in a suburb of Buenos Aires. In this institution are children who are abandoned by parents who have no money to care for them. Some of the youngsters are dramatically disfigured by birth defects. "They're children born without legs or arms, children who are retarded and who were simply abandoned to the streets," Mrs. Vegega said. "Sometimes they are superstitious. Parents give them up because they feel they have done something wrong in life to produce a child with such handicaps.
"When I went there, it was so horrible, so sad, I could not even take photographs." Buenos Aires, she explained, is a city of great contrast between wealth and poverty. Next door to the orphanage is a private school for well-to-do girls. "Thank God, those girls go over each day and help care for these children."
LeNelle Suharto of Larchmont, whose Indonesian husband, Sam, is a senior statistical officer with the United Nations, has worked with children and girls just reaching puberty in Southeast Asia. In Thailand, she said, 9-year-olds are sold in the street as prostitutes. This practice was particularly prevalent during the Vietnam War. Unwanted by either Thai or American families, many of the offspring of young Southeast Asian women and American soldiers now need help breaking the cycle of prostitution and poverty.
Emperatriz Machuca, a native of Ecuador who lives in Eastchester with her husband, Clemente, a United Nations translator, said she frequently travels to her native country to help children in the poorest sections. She has also gone to Namibia in Africa. Some of the children there, she said, are "literally living in the bush" in child societies. Women's guild members do not try to change their basic culture, but they do take needed medical supplies and offer opportunities to read books and gain knowledge. Last year, the guild received a letter from one of the first young men in the area to go to college and graduate.
For Naoko Ishigami, who lives in Closter, N.J., with her husband, Yasunobu, who is in Technology Services at the United Nations, volunteering with the guild has meant helping people in her native Japan when a disastrous earthquake struck four years ago. It also meant designing this year's commemorative mug, which depicts children of various races and nationalities smiling as they make their way down a long slide. "Children play in universal ways, and I thought this would be appropriate," she said.
Nor does the guild benefit only the recipients of its charitable projects. Members say that the organization engenders in them a sense of camaraderie and belonging. "We United Nations wives must go wherever our husbands are transferred," Mrs. Banerjee said. "I've lived in 27 countries. This can take its toll. You are happy to find others who understand your unique situation."
Friendships are especially needed in America, Mrs. Reynolds added. "When you are stationed in a small developing country, there is usually a small community of foreign families living basically in one area. People reach out to each other and, because there are no movies or restaurants, your social life is just largely entertaining at home. But here in the United States it is different. Everyone is busy going out, going to work, going to the movies, to exercise classes, to school, or, if they're home, they're in front of their computers on the Internet. You can have neighbors and barely know or see them. The guild provides United Nations wives not only a chance to do some good for the children of the world but also to feel a part of a warm, rewarding circle of friends."

HEADLINE: Giving Schoolchildren Tools to Succeed

SERIES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE: Another in a series of articles about men and women who have changed life on Long Island.

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER 

 BODY:
GERARD LEEDS has always considered himself lucky. He escaped Nazi Germany in 1939, shortly after sweeping up the glass in his synagogue on Kristallnacht.
He was lucky in the electronics business and lucky at love. Mr. Leeds, now 75, met a mathematician, Lilo Schott, his wife and business partner of 47 years, at the only ski resort in the Adirondacks with snow on the slopes on New Year's Day 1950. 
 In 1971, Mr. Leeds started CMP Publications with The Electronic Buyer's News from his living room in Great Neck. The next year, the first issue of The Electronic Engineering Times was printed.
CMP Publications in Manhassset evolved into one of the largest high-technology media companies, CMP Media Inc. This year the company, whose publications include HomePC, Information Week and Windows Magazine, went public.
By 1988, Mr. and Mrs. Leeds, co-chairmen of the CMP board, retired from active management and appointed their oldest son, Michael, as president.
Another son, Dan, took over the printing plant and, eventually, international operations.
That could have been a time to relax, ski, hike and enjoy five children and 12 grandchildren. Instead the Leeds spent a year deciding how to use their resources. By last year CMP Media had revenues of $474 million. Its operating income was $39 million, including a $4.4 million gift of shares by the Leeds to the employees.
The couple donated $21 million from the stock sale through two foundations to the Institute for Community Development, which they founded in 1990 to improve the quality of education for children who might not complete school. The institute, which is changing its name to the Institute for Student Advancement, is headquartered in a wing of CMP headquarters on Community Drive.
Education, the Leedses say, is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty. "We started from the point that you have to do well and then you can do good," Mr. Leeds said. "I have a perfectly good pair of skis to ski on good snow and I have an old pair of skis to ski on rocks. A million dollars might buy 10,000 pairs of skis. But what do I do with the 9,998 others after the first two? It's really what you commit yourself to. There's so much to be done."
Mr. Leeds attended a high school in Hamburg that specialized in science and engineering. He attended 12 schools in the United States, studying mostly electrical engineering, before he received a B.S. at Adelphi in 1962.
Mrs. Leeds also escaped Nazi Germany, arriving here with her family at the age of 11. Together the Leedses received M.A.'s at the State University at Stony Brook and received honorary doctorates in 1996.
Before going into publishing, Mr. Leeds worked on a microwave relay link and started an electronic research business that made an electronic flash with a built-in autotransformer for photography. He was a sales engineer in the digital-computer business and made nuclear counters. In another venture, his Lumatron Electronics company developed the first commercial sampling scope. He started an operational amplifier business, the Data Device Company, which merged with Solid State Scientific, a semiconductor company in Philadelphia.
The Institute for Community Development involves businesses, other charities, schools, parents and governments. Started with 25 students at Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School who had low grades, attendance problems and poor attitudes, two programs, Comet and STAR, now work with 1,400 middle and high school students in six districts.
The institute runs programs in Roosevelt, Hempstead, as well as Brooklyn, Mount Vernon and Troy, N.Y.
"What we're doing now with the institute," Mr. Leeds said, "is more exciting than building a company. Our goal is to someday be at a point where a million children are in programs like this, and someday further than that, all children will get the education they need to succeed."
STAR, which stands for Success Through Academic Readiness, features four years of daily academic enrichment, counseling and support.
The Comet middle-school program for 12- to 14-year-olds, began in 1993 as Children of Many Educational Talents. It tries to help youngsters improve attitudes and academic performance. Students sign contracts to agree to attend school and enrichment classes before and after the usual school day.
For the first two years, Mr. Leeds said, the couple donated a few hundred thousand dollars a year to pay for the entire program. They wanted to do something about high dropout rates, low graduation rates and even lower rates of college-bound students.
"What's remarkable about it is here on Long Island there is a tradition of neighborhood schools and local school districts," said Patrick G. Halpin, the co-executive director of the institute and former Suffolk County Executive. "Very few people look beyond the boundaries of their own community, and they usually don't worry too much about kids who aren't making it in some other community, especially poor ones.
"What the institute did was to say that's unacceptable. We all have a responsibility and we all bear the costs when students aren't successful, even if they aren't from our neighborhood. Kids who graduate, have to function at a much higher skill level. The rise in standards and Regents requirements for graduation underscore that. The institute has developed these exceptional programs that helped schools have large numbers of underachieving students hit those benchmarks."
All the students in STAR have graduated from high school, with 96 percent going to college.
"Part of my job," Mr. Leeds said, "is to convince people to reorder their priorities. There are a lot of worthwhile causes to give money to, the church, the hospitals, the museums. We think education is primary. Education can change the world. We support all kinds of things in a responsible way. But we're reserving the substance of what we're able to do for education."
Mr. Leeds said he donated $2 million a year, or one-third the annual budget of the institute. One-third comes from 1,200 to 1,500 companies and foundations. The balance is from the state.
"We're in discussions with other school districts on Long Island," Mr. Leeds said. "It is purely a matter of funding. They would start tomorrow."
Earl Mitchell, a double major in business and history who is on the dean's list at Adelphi, was failing four subjects in the ninth grade at Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School when he joined STAR. "I was a little disruptive in class," Mr. Mitchell recalled. "I was a class clown. The environment could turn a child out. It will take you under if you're not strong."
By the end of the 10th grade, he had pulled up his average to 84. In the 11th grade he grew upset if he received less than a 90.
He is now a mentor at the STAR program in Hempstead.
"This is the best thing I did," he added. "It's a choice I made and never regretted. I got a lot of personal and undivided attention, a lot of support and people to help me function. The staff was very dedicated, and that's what the key was. I think they fill in a lot of the blanks. When I got to high school the path I was following was not going to lead me to college."
All the 24 students in his group went to college.
In the Comet classroom at Alverta B. Gray-Schultz Middle School in Hempstead several eighth graders gathered around a coordinator who was conducting a review before quarterly examinations.
A sign on the wall read, "When you believe in yourself, anything is possible."
The institute hires the four academic coordinators, two counselors and program director at Schultz to work with 100 seventh and eighth graders and add support for regular teachers.
The staff monitors attendance and attitude with daily telephone calls home. The students are sent to a three-week summer orientation program, including a three day retreat, with the staff members, who also eat lunch with the youngsters in the classroom and conduct an incentive program that includes trips to Broadway plays, restaurants, ice skating, skiing and bowling.
"That's our way of bridging the gap that might exist between school and home," the Comet program director in Hempstead, Debbie Morton, said. "We're that parent away from home. We're their eyes and ears. We provide a lot of love, a lot of nurturing, a lot of support. We deal not only with the cognitive domain, but the affective domain, as well."
The counselors work on social and personal development and hold forums with the students on topics like drugs, peer pressure and sex.
"We have a significant number of children who attend school who need additional support," said Diane Brown, principal of Hempstead Middle School, which is in an area with the largest number of people on Long Island who are infected with H.I.V., drug addicts and people in jail.
Ms. Brown said she believed that support from the Leedses enabled the school to pass preliminary competency tests in 1995 and last year and added:
"That's what the Leeds did. They provided additional support in an organized, systematic, well-thought-out process, so that the support could become institutionalized in the daily operation of the school. I can't imagine working without it. Every function that we have the Leedses are both here with their support. They sit down with the children. With all that they have, they sit down very comfortably and talk with the children and parents here. It's just so unique.
"The smile, the warmth when you meet them. They have these genuine smiles that permeate what they do, this gift. It's really incredible, the commitment that they have."
Lavinia Dickerson, a psychologist and an educator who developed the program, said: "Gerry and Lilo are people who wanted to contribute to the betterment of the world that they live in. We've learned from each other. I've learned how business people approach what they see as the bottom line. I understand their sense of how they hold for this whole issue of accountability, which is a very different view than schools and educators tend to take. It doesn't mean that they can't reach a balanced understanding of each other's approach. We've proven that, because we've been able to work together collectively over these many years. Add in the element of my co-partner, who comes from the political and public-policy arena.
"If anything, this partnership shows when you combine those three elements which are very different together, even though the words to articulate an issue may be different, we are all on the same page to improve the quality of education for low-performing students so they can become self-sufficient human beings."
The cost for four to six years for a young person in the programs is $20,000.
The institute also gives more than $100,000 a year to STAR graduates to help pay for transportation, books and similar expenses.
"When these children graduate from college," Mr. Leeds said, "they'll be making $30,000 to $40,000 a year. They'll average paying $10,000 a year in taxes. When they graduate from college, in two years they'll have paid society back in taxes. After that society gets its money back every two years for the working life of each person. That's a pretty remarkable payoff on an investment. You can't get that on municipal bonds.
"That does not say anything about the money saved in the costs from jail and the number of people on welfare. All the hospital costs and the other costs of violence. It's a tremendously powerful economic thing. The most exciting part of all this is, it works."
CMP has long had an active social role. At Mrs. Leeds's urging, the company was the first to offer day care on Long Island, now running a center for 85 preschoolers and 50 school-age children. CMP publishes 10 domestic print and on-line magazines, has wholly owned and joint ventures in Germany, France and Britain and networks, licenses and represents more than 100 publications worldwide.
"One of the values of the company." Michael Leeds said, "is that it doesn't just stand for driving profits for the owners or the shareholders. There's a lot of good that comes out of those profits, and it's very visible to the people in the company. It's a role model for Long Island.
"My parents' generosity is an example and will be something that other people will aspire to and match. They've been very fortunate. They've taken their fortune and shared it with others. It sets a standard. It's not only a good example, but it's a standard, too, that other people can match up to. They're doing it with their time. They're doing it with their energy and they're doing what they like. There are very few superstars that are willing to give up a business career and do things in the community.
"Money facilitates a lot of things. But it doesn't make anything happen by itself. You really need the people. You need the leadership. That's where the magic is. If you look at I.C.D. and how rapidly it's grown and how effective it is, that's not just because there's money. It was because it had the leadership of my parents and the people they brought in and led and developed that make it a successful program. One of the goals of I.C.D. is to not be personally funded, because then it's not enduring, either. It's what you do with your time and where you commit yourself that really makes a difference."
The Leedses have also become involved in "girls' equity," supporting organizations that help girls develop self-esteem and equal opportunity in the classroom. The couple also support arts organizations and other charities.
Mrs. Leeds works closely with the Child Care Council of Nassau County and the Great Neck-Manhasset Community Child Care Partnership, Inc. She is on the advisory boards of a child-care center at Hofstra and the Uniondale day-care center and is working with the Great Neck School District to set up a committee on caring for young children.
Through the Long Island Funders Group she is on a team that is trying to help home day-care providers with low-cost loans. Mrs. Leeds is also working on an initiative with a small-business group to teach day-care providers to run their centers as businesses.
Mrs. Leeds describes herself as a feminist, extremely concerned with women's rights to have careers and raise families. In 1949, as a mathematician at Bell Laboratories, she said, she realized that female mathematicians earned half as much as male colleagues. Pregnant at the time, she went to her manager and within a year all the female mathematicians' salaries were doubled.
Mrs. Leeds is analytical and methodical. Mr. Leeds is passionate and fiery, a salesman.
Michael Leeds said his parents were a strong team that operated independently but with the same set of values. In general, he said, his mother is much more attuned to people's personal feelings and his father is much more attuned to driving a business forward, but sometimes not recognizing where people's feelings are. "There are only a few people on Long Island who have made a lot of money here who give it back to Long Island," said Roger Tilles, senior vice chairman of Tilles Center and a longtime friend of the Leedses. "There are very very few people who put their time and efforts and energies, in addition to their money, into charity. The Leedses do that. They are a combination of intelligent and charitable at the same time. They infect other people with their own energy."
"Gerry and Lilo are exemplars,"Msgr. Tom Hartman, said. "They are a very good role model for businesses and corporations. I do believe it's a mentality more than a business strategy. It's a mindset of how to treat people. They believe every day is a gift and they're here to do good. They offer their time, their thoughts, their money unhesitatingly. They could speak to the most intelligent of entrepreneurs. They could speak to Wall Street and they could feel the heart of the poor, the abandoned and the downcast."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: A $2.3 Million Renovation for a Bridgeport Theater;
New Home for Polka Dot Playhouse

 BODY:
Bridgeport's venerable Polka Dot Playhouse will soon have an elegant new home that bears no resemblance to the purple polka-dotted building in which it opened as a community theater 44 years ago.
After a $2.3 million renovation, the new home will be in an 82-year-old, marble-clad former People's Bank building on State Street and an adjacent red brick office building developed by P.T. Barnum, the circus impresario and onetime Mayor of Bridgeport. The renovation begins this month with completion expected in early fall. 
 The project reflects a trend of converting stately old bank buildings that have been displaced by multiple small banking offices into other uses.
The Bridgeport architectural firm of Fletcher Thompson has redesigned about half of the bank into a theater seating 223 people. Three years ago the rest of the bank building became Roberto's Italian Restaurant, with an entrance on Main Street, and will remain so.
The first two floors of the five-floor Barnum's building will be converted into the theater entrance, a formal lobby and bar, box-office, "green room" and dressing rooms. In all, the project will encompass 12,581 square feet.
"The addition of a marquee and the removal of a coat of tan paint to expose the original bricks will be the only changes in the exterior appearance of these marvelous old buildings," said Bruce Heyl, vice president at Fletcher Thompson.
The interior marble walls of the bank will also be preserved, thanks to a series of strategically placed acoustic panels that will absorb marble-generated echos.
The renovation will end two stressful years for the Playhouse. In 1996 it was cut off from its customers when the bridge connecting its Pleasure Beach Island site to the mainland burned. But in a fortuitous bit of timing, the Connecticut General Assembly had set aside $25 million to help revive Bridgeport's economy, some say as compensation for rejecting the city's request for a gambling casino.
The theater received $2 million from the fund, $300,000 from the Connecticut Department of Economic Development and use of the People's Bank rent-free for 10 years.

HEADLINE: JERSEY;
Talk About Multiplying Like Rabbits . . .

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER 

 BODY:
FIRST let me say that I have nothing against wildlife as a group. Wild animals perform many valuable services for our state, like harboring deer ticks and giving us an excuse to put eco-friendly license plates on our gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. So I am in no way disparaging wildlife when I say this:
Will somebody please get these danged rabbits out of my yard? 
 Although the state has yet to waste any tax money conducting a rabbit census, we can safely conclude that there are approximately 71 million wild rabbits in New Jersey, using the following formula:

3R x 4,748,160 = approximately 71 million
 
where 4,748,160 is the total acreage of the state and R is the number of rabbits I am likely to see on a spring evening munching simultaneously on my third-of-an-acre property -- namely, five.
It's not just me, you understand. Every yard around seems to have an R value in the three-to-seven range. The beasts are Eastern cottontails, Dave Chanda of the state Wildlife Education Office told me, and the mild winter may have left more of them intact than usual.
It is virtually impossible to dislike rabbits, since they are, of course, adorable. Smart, too. I borrowed a Have-a-Heart trap. The rabbits, once they stopped laughing, actually dragged it to the curb on trash night.
Yet we should not let the cute smartness of rabbits blind us to the fact that they drain approximately $403 million a year from our state's economy, based on this formula:

T x 8,052,849 = approximately $403 million
 
where 8,052,849 is the state's population and T is the amount an average New Jerseyan, i.e. me, spent last fall on tulip bulbs that will never bloom because rabbits bit their heads off -- namely, $50.
I know various solutions to the rabbit problem are available. For instance, it appears rabbits don't like daffodils. Unfortunately, neither do I. Mr. Chanda pointed out that garden stores sell small-animal repellent. But it stinks, I said. "That's probably why it's working on the rabbits," he said.
There's fencing, of course, but that seems like an admission of defeat. A more sophisticated strategy is to get to know the enemy. So I looked at some Web sites. That's where I found Shelley Stack and the New Jersey Chapter of the House Rabbit Society.
Ms. Stack, who lives in Matawan and is the chapter manager, knows that sometime during Easter week a child -- presumably one you're related to, but maybe not -- will catch sight of rabbits in a pet store window and say, "Please, please, can I have one?" Ms. Stack hopes you resist.
That's because she hears from too many people whose goal in life is to get rid of pet rabbits they bought on a whim. The House Rabbit Society is a nonprofit group that tries to educate people about rabbit ownership, but a lot of folks don't want education; they just want to jettison their rabbits.
"They have all kinds of excuses: 'We're moving,' 'We have allergies,' " Ms. Stack said. She was getting 5 or 10 such calls a day; finally she changed the message on her answering machine to make clear that her group doesn't take in rabbits, but tries to find homes for those already abandoned.
There are plenty of those. Parks are a common dumping ground, Ms. Stack said; people either don't realize or don't care that pet rabbits generally can't survive in the wild. Supermarket parking lots, inexplicably, are another favorite of pet abandoners. The creativity award, though, goes to the person who recently smuggled a rabbit into a pet store in Eatontown and slipped it into an empty cage, a sort of reverse shoplifting.
Probably you've guessed that I'm preaching from experience: there's a pet rabbit in our garage. I actually like the little guy, kinda. But it's humiliating knowing that at the very moment I'm cleaning his hutch, his wild cousins are making my flower beds the laughingstock of the Garden State.
So don't be an idiot. Glance in the pet store window, then keep walking. You'll get your rabbit soon enough anyway. In four years, to be exact, as shown by the following formula:
 
 71,000,000 + (71,000,000/2 x 5 x 4) + (P/2 x 5 x 4) . . . x Y x 90 > 29.78 trillion
 
where five is the average number of rabbits in a litter, four is the number of litters the average rabbit has in a year, P is the previous year's rabbit population, 90 is the number of square inches an average rabbit takes up, 29.78 trillion is the number of square inches in New Jersey and Y is years.
That's right, in four years New Jersey will be completely covered in a carpet of rabbits. That last formula may not be quite right -- I was never very good at math -- but I don't have time to check it. I have to get to the hardware store. There's a sale on fencing.

HEADLINE: Hunger Is an Issue Not Just at Holidays

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
NO snow? No problem. The Northwest Center for Family Service and Mental Health is offering "Not Ski" tags that look like lift tickets, and will have a fake ski party, as a way to raise money this month.
"You don't have to deal with the cold or the Spandex clothing, but you can still have the bragging rights if you hang the tag from your jacket," said Carol A. Mack, the development coordinator for the center, which has offices in Torrington, Lakeville and Winsted. "We try to make people laugh a little at this rather dull time of the year, and remind them that we're here." 
 A year ago, the center sent out an appeal printed on a brown paper bag and asked people to "brown bag" it to work and send them the money they save on lunch. The year before, they sent a tea bag and asked for donations for a tea party that they wouldn't have to attend. Each year about this time the center raises about $5,000 with Mrs. Mack's quirky ideas.
Increasingly, Connecticut nonprofit organizations are trying innovative ways to raise money this time of year, typically the slowest of times for donations.
"In December, we took in more than 19,000 pounds of food," said Mary S. Biggs, director of the Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County. "In February, it was a fraction of that. We get a huge outpouring of sharing over the holidays, but it drops off to nothing at the first of the year and by summer our shelves are empty."
Gloria J. McAdam, president of Foodshare in Windsor, which distributes almost 5 million pounds of food a year to 200 organizations in the greater Hartford area, said one of the largest events her organization sponsors each year is the Walk Against Hunger, the first Sunday in May.
"We do it in May for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is it's six months away from Thanksgiving," Ms. McAdam said. "It kind of balances out the year, makes people aware of the need at a time of the year when they might not otherwise be thinking about it."
"More than half of all our donations from individuals come in during November and December, and we certainly don't want to discourage that," Ms. McAdam said. "That's part of what our plan for the year is -- we know that's going to happen at the end of the year, and if we're spending more money than we're taking in it will hopefully balance out at end of the year."
The problem is, in the summer months the demand is just as high or higher, she said. If a family's finances are very tight, it might rely on the free meals children get at school to balance the food budget, and a problem exists in the summer when the children are not in school.
Lillian Maffia, manager of the St. Vincent DePaul Society of Waterbury Soup Kitchen, which serves about 25,000 meals a month, estimated that she collects 40 percent of her annual donations in the last two months of the year, versus 15 percent in the first three months. She has asked some schools and other organizations that volunteered to do food drives at Christmas to do them at Easter instead, when there is a greater need.
She said part of the problem is the misperception that there are fewer people in economic distress because business profits are up.
"One more person tells me the economy is great, and I'm going to scream," Ms. Maffia said. "There are jobs, but they're low-paying jobs, and even a single guy can't make it. We have a lot of men who work and don't make enough money so they have to come here and we help them take home meals for their family every day."
"It used to be we saw these people the last week of the month, then it went to last two weeks," Ms. Maffia said. "Now, after the 10th of the month we're starting to see a rise, because they're starting to save for their rent and their utilities and there isn't money for food."
Not everyone sees such a large percentage of their income arrive late in the year. Emily J. Gros, development director for the Ronald McDonald House of New Haven, which provides temporary quarters for the families of sick children when they are away from home for treatment, said two of the organization's major fund-raising events are timed to coincide with the holiday spirit of giving: its Trees of Hope, where businesses and service organizations donate a decorated tree that is sold to raise money, and Lights of Love, where people pay $5 to sponsor a light on the tree at the house.
But the organization's annual appeal starts in July, it receives bequests and memorial donations throughout the year, and its biggest fund-raising event, she said, is typically a golf tournament in September, which raises $60,000 to $70,000.
"For us, on a fund-raising calendar, September would be our best month," Ms. Gros said. "We're not quite as cyclical as some other nonprofits might be, but we still see fewer donations after you get past the holidays."
Still, Nancy L. Carrington, executive director of the Connecticut Food Bank, said most nonprofit organizations face the same situation as the Waterbury soup kitchen, with half or more of their annual budget raised in the last few weeks of the year, then donations dropping off to almost nothing for January through mid-year, at least. She said not only is it the holiday spirit of giving, but people are often reminded to take advantage of the tax benefits of charitable contributions. In the early part of the year it's not that people don't care, it's just that they don't think about it as much, she said.
The food bank distributed 3.5 million pounds of food in 1996, and 4.1 million pounds last year, often filling its larder with dented cans or crushed boxes, or other things that the supermarkets cannot easily sell.
"We have some holiday Rice Krispies in the warehouse right now," Ms. Carrington said. "Any time there's seasonal food, when the season is over, we generally get the food."
But Ms. Carrington said when a Providence, R.I., philanthropist made an offer to match all contributions to food banks during a 10-day period in February, up to $1 million, her organization put out a special appeal. She raised almost $70,000.
"Generally, people do want to help others. They just need to have the avenue opened for them, and be reminded," Ms. Carrington said. "If we hadn't had that special appeal, we might have collected $5,000 to $10,000 during the same period."
But even where matching grants are not available, organizations are finding that special appeals are effective -- with a greater emphasis being placed on "appeal."
Ms. Biggs of the Fairfield County food bank said her group has distributed bins in some neighborhoods of Greenwich, Cos Cob, Riverside and Stamford, similar to recycling bins in many communities, and asks people to put $2 to $4 of canned food a week in them out by their curb. Street captains pick them up and deliver them to a central location.
"We feel like this could be our best bet for keeping the shelves stocked all through the year, because it comes in every week," Ms. Biggs said. "That's what we need, people who give on a continuing basis." The program will soon be expanded to Darien, she said.
The food bank is also working with the local Council of Churches and Synagogues to establish a program under which each of its 86 members would have one food drive a year, staggered so that almost every week someone would be bringing in food. One member church has already had one and gathered 2,000 pounds of food.

HEADLINE: Neighbors Seek a Halt To Building Gas Pipeline

BYLINE: BY RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
OPPONENTS say that a high-pressure natural gas pipeline being constructed by Southern Connecticut Gas Company three feet underground along an 11-mile residential area through Stratford and Bridgeport presents a safety risk to homes, schools, churches parks and roadways.
They say the pipeline -- 16 inches in diameter and being built to fuel a new $260 million electric generating plant at Bridgeport Harbor for Duke Energy of North Carolina and the United Illuminating Company -- should be rerouted through Long Island Sound, where the Iroquois Gas line runs about six miles from the Milford shoreline, or to a more secluded pathway near Routes 8 and 25. But state and local officials, including the Department of Public Utility Control, as well as energy company engineers insist the pipeline is necessary to provide energy to customers this summer and to avoid power outages because of the rapidly growing need for additional sources of energy. While they concede that if the project is not completed by summer, it would have to be reconsidered and possibly even scrapped, they insist the chosen route is the best for long-term efficiency as well as economics. The proponents also say the pipeline will be safer and more durable than those already in existence, that the pressure will be considerably lower in the new pipeline. 
 The critics are unmoved. "If it's so safe, then let them build it through their own backyards," said State Representative Christopher Caruso, Democrat of Bridgeport, who is helping residents along the pipeline route in their battle to have it rerouted.
"This is a classic example of greedy and powerful corporations arrogantly forcing their will down the throats of ordinary citizens who probably don't have pockets deep enough to fight them," said Mr. Caruso. "But we're not giving up."
Stratford and Bridgeport residents who oppose the pipeline have organized a Coalition to Reroute the Pipeline; the coalition is preparing to go to court to seek a temporary injunction to stop the work that began several weeks ago.
Stratford residents are particularly outraged that the Town Council last month accepted a $1.5 million "host fee" from Bridgeport Energy, a subsidiary of Duke Energy, to drop its opposition to the pipeline. "They sold us out, plain and simple, they decided to take the bribe at the expense of residents' safety," said Paul Lovington, a 33-year town resident and a founder of the coalition. "This is the first time a pipeline of this type and size is being built under residential streets right next to all the other underground pipes including sewer lines, other gas lines and water lines," said Mr. Lovington, who does not live along the route but remembers "just recently there was a tragic explosion of a Massachusetts pipeline that led to a house being blown up that led to people's deaths and serious injuries."
Mr. Lovington said the energy companies have incorrectly classified the pipeline as a distribution line that delivers to residential customers and thus may be built under residential streets. It is, in fact, a one-terminus line, he said, "a major transmission line, but they don't want to call it that."
A Stratford Councilman-at-Large, Kent M. Miller, however, who voted to accept the host fee, said that as part of the agreement the town also gained additional safety measures, such as more safety valves and additional inspectors chosen by the town, but paid for by the Duke Energy.
"We realized that this is a fight we could not have won, so we decided to accept not only some money that will benefit all town residents, but to insist upon additional safety components that will make the pipeline safer than what engineers believe is even necessary," said Mr. Miller, who added that he would have voted against accepting the host fee if he believed there was any chance of stopping the pipeline through the courts.
The Council Chairwoman, Debbie Rose -- who before her election to the council last year began the grass roots opposition to the pipeline and voted against accepting the host fee -- said she would "never be convinced 100 percent that this will be safe." Ms. Rose also expressed the hope that residents would ultimately succeed in blocking the project.
At the Southern Connecticut Gas Company, however, Dave Silverstone, an incoming vice president, said the company is "either meeting and in most ways surpassing all of the safety standards at both the state and Federal level. After examining all possible routes, this was the one that posed the fewer problems and met all of the requirements we needed to get the project completed in a safe and efficient manner."
The general manager of Bridgeport Energy, Gianna Howard, said that her company's main concern was getting the pipeline constructed in time to provide energy to its customers by the summer -- and that the company left it up to Southern Connecticut Gas to find the best route to accomplish that.
"But safety is never, ever compromised," Ms. Howard said. "This project is crucial to our being able to generate efficient, low-cost energy for now and the future."
The state's Department of Public Utility Control approved the pipeline after conducting several public hearings, and argues that the pipeline presents no danger to residents in Stratford and Bridgeport.
"Not only do we believe the pipeline is safe, we believe that after exhaustive research we have an obligation, as a public service agency to approve this as a public service," said Beryl Lyons, a department spokeswoman.
The department's pipeline safety engineer, Philip Sher, said that under state regulations the gas company is allowed to generate several thousand pounds of gas pressure per square inch in this type of pipeline, but that it would only be generating 600 pounds.
Mr. Sher also said that the materials being used have mechanical abilities designed to make the pipeline particularly resistant to punctures by even the strongest and most powerful digging equipment, like backhoes.
"I believe that everything is being done that reasonably can be done to insure this pipeline is being constructed as safely as possible," said Mr. Sher. "This is a very special pipe that should be able to withstand just about anything that could possibly happen to it."
The department has also ruled that the pipeline does not "constitute a threat to the public health, welfare, and safety," as alleged by Stratford residents.
At a recent meeting in Bridgeport, the City Council voted unanimously to have Mayor Joseph P. Ganim refuse to sign permits to allow the project to continue, if, as some council members believe, the energy company continues to violate city ordinances by failing to have inspectors at work sites, and failing to post a $1 million bond to cover any construction problems.
Mayor Ganim was scheduled to meet with energy company officials by the end of last week. Chris Duby, a spokesman for Mr. Ganim, denied the Mayor was trying to make a host fee deal similar to Stratford's.
But there is apparently some support for such a fee. "Our first priority is of course safety, but I also think that if Stratford was offered $1.5 million, then the city of Bridgeport should have the same opportunity," said City Council president John Fabrizi. "The money is secondary, but it's something we have to think about."
But Carmen Franco, who has lived in Bridgeport his entire 74 years, said all he can think about is that his house will be less than 40 feet from the pipeline.
"When I go to sleep at night I don't want to have to worry about being blown up," said Mr. Franco. "It's just not fair that they can do this to us."
Armond Meroli, 85, of Stratford, agrees. For 52 years Mr. Meroli and his family have lived in his two-story, seven-room cape on Chicodee Lane in Stratford, a quiet residential street.
"My wife just died and I just want to live in my house peacefully for the time I have left," said Mr. Meroli. "Now, I worry about this every minute. I don't think after all these years I should have to."
Neither do Carol and Fred Haines, who moved into a sprawling converted barn last summer on Whippoorwill Lane in Stratford, across the road from the Mill River Country Club and golf course.
"We're horrified, just horrified that this would even be considered for such a densely populated area," said Mr. Haines. "All I can say is that if there is even one accident involving this pipeline, there are going to be a lot of angry people demanding to know why all the powers that be let this awful thing happen."

HEADLINE: County Rebounds With Rise In Jobs

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
WITH Westchester's latest unemployment figures at an all-time low and job growth robust, the county is finally flexing its economic muscle, continuing its recovery from a long-lasting downturn that -- like an illness that threatened to become chronic -- refused to go away.
"The recession here just didn't seem to end, and in many ways we're still on our way back," said Thomas J. Spitznas, a regional economist based in Mount Vernon. "But at least we're finally getting off the floor." 
 Appraising the economic indicators, economists reported that commercial vacancy rates were falling, residential sales were booming, house prices were on the way up and the county's tourism and hotel industries were gaining health.
In February, the most recent month for which figures are available, unemployment was 4.1 percent in Westchester, the lowest February figures for the county since 1990. The state's jobless rate was 6.8 percent for February, and for the nation, it was 5.0 percent -- the lowest figures for February on record.
Yet some disturbing symptoms of an economic malaise remained. While the economists had good news to report, their numbers offered little solace for those still looking for jobs. The gap between Westchester's rich and poor continued to widen, with some segments of the population taking home ever greater paychecks and others struggling to survive.
"People who are poor in this county have a more difficult time than poor people do elsewhere," said Christine Rohatynskyj, the executive director of Food-Patch, Westchester's food bank.
In one of the wealthiest counties in the state, according to the United States Census Bureau, being of modest means sometimes equates with poverty when factors like the cost of housing are considered.
"Sadly, there are folks who are playing by the rules and following the American dream and who still are not making ends meet," Ms. Rohatynskyj said. "At the same time that the economy is coming back, people of modest means are losing ground in Westchester."
Observing that New Yorkers had some of the highest average annual incomes in the United States, the Corporation for Enterprise Development, a Washington-based think tank, which rates states' economic performance, recently gave New York State a failing grade on one of its measurements because of the disparity between rich and poor statewide.
At the same time, the group also gave good grades to the state for finally ending its prolonged economic downslide and beginning to rebound.
In the Hudson Valley, the recovery in large part can be attributed to what seems to be the tapering off of corporate downsizings, which "cut into the bone as well as the fat" of the economy, Mr. Spitznas said.
But economists have been announcing for some time that the worst of the downsizing was past, and as Mr. Spitznas said last week, "People are still nervous -- they're still looking over their shoulders -- although they're not as nervous."
Indeed, worrisome news persists. Nine West, the White Plains shoe manufacturer, furloughed 85 of its 1,200 employees late last year and early this year. AT&T, too, planned to cut costs and eliminate jobs, mostly through attrition and retirement offers. About 270 of the company's 1,350 employees in Westchester were to be laid off, part of a national plan to streamline and revitalize the telecommunications company.
Texaco announced that it might reduce its work force of 1,200 at Harrison to 250; Prodigy Services laid off or redeployed 50 workers in White Plains; Tambrands' $1.85 billion merger with Procter & Gamble meant the dismantling of a 180-person work force in White Plains, and 22 bank branches in the county are candidates for consolidation, with 12 expected to close by midyear as the result of Chase Manhattan's $11 billion merger with Chemical Bank.
But there were many positive developments as well in the county's economic picture. For example, the White Plains Parker Corporation Center, a former International Business Machines site, is going to be renovated for multi-tenant use; SF Holdings in Valhalla completed an acquisition of the Fonda Group, a national producer of disposable food-service products; Foot Locker plans to move to the former Woolworth site in downtown White Plains, across the street from where Tishman Speyer Properties and Loews Theaters, a Sony Retail Entertainment company, recently announced that they would open a 24-screen, 5,200-seat movie theater.
Also, the Witco Organo Silicones Group announced plans last month to expand its Tarrytown laboratory, bringing 75 new jobs to the county; Pfizer, the world's sixth-largest drug maker, is hoping to link up with the Doral Arrowwood Conference Center to open a new training center with 130 employees in Rye Brook; PTI, a bicycle helmet manufacturer, expanded its Hastings-on-Hudson offices and added 40 new jobs; Philips Electronics is expanding its research staff by 150 employees in Briarcliff; Stew Leonard's, the Connecticut-based grocery store-tourist attraction, plans to open in Yonkers and hire 700 employees, and Sanford C. Bernstein and Company, a top Manhattan portfolio manager, announced plans to open offices in White plains and hire 300 people.
Overall, there was a net gain in 1997 of 4,800 private-sector jobs for Westchester, Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist with the State Department of Labor, reported.
Ross J. Pepe, president of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester and the Hudson Valley, said that new house construction, especially in the expensive home market, was proceeding apace to keep up with the new jobs being created in the county. Still, he said, jobs in the construction industry had not returned to the levels seen in the late 1980's before the recession took hold. "The signs are hopeful, but they could be better," Mr. Pepe said.
Residential sales reports for existing homes showed that there were 8,504 closings in 1997, the highest number since the Westchester County Board of Realtors and its subsidiary, the Westchester Putnam Multiple Listing Service, began keeping records in 1981. There was also a significant increase in the price of homes -- with the fourth quarter of 1997 showing a median sale price of $248,000, up by $14,000 from the fourth quarter the year before.
Home inventories, however, were limited, with Sylvia S. Ehrlich, director of relocation for Houlihan/Lawrence Real Estate Centers, reporting that transferees, being brought into the county by many Westchester concerns, are experiencing difficulty finding places to live. The dearth of available housing for mid- to upper-management transferees is driving up the cost of housing. The scarcity of existing homes for sale is in part due to the fact that empty-nesters and others who might ordinarily choose to move were staying put, taking advantage of lower interest rates to refinance and renovate, Ms. Ehrlich said.
Business properties were also doing well. Insignia/ESG, a commercial real estate company based in Stamford, reported that vacancy rates for commercial buildings fell to 15.49 percent in the first quarter of 1998 from 16.53 percent a year ago.
The company also said that the average asking price of rentals in the county rose to $21.54 a square foot in the first quarter of the year, compared with $20.94 in the first quarter of 1997.
As Harold E. Vogt, president and chief executive of the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce, said, Westchester's economy has always been a function of what is happening in New York City -- and nowhere can that be seen more clearly than when it comes to vacancy rates and rental values for commercial properties. "As properties in New York City fill up, companies spread out to the suburbs," he said. "There's a spillover effect."
But he observed that small businesses -- rather than the Fortune 500 companies that were once the backbone of the county's economy -- were responsible for the new leasing activity. "More and more it's the smaller companies," he said, "but they fill up space, too."
With Westchester close to the largest city in the United States and still having its own airport, Mr. Vogt said the county would most likely emerge intact from the recession, which took such a harsh toll in the Hudson Valley. Meanwhile, the Westchester Partnership for Economic Development, a public-private coalition, has started the Westchester Cities Initiative to help formerly prosperous urban centers -- like Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Peekskill, White Plains and Yonkers -- join in the upswing.
"In recent years, some of the focus of economic growth has shifted away from these established areas, which is not good for the cities themselves and which also hurts the county," William M. Mooney, the partnership's chairman, said.
Winston Ross, the executive director of Westchester Community Opportunity Program, said his organization had submitted a $4 million proposal to the Federal Labor Department to expand a welfare-to-work program and eliminate some of the pockets of poverty -- many in the cities -- that exist in the county.
Cities are also trying to attract some of the dollars being spent in the tourism industry. An example is Yonkers' $50 million effort to rebuild its waterfront. Last month, city leaders announced that a developer had been chosen to turn a run-down section of land along the Hudson River into an enclave of shops, offices and homes. The city also envisions a hotel on the waterfront.
Figures released by the Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau show that there was an almost 21 percent increase in taxable hotel sales for Westchester from March to August last year, with hotels doing $84.3 million worth of business for the period -- up from $69.7 million for the same period in 1995. Hospitality-related businesses generated more than $28 million in county sales taxes and more than $3.5 million in hotel taxes last year.

Not Dead Yet

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In his article "Don't Blame Modernists for the Empty Seats" March 22 , Paul Griffiths defends contemporary composers in the ongoing dispute about the death of classical music. But Mr. Griffiths never asks the right question: If classical music is dead, then where's the body? 
 The accepted base line for the health of classical music runs from the 1920's to the early 1960's, with concert attendance in New York City as the primary monitor of vital signs.
In the early days, New York was aflame with an artistic fervor provided by first-generation Americans from Eastern and Central Europe who, though lacking education and wealth, revered the gifts of the mind and the soul. Mainline American families still measured part of their value by their support for the arts. This core audience was supplemented in the 1930's by refugees fleeing Nazism, and then by survivors who came to the United States after the war. Because it was concentrated in New York, this great confluence of artistic talent, interest and support was also highly visible.
It would not be surprising if there were now a diminished audience for classical music in New York. Although the city's population has grown, the generation that filled concert halls has either died or moved out of town. Their children, as they achieved economic success, may have moved on as well. The ethnic groups that replaced them are not as attracted to the European music tradition, although Asians are a dramatic exception.
However, we must be cautious about a pessimistic assessment. Since the 1950's there has been an extraordinary growth of performance space in New York. Even if the city's total classical music audience grew, attendance at any particular hall would have very likely declined.
We must also distinguish between what may be perceived as a diminished audience for classical music in New York and an increased growth in the rest of the country. Think, for example, of the symphony orchestras that have sprouted in Rochester, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Cleveland and the like. New Yorkers need look only as far as across their northern border to Anthony Aibel's Westchester Symphony Orchestra and Richard Kapp's Philharmonia Virtuosi Chamber Orchestra or across the Hudson River to the musical vitality of New Jersey to witness this growth.

 BODY:

Works of Robert Kipniss
The River Gallery at 49 Main Street in Irvington has an exhibition of recent paintings by the American artist Robert Kipniss on display through the end of April. Mr. Kipniss is celebrated for his mastery of chiarascuro, transforming representational subjects into enigmas with light and shadow. 
 Examples of his work can be found in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum in Manhattan, the Chicago Art Institute, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and Yale University.
Visiting hours are Mondays through Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., and the number for more information is 591-6208.
 
'Indie' Band at Purchase
Yo La Tengo was reviewed in New York magazine as "part of a lineage stretching back past the Velvet Underground to a whole tradition of left-leaning, humanist-minded artists who have thrived in New York's margins."
The three members of the New Jersey-based "indie" band -- independently recorded on Matador Records rather than tied to a recording contract -- have been together since 1985. Ira Kaplan plays guitar and sings; Georgia Hubley plays drums and sings, and James McNew is the bass player. They will perform on Thursday at 8 P.M. in the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College.
Nils Bernstein, director of publicity for Matador, defines their music as "spacey pop, some soft and pretty, some loud, hypnotic, melodic, very theatrical," and he translated Yo La Tengo into "I've Got It."
Tickets are $12.50 and can be reserved by calling the box office at 251-6200 or Ticketmasters at 454-3388. The college is off Anderson Hill Road in Purchase.
 
Remembering Yom Hashoah
Dr. Susan S. Zuccotti, a New York-based historian and author of two major studies of the Holocaust in Italy and France, has concluded that "Italy's lack of a modern anti-Semitic tradition" was at the root of what she has determined was a higher survival rate of Italy's Jews. She will discuss her findings in a lecture titled "The Holocaust in Italy -- Destruction and Survival," to be given on Wednesday at 8 P.M. in Reid Hall at Manhattanville College in Purchase.
Her talk will be part of the program commemorating Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day. After her talk, a candle-lighting ceremony will honor Pepi Deutsch, 99, one of the oldest known Holocaust survivors in the United States, and her daughter, Clara Knopfler, also a survivor of Auschwitz.
A third segment will be the opening of an exhibition of photographs by Claire Yaffa, titled "Who Will Remember?" a documentary series on Holocaust survivors, their children and Christian rescuers. The pictures will remain on view Mondays through Fridays from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. for several months.
The event, organized by the Westchester Holocaust Commission in the lower level of Reid Hall, is open to the public free of charge but reservations are requested by calling 696-0738. Call the same number for directions or more information.
 
Short Films for Children
The Museum of Modern Art's Family Film Program has scheduled its first Westchester screening today at 3 P.M. in the Hastings High School Auditorium on Mount Hope Boulevard in Hastings-on-Hudson.
"Animal Safari" is the overall title of the series of short films, appropriate for children 4 through 10. MOMA's film consultant, Cheri Coffin, will introduce each film and generate discussion among the children between films. The program includes Maurice Sendak's "Alligators All Around" and "Jungle Juveniles," a 1937 live action short from the museum's Children's Film Resource collection.
Admission will be $5 for children or $3 for children whose families are members of the Rivertowns Arts Council of Hastings-on-Hudson, the sponsoring organization. Children must be accompanied by an adult, who will be admitted free. For reservations or more information, call 476-2321.
 
In Honor of Israel
Two Fordham University professors are to speak at Temple Israel in New Rochelle on intellect, ethics and ecumenism. On Wednesday at 8 P.M., Dr. John E. Healey's subject will be "Jews and Christians in Conversation: A New Relationship," and on April 15 at 8 P.M. "Jewish Intellectual Life in Pre-Revolutionary Russia" will be discussed by Prof. Bernice Rosenthal. The programs are open to the public at no charge.
Temple Israel's observance of the 50th anniversary of the founding of Israel includes an exhibition of sketches by David Rose, an artist and reporter who documented in his drawings the Israelis' almost dailyexperience of ricocheting between joy and despair over the years.
The exhibition, organized by the Yeshiva University Museum, will remain through June in Temple Israel's Cultural Center, at 1000 Pinebrook Boulevard. Visiting hours are Mondays through Fridays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., and Sundays from 9 A.M. to noon. The number to call for more information is 235-1800.
 
Nature Walks for Adults
Departing from its many nature programs for children, the Greenburgh Nature Center at 99 Dromore Road is offering monthly weekday nature walks for adults, particularly older adults. The first outing is on Thursday at 10 A.M., when a center staff member will meet a group at the center's Manor House and lead a walk through some of the 33 acres of woodland trails, lawns, gardens and fields.
A springtime crop of flora, fauna, birds and insects will be observed during the hourlong expedition.
Admission will be $4, including access to the Manor House exhibits, and reservations are not required. For more information or directions, call 723-3470.
 
Four Seminars at Bard
Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson has announced four intergenerational seminars to begin on April 13, each one meeting weekly at 7 P.M. for a total of three weeks. The programs are expected to generate educational and cultural benefits from the exchange of ideas between undergraduates and residents. A fee of $25 a seminar is suggested to defray costs.
The first subject will be "The Future of the Worker and Human Welfare in the Global High Technology Age," led by Dr. Kurt F. Flexner, professor emeritus of economics at the University of Memphis. "Unending Turmoil in West and Central Africa" begins on April 14, conducted by Dr. Justus Rosenberg, professor of languages and literature at Bard.
"Archeological Field Work in the Mid-Hudson Valley," led by Dr. Christopher Lindner, archeologist-in-residence at Bard, also begins on April 14, and "A Raconteur's History Through Time," with Luis Perez, adjunct professor at Bard, starts on April 16.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
In Lot Prices, Too, It's Location, Location, Location

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN

DATELINE: PORT JEFFERSON

 BODY:
THE three-bedroom semiattached two-story house that Don Lippencott selected at Harborview at Port Jefferson, under construction on a hill overlooking this village and its harbor, sells in other parts of the development for $269,000.
But Mr. Lippencott, an agent in a local insurance office, was glad to pay $25,000 more to get a premium location with an uninterrupted view of Long Island Sound. 
 "There are just not that many locations like this left in Port Jefferson," said Mr. Lippencott, who is also adding extras like a finished basement and a deck that will bring the total cost of his house up to $335,000.
"It works out just perfectly for me," he said, noting that he frequently takes the ferry from Port Jefferson to Bridgeport to go skiing in Vermont, where he has family. "When I want to go upstate, I will be able to look out my window and when I see the ferry coming, I can be on my way."
Although developers always offer a fairly wide selection of houses at the advertised price, buyers who want to be in a cul-de-sac, or next to the water or who want to enjoy a better view have to pay extra.
In a trend that has a lot to do with the positive economy and low interest rates, those better locations are the first to sell, said Ziggy Zborowski, who is a principal, with his father, Marvin, and brother, Mark, in Midland Partners of Manhattan, the Harborview developer.
Sales officially opened there yesterday, but 13 buyers had already put down binders, and all but one chose lots with premiums that ranged from $10,000 to $30,000.
Prices of more than 80 percent of the homes in the development carry lot premiums. Depending on their views, 9 of the 40 houses have lot premiums of $30,000, 2 cost an additional $25,000, 5 have $20,000 premiums, 8 have $15,000 premiums and 9 have a $10,000 premium. The 2,500-square-foot, three-bedroom houses range in price, exclusive of lot premiums, from $269,000 for all bedrooms on the second floor, to $279,000 for one with its master bedroom on the first floor. All have two-car garages and basements. Realty Group Marketing, of Smithtown, is in charge of sales.
The 18-acre parcel, through which a new road winds at a steep incline, had to be terraced with retaining walls, said Chris Keegan, the site consultant for Regional Builders of Smithtown, which is doing the construction. By stepping those walls all the way up the hillside, the developers are able to build the houses up to the summit, which is 240 feet above sea level.
A condominium association will own and maintain a tennis court, a clubhouse, a pool, and the road.
Rosalind Rossi and her husband, Roscoe, an anesthesiologist, are paying a $30,000 lot premium for the house they selected. The unit, priced at $269,000 without the premium, is already half- built. In addition to a water view it has a very private location at the lower edge of the development.
"It's my dream house because I've always wanted a beautiful view," said Mrs. Rossi, adding that she and her husband plan to install an extra large deck facing the water. "I can just imagine sitting out there with the lights twinkling in the distance."
Marc C. Eickelbeck, vice president of AVR Realty, a Yonkers developer with several projects under construction on Long Island, offered his view on marketing premium lots. "The general line of thinking is that you establish a base asking price for your typical lot in a project," he said. "And then there are always those lots that because of their size, or because they have a scenic view or other orientation will inherently be worth more."
He said that investing in a premium lot was no different from adding a fireplace or a deck, and was a much more important amenity since interior upgrades could be added later.
Geri Szymanski, who teaches elementary school in the Stony Brook schools, and her fiance, Jerry Aeck, a retired New York City fireman, signed a contract in October for a house in a development AVR is building in Setauket, paying $20,000 extra to be on a pond. With other extras the three-bedroom, 2,800-square-foot ranch will cost them a total of about $350,000.
The project, called Pond Field Estates, will have 89 houses on half-acre lots when it is completed. The three- to five-bedroom houses, which are part of a homeowners' association with a clubhouse and a pool, range in price from $290,000 to $370,000. Premiums on 64 of the lots add $10,000 to $25,000 to the cost.
"This is a second marriage for both of us, and we decided that with a new beginning we were going to treat ourselves to something special," Ms. Szymanski said. "I just look forward to seeing the sun rise and the sun go down over the pond and to sit on our deck watching the fountain and the ducks."
ALTHOUGH the waterfront is always prized, cul-de-sacs are also in great demand because they offer safety for children and privacy, said Charles B. Mancini, vice president of the Park Ridge Organization of Ronkonkoma, a large developer. He added that Park Ridge builds at least 20 to 30 percent of its houses without lot premiums "so people have a decent choice of houses at the advertised price."
In a 20-lot Dix Hills subdivision called the Estates at Half Hollow where Park Ridge just began sales, there will be several cul-de-sacs. Houses range in price from $619,000 for a four-bedroom, 4,000-square-foot colonial with a three-car garage up to $780,000 for one with five bedrooms and 5,000 square feet. Lots average one acre in size. In some cul-de-sac locations, premiums add $10,000 to $65,000 to the price, Mr. Mancini said, noting that he expects those choice locations to be the first to sell.
"Your home is your showpiece, and how it's presented is very important," said Marilyn Larsen of Lane Realty in Great Neck, which is handling sales at, among other developments, one in Glen Cove called Lattingtown Preserve and another in Melville called the Villages at Huntington.
At Lattingtown Preserve, where Peter C. Lewis of the Wharton Development Corporation of Manhattan and his partner, David E. Eisenberg, are building 19 houses, four one-acre lots overlooking a pond and a nature preserve have a $100,000 premium. One of the four is sold. The average lot is one-third of an acre. The three- to four-bedroom houses sell for $520,000 to $760,000 including lot premiums.
"When someone comes into this community and sees these acre lots they realize there has to be a difference in price from the others because they are so unique," Mr. Lewis said. "And for the more affluent buyer, spending $100,000 more is not a big concern if they get what they want."
At the Villages at Huntington, being developed by McGovern-Barbash Associates of Babylon, the 248 houses under construction are built on side streets away from the main through road. Houses, including some that are semiattached, sell for $155,000 to $415,000.
But premiums of $5,000 to as much as $40,000 are being charged for about half of the lots, specifically those that are slightly larger than the standard 70 by 110 feet and those that back up to parks maintained by the homeowners' association.
Buyers say they are happy to go the extra mile. "We didn't even think twice about paying $7,500 more," said Denise Berchtold. She and her husband, John, are buying a three-bedroom high ranch in a development in Coram called Windemere Oaks, where the 80 houses under construction by the Windemere Development Corporation of Hauppauge sell for $125,000 to $185,000. The Berchtolds selected a lot that backs up to a 55-acre preserve.
The greenbelt location increased the price of their house to $152,400 from $144,900, Mrs. Berchtold said, "but no one will ever be able to build in our back yard, so there is no way we wouldn't have done this."
THE Klar Organization of East Meadow, which is completing a 502-unit development in Moriches called Waterways at Moriches begun by another developer 10 years ago, will be charging $5,000 lot premiums for houses that will be clustered around one of eight ponds. Locations on the Forge River, on which the development fronts, had already been taken by the previous developer. The 214 units Klar is building, on which sales start in mid-April, include two-bedroom apartments and two-bedroom semiattached ranches, with prices to range from $169,990 to $249,990. Buyers must be 55 or older.
Among the original buyers at Waterways were Marcel and Lillian Haigy, who paid $50,000 extra for their waterfront two-bedroom semiattached ranch. The two retired schoolteachers have the house on the market for $280,000 because they are moving to South Carolina.
Have they ever regretted paying the extra $50,000 for the waterfront location?
"Never for a moment," Mr. Haigy said. "I've never gotten over being able to sit in my house watching the swans and the boats out there in Moriches Inlet. It's like being on vacation 360 days a year."

HEADLINE: In Suburbs, Housing Market Is Strong

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
RIDING the nation's record-setting residential real estate wave -- and a curl of demand out of New York City -- the metropolitan region's residential market enjoyed one of its healthiest years ever in 1997, with vital signs remaining strong.
Hot market or not, Tom and Jennifer Hopkins put their feet up last weekend -- a balmy precursor of summer that saw suburbanites painting fences and peeling back tarps from power boats hibernating in their driveways -- and just took a break from weekend after weekend of house-hunting. 
 "Working hard at hardly working," was the way Mr. Hopkins put it. "Lounged around a bit. Jen thumbed through a furniture catalogue."
The Hopkinses of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, could afford to do nothing, slowly, at least for awhile. After trudging the Long Island house-viewing circuit -- "We saw more than 50" -- their $130,000-plus offer for a four-bedroom Cape in Bay Shore had been accepted.
And now, while the sellers tried to nail down where they might live next, the Hopkinses, though taking a breather, were still biting their nails a bit, waiting to go to contract. "Everything's on hold," Mr. Hopkins said. "We're a little apprehensive with this waiting period."
But at least they were well ahead of the exasperating game being played by thousands of hopeful buyers throughout the region, buyers competing in a stacked-against-them seller's market of tight inventory and correspondingly rising prices.
"No one has repealed the law of supply and demand," said Joseph Mottola, executive officer of the Long Island Board of Realtors.
"Prices and inventory were pretty stable for seven years," Mr. Mottola said. But last year, after a solid recovery in 1996, "inventory was down, probably off 20 percent, so prices had to go up."
They did.
According to a survey conducted by Case Shiller Weiss, a real estate statistics firm in Cambridge, Mass., house prices rose last year in 519 of 561 ZIP-code areas in 14 counties surrounding New York City.
By the reckoning of the National Association of Realtors, the median price last year for an existing single-family home in the region was $177,900, a 2 percent rise from $174,500 in 1996.
Sales volume also indicated a robust year, according to local realty boards. In Westchester County, sales were up 10.3 percent over 1996. In Fairfield County, they rose 9.7 percent. Nassau and Suffolk Counties also posted increased sales volume, of 7 and 5.9 percent, respectively, while in northern New Jersey, sales rose 8 percent.
"The first-time buyer is coming out in droves," said Michael Ford, president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors. "We're getting a lot of buyers from Staten Island right now in Union County. In Hoboken, you're getting Manhattan yuppies."
Sizzling though the Manhattan market may be, with its high-altitude prices and unrequited demand radiating through the region, there are other forces at work in the suburban ring's rising fortunes.
As always, the common concerns that drive consumer desire -- child-inspired upsizing for younger couples, downsizing by empty-nesters, the search for the right school, yearnings for open space, the job change and the quest for safety -- are all at play. But broader regional forces, like the rebounding Connecticut economy and the effects of immigration on expanding ethnic enclaves in New Jersey, are also powering the market. As is a very favorable set of national factors.
Last Wednesday, the nation entered its eighth straight year of economic expansion. "If it continues through December," said James W. Hughes, dean of the School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, "the expansion will be the second longest in the nation's history." (The longest lasted 106 months, from 1961 to 1969).
Last year, Dr. Hughes pointed out, the nation enjoyed: the fastest Gross Domestic Product growth rate in 10 years, 4.2 percent; the lowest level of inflation in 32 years, 2.2 percent, and the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years, 4.7 percent.
THE job picture also improved in the 31-county Greater New York-Northeastern New Jersey Region, said John L. Weiting, regional commissioner for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The region, by bureau designation, includes 14 counties in northern New Jersey, 12 in New York State, including the five boroughs of New York City, but not Nassau or Suffolk; all or parts of four counties in Connecticut, including Fairfield, and Pike County, Pa.
"The region added 158,000 jobs last year," Commissioner Weiting said. "That matched the number added in 1996, and brought total employment in the region to 9.3 million, a 1.7 percent increase over 1996."
Mortgage rates, of course, played a central role in the upswing. As of last week, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage statistics company in Butler, N.J., the national average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage stood at 7.17 percent, "not much above the nation's 28-year low of 6.83 in October 1993."
All of that helped propel home buying to new heights. A national record for sales of existing homes was set in 1997, according to the National Association of Realtors, with the 4.2 million transactions representing a 3.1 percent increase over the 4.08 million in 1996 -- the previous record.
National sales of new homes hit 803,000 last year, according to Census Bureau data, 6 percent more than the 757,000 sold in 1996.
And the nation's home-ownership rate set a record in 1997, the Census Bureau reported, when 66 percent of all households owned their own homes.
"It doesn't get much better than that," said Dr. Hughes. "The home-buying stars are in full alignment. Some day we may be looking back and saying, 'Wow, what an extraordinary period '97-'98 was.' "
For Tom and Jennifer Hopkins, both 27, everything came into alignment 10 days ago. "Interest rates were attractive," said Mr. Hopkins, who works in his family's document duplicating business in Manhattan. "Jen is graduating with a master's in elementary education." Ms. Hopkins had been teaching part-time. But in September, she started a full-time second-grade position in Manhattan. "We could see what the future would bring," Mr. Hopkins said.
The Hopkinses both grew up in Suffolk, "so it was logical to go back," he said. The first house they bid on "turned out to be too much -- not the price, but with taxes, it went over our limit" -- $1,400 a month.
"What threw us off, at first," he said, "was a little mortgage broker in Brooklyn who told me we could get pre-approved for $185,000. They were willing to lend that much, but we weren't comfortable spending that much." The search took the Hopkinses to Bay Shore, Brightwaters, Lindenhurst, Babylon, West Babylon, Islip and, finally, back to Bay Shore, where the four-bedroom Cape "in the high $130's" fit the bill.
One of the bedrooms looks just like the darkroom Mr. Hopkins has long envisioned. "Kids?" he asked rhetorically. "Way, way in the back of the head; we'll start thinking about it when we're 30." Right now, there's that pending contract to worry about.
Lots of people on Long Island have faced that worrisome wait.
According to the Long Island Board of Realtors, there were 10,470 homes sold in Suffolk last year, a 5.9 percent increase over the 9,885 sold in 1996, and a very healthy 70 percent more than the 6,193 sold in 1990 at the depths of the real estate recession. The average price for a home sold in Suffolk last year was $164,662, 2.8 percent higher than the $160,091 in 1996.
In Nassau, the Long Island board reported 7,835 sales last year, a 7 percent increase over the 7,310 in 1996, and 51 percent over the 5,181 in 1990. The average price for a Nassau home last year was $209,466, 3.2 percent above the $202,466 in 1996.
Tracking real estate trends by the numbers cannot be done with absolute precision. Single-family sales are reported by local realty boards. But not all real estate agents are members of the boards, and not all sales in a given area are recorded. And then, one board may use median prices -- meaning half the sales are above that figure and half below -- while others calculate an average.
But the trends on Long Island were confirmed by another measure of the market, the Case Shiller Weiss repeat-sale survey.
THE survey is based on a table showing the average price of all single-family homes sold in most ZIP-code areas, year by year. To determine price fluctuations in 1997, for example, the survey took the purchase price of each home sold in each ZIP-code area during the year just ended, compared it to the price the house brought the last time it was sold, and then, using the annual index, adjusted the earlier purchase price to what it likely would have been had it sold in 1996. Some ZIP codes are omitted because of insufficient data.
Of the 133 ZIP-code areas for which there was sufficient data in Nassau and Suffolk, only one showed price depreciation last year. In Suffolk, 36 of 69 ZIP codes experienced price appreciation between 4 and 6 percent, and 31 appreciated by 6 percent or more. In Nassau, 36 of 64 areas experienced appreciation between 4 and 6 percent and 15 appreciated by 6 percent or more.
"Finally, after quite a few years," said Mr. Mottola of the Long Island board, "we're seeing prices rise."
Putting it in broader perspective, Mr. Mottola said stable prices during the early 1990's were "a market correction for the tremendous growth from '80 to '88, when prices tripled, from $50,000 to $150,000 for the average house. But over the past two years we've seen a return to increases, and last year more than the year before."
In Westchester last week, Robert Alter was emptying a rather large nest -- a 4,000-square-foot, four-bedroom glass-brick and stucco exemplar of the Bauhaus school of architecture, built in 1936, overlooking the river in Hastings-on-Hudson.
"I'm emptying out 35 years worth of files, papers and hidden possessions in the bottom of closets," said Mr. Alter, a retired president of a cable TV advertisers association.
As evidence of the hot Westchester market, consider that Mr. Alter and his wife, Lucille, sold their home for about $800,000 -- in less than a day.
"Our kids are married, so it's just the two of us in this large house," he said. "We decided it's easier to move into a condominium and not have responsibility for upkeep of the grounds, and also security."
In a vivid illustration of a seller's market, Mr. Alter said: "Our house was on the market for all of two hours. The broker brought our neighbors and they immediately decided this was their dream house." It took less than a week for the Alters to decide on paying "about $600,000" for a condominium on the grounds of a nearby golf club.
Not so expeditious was the mind shift. "There are emotional issues involved," Mr. Alter said, "ties to the community, the children, the grandchildren, memories. It's not just a real estate deal."
Still, quite a few people went through the process in Westchester last year. According to the county board of realtors, 5,750 existing homes were sold in 1997, 10.3 percent above the 5,211 sold in 1996. And the median sales price for the county as a whole was $293,400, up 1.2 percent over the previous year. That constituted the highest median price for any county in the state.
Of the 65 ZIP-code areas in Westchester surveyed by Case Shiller Weiss, only two showed depreciation last year, and 23 experienced appreciation of at least 4 percent.
Southern Westchester has long been desirable because of its relatively short ride into the city. "Traditionally, the family that was coming out of Manhattan looked for the 45-minute commute or less," said Robin Friedman, manager of the Irvington-Tarrytown offices of Houlihan/Lawrence. These days, "when people come up and want to find that new center-hall colonial for $400,000, it just doesn't exist. Now they go as far as an hour and a half north."
Ms. Friedman said that for "new construction on a third of an acre, a center-hall colonial, four-bedroom in Irvington -- I'm trying to keep it very generic -- that home would probably go for below $700,000. Fancier homes go for $850,000, $900,000.
"I believe you can go farther up, in Somers, on a larger piece of property, possibly an acre, and pay $500,000."
Hopeful buyers find themselves outward bound in New Jersey, too.
Since 1991, Ric Martel has been broker-manager in the Coldwell Banker office in the seaside community of Spring Lake, N.J., 55 miles south of Manhattan. "When I go by that train station, the parking lot is full," he said, "and it wasn't in '91." The newcomers, Mr. Martel said, "are young brokers, hungry guys making big bucks career-rolling in the city. And they say, 'I don't mind moving down here because I can still commute, be five blocks from the beach, not worry about my wife and kids.' "
The average price in Spring Lake is about $500,000, Mr. Martel said. "Some of them will buy these houses for a half-million dollars, level the place and start all over."
The New Jersey Association of Realtors divides the state into three sectors, with the northern sector, closest to New York City, including Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Hunterdon, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Warren and Union Counties. Sales volume in that sector, though not price, showed significant gains last year. There were 63,043 sales in 1997, up 8 percent from 58,400 in '96. The median price held steady at about $199,000.
And of the 318 ZIP-code areas surveyed by Case Shiller Weiss in northern New Jersey, only 39 experienced price depreciation.
"The mild winter started the spring market in February," said Mr. Ford of the New Jersey realtors association. "In the Bergen and Hudson County area you're getting the upper echelon Manhattan buyers who want proximity to New York. Young couples are coming over the Goethals Bridge and settling in Union County, which has a whole range -- pricewise and style -- from $100,000 and up."
Even some of New Jersey's decayed urban areas, Mr. Ford said, "are coming back block by block, inch by inch" -- fueled by the low interest rates and government subsidies. "You'll have a development of Portuguese in the Ferry Street area in Newark, and they expand with immigrants," Mr. Ford said. "Hispanics in Perth Amboy are claiming their turf, bringing properties back on line. Jersey City's West End has become very desirable, and it was a war zone not seven years ago."
THERE are signs of revival in Connecticut. "This state just decided: enough being a doormat," said Vincent Valvo, editor and publisher of The Commercial Record, a business weekly. "Three years ago, if you read that a company was hiring 300 people, it was greeted with a fatalistic attitude that someone else would lay off 500. But we've started believing the good news."
The good news includes, Mr. Valvo said: proposals for revitalizing the Hartford business district; construction of an Omni Hotel in New Haven; a $500-million plan to redevelop the wharf area in Bridgeport; opening of the Brass Mill Center, a mall, in Waterbury; large condominium projects in lower Fairfield. "When people think the economy's terrific and think it will continue, it will," he said. And they buy houses.
According to Commercial Record statistics, there were 61,205 house and condominium sales throughout Connecticut in 1997, a 12.9 percent increase over 54,212 in 1996.
In Fairfield County, there were 17,743 sales last year, a 9.7 percent increase. The median price for all sales in the county was $203,500, 3.3 percent higher than the $197,000 price in 1996. And of the 45 ZIP-code areas in Fairfield, none showed price depreciation.
Randi Hutton, a broker with Weichert Realtors in Westport, attributed higher prices to lower interest rates. "Attorneys seem to be very busy with refinancings because the rates are low and it's a good time to remodel instead of move," she said. "That's causing very low inventory. So we can't find enough homes for the buyers, and that pushes up prices."
The impact was felt by Karen and Gary Steinfield, who moved to Connecticut from Philadelphia with their sons, Jacob, 4, and Evan, 1. "Certainly, leaving the Philadelphia market, we experienced sticker shock," Ms. Steinfield said.
The Steinfields sold their home in a Philadelphia suburb for $210,000. "Coming up here, you have to spend more than double for the same kind of house," Ms. Steinfield said. After renting in Wilton while looking at "easily, 50, 75 homes," the couple finally bought a four-bedroom "country house -- it has one of those farm porches," Ms. Steinfield said, on five acres in Redding, Conn. The price: $500,000.
"This is more rural than we've ever lived," Mr. Steinfield said. "In our minds, the question is how we will adapt. We've got snakes and frogs and deer out back. The kids are thrilled."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report;
401(k)'s Can Be a Great Place to Trade Your Company's Stock

BYLINE: By ABBY SCHULTZ 

 BODY:
LET'S face it: Buying and selling your company's stock may be the one area where you have a leg up on Wall Street. After all, you probably know a lot about your employer. You hang on every stock price rally and retreat, week after week. You know the competition, the market and whether your division is likely to hit its internal performance goals.
You have an edge for another reason, too: there's a good chance that you can trade that stock without paying brokerage commissions and without paying a big tax bill on any capital gains. That is because 401(k) plans are increasingly allowing such trading, often on a daily basis. 
 In 1997, some 52 percent of 460 companies surveyed by Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill., included company stock as an option in their 401(k) plans. That is up from 36 percent in 1995. Meanwhile, 64 percent of these companies gave their employees the ability to transfer assets daily among their 401(k) investment options in 1997, up from 41 percent in 1995.
The big question, of course, is whether you ought to use your 401(k) this way. Many experts discourage doing so, figuring that a retirement account is no place for such a risky tack. Remember, they note, that if you lose money in a 401(k), you cannot use the loss to offset gains the way you can in a taxable account.
Some companies limit how much you can trade. Undoubtedly, they do not want to see employees spending their hours timing the market instead of working. And over all, employees aren't that active as investors anyhow: on average, they trade less than 1 percent of their 401(k) assets monthly, Hewitt data show.
But this much seems clear: if you are going to trade your company's stock, the place to do it is your 401(k).
A growing number of professional services are available to employees who want to do so. David Evans, chief executive at Scarborough Retirement Services, a 401(k) advisory firm in Annapolis, Md., offers employees of General Motors, AT&T and Lucent Technologies, among others, advice on how to trade their company stock -- and when it's wiser not to.
Cyclical stocks are often good fodder for 401(k) trading strategies because of the way they rise and fall in relation to the economy, he said. Aggressive growth stocks do not, because they are far less predictable.
WHO is trading their company stock? Everyone from chief financial officers to line workers to people like Ron Shannon, a 30-year veteran of General Motors who retired as regional truck manager in Atlanta two years ago. Over several years he would move all of his 401(k) into and out of G.M. stock as the price fluctuated. "I was hanging out there pretty risky," Mr. Shannon said.
Today, on the advice of Scarborough, he moves money in and out of G.M. stock about twice a year. But the stock is a relatively small portion of his total 401(k) savings -- a maximum of 30 percent.
Newsletters offer advice, too. David Paul, an investment adviser in Cincinnati, began a newsletter for employees of the Ford Motor Company in 1994 and another for G.M. employees in 1995 to offer advice on the Fidelity funds in their 401(k) plans. He did not plan to write much about the companies' stocks, but readers asked for it.
Today, each of the quarterly newsletters, the Ford 401(k) Investor and the GM 401(k) Investor, features its company's stock and gives recommendations to buy, sell or hold.
"They love that; they want that," Mr. Paul said of his advice. "I think money can be made doing it."
He does not advocate daily or even weekly trading. But he argues that buying and selling company stock at periodic lows and highs, as often as two or three times a year, can beat a strict buy-and-hold strategy, particularly for employees like those at G.M. and Ford who do not have to pay transaction fees.
The results of Mr. Paul's recommendations are not audited, but here is an example of how they could work: Say an employee followed his advice and bought G.M. stock at $56 a share and sold at its recent peak of about $74, for a return of 32 percent. If the stock accounted for 10 percent of the employee's portfolio, the maximum that Mr. Paul advises, the trade would have added about 3 percent to the employee's total 401(k) holdings. (G.M. stock has since retreated to well below $70.)
Certainly, there are risks to any such trading strategy, however tempting the potential gains. "I personally think it's a rare individual that's going to be able to capture incremental value from day trading or constant shifting into and out of their company stock," said Stephen L. Deschenes, president of 401(k) Forum, an Internet-based advisory service in San Francisco.
WHEN there is the risk that you will find yourself on the wrong side of insider trading regulations. Regardless of whether you think of yourself as doing something illegal, if you have "material, nonpublic" information that could be of value to an investor about your company, then you are subject to insider trading rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Company officers and directors are most clearly at risk, said David E. Morse, a partner at Whitman, Breed, Abbott & Morgan, a law firm in New York. Most companies advise top officials only to buy and sell during specific "windows," like after the release of an earnings report, said David F. Kroenlein, who heads the corporate practice at Whitman, Breed.
What kind of nonpublic information can get you in trouble?
Suppose you worked at a big fashion company that catered to teen-agers and 20-somethings and attracted trendy types of all ages. The company has just appointed a new head for the shoe division, which contributes 50 percent to the company's annual bottom line. Well, you know that the new boss's style runs to standard pumps in decidedly unflashy colors and that she would shun the hot leopard print platforms that the division has been designing and that you know will be the rage. Under the circumstances, you may be inclined to transfer your stock to a bond fund. Go ahead, Mr. Kroenlein said. The boss's appointment was disclosed to the public; the fact that you know she does not know what she is doing is a nice insight, but it is not insider information.
But what if you are a secretary typing a memo that says the whole company is about to be bought by the Gap? Could you dial the toll-free number of your 401(k) with a buy order? No, Mr. Morse said. The secretary, although not in on the negotiations, would have seen enough information to be considered an insider.
What if you just went to get a drink at the water cooler and overheard two top officials talking about the pending sale in sufficient detail to reasonably believe that a deal was about to go through? Could you call the "800" number then? Well, maybe, Mr. Kroenlein said. The law is written with enough leeway to give judges wide discretion. So proceed at your own risk.

HEADLINE: THE ARTS;
In New Arts Plan, an Appreciation for the Bottom Line

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Arts in service to the economy, not arts for arts' sake, is the theme of the state's new plan for the arts in public life, recently released by Governor Whitman.
The plan, drawn up after two years of focus groups, public hearings and research, and directed by the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, lays out six goals that are intended to expand the role of public arts in the state and to increase citizens' access to the arts. If there was a theme to the underlying argument, it was that public art should serve public goals, whether in reviving urban areas or in attracting sightseers. 
 "We at the council can already see what can be accomplished when the arts are integral components of urban revitalization program like those that are reshaping New Brunswick and Newark," said Barbara Russo, executive director of the Arts Council, in a statement. "Every bit as important is the way that the arts, particularly folk arts, can bring together diverse communities like Perth Amboy, Jersey City and Vineland."
Still, a 10-page synopsis of the plan does not entirely ignore art as a private esthetic experience. In the introduction, titled "Why an Arts Plan?," the document offers a less pragmatic vision: "It is in the realm of the non-profit arts industry, composed of a wide array of arts institutions, companies, facilities and enterprises, woven into the fabric of our communities that artists and creative energies emerge."
That paragraph concludes, "In this realm, one with no personal profit motive, the great majority of everyday people experience the joy, fulfillment and reward of the arts."
On March 24, when the plan was released, the Council on the Arts also announced the allocation of $270,000 for arts programs in South Jersey, $6,000 to pay for the New Jersey component of a program about Delmarva Peninsula folk life and $4,000 for the NJN Hispanic Youth Showcase, a program that is part of the Images/Imagenes series on New Jersey Network.
"Arts Plan New Jersey: Toward a Thriving New Jersey" offers six goals for the arts and five strategies for supporters of the arts to consider. The goals emphasize access, education, and public and private support for the arts, while the strategies urge supporters to coalesce and cooperate.
Goal No. 1, for example, urges the state and arts supporters to involve people through volunteerism and community participation. Goal No. 3 argues for greater public participation in arts projects by using technology to enlarge the audience, and to recycle available spaces into arts centers. Goal No. 4 calls for improving arts education. Goal No. 6 urges increased spending for the arts. And among the strategies, the plan urges hope: "Think 'Arts First,' " it tells members of the arts community. "Be amazed at the possibilities."
In its "Vision Statement," the report said: "We envision a New Jersey that celebrates the arts and extends their benefits to all residents; promotes excellence, education, and diversity in the arts; encourages artists and arts organizations to excel, grow and be welcome partners and participants in the state's advancement; abounds with vibrant, livable and attractive communities made so in part through the arts; regards the arts as a vital resource and an indispensable part of the everyday life."
Penelope Lattimer, an assistant superintendent in the New Brunswick public school district and chairwoman of the Arts Council, noted in releasing the plan that Governor Whitman had talked about it at the Governor's Conference on Tourism, held the same day the arts plan was released.
"Involvement by professionals who run hotels, resorts, tourist attractions and restaurants was an important dimension of the planning process," Dr. Lattimer said. "They understand that the arts contribute much to efforts to create a reputation that appeals to visitors and tourists. For them as well as for many others, the arts are part of the mix that creates a highly prized quality of life for those who live in and visit this state."
The arts plan had its start at a three-day meeting in 1995 attended by 450 people including artists, representatives of philanthropic and non-profit groups, educators and government officials. It was followed by eight focus groups convened by the Arts Council. Nine thousand surveys were mailed out, and 1,300 people responded. Other ideas came from several meetings involving arts groups and three public hearings, which attracted 150 witnesses.
A copy of a summary of the plan may be ordered from the Council on the Arts, P.O. Box 306, Trenton, N.J. 08625; (609) 292-6130.

HEADLINE: The Bases Are Definitely Loaded

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

 BODY:
THE Trenton Thunder's opening day is Wednesday, and the box office has a nice problem: not enough tickets. In Sussex County, the New Jersey Cardinals expect to sell more tickets for the season than there are seats. Standing-room-only has become routine.
But these won't be the only baseball tickets around this season. A state that had no professional baseball five years ago will now have half a dozen teams in the lineup. 
 Down in Atlantic City, Ken Shepard is trying to answer the question: How much baseball, how much romance and family fun, does one state want? A lot, says Mr. Shepard, president and general manager of the brand-new Atlantic City Surf of the brand-new Atlantic League of Professional Baseball Clubs.
As he gazes at the $14.5 million stadium rising like a field-of-dreams apparition on the plains, he promises: "We'll do fresh-cut flowers in the women's restroom. We'll have a locksmith service so if you lock your keys in the car you can get it taken care of without leaving your seat."
He points to a gentle slope just off left field. "And say you've got a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old and they're going to be mayhem. You can plunk a blanket down on a grass berm just off the field. You tell me, how can the Phillies compete with that?"
This season will tell. The two traditional farm teams -- the Thunder, a Class AA affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, and the Cardinals, a Class A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals -- have easily wedged themselves into the territory of the Phillies, Yankees and Mets in the last few years. Not too far away the Reading Phillies and the Wilmington Blue Rocks in Delaware have drawn nicely, too.
This year the Surf will be playing in their own stadium; two other Atlantic League teams, the Somerset Patriots and the Newark Bears, will spend the season on the road while their home ballparks are under construction. In Montclair, the New Jersey Jackals will make their debut in the Northeast League, which like the Atlantic is composed exclusively of independent teams -- those with no major-league parent club.
And when the Cardinals are out of town, a women's pro team, the New Jersey Diamonds, will be playing in their park in Augusta in Sussex County.
The dreams don't stop there. The Atlantic League plans a team in Camden, to start in a new waterfront stadium in the spring of 2000. And North Wildwood is chasing a team of its own.
Opinion is divided on whether this proliferation of teams is an obvious response to an obvious consumer demand for baseball or whether, when the last dizzy-bat race of the season is over, it will all amount to too much of a good thing.
There is the cool perspective of those who study the economics of baseball.
"I start off with considerable skepticism that New Jersey needs another baseball league," said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College and the author of "Baseball and Billions." "People in New Jersey have a lot of options for entertaining themselves, for their leisure time, including other baseball options."
There is the sunnier view of the local guys who are bringing on the independent teams.
"This area is so densely populated that we can draw and it's not really going to hurt or hinder Trenton," said Dave Gasaway, general manager of the Somerset Patriots, who will be playing all their games on the road this season. "I have just under 500 seats committed for 1999. I had three people trying to give me their credit cards yesterday, and I'm not set up to take them."
And around Camden, "you've got literally millions of people within a 25-minute ring," said David Brandt, attorney for the investors who are planning a waterfront stadium there. "With a clean, modern facility, we see success in places that don't have anything near the density of Camden County. And we know Trenton, Wilmington and Reading are not filling the need."
Finally, there is the not-disinterested assessment of the New Jersey baseball establishment, which now consists of the Thunder and the Cardinals.
"I always think, the more baseball the better," said Joe Finley, an owner of the Thunder. "Even though Somerset is maybe 25 miles away, we have not seen any adverse effect at all."
But of the new independents, Mr. Finley said: "Quite frankly, it's a different level of baseball."
Tony Torre, general manager of the Cardinals, is a bit harsher.
"Long-term I'm very skeptical," he said. "My real concern is what's going to happen to municipalities that might be left with $15 million white elephants."
These new stadiums are what makes the Atlantic League unusual among independent leagues, which have cropped up around the country over the last five years but have struggled and teetered and only rarely managed to build permanent stadiums.
 
Yearning for a Team To Call Their Very Own
The leagues arose largely in response to soaring demand for small-city franchises. Minor-league teams that have a major-league affiliation drew 34.7 million fans last year, the best season since 1949. Since 1985 they have built 86 new stadiums.
And franchise prices have risen accordingly. The larger franchises are now bringing around $10 million. The Thunder, brought from Ontario five years ago, cost $3.5 million.
Franchises from the leagues that don't have a major-league affiliation cost a fraction of that, though their prices, too, are rising. The Northeast League is now charging $400,000 for a new franchise. (Atlantic League officials will not disclose the prices paid for their clubs.)
Of course, it's probably worth millions to have the problems that the Trenton Thunder has. When season ticket sales closed on Tuesday, the club had sold 1,950, and had to add two rows of seats to the season-ticket section.
Susan Glimcher of Princeton was worried last week on behalf of her nine-year-old son, Nicholas, who received a certificate for two tickets last summer but was told it would have to be used this season because there were no seats left for 1997. Having waited to redeem them, she is now afraid she will find many of this year's games sold out.
"They're in trouble here," said Mark Thorne, who came down to Waterfront Stadium from Ringoes to pick up tickets for his usual 10 Friday nights and was able to get only eight. "They don't have enough seats. You can't get good seats on an individual basis."
Mr. Thorne converted to minor-league ball with the Thunder's arrival in 1994 after a long estrangement from baseball; born and raised a Yankees fan, he never forgave George Steinbrenner for trading Chris Chambliss in 1979. "Once he did that," Mr. Thorne said, "I said, 'It's not a team. It's just a franchise.' "
Jim Kenney of Newtown, Pa., after gesturing toward the Trenton stadium stands and announcing, "It's fantastic here," explained that he is indifferent to baseball but comes for the park.
"My wife's a fanatic Phillies fan, but she likes it over here," Mr. Kenney said. "It's better over here. You feel like you're on the field."
The Thunder, like the Cardinals, are apparently defying a trend that has become clear at the dozens of new stadiums that have been built around the country in the last 10 or 15 years.
"Generally, there's a honeymoon period where you're sold out for the first few years and then it tails off," said Steven P. Boyd, director of minor-league stadium facilities for Heery International, an architecture and construction management firm based in Atlanta. "The honeymoon period lasts three to five years. You just put on the games and people come and they love it. After that time, attendance drops."
If New Jersey loves minor-league baseball, it's a good thing, because except for its southeast corner, the state is closed off by the Phillies, Mets and Yankees to new major-league franchises. The territorial rights of the Thunder, a Red Sox affiliate, and the Cardinals, a St. Louis team, foreclose any more minor-league affiliates, too, except in Cape May County at the southern tip of New Jersey.
Independent teams, of course, can locate anywhere. And their owners emphasize that they are not trying to compete with major-league teams like the Yankees and Phillies but with local movie theaters and miniature golf courses. (Most ticket prices for the new teams are $3 to $8, with a peak price of $12 in Atlantic City. A ticket to Yankee Stadium, by comparison, costs $12 to $25.)
The Atlantic League is not especially worried about having teams as close together as Newark and Camden. League officials were careful, however, to locate where Thunder and Cardinals fans are not. The Thunder's most recent fan survey shows that 29 percent live in Mercer County, 19 percent in Bucks County, Pa., and 13 percent in Monmouth County; fewer than 3 percent are from Somerset County, where the Patriots will play. The Cardinals draw 32 percent of their fans from Sussex County, 22 percent from Morris and 17 percent from Bergen and Passaic.
Even the independents' smaller markets can be subdivided, said Leo Kirk, general manager of the New Jersey Jackals. His franchise, the newest member of the Northeast League, which has teams in New York State and New England, would seem perilously close to the Atlantic League's Newark Bears.
"In terms of distance, Newark is not too far away," Mr. Kirk said. "But people in this immediate area have really embraced us as their own. This is also a very densely populated area, and I feel there's plenty of room to have more than one baseball team in the vicinity. There's more than one movie theater, more than one ice arena."
Mr. Kirk said that about 1,300 season tickets had been sold, though the opener is not until June 5, and that season ticket sales would be cut off after 1,600.
Even more teams may soon be competing for fans' loyalty -- and money.
Mike McGuire, executive director of the Northeast League, said investor groups had approached the league with serious plans for sites in Camden County and in Hammonton in Atlantic County.
The fear of market saturation has dampened hopes somewhat in North Wildwood, which is in Cape May County, the only county in New Jersey where it would still be possible to put a minor-league affiliate. Now, North Wildwood, which has courted a Cleveland Indians Class A franchise for several years, is looking for public financing, and looking up the road at Atlantic City stadium with a case of baseball envy.
"We have a site," Mayor Aldo Palombo said, "18 acres on Hereford Inlet that would be beautiful. If it weren't for Atlantic City we'd have a stadium. But we're a small town. Let's face it. In the state of New Jersey, there's a lot more money thrown at Atlantic City than anyplace else."
Indeed, the new team in Atlantic City is thinking large. Its stadium, which is to be finished before the season opener May 20, received $11.5 million from the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, the state agency that allocates gambling taxes for redevelopment projects, and $3 million from the city. Mr. Shepard, the general manager, projects attendance this year at 350,000 to 400,000.
For an independent team, that would be astonishing. Among the eight or nine independent leagues now playing around the country, the highest-drawing team by far is the St. Paul Saints in Minnesota, which had attendance of 260,701 last year; the majority of independent teams get 20,000 to 50,000 a year.
The Thunder, by contrast, drew 446,527 last season. The Cardinals, who as a short-season team played just 38 games, drew 171,244.
Ken Shepard, who joined the Atlantic League and became a co-owner of the Surf after five years as vice president of the Wilmington Blue Rocks, acknowledges the competition. "Wilmington and Trenton are two of the top 10 minor-league operations in the country," he said. And as for the crowded New Jersey market, he said, "You can sugar-coat it all you want, but we're going to be in competition with each other.'
"But this is America," he added. "Competition is good."
 
Chocolate-Chip Cookies And Other Enticements
 And in drawing the families that every small-time franchise covets, Mr. Shepard said, the game is not really the point. "It's all about entertainment," he said. "When you go to a minor-league game, do you really know any players? No. It's our job to think of ideas that will make people say, 'Wow!' "
In Wilmington, Mr. Shepard's ideas included having the kitchen bake chocolate-chip cookies, which he sold himself, two for a dollar, behind home plate. Before that, in Geneva, N.Y., where he worked for the completely miserable Geneva Cubs, he announced after the team lost five of its first six games of the 1988 season that he would sleep in the press box until they won. He did, for 17 more games, and attendance rose 36 percent that year.
The Surf plans a number of unprofessional events this season at its park, called the Sandcastle. A nine-year-old girl from Brigantine is to sing the national anthem on opening night, and a four-year-old Atlantic City boy will do "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." ("He's good," Mr. Shepard said, "really good.")
Still, Mr. Shepard insists that the players are to be taken seriously.
Last weekend, the league held tryouts in Plant City, Fla. Each of the member teams signed several players. Others were signed by the league, which will allocate them in a draft next month.
The Surf is setting player salaries at $850 a month for raw recruits, rising to $3,000 to $5,000 a month for its bigger names, who are expected to come from the ranks of former major-leaguers.
That is more than competitive with salaries paid by affiliated minor-league teams. The Thunder and Cardinals players average less than $1,500 a month -- though as an apprenticeship for the majors the Thunder has seen some players arrive with huge signing bonuses. Tony Clark, a first baseman who now plays for the Detroit Tigers, and Nomar Garciaparra, the Boston Red Sox shortstop who was the 1997 American League rookie of the year, each showed up with signing bonuses of more than $800,000.
For now, most of the former major-leaguers in the Atlantic League are owners, managers and coaches: Bud Harrelson, the league president, spent 34 years in the Mets organization, most famously as the shortstop for the 1969 Miracle team. The Newark Bears are owned by Rick Cerone, the former Yankee catcher. The Somerset Patriots have hired Sparky Lyle, the former Yankee pitcher, as manager, and Jim Frey, who managed the Chicago Cubs and Kansas City Royals, as vice chairman of baseball operations. Doc Edwards, a former Mets coach, will manage the Surf.
And the players have no choice but to give their all.
The first player signed by the Surf, the former Phillies pitcher Jose de Jesus, showed not a trace of major-league cockiness when he was presented at a news conference on March 25, the beginning of a small promotional blitz.
"I'm trying to come back," Mr. de Jesus said. At 33, he is returning from two seasons of play in Taiwan, where he went after a serious shoulder reconstruction derailed his major-league career.
And the next day, in an interview at the Surfs offices, he offered: "I want to live close to the ball park. I'll be the first to get there and the last to leave. I'm very excited that the Atlantic City area is having baseball. I'm happy for them, too."
Later, in a car headed for his hotel, he complained about Taiwan.
"I don't know how I did it," he said, twice, and on passing a restaurant with a facade styled like a pagoda, he said, dyspeptically, "Oh, Chinese."
But he was, after all, very tired. The evening before he spent with Mr. Shepard addressing the Galloway Township Athletic Association, which runs sports programs for children. And he had to catch a few hours of rest at the Comfort Inn before heading onward, to a Latino focus group.
The Surf, he agreed, is sparing no effort.

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
'Is Ralph Here Yet?'

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: MILLBURN

 BODY:
"NINETY percent of life is showing up," as Woody Allen once said. But how many clock-watchers said it, or thought it, before him?
Just showing up reflects not only the cool, blase attitude of a celebrity but also the insignificance of thousands of faces in the crowd, from the downward-bound (the Willy Lomans, the Wozzecks of the world) to anyone who bides time on the job, waiting for something to happen. 
 Carl N. Wallnau knows the feeling. This spring, he has spent six weeks in theatrical no man's land as standby for three roles in "Death of a Salesman" at the Paper Mill Playhouse here. The job included two weeks of rehearsals "without getting up and moving," he said. Tonight it's over. And he did go on -- once.
In the Arthur Miller classic, which closes today, Mr. Wallnau has been standby for Uncle Ben (Willy Loman's brother, played by Michael Balcanoff), Charley (Willy's next-door neighbor, played by Joseph Hindy) and Stanley (the bartender, played by Ford Austin). Last Tuesday, at a noontime student matinee, Mr. Wallnau took over for Mr. Hindy as Charley, while Mr. Hindy -- the understudy to the star, Ralph Waite -- played Willy Loman.
Through it all, he continued holding auditions and callbacks in Manhattan for "The Killing of Sister George," the next production of the Centenary Stage Company, where he is producing director. Then back to Hackettstown to teach three courses a week, two classes a day, as associate professor of theater arts at Centenary College. "Most of my time was really spent in my car," he said.
The standby is the necessary phantom of the theater, the second-class citizen among thespians, not necessarily an Eve Harrington type. Unlike the understudy, who has a part in a play or is a member of the chorus in a musical and simply steps up when the star or a supporting player is indisposed, the standby is relegated to just showing up, being there, waiting.
For some actors, the standby's role seems to be a run-of-your-life contract, a commitment not to the glamorous life but to the vicarious one, of perpetual anticipation with no guaranteed entrances. The show will go on, as it must, but the standby may not.
What made Mr. Wallnau's job more nerve-wracking than tedious was Mr. Waite's much-publicized travels while he has been running for the seat in Congress that Sonny Bono held until his death in January; the election is to be held on Tuesday in Palm Springs, Calif. After each Sunday night performances, Mr. Waite, "a well of endless energy, would fly out to Sonny Bono-land," Mr. Wallnau said. "And he'd fly back on Tuesday. So every Tuesday, we'd all be lingering. And I'm standing around like a hyena or a jackal waiting for the kill. Then the cry would go out: 'Is Ralph here yet?' Then I'd hear, 'He's on the highway.'
"Sometimes he would arrive at 7:45, and the curtain would be delayed a few minutes. I'd spend a lot of time asking Joseph and Ford and Michael, 'How are you feeling today?' You wait for a cough so you can say, 'Rest a bit.' It was always worse for Joseph, who had to anticipate the audience groan."
Tuesday's matinee was a no-groaner. "We banked on the high school groups not knowing who Ralph Waite is," Mr. Wallnau said after the performance. "And that they'd just be glad to be out of school. And we were right."
Groups from 24 high schools and middle schools in New Jersey, and one from Staten Island, filled the 1,192-seat. Among those represented were Nutley High School, Hopatcong Middle School and Kushner Yeshiva High School in Livingston.
"There were more school buses than I've ever seen in one place," Mr. Wallnau said. "And it was a different kind of audience," he added, even though he is accustomed to young audiences in Hackettstown, where each semester his Young Performers Workshop trains 60 to 75 students, ages 6 to 18, and stages 12 full productions a year. Once there was an all-white version of "The Wiz." This year's shows include "The King and I," "Life With Father" and "Schoolhouse Rock."
To Mr. Wallnau, "the audience is always a character in the play; it just isn't introduced until the performance starts."
"When the lights went down at Paper Mill, a roar went up," he said of Tuesday's performance. "It sounded like the final death throes of the Titanic, and our hearts sank." The exhausted Willy Loman, lugging his suitcases, should make his entrance to the sound of silence.
"But once the play was cooking, they were really hooked into it -- except in the predictable place with Willy and the woman in the hotel room in Boston. Then they hooted. Luckily, with the size and distance at Paper Mill, distractions don't come across the footlights. And they cheered like crazy at the end."
During a discussion after the performance, -- "it was so reassuring that so many remained to talk about the play," said Mr. Wallnau, who participated -- students asked questions ranging from the stock ("How do you become an actor?") to the psychologically sophisticated ("Why does Linda put up with Willy's emotional abuse?"). "They were very interested in the relationship between father and son," he said. "And all the girls were in love with Happy, that sleazy womanizer. Why? Because he's a take-charge guy, not a wimp."
Biding his time in the green room during a performance two weeks ago, Mr. Wallnau mused on his latest theatrical credit. "I have to keep ready as if I'm going on -- for someone," he said. Usually an understudy must appear "at half-hour" -- 30 minutes before curtain time.
"But I don't have to get here before 8 o'clock," he said. "Ben and Charley's first entrances are in the middle of the first act. That would be about 8:30. When I arrive, I look at the sign-in sheet. That gives you a clue. But usually the name that wasn't on it was just mine.
"The theater is not obligated to let me know, but I am -- contractually -- to be there every performance. Then I come up here -- and sit there, right by the coffee machine, reading papers, grading papers, filling out State Arts Council grant applications. And I wait. Everyone knows about waiting." Mr. Austin's entrance in the second act is the cue for Mr. Wallnau's exit: "Once Stanley goes on in the second act, I go home."
"But I always watch the scenes," Mr. Wallnau said. "I want to see the process. I would stand backstage and try to get the attention of the stage manager, Betsey Berther, so that maybe I could do lines with her, and she'd be too busy with light cues to bother with my yammering."
Clearly, Mr. Wallnau took the term standby too literally. "I grew accustomed to hearing, 'Go away, Carl; you're muttering in my ear.' She was getting the same words three ways -- from the stage, from the monitor, from me next to her, standing by."
N OW that the six-week grind of "teach the class, drive to Paper Mill, park the car, wait" is over -- not to mention the understudy rehearsals on Fridays at 2 P.M. -- he will begin directing "The Killing of Sister George," a four-character English comedy from 1966. His wife, Colleen Smith Wallnau, is to play Miss Mercy, an emissary from the BBC who arrives to tell the actress playing Sister George, a nurse on a television soap opera, that her character is to be killed off and then takes off with the actress's girlfriend.
As the artistic head of Centenary Stage -- where, he says, he is also "janitor, usher and concessionaire at times" -- his mission is "to challenge audiences with neglected works." For next season, Mr. Wallnau is thinking of directing a play by Terence Rattigan, and "Below the Belt," by Richard Dresser.
But esoterica does not fill the 174-seat house. Mr. Wallnau does not deny his practical side, although he says he despises it. So he once did what theater managers everywhere do: when the bills pile up, call in "Nunsense."
It would be a canard to believe that the crowds who flock to "Nunsense" will come back for Mamet or Rattigan. "There were people living in Hackettstown for 15 years who'd never been to Centenary," he said. "But they came to 'Nunsense,' and they travel all over to see the same show. This was their fifth 'Nunsense,' and they haven't been back to our theater since. But nothing else we do pays the bills."
The standby's lot may not be a happy one, but "if I weren't here, I'd be on my way to the Forum," Mr. Wallnau said, referring to the Forum Theater Group in Metuchen. "My vocation is also my avocation." Summing up his Paper Mill experience, he said: "I'm glad I did it and I'm glad it's over, and I don't think I'd do it again. It's frustrating. You never bring your experience to completion, just your version of someone else's version, so that it doesn't mess anyone up. You just show up. And get ready to wait."

HEADLINE: The Changing Face Of America's Teachers

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
The lights went off inside the windowless, cinder-block room, and the television screen began to glow, filled with the grainy images of a Department of Defense video. As the 11 viewers took furious notes, the camera focused on a communications tower outside of Baghdad. Seconds later, the tower exploded, blown up by a bomb from the belly of an American plane.
As if leading a Pentagon briefing, the man at the front of the room noted the angle and speed at which the bomb had hit, his voice matter-of-fact, his cadence clipped from two decades in the Air Force. When the lights came up, the viewers began a series of calculations of their own. 
 But those being briefed were not in the military; they were 12th-grade physics students at Richmond Senior High School, in a small town 80 miles southeast of Charlotte, N.C. And although the speaker was an Air Force colonel who commanded 500 men and women in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, his career ended a lifetime ago. At least that's how it seems to him.
For four years now, Jay Gaskin has been a teacher.
While a 26-year military odyssey that stretched from the Nevada desert to the Far East is hardly the most direct path to the front of a classroom, experts say it will take tens of thousands of teachers like Mr. Gaskin -- people who were well established in other careers, and who probably didn't take an education course in their undergraduate years -- to help fill all the vacancies projected in the nation's public schools over the next decade.
The Department of Education predicted last fall that two million elementary and secondary teachers will have to be hired and trained by 2007, a figure that is nearly three-quarters as large as the current workforce of 2.7 million public-school teachers. (And that doesn't include the 100,000 elementary-school jobs that would be created over the next seven years, under President Clinton's recently proposed effort to reduce class size.)
Most of the vacancies will come as a result of teacher attrition or enrollment growth. But the current cast of teachers is a driving factor as well: today's teaching ranks are generally considered too white and too female, given the diversity among students in the nation's schools. And a third of all teachers are not trained in the subjects they teach.
As they have in the past, the nation's teaching schools, whether undergraduate or graduate, will produce most of the teachers who will fill these available slots. But they won't be able to do it alone -- especially in districts like Los Angeles and Houston, which are already short thousands of qualified teachers.
And so districts must get creative, looking in unusual places for candidates who can relieve shortages but who also bring to the classroom skills and a point of view that might not be taught in an education school.
There are currently more than 300 alternative teacher-recruitment and training programs in the country -- half begun since 1990, many catering to physicists, engineers and business people, among others, who are looking for a career change. At a time when education schools are striving to give prospective teachers better grounding in subjects like math and science, the alternative programs produce teachers who have used such skills in everyday life.
One program is Troops to Teachers, a four-year-old clearinghouse that has moved Mr. Gaskin and more than 2,000 other retiring military personnel out of their labs and barracks and into second careers in schoolhouses in impoverished communities that more experienced teachers have shunned.
Another venture, Teach for America, has strived over the last nine years to counter teaching's bad rap as a career choice. The organization's pitch -- that teaching in the inner city is cool and rewarding -- has been so persuasive that it has rerouted, or at least delayed, the career plans of 4,000 prospective bankers, doctors and software writers on the nation's most elite college campuses.
Janice Gordon, for instance, a Dartmouth College student who was planning to apply to law school until she was buttonholed by Teach for America in 1991, is finishing her sixth year at an elementary school in one of New York City's least affluent communities.
Looking closer to home, the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund has given nearly 2,000 classroom aides who were already working in urban districts the financial means to reach the major leagues: to be trained and promoted to full-time teachers. One recent graduate of the program, which began in 1989, is Kathy Moran, a teacher's aide in Pittsburgh who dreamed for two decades of presiding over her own classroom.
"It's not healthy -- and it's not sufficient or realistic -- to just replace the next generation of teachers with only 23- and 24-year-olds from the suburbs who don't have much life experience," said David Haselkorn, the president of Recruiting New Teachers, a nonprofit resource center in Belmont, Mass. "These alternative-route programs draw from different talent pools and they connect, in many cases, much more directly to the needs of urban and low-income classrooms."
Most of the new hires will be replacing an unusually high number of retirees: about one of every two teachers is 45 or older and is expected to leave the classroom by 2007, at or around age 55. The bulk of these teachers were hired to teach the baby-boom generation in the late 1960's and early 70's.
But other departing teachers have far less experience. Nearly a third of the nation's newly minted teachers, by some estimates, have been quitting in their first, second or third years, discouraged, they say, by the low pay and monumental task of prodding student achievement. Indeed, if everyone who received a teaching degree in recent years were in the classroom today, there would be a surplus.
A major new movement has been creating a safety net for the most vulnerable educators by strengthening their teaching skills and pairing them with mentors. In Goose Creek, S.C., just outside Charleston, a new state-mandated mentoring program may have already saved one fledgling teacher -- Tammy Reynolds, 22 -- who got rattled like a rookie starting pitcher in the early weeks of the school year.
New hires like Mrs. Reynolds are charged with relieving the effects of burgeoning enrollments, as the children of baby boomers advance through the nation's schools, joined, especially in California and New York City, by a continuing flood of immigrants. Over the next decade, the rolls of public schools are expected to grow by 4 percent, from 46.4 million to 48.3 million.
Some parts of the country have greater needs than others: In Texas, for example, the state's universities graduated 457 certified math teachers in 1996 -- but the Texas public schools needed 2,500, according to Houston school officials.
And although other states, particularly Minnesota, Indiana and Wisconsin, are graduating tens of thousands more teachers each year than they can place in jobs, those rookies have been reluctant to relocate to areas where the needs are most great, like urban schools in Los Angeles, or depressed communities like Richmond County, N.C.
 
Desert Storm? Piece of Cake
Forgive Jay Gaskin if standing in front of a classroom in rural North Carolina did not sound like hardship duty.
After all, he spent four years in the 1980's testing and redesigning the F-117 Stealth fighter. And for the first year of that classified project, he left his home outside Las Vegas, Nev., every Monday morning and did not return until Friday night -- never at liberty to tell his wife, Sandra, where he had been. (He was working from a hangar in the Nevada desert that only a few people knew existed.)
But nothing, he says, prepared him for what he encountered four autumns ago, on his first day as a science teacher at Richmond Senior High. Unfazed by the colonel's eagle once worn on his shoulder, his students never hesitated to tell him, "You stink!" or worse.
"There was a desperate feeling of helplessness," Mr. Gaskin, now 52, recalled, his face reddening. "I went from a situation where I could tell a person to go into certain death, and they'd do it, to a case where it was just the opposite. Nothing was obeyed blindly.
"I couldn't take their paycheck," he added. "I couldn't throw 'em in the brig. What could I do?"
Fighting the temptation to ball his hand into a fist, Mr. Gaskin says he learned, slowly, to use charm instead of pulling rank.
"If they would walk up to me and say, 'You stink!' I'd say, 'That's funny, I thought I put on my deodorant today."'
Coming from a stern-looking man with a brushy mustache and a midsection as trim as when he enlisted, the humor was disarming.
Ralph Robertson, the principal of Richmond Senior High, said it was nothing short of a godsend to get a science teacher with the qualifications of Mr. Gaskin, who had hands-on experience with the most sophisticated engines in the world.
Although the school's football team is a perennial state champion, Mr. Robertson has had difficulty attracting teachers to this depressed, pine-studded county near the South Carolina border. Its most productive textile-manufacturing days came and went long ago. When the school's lone, longtime physics teacher announced his retirement in 1993, Mr. Robertson did not have an applicant for the job.
Then he heard about the Defense Department's Troops to Teachers program. Seeing Mr. Gaskin's resume on a Troops to Teachers circular, Mr. Robertson invited him for an interview.
The principal learned that four years earlier, Mr. Gaskin had begun to contemplate retiring after a quarter-century in the military and was wondering what he should do next. He thought about joining an aerospace company, but he also thought of the words of his high school chemistry teacher, who had predicted that Mr. Gaskin would make a wonderful teacher himself.
Although he had a bachelor's degree in geology and a master's degree in psychology, Mr. Gaskin knew he needed some education courses to satisfy the requirements in most states. So, during his last command, at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, Mr. Gaskin enrolled in night school at Old Dominion University in Norfolk. He graduated two years later with a master's in education.
For Mr. Gaskin, who grew up in a South Carolina town not far from Richmond County, the chance to return to the region -- and a student population he felt he could help -- seemed perfect.
Now a veteran of four years in the educational trenches, Mr. Gaskin has looked to his military career for a trove of real-life examples to help his students grasp the concepts of chemistry and physics.
"Think if you were shooting artillery at Saddam Hussein," he said in class the other day, attempting to guide a student through a lab he had designed on the concept of ballistics.
At another point, he cautioned his students against trying the demonstration portion of the lab before calculating their anticipated results.
"You got to do the paperwork first," he said, his voice a bark. "When I was in the Air Force, I hated paperwork. But you got to do it."
The principal says his prized teacher is getting
results: the school's scores on standarized state physics tests have increased 25 percentage points over the last four years. The students have noticed a difference, too.
"He did this all his life," said Brandon Thrower, 17, a member of Mr. Gaskin's second-period, college-level physics class. "He used physics to plan bomber runs."
A classmate, Jaime Bolton, 17, added: "He makes it fun. When he talks about his military background, it's weird to think he was above all these people, and now he's just teaching us.
"But he's not scary at all," he said. "He's just Mr. Gaskin."
 
Ivy League Tweed
A quarter-century ago, one of the few career options open to Janice Gordon would have been teaching. But this is a different time, of course, and by the summer of 1991, before her senior year at Dartmouth College, Ms. Gordon had decided on a far different course: she would be an international lawyer.
Then she saw a Teach for America flier, and figured she might as well hear what the recruiter had to say.
Since 1989, Teach for America, a nonprofit venture, has been trolling for inner-city teachers on Ivy League and other elite campuses. Its pitch to economics, science and other majors has combined the hard sell of a visiting investment bank ("We're looking only for the best and the brightest") with the higher calling of the Peace Corps (the desperate need for qualified teachers in under-served neighborhoods). And hey, those accepted to the program need only commit to two years.
More than 4,100 graduating seniors have signed on.
Ms. Gordon, who grew up in one of New York City's hardscrabble neighborhoods, East Flatbush in Brooklyn, says she has always been grateful to the teachers who guided her through the city's public schools, though she never imagined following in their footsteps. Nonetheless, as she listened to the Teach for America presentation, she suddenly found herself reflecting on her sixth-grade teacher, Joan Diehl, at Public School 219, who taught her "probably all the vocabulary I needed to survive in life in that one year.
"I thought about what a good teacher can do for a student," she added. "I thought, 'Maybe I could teach for two years, and then go to law school."'
Since she had never taken an education course, she spent two months that summer at a Teach for America boot camp at the California State University, at North Ridge, which taught her the basics of managing a classroom and assessing children's needs.
While there, she met Miriam Acosta-Sing, the principal of the Mott Hall School, a magnet school populated almost entirely by first- and second-generation Dominican immigrants in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. Impressed that Ms. Gordon had majored in Spanish -- a language in short supply among New York City teachers -- the principal offered her a job as a fourth-grade teacher.
That first year she was continually exhausted and anxious. Commuting 80 minutes each way on the subway from her mother's house in Brooklyn, she sometimes fell asleep on the ride home and missed her stop. In class, she peppered herself with questions: "How am I going to make sure I cover all these things? What is a fair test?"
By that spring, she was pulling out her law school applications again, she says. But on the last day of school, something happened. "I had 25 students," she said. "And each one sat in the lunchroom that day and cried that the school year was over.
"I said, 'I think I'm hooked."'
Ms. Gordon, now 27 and in her sixth year, has since completed most of the coursework for a master's in education. She was also selected to be the pilot teacher in a program, partly sponsored by Microsoft, in which laptop computers are leased to students. In early March, the Microsoft chairman, William H. Gates, visited her class. "He seemed like the person from down the block, who just happens to be the richest man in the world," she said.
And how has Ms. Gordon coped with a salary that, this year, is about $31,000? She's still living at home. And sometimes she wonders about all the money she could make on Wall Street. But then she pulls out a stack of valentines from her students. "I don't think $100,000 would make me feel as good as these do," she said.
Though her posture is ramrod straight and her clothes are Ivy League tweed, Ms. Gordon has encouraged her students to loosen up a bit as they learn. On a recent morning, she asked them to report on the status of their forthcoming presentations on the ancient kingdoms of Africa.
"We're still getting a rhythm for the rap we're going to do," said one boy from the group researching Nubia.
"Nubian rappers?" Ms. Gordon responded, her smile quizzical. "I wonder if they were around at that time?"
Her students say they appreciate that she speaks often of growing up in a poor neighborhood, not unlike theirs, the daughter of a single mother from Jamaica.
"She can relate to us," said Evelyn Perez, 11. "She's very determined to succeed. She has accomplished a lot. It's very encouraging."
 
A Dream Realized
If Teach for America has shown school districts the rich rewards of aggressive recruiting, then the DeWitt Wallace-Readers Digest program has taught them that their most qualified candidates may have been under their noses all along.
That was true of Kathy Moran, who for 20 years labored virtually unnoticed as a teacher's aide in a succession of special education classrooms in inner-city Pittsburgh.
About a half-million aides, or paraprofessionals, hold such jobs nationally, and their role is to ease the burden of the classroom teacher by, say, reading with a slower student or escorting the class to the playground.
Often, the heart of a classroom teacher beats within the teacher's aide. But more often than not, that ambition is squelched by the challenge of attending college -- and, in many cases, returning to high school first -- to collect the requisite degrees and education courses to be promoted.
Ms. Moran, now 41, was mired in just such a rut. The daughter of a mechanic and a school secretary who graduated to teaching herself, Ms. Moran grew up in Pittsburgh and dropped out of Indiana University in Indiana, Pa., in 1976. She had been there less than two years and had no idea what to do with her life.
Two years later, she found part-time work as an aide in a special education classroom in a Pittsburgh elementary school, and a light went on.
"Just seeing what they did," she said of the teachers and the pupils, who overcame any number of physical and emotional barriers, "enlightened me."
Although she then knew she wanted to lead her own classroom, she saw no easy way to get there. Married to a bank maintenance worker who, like her, was earning little more than minimum wage, she had no resources to pay for the 90 additional credits (or 30 courses) that she needed. And so Ms. Moran enrolled in a community college at night, taking one or two courses a year, as well as working full-time as a classroom aide and often part-time as a department store cashier.
"I was real frustrated," Ms. Moran said. "It was always not too far away. I could almost put my hand on it. But I couldn't.
"Still," she added, "I was determined to finish."
Fifteen years later, in 1993, she had 60 credits -- 30 more than she had left college with, but still 60 shy of a degree.
Then, she said, fate finally smiled: she learned that Readers Digest was doling out millions of dollars to education schools to turn teachers' aides into teachers. All tuition was covered. And one such program was at Indiana University, the same school Ms. Moran had left. Ms. Moran was one of 85 paraprofessionals in the Pittsburgh schools who applied for 36 available spots. To her delight, she was accepted.
Edwina Vold, who oversees the program at Indiana, said Ms. Moran and her classmates bring enormous gifts, because they are "unafraid of the inner city" and "have very few stereotypes about the children they are working with."
One night last August, only three months after graduating with her degree in elementary education, Ms. Moran endured a sleepless night. She knew that the following morning, she would stride into a classroom that was her very own -- for the first time in her career.
"I was bouncing off ideas and writing notes," she said. "It was excitement."
The months since have been a challenge. Ms. Moran has sole responsibility for a classroom of 21 second graders at the Weil Technology Institute, a red brick fortress in the middle of the struggling Hill District. Only 4 of every 100 pupils at the school has two parents at home. From the window of Ms. Moran's classroom, she can see an overgrown, vacant lot filled with tall weeds.
Inside her class, behind its bright yellow door, the learning is often bumpy. Standing 5 feet 10 inches, but seeming far taller, Ms. Moran uses her booming voice as she patrols the rows of tan, open-top desks.
"Shawn, sit down!" she intoned the other day. "Turn your paper over and do it the right way!"
But a moment later, she had another boy clutched in a bear hug. "Tie your shoe," she told him softly. "Don't break your neck."
So far, the combination of good cop and bad cop seems to be working.
"If we're bad, she makes us stay after school and gives us a lot of work," Darren Scott, 8, related over a lunch of ham and cheese and fruit cocktail. "And every time we win a game, she gives us a treat."
Though imploring her students to improve has often been frustrating, Ms. Moran says she wouldn't ever want to return to her former, subordinate role.
"How can I put it?" she said the other day, the stern expression she shows her class finally dissolving into a smile. "This is a blessing for me."
 
A Guardian Angel
If Kathy Moran's path to the classroom seemed as long as a marathon, then Tammy Reynolds's was a sprint.
Mrs. Reynolds decided in her sophomore year at Ohio University that she wanted to be a teacher. Over the next two years, she took more than a dozen traditional education courses, with titles like "Classroom Management" and "Multimedia in the Classroom," and even logged several months as a student teacher in a first- grade class.
Last spring, she and her professors believed she was ready, and she graduated with a bachelor's degree in elementary education.
But in August, after her first day as a seventh-grade mathematics teacher at Westview Middle School, in a middle-class suburb of Charleston, S.C., Mrs. Reynolds went home and wept. Lucky for her, her school district had assigned her a guardian angel.
Mindful that many teachers drop out of teaching early in their careers -- many of them midway through the first year -- the South Carolina Legislature last year required districts to establish intensive mentoring programs for new teachers. While recruiting has been a high priority in many states for some years, it's only recently that states have begun to focus on the next steps: retention and staff development.
So many things had unnerved the 22-year-old rookie on her first day. At 5 feet 3 inches, she was shorter than most of her students, including several who played junior varsity football at the local high school. ("It was very threatening," she said.) When she gave out her first homework assignment, she said she was met with "rolled eyes.
I missed the hugs of my first graders," she said. "I got a lot of sarcasm." Within weeks, Mrs. Reynolds was wondering whether she had made the right career choice.
To help her over such patches, Westview Middle School had made her well-being the responsibility of Lee Ann Coleman, 33, a nine-year veteran who had known since the age of 13, when she all but received a vision in an evangelical church service, that her life's work was to teach.
Meeting before and after school, Mrs. Coleman tutored her pupil in any number of areas. She helped Mrs. Reynolds establish classroom rules, as basic as when her students would be permitted bathroom breaks. She guided her through the writing of a yearlong lesson plan. And
she staged a mock evaluation interview, playing the role of the principal.
"There were little things she doesn't even know she did," Mrs. Reynolds said. "For example, I was always really tired all the time. My husband was like, 'You must be sick.' But Lee Ann said, 'That's normal. It's O.K. You're tired because of the stress and the workload and because your immune system is not used to being around all these kids.' "
Slowly, Mrs. Reynolds's confidence has grown. Last November, she was confronted with her most challenging behavioral problem: a student who insisted on banging his head against a cabinet as a way to get attention.
"I asked the rest of the class, 'Raise your hand if you want this student to be in the class,' " she recalled. "No one did."
"He felt bad," she said. "He asked if he could participate. So I said to him, 'Go and ask if anyone wants you in their group.' Finally, one person took him in."
There are still ups and downs, she says, but with the encouragement of her mentor, Mrs. Reynolds no longer thinks much about truncating her career.
"Whenever I start to get so bogged down with paperwork and I'm fed up with that one problem student," she said, "another student seems to come along and let you know how much you mean to him.
"There's more of those times than the bad times," she said. "I will hang in there."

In Vietnam, A New Approach To English

BYLINE: By David W. Chen 

 BODY:
Vietnam's English-language curriculum, hampered for decades by a lack of materials and trained teachers, is being revised for the first time in 17 years.
In a program run by Business Alliance for Vietnamese Education, a nonprofit organization based in Manhattan, all of Vietnam's 450,000 sixth graders in 1,560 public schools will receive a new textbook this year. Titled "English for Vietnam," it was developed by American and Vietnamese educators. Books for 7th and 10th graders are in the works, and by the year 2000, all of Vietnam's middle and high school students are to have textbooks. 
 Expected to be in schools in September, the new curriculum emphasizes participatory exercises involving audiotapes and role-playing, said Daniel W. Reese, director of the alliance.
The program, which will cost an estimated $1.2 million for the first year, is sponsored by corporations that have been active in Vietnam's rapidly growing economy, including Chase Manhattan, Citibank, McDonnell Douglas, Microsoft and Coca-Cola.
"This is a very important project for Vietnam," said Tran Khanh, a counselor with the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington, noting that English, not French, is now the country's official second language. "It will have very long-lasting impact on the younger generation of Vietnamese."

Can't Get Subsidies, Can't Buy, Can't Move

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
They live in a solidly middle-class area, opposite First Avenue from Peter Cooper Village and just a few blocks from Gramercy Park. And that is precisely the problem for tenants of 346 East 21st Street, nearly all of whom are low-income families who have lived in the rundown tenement for many years.
The 30-unit, six-story building is like thousands of others that fell to the city when previous owners abandoned them. But because of its location, city officials are refusing to offer tenants subsidies that might allow them to buy it, even though similar buildings in poorer neighborhoods generally qualify. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which appraised the building at $1.5 million, has given tenants until June 30 to come up with the money. If they can't, it will go on the open market, where a developer may be willing to pay far more than the appraisal figure. 
 "It's impossible," said Ed Delgado, president of No. 346's tenant association. He said 98 percent of residents had family incomes of less than $7,400 annually. "Who is going to give us a mortgage?"
Since 1994, building residents have tried to join the city's Tenant Interim Lease program, which would permit them to organize as a low-income cooperative and buy their units at low cost after a leasing period.
But the city has turned them down. A department spokeswoman, Cassandra Vernon, explained that the program "is a subsidy, not an entitlement," to be used only "when there is little chance for a private sale."
"But this building is located in a good area," where a private sale is likely, she added.
Mr. Delgado said that he had met with department officials several times but that the city had consistently turned down his requests for low-income tax credits and low-interest loans often offered to low-income apartment buyers in abandoned buildings elsewhere in the city.
Mr. Delgado declined to say how much apartments in the building rented for, but he acknowledged that rents were "very low." Tenants will continue to have rent protection if a private owner buys the building, but the cost of much-needed major capital improvements could be passed on to them. That, Mr. Delgado said, would probably force most tenants out.
"Many people are disabled or retired," he said, adding that the building is "racially mixed."
"It's not fair," he said. "If we were south of 14th Street, we would have gotten into a program."
Councilwoman Margarita Lopez agrees. Her district includes East 21st Street and the Lower East Side, the site of many subsidized buildings.
"I'm looking into the question of discrimination against poor people in a middle-class area," she said. "This building is the only one I know of between 14th and 35th Streets asking to join the Tenant Interim Lease program, and it's not getting it." BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report;
Right Time for an Inflation Hedge?

BYLINE: By ABBY SCHULTZ 

 BODY:
YAWN.
That is how investors have greeted the small crop of new mutual funds investing in inflation-indexed Government securities. 
 Since the securities were first offered, a little more than a year ago, only three retail funds specializing in them have been introduced. Together, the funds have just $26.6 million in assets, some of which is in inflation-indexed securities issued by other countries.
But now, precisely because inflation is so low, the cost of buying protection against its rise is about the cheapest it has been since the Government began issuing the securities in 1997. And that could make this the right choice at the right time for people seeking a conservative fixed-income investment.
"I can't say what inflation will be in 10 years, but inflation protection costs less now than it did," said David W. Schroeder, manager of one of the funds, the $5.2 million American Century-Benham Inflation-Adjusted Treasury fund.
According to Daniel S. Bernstein, director of research at Bridgewater Associates in Wilton, Conn., when the inflation-indexed securities were issued last year, inflation would have had to be 3.3 percent or more a year for the notes to earn a higher total return than traditional Treasury notes. Today, he said, inflation would have to be just 2 percent or more a year for them to do so.
"From a year ago to today, it just makes inflation-indexed bonds more attractive," he said.
If inflation does strike harder, these securities will offer better protection than traditional inflation hedges like commodities, precious metals, collectibles or real estate, said John B. Brynjolfsson, manager of the $7.7 million Pimco Real Return Bond fund, another of the funds specializing in inflation-indexed securities. That is because inflation-indexed notes not only guarantee that the principal of the securities will maintain today's purchasing power, by rising with inflation, but they also offer interest income, now about 3.7 percent for 10-year issues.
"That essentially means until the year 2008 you can lock in a 3.7 percent real return above inflation," Mr. Brynjolfsson said.
INSTITUTIONAL investors worldwide have bought most of the $39 billion in these securities that the United States Treasury has issued so far. Retail investors have been more reticent, and for several reasons.
The first, of course, is low inflation -- it is about 1.4 percent a year now, down from 3 percent at the time of the first, $7 billion offering of 10-year notes last year, and it shows no signs of picking up. Selling inflation-indexed bonds now is like "selling ice in the winter," said Michael Shamosh, chief fixed-income strategist at Gabriele Hueglin & Cashman, a New York brokerage firm.
Investors have also avoided the securities because of a tax on the so-called phantom income that accrues in the notes but is not passed on to investors until the security matures. Unlike regular Treasury notes and bonds, which have a fixed principal and a fixed coupon, the principal in an inflation-indexed bond is adjusted continually for inflation, as determined by monthly changes in the Consumer Price Index. If inflation were to rise 10 percent in a year, the principal of a $1,000 bond would adjust to $1,100 and holders would be taxed on the $100 gain as ordinary income, even though they had not pocketed the increase.
But it is most likely that individual investors have shied from inflation-linked funds because their returns have paled in comparison with those of other fixed-income funds, let alone the soaring returns of stock funds.
The average total return of the three retail funds -- the third is Brown Brothers Harriman's 59 Wall Street Inflation-Indexed Securities -- was 3.7 percent for the 12 months ended March 31, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. That is less than the 3.9 percent return of a Lehman Brothers index of the Treasury's inflation-indexed securities for the same period, and well below the 10.5 percent return of intermediate-term Government bond funds or the 7.4 percent return of short-term Government bond funds, Morningstar said.
The meager results reflect the fact that "real yields," or interest rates minus inflation, have risen and prices have fallen in the last 12 months. At the same time, yields on traditional bonds have fallen and prices have risen because inflation has continued to drop. The first 10-year inflation-indexed Treasury note, for instance, was priced at 101.05 percent of par value when American Century opened its fund on Feb. 10 last year; on April 1 this year, the note's price had fallen to 97 percent of par value -- although the loss was not quite as great as it seems because the par value had grown in line with inflation. The fund, meanwhile, returned 3.4 percent for the year ended March 31.
While this short-term record is lackluster, long-term investors should not be discouraged, said Mr. Schroeder, the fund's manager. "Folks should know that, over the short term, performance will be impacted by changes in real yields, while long-term performance will be impacted more by changes in inflation," he said.
That is a strong reason to take a look at these securities now, when the inflation protection is relatively cheap. The traditional 10-year Treasury note yields about 5.5 percent, while 10-year inflation-linked notes yield about 3.7 percent -- a difference of just under two percentage points. If inflation were 2 percent a year or higher for the next 10 years, the return on the inflation-indexed security would be higher than the return on the traditional 10-year note, Mr. Schroeder said.
Mr. Brynjolfsson's fund, Pimco Real Return Bond, is the best-performing of the three retail offerings. It had a total return of just over 4 percent for the 12 months ended March 31, according to Morningstar.
The manager uses several strategies to outperform the Lehman Brothers index of inflation-linked securities, including the buying of foreign inflation-indexed bonds -- other big issuers include Canada, New Zealand and Australia -- and securities issued by corporations and agencies in the United States.
The $13.7 million 59 Wall Street Inflation-Indexed Securities fund also invests overseas and in corporate issues. Only American Century sticks solely with United States Government issues.
All these funds will have the opportunity to lock in inflation protection over a longer period on Wednesday, when the Treasury Department auctions $8 billion in 30-year inflation-indexed securities.

How a Few Leapfrogged the Rest

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
WHAT a way to start the year. United States stock fund managers seized hold of the red-hot equity market and the best delivered returns as high as 24 percent, with only five diversified funds losing money in the first quarter.
The average return of 11.2 percent, however, still trailed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which returned 13.9 percent for the quarter. 
 It was a trio of takeovers that landed Mark A. Coffelt, manager of Texas Capital Value's Value and Growth fund, at the top of the group in the first quarter, with a return of 24.3 percent. Other managers in the quarter's top 10 for United States diversified stock funds with $30 million or more in assets were Thomas F. Marsico, formerly of Janus Capital, who started Marsico Focus on Jan. 1; Mark G. Seferovich, manager of Waddell & Reed Growth, and Arden C. Armstrong, who manages MAS Institutional Mid-Cap Growth.
The three oldest of these funds also made the top 20 list for the last 12 months.
How did these winning managers achieve their gains? Three of the four have concentrated their investments in so few stocks that their winning picks had a particularly big impact in the quarter. The fourth scurried to avoid earnings disasters. Here, the managers discuss their good fortune and look forward to the rest of the year.
 
Where Takeovers Rule
Mr. Coffelt uses a quantitative approach to figure companies' worth if they were taken over, depending on their profitability, growth in business, leverage and current interest rates.
He hit the bull's-eye in the first quarter when 3 of the 35 companies in the Value and Growth portfolio of Texas Capital Value Funds rose on takeover news, helping to propel the fund into first place for that period and into second for the 12 months, with a return of 77.16 percent.
"It's unusual to get that many takeovers in one quarter, although typically we get many throughout the year," said Mr. Coffelt, who has run the fund, with $60 million in assets, since its inception in 1995. Acquisitions of Medusa, a cement company, and the Money Store were announced in the quarter, and the acquisition of Oregon Metallurgical was completed at the end of March.
Mr. Coffelt screens the 1,700 stocks tracked by the Value Line Investment Survey, rating them on such criteria as earnings growth, cash flow and book value. He then estimates each stock's intrinsic value and tries to buy at a discount.
He sells shares when he thinks the companies are fully valued, as he did with Tommy Hilfiger last quarter when its shares reached $60. He also dumps companies that add debt to their balance sheet or whose earnings shift direction, or when he finds a better bargain elsewhere.
Mr. Coffelt is a believer in beneficence. He donates part of his management fee to charities designated by his shareholders. And the fund will waive its usual initial sales charge for investors who transfer money from another fund.
 
Powered by Ford
Mr. Marsico says pure and simple stock selection was the key to his fund's 23.1 percent return and fourth-place finish in its own first quarter.
"It came from a broad base of industries because, in managing a focused fund, you need that to diversify risk," he said. The young fund holds just 24 stocks; the top 10 make up 60 percent of the portfolio.
"We're looking for companies that are improving their return on assets and equity and building a stable growth platform for the future, usually including a global growth opportunity," he said.
His biggest holding is the Ford Motor Company, which makes up 11.2 percent of the fund. Ford has been increasing its cash position to weather a downturn in its core car business, as well as liquidating some peripheral assets, Mr. Marsico said.
Another winner was Dell Computer, the fund's second-largest holding, at 8.5 percent. The company is profiting from its direct distribution model, Mr. Marsico said, and he expects earnings to grow annually over the next three years as Dell moves into the less competitive markets for servers and work stations.
Looking ahead, Mr. Marsico is bullish on the stock market.
"I'm seeing earnings growth of about 10 to 12 percent for United States companies over the next 12 to 18 months and interest rates falling below 5 percent," he said, "which would mean the market is undervalued at these levels."
 
Three Stocks With Punch
"What drove the quarter was telecommunications stocks," said Mr. Seferovich, who has managed the $350 million Waddell & Reed Growth fund since its inception in 1992. He owns just 56 stocks, with the top 10 making up one-third of the fund. Annual turnover is a low 35 percent.
Mr. Seferovich devoted 10 percent of his portfolio to three telecommunications stocks, each of which turned in a stellar quarter that helped the fund return 22.2 percent, for a sixth-place finish in the three months, and 65.4 percent in the 12 months, for 18th place.
Colt Telecommunications, a British company traded as an American depository receipt, doubled in price. Colt offers bundled fiber optic cable for combined voice-data-video transmission in big European cities and, because it invests in advanced equipment, it can provide services much more cheaply than local telephone companies, Mr. Seferovich said. Its customer growth is increasing, but Colt has yet to report a profit.
"They spend like crazy on infrastructure; the revenues will come later," he said.
He also made a lot of money in Intermedia Communications, a similar company operating in the southeastern United States.
His third telecommunications holding is America Online, whose stock rose 50 percent in the quarter. "They successfully diversified revenues from subscriptions to E-commerce and advertising," he said.
Among his other winners were Williams-Sonoma, the catalogue retailer. The company brought in outside managers to fix its distribution system, and that paid off in unexpectedly strong earnings, he said.
As for the year's strong start, Mr. Seferovich is doubtful it can be maintained. Instead, he figures that 1998 will have up-and-down quarters.
"I don't see a continuous stair-step pattern," he said. "We haven't had one in two years and I don't expect to see one now."
 
The Earnings Test
Keeping a keen eye on earnings helped Ms. Armstrong and her $450 million MAS Institutional Mid-Cap Growth fund grab the top spot for the 12 months, on a return of 77.18 percent, and ninth place for the quarter, at 20.7 percent.
"When the Asian crisis hit late last year, our strategy for 1998 was to avoid earnings misses, which would be more pervasive because of Asia," she said. "So we were brutal about going through the portfolio and tossing out anything we thought had earnings risk." She moved out of export, personal computer, economically sensitive and aggressive companies and into more stable domestic businesses.
Ms. Armstrong did especially well with media, broadcasting and cable companies, she said, including Panamsat, a private satellite company, and Outdoor Systems, a billboard company. Her fund owns 90 stocks, and the top 10 represent 21 percent of the portfolio.
"We spend a lot of time thinking about profitability and cash flow," Ms. Armstrong said, adding that she likes a company with excess cash because it can reinvest in the business and thereby sustain growth. "If Microsoft were small-cap," she said, "I'd buy it."
Instead, she owns BMC Software, a data base management software company, and Network Associates, a specialist in anti-virus software.
Ms. Armstrong is confident the market for smaller stocks will move ahead, even if it slips occasionally, given forecasts of slower economic growth and lower interest rates. "As long as cyclical stocks have earnings risk, people will go for growth stocks," she said. "The real risk to the stock market is a sustained rise in interest rates."
The fund ordinarily has a retail minimum of $5 million, which tags it an "institutional" fund, but it is available for a $2,500 initial purchase through fund supermarkets.

Fickle and Faithful Formulas

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
MUTUAL fund portfolios are as different as the investors who create them. Some are positioned to reflect the market outlook three years from now; others take a closer view. Some use contrarian strategies, and some work hard to reduce the portfolio's risk levels. Some play market momentum; still others bet on unusual opportunities or historical patterns.
Such differences in the hypothetical retirement portfolios created by five professional money managers for The New York Times go a long way to explain the range in their returns for the first quarter this year. All the managers came in winners, gaining 7.23 percent to 11 percent. But none outpaced the market proxy, the Vanguard Index 500 fund, or even the average of all stock funds, because they held small or emerging markets stocks along with the large United States stocks that dominated the list of leaders in the first three months of the year. 
 Holding a diversified portfolio for the long term as market favorites come and go can be hard to live with day to day. "Long-term investing is my mantra and my faith, but I will admit that, about now, 'long-term' seems interminable," said Harold R. Evensky, a financial adviser in Coral Gables, Fla.
(Rather than publishing this retirement portfolio horse race once a year, as readers and managers were told last quarter, The Times has decided to continue presenting it each quarter.)
Looking long term, Mr. Evensky had carefully created a diverse portfolio that was held back by its big stake in small overseas companies and emerging-market stocks as well as by its holdings in domestic small stocks. The portfolio placed third among the five, returning 8.94 percent in the quarter.
He was also hurt by an 11 percent stake in Barr Rosenberg Market Neutral, which started in mid-December and was flat for the quarter. "I can't say we're happy," Mr. Evensky said, although he noted that the return was not out of line with the performance of similar investment portfolios run by Barr Rosenberg.
"My job is to plan for a lifetime, and my concerns include risk as well as returns," he said. "The portfolio is well-diversified and run by world-class managers, so damn the torpedoes and full steam ahead!"
His only change is to replace the Yacktman Fund with Wilshire Large Cap Growth, an index fund. "Don Yacktman is too often in cash and his investment style is tending too much toward value," Mr. Evensky said.
IN first place for the quarter was Jack A. Brill, a San Diego money manager who steers a "socially responsible" course. Mr. Brill's portfolio rose 11 percent, mostly because of its bias toward large-cap stocks, he said. He plans no changes.
"My portfolio contains a good mix of growth styles and defensive funds for the high market volatility I expect this year," he said.
Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y., retains the overall lead among the five managers, with a gain of 128.4 percent since the contest began on July 7, 1993. The five portfolios have risen an average of 107.6 percent since then, compared with a 176.5 percent return for the Vanguard Index 500, which mimics the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each quarter by Lipper Analytical Services of Summit, N.J. It excludes sales charges, transaction costs and taxes because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred accounts. The five managers can choose any fund open to new investors. From the outset, they were asked to pick portfolios that would grow for 20 years.
While Mr. Jacobs leads long term, he trailed the other four managers for the quarter, with a return of 7.23 percent -- in large part, he said, because he had made the portfolio more conservative when The Times told him he would be making only annual changes. Now that he is back to quarterly reporting, he is bolstering his large-cap stock allocation and generally taking a more bullish stance.
To that end, he has dropped Heartland Value Plus and USAA Tax-Exempt Intermediate, which together had totaled one-quarter of the portfolio, and added a 20 percent chunk of Vanguard Total Stock Market, an index fund. "I've been gradually trying to switch over to index funds, which I think are superior in the long run because of their lower expenses," Mr. Jacobs said.
He chose this fund over Vanguard's S.& P. 500 fund because Total Stock Market holds small- and midcap stocks in addition to bigger ones, more closely mimicking the overall market. "To me, the whole concept of an index fund is not to make any judgments on the market," he said.
Mr. Jacobs also added a 10 percent position in Marsico Focus, one of the quarter's top performers. Thomas F. Marsico, formerly of Janus Capital, was doing a great job with a similar fund there, Mr. Jacobs said: "Now he can take the same strategy and start all over."
Eric M. Kobren, president of Kobren Insight Group in Wellesley, Mass., runs a portfolio of all-Fidelity funds that gained 8.87 percent in the quarter, taking fourth place among the five money managers.
Mr. Kobren is selling his 20 percent stakes in the Low-Priced Stock and Mid-Cap Stock funds, replacing them with two new Fidelity funds: Small-Cap Stock (20 percent) and Contrafund II (10 percent).
"While we would not recommend buying new funds simply because they are new, our research does show that new Fidelity stock funds tend to outperform their mature counterparts during their first and second years of operation," Mr. Kobren said. "Though larger Fidelity funds are forced to take a more sector-oriented approach to investing, these new funds can focus on the type of bottom-up stock-picking that has helped other Fidelity funds to outperform their competitors in years past."
He also doubled the position in Fidelity International Value, to 20 percent, on the theory that most international markets are attractive relative to United States valuations.
Susan Dziubinski, editor of Morningstar Investor in Chicago, took second place among the managers, with a gain of 9.82 percent. She is making no changes to her portfolio, which includes a big chunk of international stocks to help counteract a possible slowdown in the United States. Those holdings fared well largely because of a heavy investment in European companies. Her portfolio also includes small-cap issues that did well in the quarter.
Her only loser was Oppenheimer Real Asset, which fell 9.6 percent, in large part because of falling oil prices. But she's sticking with it. "The fund acts as a hedge against inflation and the stock market because it's more like a commodity play," Ms. Dziubinski said.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
Productivity as the Catalyst of Prosperity

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
LIKE scientists poring over a petri dish and quarreling about what the microscope shows, economists these days have been squinting at the "new era" economy to spot a sign -- any sign -- of the kind of growth that really matters. Yes, output is swelling and jobs are multiplying, the stock market is robust and inflation dormant. But what about productivity?
After all, a steady rise in output per employee is an essential enzyme for a strong economy. Without it, gross domestic product gains and job growth won't bring the higher standard of living associated with national prosperity. 
 And is productivity finally growing beyond the paltry annual average of 1 percent or so of the last two decades? That's what the optimists and the pessimists are slugging out.
In "Prosperity: The Coming 20-Year Boom and What It Means to You" (Times Books, $27.50), Bob Davis and David Wessel ultimately side with the optimists, even though they don't see many productivity gains yet.
Instead, in this engrossing, well-reported book, the authors -- both economics correspondents at The Wall Street Journal -- argue that during the next 20 years, computerization will finally deliver its long-awaited productivity payoff.
They also predict the blooming of a widely shared prosperity, a result of this productivity spurt, broader post-secondary education and -- get this -- globalization.
"The next 10 to 20 years will see the flowering of an era," they write, "in contrast to the economic disappointments of the past 25."
All this, of course, fights the gloomier view that technology and globalization will only widen the gap between the rich and the rest of the country. But Mr. Davis and Mr. Wessel, whose book grew out of issues they covered in 1995, set out to prove that history is on their side.
Drawing on company archives and on the work of economists like Paul David at Stanford University, the authors maintain that computers are where electricity was at the turn of the century: a nifty new technology but not yet used well enough to affect productivity.
Not until the 1920's, they say, did electricity produce sizable productivity gains.
To argue their point, the authors take a fascinating trip to turn-of-the-century Newton, Iowa, where the Maytag company was making farm machines. Shaft-and-belt systems (yesterday's mainframes) were just yielding clumsily to individual motors (read, desktops) in the factory, and Thomas Edison aggressively marketed new systems that weren't really ready. The big debate was over alternating versus direct current, the Mac-versus-PC fight of that era.
Slowly, though, electricity spread to become a fact instead of a feature of production. By the 1920's, Maytag was churning out affordable washing machines in Newton, while Ford cars were zipping off the assembly line in Detroit. It takes decades for technology to produce prosperity, the authors say, as they trace similar stop-and-start progress in computerization.
And why will the wealth from computerization be so widely spread? Because of more widely available post-secondary education, the authors say, notably at the nation's 1,100 community colleges.
THESE schools are largely unappreciated by state legislators, the authors lament, even though "what goes on at a school like Cuyahoga Community College, in Cleveland and similar institutions across the country is more important to the American middle class than what happens at Harvard."
Such colleges, now with five million students, prepare new and displaced workers for the technology-heavy economy to come. And as such employees flood the job market, the premium price paid for "educated" workers will start to disappear and the now-widening income gap will narrow.
That is what happened in the 1920's, the authors show, when high schools, once thought a luxury, were regularly graduating working-class students instead of just the college-bound children of the elite.
Computers will ultimately require less expertise anyway, the authors say, thanks to ease-of-use inventions incubated in the Army and the world of the disabled.
As for the effects of globalization, Mr. Davis and Mr. Wessel use reporting and reasoning that are a bit less reassuring, though still respectable. They try to show why foreign investment is a boon in places like Tennessee, why imports are prosperity's allies and why free trade is not anti-worker, as it is often painted. Computer programmers in Bangalore, India, won't take cutting-edge software contracts away from Americans; such offshore programming is grunt work, not innovation. (To be fair, the authors acknowledge that pundits once talked this way about Japanese manufacturers.)
"We could be wrong, of course," they say about their prosperity theory. A major war could wreck global trade, they note, or the Federal Reserve might unwisely put the brakes on the economy, or China and India could turn into Japanese-style competition for America.
But if some of the book's premises seem more solid than others, no matter. "Prosperity" pulls together many threads to become a primer of sorts, a framework for figuring out how an economy could work for everyone.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Shirkers Unite! Tomorrow Is Your Day

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

 BODY:
STUCK in a dead-end job? Spend your days answering the phone, fetching cappuccino for your superiors and making abstract sculptures of paper clips?
Why not do your bit for the oppressed workers of the world and call in sick tomorrow? 
 At least that is what a group called Rtmark, whose name is a joke version of "registered trademark," suggests. In announcing what it says is the first "Phone In Sick Day" in the United States, the group, a shadowy anti-corporate organization based in California, is urging people to show their dissatisfaction with the rat race by playing hooky from the office.
"The capitalist world treats humans as machines, so why shouldn't we treat them as machines, too?" said a spokesman for the group, who identified himself only as Ray T.
Mr. T., who plans to come down tomorrow with a fake illness that will keep him away from his own job at a law firm, says he is optimistic that thousands of people will likewise phone in sick. A prominent supporter of the action is Andrei Codrescu, the National Public Radio commentator and poet, who announced in a recent on-the-air commentary that he planned to not work tomorrow, especially if he felt particularly well.
In an interview, Mr. Codrescu said that on his day of nonwork, he planned "to get up without any idea of what I'm going to do or where I'm going to end up -- take a few buses to nowhere, maybe having romantic or violent adventures along the way."
Mr. Codrescu's unstructured day will not affect his work at N.P.R., though; Ellen Weiss, the executive producer of "All Things Considered," the program on which he is featured, said he had already submitted his next two commentaries.
The American phone-in sick day is part of a larger worldwide campaign led by Decadent Action -- a British group that calls itself a "consumer terrorist organization" -- which called for a one-day sickout last year in Britain. It is not clear how effective the action was, though the group contended that 2,000 workers at British Airways called in sick.
A spokeswoman for British Airways said that the company "had no record of that," but added that 2,000 to 3,000 employees did phone in sick during a work stoppage a couple of months later, and that perhaps the group was just taking credit.
What is the point of calling in sick?
"Generally, work is something everybody hates," said a spokesman for Decadent Action, who identified himself only as Ian H. "It's the working class that hates their jobs the most because they have the least power, the lowest wages and the least interesting jobs."
By refusing to work, said Mr. H., who is now unemployed after three years as a civil servant in London, even the lowliest workers can demonstrate that they hold economic power. For every sick day in Britain, employers lose between $112 and $128 in average wages for each worker, as well as two to three times as much in lost production and labor value, Decadent Action said. Last year, the group said, Britain lost 187 million working days to sickness.
"Currently, phoning in sick in the country costs between $19.2 billion and $20.8 billion a year," he said proudly. Rtmark estimates that sick days in the United States cost employers "hundreds of billions of dollars," but there's no official tally.
One problem with calling in sick, though, is how lame an excuse sounds. "If you kill off your grandmother more than three times your boss might get suspicious," Mr. H. said. "Back pain is great, because it's not provable by either your doctor or your boss," he continued. "Things like depression are hard to prove or disprove, and it's fairly easy to fake the symptoms."
An unearned day of rest will be most effective, of course, for people who don't have a lot to lose -- people who aren't raising families or paying off mortgages, for instance. But Rtmark says that even people who must go to work can make the most of the day by sabotaging their job from within. Some steps it suggests include ordering subscriptions, in the boss's name, to munitions magazines and speaking "in a bad English accent all day."
Business groups in the United States shrugged off the attempt at insurrection. Joe Davis, spokesman for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said, "Our response to those guys who are doing the national phone-in sick day: Get a job."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report;
Hey, Let's Put on a Fund! But Why 8,000 of Them?

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
LAST year, some big wheel at a mutual fund firm had a brilliant idea: "Let's start a fund to invest in growing companies."
Unfortunately, dozens of other executives at dozens of other mutual fund companies had the same brain wave. And dozens more decided to clone growth funds they already had. 
 Which is why the fund trackers at Lipper Analytical Services have added 163 growth funds to their data bases just since the end of 1996. The addition of those funds to the more than 800 Lipper already listed means that it now tracks 988 growth funds -- almost double the number just four years ago.
Do investors need nearly 1,000 growth funds? Do they need anywhere from 5,800 to 8,000 stock and bond funds (depending on who's counting)? Can they make heads or tails of all of these funds?
No, no and no.
So what in the world is the fund industry thinking?
Given that the very fund companies that have spawned this overpopulation are now trying to sell Americans advice about how to narrow their choices, investors could be forgiven for believing that the fund explosion is a plot hatched by some evil genius.
But alas for overwhelmed investors, no superhero can save the day; there is no single madman-cum-mastermind directing the fund explosion from a secret lair. Nor, however, are fund companies creating ever more funds out of a magnanimous desire to benefit investors.
No, the proliferation of mutual funds is dictated by the realities of mutual funds as a business -- as opposed to an investment -- during America's greatest bull market ever.
Keep in mind, to begin with, that old mutual funds seldom disappear, even if they have performed poorly. Some get merged into better performers, especially if they are the bad actors in a big fund family, but whole families of funds with dismal performance manage to keep going for years. Consider, for example, the three appalling Steadman funds, which still exist even though their proprietor is dead, and which lost 30 to 80 percent over the last five years.
In addition, starting a fund has become increasingly simple, as long as you know a good lawyer. Indeed, a would-be fund manager can hire outside companies to do everything from answering phones to pricing a portfolio. Fund supermarkets, like the big one run by Charles Schwab & Company, also make it possible to get a fund into investors' hands without a big marketing organization. In fact, a fund company can even hire outsiders to manage the investments, leading to what Neil Bathon of the Financial Research Corporation, which analyzes the mutual fund industry, calls "the virtual fund company."
All of which makes it easier for people to create wacky funds in the spirit of those old Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney "Hey, kids, let's put on a show" movies. One such innovation is the Motorsports Growth and Income Fund, which opened last month in the hopes of attracting Nascar fans by investing in companies with even the most tenuous link to auto racing, from Adolph Coors to Winnebago Industries.
Investors, however, do not seem to flock to such offbeat items. For example, the Pauze Tombstone fund, which came to life last year in order to invest in what it calls "the death care sector of the economy," has only about $4 million of assets, much of which was contributed by a funeral home, according to the fund's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
But the bulk of the growth in the industry comes not from little fund families, but from the big ones.
Often, they are not really creating a new fund but merely replicating an old one over and over, with different fees to appeal to different "distribution channels," as the industry puts it, like traditional stock brokers, financial planners, 401(k) retirement plans, the bundles of funds called wrap accounts and even direct marketing. These different versions of the same fund -- often called A, B and C classes -- account for thousands of relatively new funds. Indeed, Lipper estimates that, on average, there are almost two funds for every underlying portfolio.
When fund companies add new portfolios, they seldom do so because of a new investing premise. Instead, they often add funds merely to round out their product lines, said A. Michael Lipper, the fund tracker's president, who notes much growth in municipal bond and foreign funds. Fund companies feel that "you're not for real unless you have international" funds, he added.
This may make sense to the fund executives, but is unlikely to fool professional investors, who pick money managers for their expertise in a specific area. And many fund companies that have great track records at home can stumble badly overseas: witness the poor performance of Strong International Stock over the last five years.
The rise of 401(k) plans and financial planners has also prompted fund companies to create more funds, because they want to have an offering for each of the investment styles now in vogue, noted Geoff H. Bobroff, a consultant to the fund business who is based in East Greenwich, R.I. Morningstar Inc., the Chicago firm that analyzes funds, uses nine categories for diversified stock funds, based on the size of the companies in which they invest and whether they shop for growth or value stocks.
Even as this approach catches on with the public, sophisticated investors are starting to move away from a rigid adherence to styles. "Increasingly, rather than focusing as much on style, we are focusing on the quality of the manager," said Craig Litman, a principal at Litman/Gregory Fund Advisors, which analyzes funds and manages two. "Because there are so many more managers now, there are fewer standouts."
Of course, a new idea occasionally becomes popular in fund land. When that happens, a lot of fund families jump on the bandwagon. Many new funds of the last year fall into one of two categories: concentrated portfolios, which own 50 or fewer stocks, and so-called tax-advantaged funds, which invest with tax consequences of their trades in mind.
Investors can make the process of picking a fund slightly more manageable by screening out those that do not meet certain standards. Mr. Litman, for example, suggests demanding that a fund's manager have at least a three-year track record; do-it-yourselfers could also eliminate funds that charge the commissions known as loads, or have big annual expenses. But in the case of the 1,000-odd growth funds, the only way to get the number under 100 is to demand that the funds also appear in the top performance quartile; even so, an investor would still have to investigate 80 funds.
One industry watcher has suggested, only partly in jest, that mutual funds be regulated as if they were taxi medallions: if you want to start a new one, you must first put an old one out of its misery.
Regulators are unlikely to go for this, but there is something else that could force down the number of new funds: a bear market. As the chart above shows, funds have proliferated virtually in lockstep with the rise in the Dow. For some overwhelmed investors, a halt to that climb might almost seem worth it.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Flying High on The Option Express

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
CORPORATE America's numbers took off last year, with earnings climbing 11 percent and stocks surging 33 percent. But those results were merely booster rockets for executive pay.
According to an analysis conducted for The New York Times of the compensation of chief executives at America's biggest companies, average total pay, made up mostly of salary, bonuses and the present value of stock options, was $8.7 million in 1997. For those who were also in office in 1996, pay soared 37.8 percent. 
Some of that gain came from higher salaries and bonuses, which on average rose 12.3 percent, to $2.1 million. By contrast, wages for the average American worker increased 3.5 percent.
But the biggest thrust behind higher chief executive pay was new grants of stock options, which give recipients the right to buy shares at a set price for a specified period. More than half the executives received stock-option grants last year worth more than $5 million apiece. Large grants pushed several pay packages to more than $50 million.
How fast is pay rising? Graef Crystal, the compensation specialist who conducted the analysis for The Times, found that in 1997, roughly one in 10 chief executives had pay packages worth at least $20 million. A year earlier, it was one in 40. (The analysis included 279 of the 500 biggest publicly held companies in the United States -- all those that had reported by March 24 on 1997 pay )
"C.E.O. pay has been rising so quickly for several years now that it has lost its shock value for many people," said Mr. Crystal, a former compensation consultant who is editor of a San Diego-based newsletter on executive pay called The Crystal Report and the author of six books on the subject. "But these pay packages are, by any conceivable measure, enormous, and are prompting many people to take a hard, second look at stock options."
The best-compensated executives last year included Sanford I. Weill, the chief executive of the Travelers Group. Rewarded for consistently strong performance with consistently high pay, he received stock options last year with a current value of $142 million, according to Mr. Crystal's analysis.
Other chief executives who were granted option packages worth more than $50 million were Louis V. Gerstner Jr. of I.B.M., George M. C. Fisher of Eastman Kodak and L. Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco International.
While expanding pay packages have prompted warnings in recent years of an anti-business backlash, those warnings have often been drowned out by the celebration of a healthy economy and a booming stock market. But now, the complaints are getting a little louder, and perhaps harder for management to ignore.
What most upsets critics is that under the current system, huge option packages enrich high achievers as well as so-so performers. To correct that, the Council of Institutional Investors, whose members include Fidelity Investments and large public pension funds, proposed last week that incentive pay should be structured so that executives cash in only if they outperform the overall market. In particular, they are attacking the practice of repricing options downward, which lets executives reap windfalls even after their company's stock falls.
"I'm starting to get a little cynical about all this," said Nell Minow, a principal at Lens, a shareholder-activist fund based in Washington. "C.E.O. land is a world like Lake Wobegon, where all of the children are above average."
In rare cases, options were not the main factor in last year's outsized pay packages. For example, Occidental Petroleum's chief executive, Ray R. Irani, received compensation totaling $108.2 million -- the bulk of it a $95 million one-time payment to cancel his previous contract, which had guaranteed lavish pay and included an unusual automatic-renewal feature. His new contract is based more on performance.
Many companies highlighted by Mr. Crystal's analysis, including Travelers, disputed his valuations of new stock option grants. Regulators give companies considerable freedom in how they value options; Mr. Crystal used a version of the widely accepted Black-Scholes model to analyze and compare options awards. Other companies, including Colgate Palmolive, noted that while their executives were awarded big option grants last year, they would not receive any more for several years.
WHATEVER immediate value is put on options, they are a gold mine for a chief executive, because they almost always carry no risk and generally can be exercised over a period of 10 years or so, ample time for the stock price to rise to profitable levels. They are typically easy to cash out, too. If, for example, an executive holds one million options exercisable at $10 and the market price rises to $30, he can typically borrow $10 million from his broker to buy the shares (with the company making up the difference), resell them for $30 million the same day, repay the loan and bank $20 million.
Certainly, options have transformed the world of executive pay over the last 10 years. In the mid-1980's, the typical chief executive of a large company made not much more than $1 million in combined salary and bonus. Many received stock option packages, too, but these were comparatively small.
But then option grants began to grow, in response to calls from activist shareholders that executive pay should be tied more closely to performance. Increasingly large option grants, combined with the bull market of many years, have created princely rewards.
MOREOVER, large companies now give out so many stock options that they typically represent 10 percent of a company's outstanding shares, or more. And while many of those options are given to lower-level workers, chief executives often get millions of options in a single year.
Over time, gains in their value have created hundreds of millions of dollars of wealth for a favored few. Roberto C. Goizueta, the chairman of the Coca-Cola Company who died last year, saw his worth rise above $1 billion with the help of options. Michael D. Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company, may soon be a billionaire, if he is not already there, Mr. Crystal said. (Disney's board hired Mr. Crystal as an adviser when it negotiated Mr. Eisner's latest contract in 1996.) Mr. Weill, the Travelers chairman, appears to have amassed about $700 million, largely through increases in the value of stock options, Mr. Crystal said.
Some celebrity chief executives, like William H. Gates of the Microsoft Corporation, are vastly richer than any of these executives, of course, but they started their companies; Messrs. Goizueta, Eisner and Weill did not.
The strong long-term performance of these and other executives in running their companies has tempered shareholder criticism of their pay packages. And in support of stock options, some compensation consultants note that it is not entirely coincidental that the nation's economy started its long run-up around the time that options came into broad usage.
"What is clearly true is that if you pay your management with stock-based incentives, they will be very motivated to do everything they can to get it right," said Ira T. Kay, global practice director for compensation consulting for Watson Wyatt and author of "C.E.O. Pay and Shareholder Value: Helping the U.S. Win the Global Economic War" (St. Lucie, 1998).
"On balance," Mr. Kay added, "these are very effective investments for the shareholder to make."
On the other hand, options dilute the value of stock purchased on the open market by increasing the number of shares outstanding and thus knocking down earnings per share.
One reason options are granted so freely is their accounting treatment. Corporations do not have to record stock options as a compensation expense on their income statements, and therefore they are not charged against earnings. When employees cash in their options, the cost to the company takes the form only of a greater number of shares outstanding. The company also gets a tax deduction. Efforts to change this favorable accounting treatment have met with fierce opposition from the business community.
While compensating executives with options was originally intended as a carefully calibrated lever to get better performance out of managers and companies, the willy-nilly approach to handing out options has undermined that goal, in the view of some critics.
Corporate boards give them to chief executives as a reward for a job well done and to spur even better performance, of course, but they also award them to underperforming executives as an incentive to work harder. Option packages are also used by companies to lure new talent, and to keep talent from leaving.
HOW promiscuously are options being ladled out? Mr. Crystal calculated that shareholder return accounted for just 9 percent of the variation in compensation for the 279 executives in his analysis; 16 percent of the variation was associated with the size of the company. The relatively low pay of C.E.O.'s who run utilities accounted for another 7 percent.
As for the other 68 percent of the variations in pay, he said, "your guess is as good as mine."
Among the 279 companies in his analysis, Mr. Crystal found only two cases with a clear connection between underperformance and low pay: those of William F. Hecht, chief executive of PP&L Resources, a Pennsylvania utility, and Eric Krasnoff, head of the Pall Corporation, a filter maker in East Hills, N.Y.
Under the two executives' stewardship, their companies underperformed both the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and their industry peers. They also received compensation packages that were low in comparison with the executives of companies of similar size and performance in Mr. Crystal's analysis -- $1 million in all for Mr. Hecht and $850,000 for Mr. Krasnoff.
The clear implication of the paucity of names in this category, Mr. Crystal said, is that many low performers were paid relatively well. But not extraordinarily well: only three names appeared on Mr. Crystal's list of highly paid chief executives whose stock has not fared well. That represents a smaller number in that category than he has seen in the past. "There is some moderation there," Mr. Crystal said.
Some high-profile chief executives have accumulated so many options over the years that the value of their holdings ballooned last year by $20 million or more, even though their companies trailed their peers' stock-market performance for the 1997 fiscal year. The value of Mr. Eisner's options rose $226.2 million in Disney's fiscal year, although his company underperformed the peer group identified by Disney in its proxy.
Other prominent chief executives who saw the value of their options rise by at least $24 million in fiscal year 1997, despite lagging performance within their industries, were Geoffrey C. Bible of Philip Morris, Scott G. McNealy of Sun Microsystems and John S. Reed of Citicorp.
Over their tenure in the top job, though, all 10 chief executives in that group run companies that have outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Some experts argue that as a company's stock rises over time, the size of option grants to top executives should actually shrink. The reason they give is that a $1 increase in the stock price represents a smaller percentage increase when the stock price is higher, so it is presumably easier for a chief executive to gain wealth from the same number of stock options.
"So many companies don't adjust their option grants," said Patrick S. McGurn, director of corporate programs for Institutional Shareholder Services in Bethesda, Md. "So it creates this escalator effect."
Many executives challenge that logic, arguing that they deserve more options because there is less upside in the stock and because, after all, they lifted the stock price in the first place.
Institutional shareholders are beginning to grumble a little more loudly about trends in executive pay.
The College Retirement Equities Fund, part of the $225 billion T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F. retirement system for educators, put forward a resolution at Disney's annual meeting in February demanding that the company reconfigure its board to achieve greater independence, especially on key committees dealing with issues like compensation. The resolution failed, but with 35 percent of the votes -- an unusually high proportion at a company that has performed well over time.
B. Kenneth West, a senior consultant for corporate governance for T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F., said the pension fund had also begun talking about drafting broad compensation guidelines for boards to follow.
"We would like to see a new calculus developed over time," Mr. West said. "Rather than discussing how much is too much, we can address principles and logic."
And the State of Wisconsin Investment Board took the unusual step last month of seeking publicity for its opposition to the practice at many faltering companies of lowering the price at which executives can buy shares. The Wisconsin board is trying to convince the S.E.C. to allow shareholders to put resolutions in companies' proxies that would prohibit such repricings without shareholder approval. Currently, such repricings are considered an ordinary business matter that does not require such permission.
At the meeting last week of the Council of Institutional Investors in Washington, many discussions focused on concerns that if the market turned down for a long period, executives would use repricing to insure that their pay did not fall along with it.
"If that happens," Mr. West said, "I think you'll see a great uprising."

GRAPHIC: Charts: "Pay Packages That Don't Discriminate on the Basis of Performance"
Compensation of the nation's highest-paid chief executives, including the present value of stock options granted in 1997, and their companies' stock- market performance during the executives' tenure.
 Chief executives with the largest gains in accumulated stock-option wealth in 1997 whose companies' stocks underperformed for the year those of the companies they identified as their peers. (Figures are based on a study for The New York Times by Graef Crystal, an expert on executive compensation, of the 279 companies among the nation's 500 largest that reported 1997 pay by March 24)(pg. 1)
 
"Outstanding in Their Field" lists chief executives in their current jobs for at least three years whose combined 1997 pay (including options granted) and three-year company stock performance distinguish them from their peers in The Times's study of 279 executives.
 
These figures are based on a study for The New York Times by Graef Crystal, an expert in executive compensation, of the 279 companies among the nation's 500 largest that reported 1997 pay by March 24.
 
Total direct compensation The sum of 1997 base salary; annual bonus; the present value of stock options granted, valued as of the date of grant; restricted stock awards, valued as of the date of grant; long-term incentive payments; other annual compensation, and all other compensation. Figures are from company proxies, except for stock-option values, which were calculated from proxy data using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model.
 
Percent above/below competitive pay Compares the executive's total direct compensation with what an average-paying company in the study would pay its chief executive if it were the same size and had the same stock-market performance as the company in question. The figures are adjusted in the case of power companies, which consistently pay their chief executives less than other companies.
 
Performance percentile rank Ranks the company against all others in the study by shareholder return (stock price appreciation plus reinvested dividends). Return was calculated for three time periods: fiscal years 1995-97, fiscal years 1996-97 and fiscal year 1997. Results for the three periods were combined into a single measure after giving the three-year period a weight of three, the two-year period a weight of two and the one-year period a weight of one. The company with the highest overall score was assigned a performance rank of 100, while the company with the lowest score received a rank of 0. Blending three time periods minimizes anomalies, such as a single exceptionally bad or good year for the company's stock that may have little to do with the chief executive's job performance.
 
To appear in this chart, chief executives had to rank in the top or the bottom quarter of performance in each of the three time windows. In addition, their pay packages had to be significantly higher or lower than the average for a company of the same size and performance. In other words, the next-highest- or next-lowest-paid executive, in relative terms, was too close to the competitive pay level to be singled out for inclusion in the chart. That is why there are 10 executives listed in the high performance/low pay category, but only three in the low performance/high pay category and two in the low performance/low pay category. (pg. 8)

What Goes Up May Keep Going Up

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THE Dow Jones industrial average passed another impassable barrier, rising above 9,000 for a while on Friday, the first time that had ever happened. Each time the Dow has racked up another thousand points, there has been no shortage of experts warning that stock prices cannot keep going up like this. But they do. And as the market goes through one barrier after another, even the Cassandras, having been burned too often, bone up on the rationale for a rising Dow.
"We are in a financial mania where emotions overwhelm rational thinking," said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist and money manager who, unwilling to succumb to the optimism, has lightened his own stock portfolio. "What keeps stock prices going up is the emotional involvement that so many people have in stock prices going up." 

Teflon Dow
 Even the nation's most famous naysayers have fallen silent. No longer does Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warn of irrational exuberance. If anything, he has been quite optimistic about the American economy lately. And while Warren Buffett, a folk hero among stockholders, had stated last year that stocks may be overpriced, he now says they are not. But Mr. Buffett also says he has difficulty finding stocks worth buying.
"The whole thing is so extraordinary that the bears are exhausted, and they have shut up," said Peter L. Bernstein, a New York economist and consultant. "We can make up explanations about profits and interest rates to explain why the market is rising, but the real reason is that there is no compelling reason to sell. The Dow has gotten so high that even if it dropped by 20 percent, many people who have bought stock would still be ahead."
The Dow passed 6,000 in the fall of 1996 and 7,000 last spring. It broke 8,000 briefly in June and July and then rose decisively above 8,000 in early January, despite the Asian crisis. The 9,000 breakthrough came Friday morning, with the Dow getting as high as 9,030 before falling back and finally losing 3.2 points on the day, closing at 8,983. Again, bad news did not seem to matter. The Labor Department's unexpectedly weak March employment report -- the unemployment rate ticked up last month to 4.7 percent -- failed to move the stock market.
For some true optimists, like Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, stock prices are rising because the United States economy, with its strong recent growth, healthy profits, low inflation, low unemployment and low interest rates, "is the best it has ever been in history." For the less sanguine, the explanations of why the market is doing so well shift with the seasons.
 
Better Than Bonds
 Until recently, the big explanation had centered on profits. They were growing and the forecasts were for more growth ahead. Naturally, stock prices responded by rising, every analyst said. But profit growth slowed in the fourth quarter, and now attention has shifted to interest rates. They are low, and they are likely to remain low, which make stocks seem a far better way to make money than bonds and bank CD's, with their very low yields.
"People say, 'Gee, why buy bonds, we'll buy something else,' and that something else is stocks," said Joel Prakken, a partner at Macroeconomics Advisers Inc., a forecasting and consulting company in St. Louis.
Other reasons are thrown in. Confident consumers are spending, and demand for American goods is strong, not only at home, but increasingly abroad, except for Asia. Others say the slowdown in profit growth is temporary and probably mismeasured; in any case, by summer profits will quicken again. And then there is the widely held view that every dip in the Dow is an opportunity to buy and profit from the next rise. "Since 1987, people have found that every time the market sells off, it becomes a buying opportunity," Mr. Bernstein said.
 
No Predictions
Still, Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Bernstein are nervous. For them stock prices are overvalued. Even some bulls hold this view, among them Byron Wien, managing director of domestic investment strategies at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. Mr. Wien had predicted early this year that the Dow would reach 9,000. Now he says it won't go any higher.
"I am not raising my target," he said, "at least not at this time."

Re-Rethinking Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the courts, and in the court of public opinion, the opponents of affirmative action are winning.
They have won a ballot initiative in California banning the use of race and sex in college admissions, contracting and public employment. They have gained enough signatures on petitions to place a similar initiative on the ballot in the state of Washington. In Texas, they have prevailed in court suits to end preferences for minorities and women in college admissions, and to force the state government and the Clinton Administration to scale back affirmative action efforts in the awarding of contracts. In Piscataway, N.J., their string of successes has scared civil rights groups into seeking an out-of-court settlement of a teacher's challenge to her school district's affirmative action plan. 
 But with victories come doubts, and as the opponents of affirmative action see what they have wrought, some of them have begun to recoil in horror.
Fresh evidence of the fruits of their opposition was unveiled last week when the University of California at Berkeley and the University of California at Los Angeles disclosed the racial and ethnic makeup of their incoming classes. Berkeley reported a 57 percent drop in the number of black applicants and a 40 percent decline in the number of Hispanic high school seniors who had been accepted for admission. For U.C.L.A. the decline was 43 percent for African-American students and 33 percent for Hispanic Americans.
"Perhaps the most important lesson I've learned is that there are no airtight, completely coherent, unassailable and holistic answers on the question of affirmative action that are not only theoretically perfect, but instrumentally practical," said John Bunzel, who, as President of San Jose State University, had written stinging critiques of affirmative action but is now more disposed toward it. "Any intelligent person who wrestles with it is going to be vulnerable and subject to the twists and turns of unintended consequences."
 
Defectors
Even before the latest statistics emerged from California's elite public universities, some conservatives seemed to be getting more prone to hand-wringing. For example, Nathan Glazer, the noted Harvard sociologist, has even given up his opposition to affirmative action in some cases. Two weeks ago, Mr. Glazer wrote in The New Republic that ending affirmative action would visit so much damage on the aspirations and advancement of blacks that opponents of granting preferences to qualified black college applicants should re-think their position.
"I believe the main reasons we have to continue racial preferences for blacks are, first, because this country has a special obligation to blacks that has not been fully discharged," he wrote, "and, second, because strict application of the principle of qualification would send a message of despair to many blacks, a message that the nation is indifferent to their difficulties and problems."
For Mr. Glazer, it is a clear case of modifying views when principles meet reality. "It's the consequences," he said in an interview from his home in Cambridge, Mass. "It's one thing to fight for a principle, which is a very good principle, especially if you don't expect it to win. Then, as you come close, the consequences become a little larger."
Mr. Glazer and Mr. Bunzel are not alone. In recent years they have been joined by Glen C. Loury, a Boston University economics professor and former aide in the Reagan Administration, and James Q. Wilson, a sociologist at U.C.L.A. In some cases they have maintained a strong antagonism toward granting preferences in government contracting or in employment. But college admissions seem to have warranted a second look.
Such sentiments, of course, remain apostasy among many opponents of affirmative action. These opponents argue that whatever the numbers coming out of California show (including how deeply preferences were ingrained in admissions policies), the adjustment now being recorded represents only a short-term pain that blacks and Hispanics must bear. Their argument remains that affirmative action is like a placebo that only masks the need for a real cure -- namely, an adjustment by individual schools and families to a no-preference world, in which harder striving would produce real equality. This, they say, comes only with time.
"We have a lot more confidence than the Nat Glazers of the world that with good education you will end up with parity in academic performance," said Abigail Thernstrom, co-author with her husband Stephan of "America in Black and White: One Nation, Indivisible" (Simon & Schuster, 1997). "There is a kind of throw-in-the-towel pessimism that I think is behind a lot of support for preferences that we don't sign on to."
 
What Alternatives?
For some, like Mr. Loury, the problem with such arguments is that the only alternative proposed by the critics of affirmative action seems to boil down to simply exhorting blacks and Hispanics to work harder. With figures showing that Berkeley turned away 800 black applicants who had 4.0 grade point averages and scored at least 1,200 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, Mr. Loury said it is clear that many African-American students are already working very hard. Yet their efforts and the goal of a diverse student body -- an idea that the critics of affirmative action say they value -- apparently aren't enough.
"Is the sole measure of merit or worth the performance on these tests?" Mr. Loury asked. "Is there no value at all to racial diversity?"
Only a small group of conservatives and political centrists, of course, make up this network of affirmative action foes who are having second thoughts. But, then, the movers and shakers against affirmative action -- the lawyers who file the suits, the lobbyists who buttonhole legislators, the advocates who gather signatures on petitions for ballot initiatives and the far right foundations that fund them all -- also form only a tiny group.
And some former opponents -- Mr. Glazer, for example -- have a special stature because they were at one point the movement's intellectual trailblazers, and their words have the power to convert. Gerald Reynolds, president of the Center for New Black Leadership, a Washington-based organization that is a staunch foe of affirmative action, recalled reading Mr. Glazer's critiques of affirmative action while a student at York College in New York. "Nathan Glazer's arguments persuaded me that racial preferences are extremely harmful to the beneficiaries," he said.
More significantly, the former opponents reflect the ambivalence of a much larger and more important institution: the Republican Party. Republican leaders like the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, have been vocal critics of affirmative action. Yet for some reason -- concern about the fallout, a desire to attract black or Hispanic voters -- when it comes to killing it off, the Republicans have not been able to pull the trigger. It is one reason that backers of affirmative action have been able to beat back attempts in 13 state legislatures to ban the practice.
All of this drives those who have held firm against affirmative action to distraction.
"The arguments that Glazer and Loury made in the past against preferences are some of the strongest arguments," Mr. Reynolds said. "The only thing I can say to those who would embrace a policy that they already rejected in theory is if they don't have the stomach for it, they should get out of the debate."

HEADLINE: The World;
Searching for the Method In Czar Boris's Madness

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
THE big story in the Russian press last week was that President Boris N. Yeltsin had dismissed his Cabinet to clear the way for a secret successor. The future leader is kept at Gorky-9, a secluded compound outside Moscow, where he is allowed to exercise out of the public view.
The scoop in the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets turned out to be nothing more than an April 1 spoof. But given the swirl of rumors surrounding Mr. Yeltsin's Government shake-up on March 23, it is getting harder to tell the parodies from the real thing. 
 The startling fact about Mr. Yeltsin's firings and hirings is that even now nobody is quite sure what was behind them.
Russians may be the world's biggest conspiracy theorists, which is hardly surprising for a nation in which political intrigue is an art form. So guessing Mr. Yeltsin's motivation has become a national pastime.
It is more than a parlor game for the Russian tycoons, market reformers and Communists who want the public to believe their influence is on the rise: it is the ultimate exercise in spin control. It seems that all of Moscow wants to be seen as the hidden hand behind Mr. Yeltsin's seemingly inexplicable moves.
As Sergei Baburin, the vice speaker of the Parliament, put it, the key question is, "Who did what?"
Here are some of the most popular theories.
The Man Who Would Be King This is the dominant theory and is favored by the many detractors of the former Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. It holds that Mr. Yeltsin fired Mr. Chernomyrdin for acting too much like a President-in-waiting. Vice President Al Gore played an unwitting role in Mr. Chernomyrdin's undoing by treating him as a virtual head of state during recent talks in Washington.
Money Talks Boris Berezovksy, one of Russia's most powerful and notorious tycoons, has been promoting this hypothesis, which holds that he and his fellow moguls tightened their control over the Kremlin. They persuaded Mr. Yeltsin to dismiss Mr. Chernomyrdin because they are looking for a standard-bearer who has a better chance to win the 2000 Presidential election. Anatoly B. Chubais, the pro-reform Kremlin aide, was fired for failing to do their bidding.
The Kremlin Kamikaze Many Russian reformers insist it was Mr. Chubais who played the key role in the shake-up. They maintain that Mr. Chubais, having steered the economy through its rockiest period, was ready to leave for the private sector. But to preserve the Government's reforms, he agreed to leave only on the condition that Mr. Chernomyrdin and Anatoly S. Kulikov, the recently fired hard-line Interior Minister, be dismissed.
Scapegoating The Communists hold that Mr. Yeltsin was worried about swelling social unrest over unpaid wages and tried to head off an explosion by blaming the nation's problems on a handful of top aides and firing them before a national protest set for this Thursday.
Tough Love A far less plausible case is made by Mr. Chernomyrdin's backers, who insist that the firings were part of an elaborate ruse by Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin to enable the former Prime Minister to distance himself from Government corruption and concentrate on running for President.
Boris Is Losing It Many of Mr. Yeltsin's critics maintain that the President reacted impulsively to rampant speculation that his health is failing and fired his Cabinet in a desperate effort to remind the nation that he is still in control. A variation: Mr. Yeltsin has lost his interest in governing but gets an adrenaline rush from real or manufactured political crises.
There is probably an element of truth in many of these theories. A leader who has taken to calling himself Czar Boris was almost certainly uncomfortable with Mr. Chernomyrdin's efforts to position himself as a successor.
It is also reasonable to think that Mr. Berezovsky encouraged the President to get rid of Mr. Chernomyrdin and Mr. Chubais, but it's unlikely that the tycoon was the mastermind. Mr. Yeltsin's new choice for Prime Minister, Sergei N. Kiriyenko, is not in Mr. Berezovsky's pocket. It was Mr. Kiriyenko who set terms for the coming auction of the state-owned Rosneft oil company that were not in Mr. Berezovsky's favor. Mr. Berezovsky's choice for Prime Minister is believed to have been Ivan Rybkin, who oversees relations with other former Soviet republics.
Mr. Chubais's stated desire to leave may also have influenced Mr. Yeltsin's decision. After all, Mr. Yeltsin likes to maintain a political balance among hard-liners and reformers within his administration. If Mr. Chubais decided to leave, it would be reasonable for Mr. Yeltsin to sack some of his former aide's adversaries.
But if Mr. Chubais were pulling all the strings, he should have been able to arrange a cushy landing for himself as chairman of the Government-controlled electricity monopoly, a position he has openly coveted. Mr. Kiriyenko recently said, however, that the former aide was not entitled to the chairmanship.
For all the political machinations, it is important not to overdramatize Mr. Yeltsin's moves. The vast majority of his top aides are being reappointed, including Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev and a leading pro-reform aide, Boris Y. Nemtsov. The financial markets took the dismissal of the Cabinet calmly. The Communist-dominated Parliament is likely to approve Mr. Kiriyenko as Prime Minister after a little stroking and, perhaps, a few concessions by Mr. Yeltsin.
This, however, is just the beginning of two years of infighting leading up to new Presidential elections. And the elaborate game of musical chairs has not moved the country any closer to solving one of its most pressing problems: finding a successor to Mr. Yeltsin.
That is, unless Moskovsky Komsomolets was right after all, and he's living at Gorky-9.

HEADLINE: The World: The Atlantic Slave Trade;
On Both Sides, Reason for Remorse

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast

 BODY:
FROM the moment the White House announced that President Clinton would stop at Senegal's Goree Island, one of this continent's most famous monuments to the Atlantic slave trade, a polemic was re-launched in the United States and in much of Africa over how and indeed whether Mr. Clinton should apologize for the centuries-long capture and sale into bondage of millions of Africans.
For some, the very idea of an apology was offensive. Weren't Africans engaging in slavery themselves well before the first Europeans came and carried off their first human cargoes? Didn't African chiefs themselves conduct razzias, or slaving raids, on neighboring tribes and march their harvest to the shores for sale? 
 For others, though, the Atlantic trade in Africans was one of the greatest crimes humanity has known, and remains one that has never been properly acknowledged. "The Holocaust was certainly a great tragedy, but it only lasted a few short years," said Joseph Ndiaye, the curator of the Maison des Esclaves, the featured stop on Mr. Clinton's trip to Goree. "We never stop hearing about the Holocaust, but how often do we dwell on the tragedy that took place here over 350 years; a tragedy that consumed tens of millions of lives?"
In the end, an appropriately solemn Mr. Clinton stopped short of an outright apology for America's part in the slave trade, finding other ways to express his regret as he focused on the future. That Mr. Clinton so artfully chose to sidestep African slavery's long history should have come as no surprise to anyone familiar with its cruel and complicated details. Even today, few subjects are so prone to passionate disagreement. As ever, people from each leg of the triangular Atlantic trade -- Europe, Africa and the Americas -- still use the slave experience as a vacant screen upon which they project their own misperceptions and justifications.
 
The Colonial View
In the United States, the conservative columnist Patrick Buchanan recently echoed a sentiment heard often from whites who resent attempts to make them feel guilty for slavery: "When Europeans arrived in sub-Saharan Africa, the inhabitants had no machinery and no written language. When the Europeans departed, most of them by 1960, they left behind power stations, telephones, telegraphs, railroads, mines, plantations, schools, a civil service, a police force and a treasury."
Even disregarding the wildly benign view of Europe's colonial legacy, many historians say Mr. Buchanan's assumptions -- of a savage continent being blessed with the gift of European civilization -- are as erroneous as they are widespread. Early European travelers to West Africa, in fact, found societies that by many measures, from commonly available technology to general living standards, were not so different from home.
"The smelting of iron and steel in West Africa was similar to that in Europe in the 13th century, before the advent of power driven by the water wheel," wrote Hugh Thomas, the author of "The Slave Trade" (Simon & Schuster, 1997). "Senegambia had iron and copper industries, and the quality of African steel approached that of Toledo before the 15th century."
It would be dishonest to lay all of Africa's subsequent problems on the slave trade. But most experts do not doubt that the forces unleashed by Europe's demand for slaves, gold and other African goods radically destabilized societies that were embarking on their own path toward development, and laid waste to whole regions of this continent. "The discussion of how Africa became what it did subsequent to 1500 very quickly becomes an argument over what the slave trade did to the continent," said John Reader, a fellow of the British Royal Anthropological Institute and author of "Africa, a Biography of the Continent." "Africa clearly would not have had an easy time even if there had not been an Atlantic slave trade," he wrote. "But one can easily imagine entirely different trajectories for the continent."
A cold look at the nature of the Atlantic slave trade makes it very difficult to overstate its impact.
Until recently, Africa's economic development has always been hindered by low population densities. Africa's population in 1500 has been estimated by some at 47 million. Over the next 350 years, between 10 and 15 million Africans were landed in chains in the New World, and 4 to 6 million more are thought to have died during their capture or the Atlantic crossing -- a total of between 14 and 21 million people. History has seen few social disruptions on that scale.
In the end, however, many specialists in African history consider the process by which slavery worked to be as destructive as the sheer numbers involved.
Few African slaves were enchained by Europeans themselves. Instead, massive slave raids, huge marches of captives from inland areas and continuous rivalries between coastal kingdoms and local ethnic groups were driven by demand for Europe's coveted goods -- cloth and candles, grain, horses, spiced wine, pots and pans.
For centuries in Africa, ethical conventions had governed the taking and use of slaves, who in most cases resembled the serfs of Europe more than the chattel of the Americas. These suddenly dissolved.
"The trans-Atlantic slave trade vastly devalued human life compared to what existed virtually anywhere on the continent before," said the historian Basil Davidson. "Things were not a peaceful Garden of Eden in Africa beforehand. But all of the evidence combines to show that the level of civilization in pre-colonial Africa was degraded and depressed by the onset of widespread violence related to the slave trade."
And here one begins to touch upon one of the cruelest ironies of the slave trade and enter into an area that many Africans and African-Americans are often unaware of or uncomfortable confronting directly.
African slavery, albeit of a very different kind, began long before the arrival of Europeans, and continued well after slavery's abolition in the West. And the slavery of the Americas could never have approached the scale it attained without the active and widespread collaboration of Africans. Most troubling, perhaps, are how European perceptions of Africans and their behavior lent seeming moral acceptability to the commerce.
The free-for-all among African societies to capture slaves from their neighbors and rivals for sale to whites was deliberately stimulated by the Europeans who anchored offshore with their cloth and trinkets. And this same state of chaos comforted whites in their view of Africans as ignoble savages.
Today Africans and African-Americans may often share a common view of slavery as the evil work of whites. But the very notion of shared Africanness so commonplace today existed only in the minds of foreigners during the time of this trade. To Africans, their own divisions on ethnic and linguistic lines mattered far more. The lack of solidarity served, in the European mind, as another easy rationale for enslaving them.
Contrast this to the attitude Europeans took toward the New World's Indians. Recorded instances of Indians selling each other into plantation slavery are rare. Less than 100 years into the colonization of the New World, calls were spreading for the abolition of Indian slavery.
"The Indians were seen by and large as a people unknown to the ancients who had somehow remained innocent and noble," said David Brion Davis, the Sterling Professor of History at Yale University. "At the very same time, mariners going up and down the African coast spread tales of Africans as savage barbarians who sold slaves themselves."

Chart: "The Atlantic Slave Trade"
The number of Africans who were transported to the New World between 1520 and 1867 is estimated at 10 million to 15 million with an additional 4 million to 6 million perishing en route. The chart shows carriers (the leading slave traders) and their destinations (the main places to which slaves were delivered). (Source: "The Slave Trade," by Hugh Thomas (Simon & Schuster)(pg. 4)

THE ECONOMY
Growth Without Inflation
The American economy keeps growing, far beyond analysts' expectations, with no signs of rekindling inflation -- so, not surprisingly, interest rates were left unchanged at the Federal Reserve's policy meeting. In the first economic report for March, the National Association of Purchasing Management said that its monthly index of business activity surged to 54.8, from 53.3 in February. However, the unemployment rate rose a tenth of a point, to 4.7 percent, and nonfarm payrolls tumbled 36,000, suggesting that growth may be cooling a bit. Several indicators showed strength in February. Construction spending, up 0.3 percent, rose for a third consecutive month; the index of leading indicators climbed to 105.0 and sales of new homes reached a new high. 

MARKETS
Scaling New Peaks
As the economy goes, so go the markets -- up, up, up. The Dow Jones industrial average broke the 9,000 mark on Friday, but backed off, to close at 8,983.41. That was up 187.33 for the week. Prices also climbed in the credit markets, sending yields down. The benchmark 30-year Treasury ended the week at 5.79 percent, its lowest yield in nearly seven weeks. For the first quarter, the Nasdaq index turned in the markets' best performance, climbing 16.9 percent, paced by technology standouts like Microsoft, up 39 percent, and Dell Computer, up 61.3 percent. The Dow industrials gained 11.27 percent in the quarter, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.53 percent.
 
BMW-ROLLS ROYCE
Silver Clouds on the Autobahn?
BMW of Germany bid $571 million for Rolls-Royce, Britain's legendary manufacturer of hand-burnished luxury automobiles, said Vickers P.L.C., Rolls's current owner. That offer topped bids from Volkswagen, a British investment firm and a dismayed consortium of Rolls-Royce enthusiasts who had hoped to rescue the company from foreign hands. BMW executives said they wanted to invest about $1.6 billion in Rolls-Royce in the next 10 years, double the work force of 2,600 and introduce two new lines of automobiles, which analysts surmised would be sportier and a bit less expensive than a traditional $250,000 Rolls.
 
AUTOS
The Beetle Is Reborn
There may be hope for drivers who want to see farther ahead than the blacked-out windows of the big-brute sport utility in front of them. Volkswagen said its United States sales rose 44 percent in March on strong demand for its New Beetle, above, the successor to the Beetle of the 1950's, 60's and 70's. Still, its sales in the introductory month -- 2,365 -- were minuscule compared with Detroit's numbers. Chrysler sold 12,283 Dodge Durangos, its big new sport ute, last month, nearly offsetting a drop in car sales of 12,470, or 16.8 percent. General Motors had an 11 percent rise in truck sales but a 2 percent slip in auto sales, while Ford's car sales fell 5 percent and truck sales held even.
 
OXFORD HEALTH
Big Bucks for Leaving
If an office boy has problems sorting the company mail, he may have to live on plastic until he can find a new job. Not so Stephen F. Wiggins, the founder and former chairman of Oxford Health Plans. Despite leaving the company in turmoil, company filings showed, he was to receive a severance package of $9 million and assorted benefits. But once that news became public, Gov. George E. Pataki and the New York State Insurance Department objected. The company had already paid Mr. Wiggins $3.6 million in cash but agreed to withhold the rest of the package. Oxford also disclosed that it had taken on additional short-term financing and was starting to put its new management team in place. But the filing suggests that a quick cure is unlikely for Oxford's ills. It lost $291 million in 1997, and expects to continue losing money this year.
 
AIR TRAVEL
Let Them Fly Coach
There have long been clear class distinctions in the air, but the divisions are growing ever wider as airlines invest millions of dollars to pamper their best customers -- like business travelers paying full coach fares -- enticing them with everything from more legroom to extra frequent-flier miles to fancier V.I.P. lounges. Who loses? In some cases, passengers with discount tickets. They may have to make do with less space, longer check-in lines and longer waits for baggage. Above, smiling service is offered at Virgin Atlantic's Upper Class Clubhouse in Dulles International Airport near Washington.

HEADLINE: Refinancing Costs Will Benefit Consumers

 BODY:
Within the next six weeks, the Connecticut General Assembly may pass legislation that would open the state's electric generating business to competition.
Some critical details were missing from the article ("Who Pays for Mistakes in Making Electricity?" March 21) that should be known by readers. 
 Legislation would dramatically restructure an industry that has served Connecticut homes and businesses for more than 100 years. The Connecticut Light and Power Company (C.L. & P.) has had and will continue to have an obligation to provide electricity to Connecticut consumers in its service territory for the foreseeable future.
In the turbulent energy markets of the 1970's, C.L. & P. had to be sure it had resources to meet the state's future electricity needs.
Building new oil and natural gas plants were judged to be out of the question because of rising prices, limited supply and Federal prohibitions against using certain fossil fuels. Coal had too many air quality issues associated with it.
Construction of nuclear, trash-to-energy and other plants was undertaken as a means to wean Connecticut away from imported fossil fuels.
Unlike other industries, there was no option for electric utilities that said, "Don't build anything and risk blackouts."
The Department of Public Utility Control, which regulates utilities in the state, agreed those investments by utilities were reasonable and agreed they could be recovered from customers over a period of time. These costs are currently reflected in customers' monthly electric bills, and under deregulation they will be reflected in a competitive transition assessment.
They are not new costs. They only reflect the remaining costs of state energy policy of the 1970's and 1980's.
These investments have been pro-rated over time, some as long as 30 years, which means customers' monthly bills will reflect some of these charges for some time.
Using securitization, C.L. & P. can refinance those costs approved by the D.P.U.C. at a lower interest rate over a shorter period of time, resulting in substantial savings and reducing the length of time customers would pay this competitive transition assessment.
The results are similar to when a homeowner refinances his/her mortgage at a lower interest rate. These savings will be passed on to customers in the form of lower electric bills. The greater the amount we securitize, the greater the savings for customers.
Your article stated that securitization has never been done in this industry. That's not true. Securitization has been implemented in California, the state in the forefront of deregulating the electric industry, where $6 billion has been securitized. Rates in that state dropped 10 percent in January, largely because of the benefits of securitization.
Similarly, securitization has been endorsed by other states that are in the process of restructuring their electric markets.
C.L. & P. supports competition and lower electric bills. By refinancing the maximum amount of C.L. & P.'s investments, customers will see the maximum amount of savings on their electric bills.

HEADLINE: Helping the Homeless Get Back Into Society

 BODY:
I am writing regarding the article in the March 15 Westchester section, which profiled Steven Schiff Q&A: "Up Front and Personal With the Homeless" . I admire Mr. Schiff for his generous support of the Bridge Fund, which is one of the most compassionate agencies in New York addressing the real problems of homelessness.
I must take exception to Mr. Schiff's view that someone who is homeless cannot "get back into society." That view is totally contrary to the Greyston Foundation's experience. We develop and provide permanent housing and support service (including high-quality child care) to homeless families. Many of those families became homeless as a result of domestic violence, substance abuse, mental illness or chronic unemployment. Lack of education may have contributed to those causes, but visionary intervention can bring remarkable results. 
 Often the problem is not lack of education but lack of opportunity. Our tenants receive life-skills training, counseling, job training and linkages to decent employment, including jobs in our for-profit subsidized Greyston Bakery. Most have re-entered the social mainstream as responsible citizens. Greyston is not alone in successfully addressing the recovery from homelessness.
The 1,300 homeless families and individuals (including 1,600 children) now homeless in Westchester County must not be written off as lost causes. Rehabilitation is demonstrably possible and an obligation of this affluent community.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Congress Likes It, Sometimes;
Let's Hear It for the World!

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT'S been a rough few weeks for internationalism on Capitol Hill.
The House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, is urging fellow Republicans to reject $18 billion in new financing for the International Monetary Fund to use in future financial crises. House Republicans want to attach to the I.M.F. bill an anti-abortion provision that President Clinton opposes. 
 Congress is balking at paying $1 billion in back dues the United States owes the United Nations. Representative Gerald Solomon, a New York Republican, said the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, should be "horsewhipped" for saying nice things about President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. There's even a bill in the House that would require Washington to pull out of the United Nations altogether.
As Representative Henry J. Hyde, a senior Republican from Illinois who supports the United Nations, put it last week: "We have a lot of conservatives who do not like foreign aid."
Except when it involves some of the lesser-known international organizations the United States belongs to, like the Universal Postal Union, the Bureau of International Expositions and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.
 
Don't Mess
Call it selective isolationism.
Picking on the United Nations or the I.M.F. is one thing; public support for them is diffuse, the required commitments huge and the benefits largely intangible (some would say there are none). But mess with the esoteric organizations that provide tangible economic, scientific or health benefits for relatively little cost and lawmakers invite grief from the powerful domestic interests behind them.
"These organizations are about jobs here at home," said Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat whose personal favorite, the 37-nation International Natural Rubber Organization (annual dues: $234,000), benefits the American tire industry.
Through many of the groups -- particularly the agricultural ones, like the International Office of the Vine and Wine -- the United States promotes its exports by fighting unfair tariffs.
Three years ago, the State Department tried to save money by withdrawing from some of the lower-priority organizations. Officials succeeded with a few, including the Pan American Railway Congress Association.
But when the Government tried to pull out of the 42-nation International Cotton Advisory Committee (annual dues: $203,000), senators from cotton-growing states rescinded the decision and kept the United States in the group, which tracks statistics on cotton production, trade and consumption.
"All these people have constituencies who defend them," said Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican who has tried, and mostly failed, to end American membership in several groups, including the 53-country International Tropical Timber Organization (annual dues: $143,000), which helps American furniture makers that import tropical wood.
Even with some of these groups, Congress tries to have it both ways.
When lawmakers last year approved $85 million less than the State Department requested to pay dues to nearly 50 international organizations, officials had to write partial I.O.U.'s.
That didn't go over well with the 35-nation International Copper Study Group (annual dues: $60,000), which threatened to force the United States to forfeit the chairman's position and its voting rights altogether if Washington did not pay $9,950 in arrears.
 
Grumbling
American industry is also grumbling about arrears to groups affiliated with the United Nations. The United States owes $105 million in back dues to the Food and Agriculture Organization, which helps set international standards in processed foods and agriculture, and $36 million to the World Health Organization, which guides health standards.
In a recent letter to Speaker Newt Gingrich, the Grocery Manufacturers of America warned that if back dues at the two groups go unpaid, the United States will lose its leadership leverage, and "Congress will run the real risk of subjecting U.S. business and agriculture to standards to which we do not and cannot conform."
For Administration officials, the challenge is to muster support for the United Nations like that enjoyed by its tinier, more specialized brethren.
It's not easy, especially with this Congress. "There are certain obligations and responsibilities we have as a superpower," said Princeton N. Lyman, Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs. "But for some people, that's hard to accept."

HEADLINE: The Care And Feeding Of the Rich

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich is a professor of social and economic policy at Brandeis University's Heller Graduate School. He was Secretary of Labor in the first Clinton Administration.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Recently, U S Airways removed a row of coach seats in each wide-body plane to make room for a new, luxurious business-class service. The distance between rows in the new section is 55 inches, compared with 31 inches in coach. Other airlines are also expanding their accommodations for travelers in business class, as well as in first class.
The ranks of America's affluent are growing, and the market is responding -- creating superior spaces and services for them. But unlike the old moneyed class a century ago whose languid extravagances created the Gilded Age, the new affluent are a business and professional elite who are in constant motion -- investment bankers, corporate lawyers, jackpot entrepreneurs, real estate developers, entertainment moguls. They are money-rich but time-poor. 
 Rather than spend their fortune on fox hunts or long cruises, they spend it on necessities, like flying from city to city. Yet because they have so much money to spend on what they need, and so little time for anything else, the marketplace is quickly transforming their necessities into extravagances.
First- and business-class seats now account for more than 22 percent of the airlines' domestic passenger revenue, up from 9.5 percent in l987, according to the Air Transport Association. No wonder there has been a growth in luxury services at the front of their planes. The new elite also demand premium ground transportation, which explains the surge in limousine services and sales of luxury cars. These people have to live somewhere, so the residential market is quickly shifting to luxury apartments and co-ops.
In this new economy, the middle class is getting squeezed, sometimes literally. Wherever space is limited, a larger portion of it is going upscale. Expanding the front of the plane means less legroom in coach class, and the seats are narrower.
As the cost of real estate soars, the middle class is being pushed out. In New York City, two-bedroom apartments that went for $240,000 just two years ago now cost $300,000 and up.
Not only do the new elite get more space. They also get more attention. The front of the plane contains far more flight attendants per person than in coach, and they respond to "call" buttons more quickly. The airline's V.I.P. lounge is staffed by friendly souls who speed passengers through check-in lines. Limousine services answer the phones more quickly than taxi companies do, because they're better staffed. Luxury-car dealerships have more mechanics on hand, so the wait for servicing is shorter.
Increasingly, the quality most sought after by the new elite is personal care. What makes an apartment truly deluxe is the custodians who respond quickly. What distinguishes the high-end retail stores from the mass-market department stores is the abundance of salespeople who hover tactfully. The best hotels have platoons of obliging clerks and charming concierges.
And the new elite has no shortage of specialized care -- personal trainers, masseurs, physical therapists, guides, counselors, decorators, planners and advisers to make their lives and bodies more efficient. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has estimated a 76 percent increase in the number of physical therapists between 1990 and 2005; in this same period, 40 percent more gardeners and groundskeepers, and 39 percent more restaurant cooks, waiters and hotel staff. Productivity isn't growing much in this large and expanding sector of the economy, because the quality of personal attentiveness improves when there are more people available to provide it.
Meanwhile the squeezed middle is getting less personal attention, in case you hadn't noticed. As the labor market moves upscale, whatever services are still available to the middle are becoming automated and digitized. Remember when telephone operators and bank tellers were human beings instead of machines? By the year 2005, the number of bank tellers will have dropped by 25 percent from the 1990 level, switchboard operators by 24 percent and service station attendants by 17 percent. Personal service is just too expensive these days. We'd rather get the bargain-basement air fare, without the frills. Forget full-service pumps. We'll take the cheap gas.
Here is the irony. Most of the tens of millions of personal-attention jobs created in recent years to cater to the new elite are being done by the same middle that's being squeezed in the back of the plane.
They used to be bank tellers, telephone operators, garage mechanics and factory workers. Their work had often benefited people like themselves, who might even have lived in the same neighborhoods.
But now they've been pushed out of the old jobs and into new jobs whose value is measured by the quality of their attentiveness to people who live much better than they do, and better than their neighbors.
The old moneyed class of the Gilded Age had servants from the other side of town, of course, and the servants cleaned rooms and drove carriages they never could have afforded for themselves.
But large-scale industrialization gradually changed all this, creating a mass market for mass-produced goods and standardized services, while building a huge middle class along the way. That was the great achievement of modern capitalism, and it strengthened our society as well as our economy.
The emerging economy isn't taking us backward, but it does seem to be moving us toward a new kind of social divide. As long as the buoyant economy continues to lift most of us, no one's complaining, at least not very much. But what happens when the tide goes out?

HEADLINE: Nations Endorse Moves to Eradicate the Plague of Small Arms

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: OSLO, April 2

 BODY:
With words like path-breaking, courageous and visionary, representatives from African and Western nations, including the United States, have resoundingly endorsed measures to control the spread of light weapons, the major cause of death in today's wars.
The action came at a two-day assembly here called to advance a proposed moratorium on the export, import and manufacture of light weapons in West Africa, and to consider how that moratorium could be a model for other regions of the world, like Central America. 
 Reflecting a rapidly growing movement to stanch the flow of light weapons into areas of conflict, the conference was attended by 18 African nations, more than a dozen European countries, and Japan, Canada and Argentina.
"It is a dream come true," said Jan Egeland, director of the Norwegian Initiative on Small Arms Transfers, which convened the meeting, along with the United Nations Development Program. "Africa has seen too many wars, too many civilians killed, too much human rights abuse," said Mr. Egeland, a former Norwegian diplomat, who two weeks ago was the key speaker at a conference at Columbia University on controlling the light weapons trade.
It was therefore imperative, he said, for governments to support the "visionary idea" of a moratorium.
In a distinct break from weapons control measures in the past, delegates noted, this one is not the work of major outside powers. Rather, the project came from the President of Mali, Alpha Oumar Konare, who has been commended for the symbolic burning two years ago of a pile of 3,000 weapons surrendered by rebel groups in his country.
"The political, economic and social consequences of the anarchic proliferation of light weapons are well known," Mr. Konare said in his opening address. "They are the millions of victims, most of them civilians, the displaced populations with their tears and suffering, the phenomena of child soldiers, terrorism and wide-scale banditry in urban areas."
Mr. Konare said his Government would soon declare a moratorium, and other countries at the meeting here said they expected the 15-member Economic Community of West African States to call for a moratorium at its next meeting, in July.
The fledgling movement to curtail the trade in small arms and light weapons, like automatic rifles, machine guns, hand grenades, mortars and shoulder-fired missiles, has been propelled by the successful campaign to ban antipersonnel land mines.
And this time the United States is determined not to be left out, as in the land mines campaign, which produced a treaty that the Clinton Administration has refused to sign.
"We not only want to play in this, but exercise a little control to keep it in the right direction," said Herbert Calhoun, an official in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the leader of the United States delegation to the conference.
The Clinton Administration is fully mobilized to support measures to control the trade in light weapons, and is preparing some proposals of its own, he said.
The focus of Washington is on the illicit trade in pistols, which it wants to keep out of the hands of street criminals and drug gangs. But the participants here were part of a much broader movement, one aiming at all small arms, and the legal as well as illegal trade. It is primarily concerned about the political and social mayhem magnified by the spread of small arms.

HEADLINE: Strides in Pet Care Come at Price Owners Will Pay

BYLINE: By CAROL MARIE CROPPER 

 BODY:
When young Trina's adult teeth started coming in crowded, Dee Hanna did what so many other Americans have done -- she collared her little one and headed for a dentist who could straighten teeth.
Now, hundreds of dollars later, Trina's smile is as lovely as any other 12-pound Norwich Terrier's. 
 Veterinary medicine has moved way beyond rabies shots and heartworm pills, and now provides orthodontics for dogs, kidney dialysis for cats, Prozac and Valium for pets.
The money goes for pet pacemakers, chemotherapy, artificial hips, even open heart surgery.
"A lot of the things that are available to humans are available for pets," said Sharon Granskog, spokeswoman for the American Veterinary Medical Association. "I think the pet is being more and more recognized as a member of the family and is being treated as one."
Before World War II, when more Americans lived on farms or in rural areas, barnyard animals were kept for practical purpose and such fancy treatments were unheard of, said Bernard Rollin, a professor at the Colorado State University School of Veterinary Medicine and a trailblazer in the field of veterinary ethics. Now, with Fifi sharing the urban apartment and providing what may be the closest link to nature -- as well as being the closest thing to a child living at home -- the idea of spending thousands to save her life no longer seems far-fetched. This attitudinal shift started after World War II and has accelerated in the last 20 to 25 years, Mr. Rollin said.
A 1995 report by the American Animal Hospital Association found that 70 percent of former and current pet owners surveyed thought of their pets as children. Asked what one companion they would want on a deserted island, 53 percent listed a dog or cat.
Such feelings have translated into a huge change in the way veterinarians do business, and the amount of business. While $6.9 billion was spent on dogs, cats and birds in 1991, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, pet owners spent $11.1 billion on health care in 1996, an increase of 61 percent.
Until 1951, the American Veterinary Medical Association did not recognize practice specialties. Now, there are 20 board-certified vet specialties -- from anesthesiology to toxicology -- and the number of vets who have taken the additional schooling and examinations to become certified has grown to more than 5,600, up from 2,700 in 1984.
Not surprisingly, the cost of a typical visit to the vet has also ballooned. The average cost for a dog went from $49.96 in 1991 to $73.60 in 1996, increasing at an 8.1 percent compound annual rate, according to the veterinary association. For cats, the price rose from $44.81 to $66.58, an 8.2 percent compound annual increase. Inflation grew just 2.9 percent.
Pet owners like Sally Prewett, a registered nurse in Sacramento, Calif., are fueling this economy. Bandit, a male Maine coon kitten she bought for $12, suffered kidney damage in 1992 after tasting antifreeze picked up off the garage floor. Five years later, Bandit was referred to the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California at Davis, a pioneer in feline kidney transplants. The operation was a success.
Ms. Prewett, 34, had to borrow part of the almost $3,000 it cost to get a new kidney for her large, black, gray and camel-colored cat. And since his surgery last spring, Bandit has also needed about $80 worth of anti-rejection drugs each month.
"A couple of people said, 'You're crazy for doing this,' " said Ms. Prewett. "I said, 'It's my cat and it's my money.'
"I don't have children. I'm single. These cats are like my kids," she said of Bandit and his three playmates. "I just can't imagine not doing it."
While the University of California at Davis is known for kidneys, Michigan State University's Veterinary Teaching Hospital is recognized for open-heart surgery, and Colorado State University's Veterinary Teaching Hospital is the place to go for bone cancer treatment. In fact, that hospital perfected a procedure for treating osteosarcoma later adapted for humans.
In the footsteps of "E.R." and "Chicago Hope" comes "Emergency Vets," a program broadcast five days a week over a cable station starring veterinarians at Alameda East Veterinary Hospital in Denver.
Even the emotional problems of dogs, cats and parrots merit treatment by specialists.
Veterinary behaviorists use drugs like Valium or Prozac for anxiety-ridden kitties that mark the kitchen with urine and dogs that howl from separation anxiety, said Dr. Benjamin Hart, professor of behavior at the University of California at Davis's School of Veterinary Medicine. Dr. Hart brings pet and people into his office for $120 consultations lasting an hour to an hour and a half to determine what is causing the behavior. Follow-up visits cost $80 but are less common than in human therapy. "People aren't going to string along for an hour-a-week for a year," Dr. Hart said.
Americans' increased care for pets may one day affect stark agricultural practices. "As people identify more with their pets they become more and more concerned with the treatment of all animals," said Mr. Rollins, the ethicist.

HEADLINE: Business Groups Press For $18 Billion for I.M.F.

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
Every Friday afternoon, 100 of the country's top business advocates meet in the majestic courtyard of the United States of Chamber of Commerce headquarters here to map out strategy in their struggle to influence one of Congress's biggest foreign policy decisions this year.
Still smarting from its role in last fall's defeat of the fast-track trade negotiating authority, American business has regrouped and enlisted new allies, and is furiously lobbying Congress to approve $18 billion in new financing for the cash-strapped International Monetary Fund, which has been instrumental in the Asian financial bailout. 
 It is an unusual coalition with about 300 members -- Fortune 500 companies and small businesses, ranging from Boeing to the San Francisco Pasta Company, as well as trade associations, farm groups and local chambers of commerce. Their effort began in February out of concern over losing exports or letting a financial crisis abroad upset national security goals at home.
The campaign has scored one major victory. Late last month, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the financing and attached it to a must-pass disaster-relief bill. But the House is balking, setting up a showdown when Congressional negotiators return later this month from their spring recess to hammer out a compromise on the disaster-relief legislation.
"We are going to ratchet up the temperature on this," said Edmund B. Rice, executive director of the Coalition for Employment through Exports Inc., one of the main trade groups setting sights on lawmakers here and mobilizing business advocates in the field to buttonhole their legislators.
In the ill-fated fast-track trade campaign, business and many liberal Democrats were in opposite camps.
In this fight, however, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, was an early and influential ally of the business lobby.
Another big difference this time around is the business community's close coordination with the Clinton Administration's point man on the I.M.F. financing, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has also influenced many lawmakers, especially some skeptical Republicans.
Despite the advantages, I.M.F. supporters still face huge hurdles. "Of all the trade issues, I.M.F. is still pretty esoteric," said Willard A. Workman, the Chamber's international vice president. "Most members of Congress don't really understand how the I.M.F. works."
In addition, Big Business can no longer count on the lock-step support of Congressional Republicans, longtime allies of corporate America and Wall Street.
A new breed of populist Republicans has emerged, particularly in the House, who are not responding to business's appeals.
"Many of these new Republicans are skeptical of many positions of U.S. business, particularly in the international arena," said Mr. Rice. "It is clearly more difficult for business interests to make their case."
Moreover, senior House Republicans, including Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, and Representative Christopher Cox of California, chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, oppose additional financing to the I.M.F., arguing that the fund is more the problem than the solution to the economic crises overseas.
Business groups are waging a counteroffensive to educate lawmakers on the importance of the new financing. The Chamber of Commerce's web site, for example, features I.M.F. facts and figures.
Peter G. Peterson, a former Commerce Secretary who is chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, and Maurice R. Greenberg, an insurance executive who is chairman of the Asia Society, mobilized a $400,000 newspaper ad campaign in several major daily newspapers, and recently sent an appeal to all 535 members of Congress signed by dozens of corporate chiefs and a bipartisan group of former Cabinet Secretaries.
Using Government data, the Chamber of Commerce and other groups, including the Business Roundtable, are alerting lawmakers on the amount of international business in their state or district at risk if another crisis hits and the I.M.F. is unable to respond.
In a letter sent last month, the Chamber reminded Representative Robert L. Livingston, a Louisiana Republican who heads the House Appropriations Committee, that his home state exported $2 billion in merchandise to Asia last year, a 66 percent increase over 1993.
Three dozen agriculture groups, from the American Soybean Association to the National Cattleman's Beef Association, have urged Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, to support the $18 billion financing package. He did.
"If the economic situation deteriorates and the I.M.F. is unable to respond, the loss in agricultural exports could be devastating to the domestic farm economy," the letter said.
The Chamber of Commerce is gathering anecdotal evidence of the domestic fallout from the Asian financial crisis:
Boeing expects 60 fewer aircraft deliveries to Asia. Wheat sales from Washington State to South Korea have plummeted. Sales in Southeast Asia for Amerex International Inc. of Trussville, Ala., one of the nation's largest fire-extinguishers makers, are down $610,000.
Senators credit the business lobby, along with efforts by the Administration and I.M.F. supporters like Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, for the large victory in the Senate.
"The business community is on the front lines, and I'm sure they did sway some votes," said Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who helped guide the financing to an 84-to-16 victory in the Senate.

HEADLINE: Deep Plowing Is Halted By Many to Protect Soil

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Ill., April 4

 BODY:
Jim Kinsella turns a spadeful of black soil on his 640-acre corn and soybean farm, exposing a pack of wriggling earthworms that signal an abundance of organic material.
The soil breaks apart easily in his hands, and the land suffers far less than it used to from erosion. Pheasants and other wildlife flit about in the crackling corn stalks left scattered after harvest. 
 Mr. Kinsella's land is twice as rich in nutrients as it was when he first abandoned deep plowing 21 years ago. "Farmers are still infatuated with tilling, but they are kind of living in the past," Mr. Kinsella said. "The soil plays out. You can only do that for so long."
Across America, an increasing number of farmers are turning to no-till methods to stop the loss of topsoil and improve its organic content, conserve ground moisture and reduce runoff of pesticides and fertilizer into lakes, streams and rivers.
"Tillage is a disaster for the soil; it's like a hurricane coming through," said Steve Groff, who runs a no-till 135-acre vegetable farm in Lancaster County, Pa. "I'm going to leave this soil in better condition than when I found it."
In simple terms, no-till means just what it says: not plowing the ground -- or at least only minimally disturbing the topsoil -- to plant seeds. Crop residue is left on the field over the winter to improve soil quality and stop erosion, and crops are rotated annually to cut down on diseases and insect infestations that take root if the same crop is planted each year.
To be sure, thousands of farmers are still cranking up their tractors and plowing the land just as their fathers and grandfathers did.
Those traditional methods are somewhat easier and do promote faster early growth in crops, Mr. Kinsella said, because the soil warms up faster and the nutrients are exposed. And, he said, many farmers view no-till as a fad with unproven economic consequences.
"Farmers are very traditional and they're very slow to change," he said. "There is a stigma to no-till."
Yet there are some economic benefits to no-till methods.
Because farmers do not repeatedly go into the fields to plow, they can save up to 3.5 gallons of fuel an acre on a 500-acre farm, $5 an acre on machinery wear and maintenance costs, and four 60-hour weeks in labor time, according to the Conservation Technology Information Center. The center, based in West Lafayette, Ind., is a government-agribusiness partnership that promotes no-till methods.
Its latest statistics show that three common conservation tillage systems accounted for almost 110 million acres of farmland in 1997 -- or about 37 percent of the total acres planted. Conventional deep plowing with metal disks and blades was practiced on about 107 million acres, while reduced-till farming accounted for an additional 77 million acres.
Although the methods have been in use since the 1960's, there is more interest than ever now that the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act is phasing out subsidies and ending restrictions on what farmers can plant.
This is especially true in the Great Plains, where many farmers once planted only wheat and let the land lie fallow the next season. Now, they need more income from the land and are looking for new crops to put into rotation.
There are new challenges with no-till methods. There is more variability within a single field, meaning farmers must use precise amounts of fertilizer and improved seeds to have desirable yields.
New equipment must be bought and techniques learned, like leaving mounded strips of soil on fields over the winter to warm the soil when planting time comes.
"When you first start doing this, you might suffer a yield hit," Mr. Groff said. "The soil has been addicted to tillage."
But this season, Mr. Kinsella said his yields in this north-central Illinois county were above average.
"It takes better management to make it work," he said. "It takes patience."
Mr. Kinsella said reduced deep plowing could cut release of carbon dioxide from the soil to the air, helping ease global warming. And the increased carbon dioxide in the soil, he said, will help farmers grow enough food to feed the expanding world population without using more and more chemicals and fertilizers.

HEADLINE: Hunger Rising, Study Says

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, April 4

 BODY:
A study by Second Harvest, a national network of food banks, indicates that even as the economy booms, more people are seeking relief from hunger.
The study, based on interviews with 28,000 people visiting soup kitchens, shelters and food pantries across the country, found that 26 million Americans made onetime visits to charitable food programs during 1997 -- an increase of 15 percent on average to charitable food programs. 
 The report, "Hunger -- The Faces and Facts," was released on Friday at Senior Gleaners, a volunteer organization that distributes food to charities throughout Northern California and Nevada.
Christine Vladimiroff, the president of Second Harvest, said the healthy economy is bypassing about 20 percent of the population, many of them children and the elderly.

HEADLINE: D. C. McClelland, 80, Pioneer In Work on Human Motivation

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Dr. David C. McClelland, a psychologist who studied human motivation, job competency and the entrepreneurial spirit, died on March 27 at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 80.
For most of his 57-year teaching and research career, he enthralled Harvard University students with his unconventional, even radical, approaches to studying human personality. He was among the first scholars to offer scientific evidence that successful entrepreneurs were driven by an inordinate need to achieve. 
 Dr. McClelland's studies on motivating achievement raised many eyebrows. Instead of relying on clinical intuition to interpret fantasies and imaginative thoughts, he and his students developed scoring systems to map those thoughts. The researchers used various experiments to measure psychological characteristics, in effect quantifying those drives.
"He was one of the most creative psychologists that I have ever known," said David G. Winter, a psychology professor at the University of Michigan who had studied with Dr. McClelland at Harvard. "He was always interested in measuring things that you might call ineffable or subtle. He tried to be both B. F. Skinner and Sigmund Freud."
Dr. McClelland advanced his argument that the desire to achieve was a factor in entrepreneurship and economic growth in the 1960's. Under State Department sponsorship, he trained entrepreneurs in India, Ethiopia and other countries. In 1963, he was a co-founder of McBer, a consulting company in Boston that helps employers assess and train people to improve effectiveness.
Ten years later, Dr. McClelland wrote an influential article in The American Psychologist in which he said that commonly used I.Q. and personality hiring tests were poor predictors of applicants' performance. Companies, he argued, should hire based on competency in relevant fields, meaning that a company should hire, say, a mechanic based not on Scholastic Assessment Tests but on spatial reasoning.
His idea, competency assessment, was considered radical at the time but has become a standard tool in many corporations.
Toward the end of his career, Dr. McClelland focused more on the relationships among motivation, the quest for power and physical and emotional stress. He wrote or was co-author of several books, including "Personality" (Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1951), "The Achieving Society" (Van Nostrand, 1961) and "Human Motivation" (Cambridge University Press, 1985).
Dr. McClelland instructed students at institutions other than Harvard, including Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., his alma mater, and Boston University, where he was a research professor of psychology from 1986 until his death.
He was born in Mount Vernon, N.Y. Dr. McClelland grew up in Illinois and lived the rest of his life in New England. He graduated from Wesleyan in 1941, and received his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1941.
Surviving are his second wife, Marian Adams McClelland, and their children, Mira, 14, and Usha, 12, as well as five children and nine grandchildren from his first marriage. The five are Catherine Dole of Morristown, N.J.; Duncan McClelland of Winchester, Mass.; Nicholas McClelland of Marblehead, Mass.; Sarah McMullen of Downey, Calif., and Jabez McClelland of Bethesda, Md.
Dr. McClelland's first wife, Mary Sharpless McClelland, died in 1980.

HEADLINE: Droves of Rich Foreigners Hit the Slopes of Colorado

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: VAIL, Colo., March 30

 BODY:
The high chiseled peaks are American Rockies, the resort architecture is neo-Tyrolean, but in a few days the language of the lift lines will be Mexican Spanish.
"During Semana Santa you will hear so much Spanish in the streets, you will think you are in Mexico City," Elena Campa said today, forecasting a large Easter invasion of wealthy skiers from Mexico and points south. 
 A pioneer in this emerging Latin skiing market, Ms. Campa publishes Andando por Vail, a brochure that advertises in Spanish everything from furs to ski boots. The number of pages of her Vail guide quickly tripled, and she recently started Andando brochures for other Colorado resorts, including one brochure in Portuguese for Brazilians who flock to Aspen.
Colorado, long the nation's most popular skiing state, is rapidly becoming a sort of Cancun with snow. In three winters, the number of foreign skiers at Colorado resorts has increased to 9 percent of the total last year from 6 percent.
This season at Aspen, the Rockies' most cosmopolitan resort, nearly one quarter of all lift tickets have been sold to foreigners. More British skiers are expected to ski in North America, largely in Colorado, than in Switzerland.
"Someone who lives in the U.K. has to fly to a resort anyhow," said Kristen Kopplin, marketing director for Copper Mountain Resort. "And, unlike the Alps, we have guaranteed snow."
At nearby Breckenridge, newsstands stock London tabloids and magazines in the winter. Every Dec. 31, the Breckenridge Hilton has a New Year's party at 5 P.M. -- timed to coincide with festivities in Britain.
The British attachment to Colorado has grown so strong that in June, British Airways will begin direct daily service between London and Denver. Next year, Lufthansa is expected to begin direct flights between Frankfurt and Denver.
The desire to integrate Colorado into the world skiing economy is driven by the search for profitable growth. "Where the domestic market is flat, or growing slightly, our international market is growing every year," said Jean Alexander-Gitchell, international sales director for Vail, the nation's largest skiing area.
"Eighty percent of the world's skiers live outside of the United States," said John Frew, president of Colorado Ski Country USA, an industry group. "International destination skiers represent the most important and promising target market for our resorts."
His group's research indicates that the foreign skier visiting Colorado spends $300 a day, the out-of-state American skier spends $150 a day, and the day tripper from Denver spends $49 a day.
Foreigners not only spend more, they generally stay for at least a week, while the average out-of-state visitor skis here for four days, down from a week a decade ago.
The international influence can be felt across the Colorado Rockies.
"You close your eyes, and you think you are in Brazil -- 95 percent of the conversations are in Portuguese," Alexandra Lichtenberg, a businesswoman from Rio de Janeiro, said on a recent snowy afternoon at the Club Med in Copper Mountain.
"I was renting my skis and I ran into someone I knew from Rio, then I ran into a girl I knew from Sao Paulo 25 years ago," said Ms. Lichtenberg, who came to Vail and Copper Mountain with her sister, Wendy, and their four sons.
A Latin American tradition of turning overseas trips into shopping sprees is heightened by the radical change in climate.
"We live at sea level, we don't have snow, people don't know what to wear -- so we buy it here," said Esther Loewenstein, a visitor from Sao Paulo, who was wearing a new skiing outfit.
Last winter, Marise Cipriani, a Brazilian who owns Silver Creek Resort, began including trips to Denver's largest malls -- Cherry Creek and Park Meadows -- in her package tours for Brazilian guests.
"The Brazilians kept asking to go shopping," said Ms. Cipriani, whose family owns Transbrasil, one of Brazil's largest airlines.
Foreign fortunes are heating up an already overheated vacation home market in the Colorado Rockies.
In early March, a planned complex of 108 condominiums at Copper Mountain sold out in eight hours at an average price of $308,000 a unit. "We had several big spenders who flew in from Mexico for a couple of hours to buy places," Ms. Kopplin of Copper Mountain said.
In the United States, where an estimated 70 percent of skiers use the Internet, American skiing marketers increasingly favor Web sites over printed brochures, the traditional marketing tool. Vail Resorts maintains a Web site, www.snow.com, with pages in English and six other languages.
But Internet usage in other countries trails far behind that of the United States, and skiing marketers are using traditional tools: free trips for travel writers and agents. The four areas of Vail Resorts -- Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge and Keystone -- are represented by travel agencies in 39 countries, ranging from Argentina to Venezuela. Vail Resorts publishes its brochures in English, Dutch, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish.
Determined to attract more foreign visitors, Copper Mountain maintains international toll-free reservation numbers.
"They ring directly through to us here in Colorado," Ms. Kopplin said of people making reservations from Australia, Britain, Germany, Holland, Mexico and New Zealand. "There are people on this end of the phone that speak their language."

Cane? Fiberglass? It's Still Fishing

BYLINE: By Nelson Bryant 

 BODY:
Norman Rockwell's 1948 calendar illustration of a barefoot lad and his eager beagle loping across a field beside an older man at the start of a fishing adventure dramatizes the changes that have taken place in recreational fishing in the United States during the past half century.
The boy is carrying a cane pole with line and bobber attached, and a worm can dangles from his waist. Rockwell, who was best known for his nostalgic Saturday Evening Post covers -- hundreds of them from 1916 to 1963 -- equipped the man with a split bamboo rod, a rudimentary bait casting reel and a wicker creel. 
 Today, the boy's cane pole would be replaced by ultralight spinning gear, his worm can would be a box of lures, and the man's rod and reel would be hanging in a collector's den, as would his creel.
It wouldn't be too far-fetched for an illustrator of a 1998 version of that scene to give both of them waders, a fly rod and a fly-fishing vest. There should be no creel. Creels are used to bring home fish for the table, a ritual that has fallen into disrepute because many species -- wild trout among them -- are in short supply. Today's youthful anglers are likely to eschew the messy business of killing and cleaning their catch and to settle for a Big Mac.
If they are trout fishermen, they know that portions of some streams are limited to catch and release, and even if there is no legal restriction against the act, growing numbers of anglers are morally opposed to killing their quarry, hence the scarcity of creels in trout country.
There are variations on this theme. The daily limit for trout or some other species might be one fish of a certain size. At present, for example, sport fishermen in my home state, Massachusetts, are limited to one striped bass a day, 28 or more inches long. This hampers food gathering. When fly-fishing for stripers, I find that, on the average, I catch and release more than 100 sub-legal bass for every one that I can keep and eat.
Despite legal or ethical restrictions against keeping one's catch, sport fishing is big business, and is the nation's third most popular participant sport, topped only by swimming and bicycling. In 1996, according to the American Sportfishing Association, the total economic impact of recreational fishing in the United States reached $108 billion, which is, says the association, a 36 percent increase over the 1991 figure.
The association's economic estimate derives from a 1996 nationwide survey, conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which included expenditures by anglers in pursuit of their sport. In New York State alone in 1996, sport fishing's total economic impact was over $3.1 billion. California led with $7.1 billion, followed by Texas with $6.3 billion.
Although the ranks of anglers remained virtually stable from 1991 to 1996 -- some 50 million, if children under 16 are included -- by 1996 they were fishing more often and spending more money. Money shelled out for fishing trips was the largest single expenditure, over 40 percent, followed closely by the cost of boats, motors and vehicles. Equipment, including rods and reels, accounted for about 14 percent.
Freshwater fishing accounts for the majority of angler expenditures in the United States. This is true even in New York State with its extensive fish-rich coastline.
The nationwide, big-money professional tournaments for freshwater black bass, sponsored by the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society, have contributed mightily to angling's popularity. Founded in 1968, B.A.S.S., which advocates catch and release, now has half a million members, and bass have become the favorite quarry of this country's anglers.
Bruce Shupp, the organization's conservation director, said more than 75 percent of its members release all the bass they catch. In the organization's tournaments, the fish are kept in live wells, weighed, and returned to the water alive.
New fishing magazines and a spate of new books -- or reprints of old ones -- have also sparked interest in sport fishing. Fly-fishing got a substantial boost from Robert Redford's film version of Norman Maclean's book, "A River Runs Through It" and from the fly-fishing schools put on by Lee and Joan Wulff, Lefty Kreh, Mel Krieger and by fly-fishing houses, including Orvis and L. L. Bean.
Although both Orvis and L. L. Bean favor catch and release, both still offer wicker creels for sale, a nod to tradition that pleases some anglers who are long in the tooth.
Americans delight in competition. The prestigious International Game Fish Association, which is the official keeper of records for freshwater and saltwater species caught on rod and reel the world over, launched a junior angler record program last year. This year it set up separate records for women who fly-fish in saltwater. The association favors catch-and-release angling, but notes that it is not possible to weigh certain fish without killing them.
Both Trout Unlimited and the Atlantic Salmon Federation espouse catch and release, but Pete Rafle, a T.U. official, noted that to some anglers catch and release "has become a religion unto itself." He added that his organization regarded the practice as one of the tools used to protect trout, with the guarding and enhancing of trout habitat being another.
It is possible to catch certain species -- in fresh water, yellow perch and bullheads would be among them -- and bring them home for supper without feeling guilty. But booted or barefooted, someone beginning his angling career today would do well to focus on the total experience, minus -- sadly, to one who was a lad in the 1930's -- the closure symbolized by the endangered creel.

President and Congress Jockey for New Positions
The eruption 10 weeks ago of accusations regarding Mr. Clinton and a former White House intern upset the uneasy working relationship that allowed Congress and the President to enact a number of major initiatives. Now, with Congress in recess and the Paula Corbin Jones debacle quieted, the President is preparing to reclaim the public stage. But it is not clear whether the old balance of power can be restored. 1
 
Fewer People Pay Nanny Tax
Four years ago, Congress simplified the requirements for reporting wages paid to nannies, maids and other servants and for paying the employer's share of Social Security, Medicare and Federal unemployment taxes. The new law also requires that people who employ household help declare the taxes due on their income tax forms -- leading to a 40 percent drop in the number of people who pay those taxes. 1

HEADLINE: The Mayor's Reach

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
For a Mayor who takes pride in the tight control he has asserted over an economically buoyant city, they are both a political asset and a pesky distraction: New York City's 39 business improvement districts, which for more than a decade have performed a variety of municipal good works beyond the reach of City Hall.
But last week Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani informed the districts that, however commendable their work in cleaning streets, fighting crime and generally improving life, they would now have to submit to far greater city control. 
 "All activities and initiatives must be discussed with the Department of Business Services at the first opportunity and prior to their development," the city said in letters the districts began receiving on Thursday, provoking anger and confusion among business people.
Before the letters arrived, the Mayor had said on Thursday, "The fact is that most of the BID's were formed at a different time, when the city wasn't functioning as well, and when we allowed unaccountable activity all over the place."
From their inception in the 1980's, the districts have been charting unfamiliar territory at the intersection of private and public sectors. Formed by property owners who agree to pay for a variety of services and projects, the districts have been described by some urban planners as front line troops in a period of economic and social renewal.
The districts have helped make sidewalks, streets and neighborhoods cleaner, safer and more civil. And businesses admit that they have been rewarded with higher property values. Some of the larger districts have amassed hundreds of private security and sanitation workers, and invested millions of dollars in landscaping, signs and tourist services.
Would this be happening under tight government control?
"If you layer them over with bureaucracy it defeats the purpose," Emanuel Tobier, an economist and urban planner at New York University, said. "The point is that the BID's can do things better than the government, and if they weren't doing them, the city would still be a mess."
Executives involved with the districts said they were mystified by the Mayor's motives. Although all insisted on anonymity, the chairman of one large Manhattan district said the new rules might reflect the Mayor's fear that the districts' power will continue to grow. He said the Mayor might have begun to think that the districts are becoming too influential in municipal affairs, much as has happened with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly criticized as unaccountable to the city.
Other officials speculated that the Mayor might simply be imposing his own mark, in a effort to claim control and credit, as they say he has done with the Police Department and the Board of Education.
Even within city government, critics of the districts said the new rules would be difficult to enforce without interfering with their affairs.
"We do have to avoid trying to micromanage their affairs," said Herbert E. Berman, the chairman of the City Council Finance Committee. But he added, "The BID's can't work in a closed environment in which they are the only ones that know what is going on."
The districts are formed when a majority of commercial property owners in a neighborhood agree to participate and pay annual assessments. Then, all property owners -- even those who are opposed -- become members and are assessed.
Although the system generates the income to support its projects, it relies on the city to collect the money and return the proceeds to the districts' directors.
Each district is required to sign a five-year contract with the city that spells out what projects and services it plans, and four city representatives are appointed to each district's board. They include designees of the Department of Business Services, the Comptroller, the Borough President and the City Council. The city's representatives are far outnumbered by others on the districts' boards, which in some cases include more than 40 people.
"Obviously, since we are under contract with the city, they are entitled to a lot of oversight," said Michael A. Weiss, director of the Metrotech Business Improvement District in downtown Brooklyn and president of a managers' association representing all of the city's 39 districts.
Mr. Weiss said there appeared to be little legal recourse to fight the new policy. "The city probably has a lot of leeway in this," he said.
Still, the Mayor's motives for his edict remained unclear, particularly because he has repeatedly cited the districts as symbols of the city's renaissance. Instead of taking issue with the broad precepts of governance, several officials said privately, he may have been prompted by a series of irritants arising from some of the districts.
There was the City Council study, released in November by Mr. Berman's committee, that found that property owners in several of the districts felt they were being left out of their board's decisions on expenditures.
There was a Federal Court ruling in March that the Grand Central Partnership and the 34th Street Partnership, two of the largest districts, had illegally used homeless people as sanitation and security workers at below the minimum wage.
Advisers to the Mayor said his anger has also been provoked by a plan by the Times Square Business Improvement District to spend $1 million to restore the interior of a closed theater as a tourist information center on Seventh Avenue between 46th Street and 47th Street. After a series of missteps and disjointed negotiations, the district's plan, when it was announced in early February, did not include space for a booth that would be controlled by the city.
In an interview, Randy Levine, the Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, said the Mayor had been annoyed because the Times Square district had at first asked the city to pay rent to use such a booth. (All others who are to be represented in the tourist center, including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a theater owners' group, will pay rent.)
Meanwhile, since the plan for the center was announced, officials of the Times Square district said permits that they had expected to receive swiftly from the city's Landmarks Commission have been delayed, without explanation. (Officials of the Landmarks Commission did not respond to repeated requests last week for information on the status of the permits.)
Now, with their project delayed, and left to reflect on the potential effect of the city's new oversight rules, executives in the Times Square district said they were eager to appease the mayor.
Robert M. Kaufman, the district's chairman, said the city's initial request for free space had been denied "because, legally, we are not supposed to be subsidizing the city." But in recent weeks, he said, the district has written to the Mayor, offering free space, but has received no response.
Now, Mr. Kaufman said, the district has been granted a meeting with the Mayor on Tuesday and plans to present its offer in person. "It still stands," he said. "The city can have our best booth at no charge."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
The D.H. Is 25 Years Old, but Now the Question Is Whether It Will Get to 30

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
With the elimination of the designated hitter from his team, Milwaukee's Cal Eldred faced Greg Maddux on opening day last week and lined a single to right-center field.
"I think it was a fastball," Eldred, the Brewers' starting pitcher, said of the pitch from Maddux. "That tells you how much I know about what I'm doing up there." 
 The way Bobby Bonilla tells it, he did not know a whole lot more about what he was doing at bat when he was the Baltimore Orioles' designated hitter two years ago, a circumstance that was overcome with controversy.
"The trouble is, I told the truth," Bonilla said. "I was asked about being the d.h. I said I didn't like it. I didn't say I wouldn't do it. But I figured after hitting .190 for two months, it wasn't for me."
The designated hitter, now 25 years old, has always been a source of debate, and now it threatens to engender ever-nastier controversy. The owners' labor representatives, following a procedure provided for in the collective bargaining agreement, have sent the union a notice they feel would allow them to change the designated hitter rule unilaterally next year (the union disputes that position) if the owners want to eliminate the position and the players balk.
Donald Fehr, the head of the union, has reacted harshly to what he perceives as a threat and a signal that the owners are willing to shatter the labor peace that has existed since the end of the 1994-95 strike. But the owners, management people say, have made no decision among themselves about the future of the d.h.
"We have nothing in particular in mind right now," said Bud Selig, the acting commissioner. "There is no reason to force any decision on the d.h."
Last summer the owners proposed that the designated hitter be phased out over three to five years. As a quid pro quo, they offered to add a 26th spot to team rosters. The players rejected the proposal.
"At that point we were talking about a rather significant amount of realignment," Selig said. "I guess I would call that the event in history, the force that would say we need to have one set of playing rules. At least for the time being, we don't need to do that."
Selig said he believed at the time there would have been enough votes in the American League to kill the designated hitter. But he added: "That was based on a lot of contingencies, and now all of those contingencies are gone. There is no specific proposal right now to force the American League to consider elimination of the d.h. We'll see what happens in the next two, three years."
Renewed discussion about realignment could trigger renewed consideration, but Selig, speaking vaguely, said, "I think you'll find any future debate on the d.h. will be tied to something else, and what that something else is isn't clear right now."
What will not happen, Selig said confidently, is the acceptance of the designated hitter by the National League. "It became clear in the realignment discussion," he said, "that the National League clubs were unalterably opposed to the designated hitter. They are inflexible. If anybody thinks ultimately the National League will go to the d.h., they're living in a fairy land. That's not going to happen."
Bonilla, for one, is delighted that the N.L. does not have the designated hitter. "You have to learn how to do it," the Florida Marlins' third baseman said. Then he praised such designated hitters as Harold Baines of Baltimore, Paul Molitor of Minnesota, Edgar Martinez of Seattle and Chili Davis of the Yankees.
"Bainesy said it took him two, three years," Bonilla said. "Molitor said he pretty much had to do it because of his arm. Edgar Martinez, if he picked up his glove he got hurt. They wouldn't let him pick up a glove anymore. Chili in New York -- a tremendous pickup."
The designated hitter, Bonilla added, is "a very sensitive subject with me because I like to see the guys playing, but I enjoy playing the whole game."
 
Great Power, Great Hitter
 Mark McGwire's sizzling start for St. Louis has figure fanatics agog. Based on his pace in the Cardinals' first four games, they can say, McGwire will hit 162 home runs. Sound silly? Of course. But it is just as silly to project what a player will do for an entire season based on 20 or 40 or 60 games.
Phil Garner, on the other hand, offered a meaningful assessment of McGwire's development as a hitter.
"Four or five years ago, he was a good power hitter but without a good swing," the Milwaukee manager said. "He had a big loop in his swing, and you could pitch to him. But in the last couple years, he has developed a good swing. He doesn't have that loop anymore. He's a .300 hitter. Add to that the power, and he's a devastating hitter."
 
Nothing but the Truth
 After Hideki Irabu had defeated the Detroit Tigers in his major league debut last July, the Detroit players were generally complimentary about his performance. Brian Hunter, however, presented a contrary assessment. Irabu was nothing special, Hunter said of the Yankees' heralded rookie; wait until he pitches against a more veteran team whose hitters would be smarter than the Tigers.
Sure enough, five days later, the wily Indians roughed up Irabu and deflated the balloon of hype and hope that the Yankees had created for Irabu. The development came as no surprise to Hunter.
"I just tell the truth," Hunter said eight months later when asked about his candid remarks. "Everybody was kind of comparing him to Roger Clemens and all these great pitchers, and it's unfair to do that to him."
Hunter said everyone else on his team thought as he did, but nobody wanted to say it. "They were saying the same thing I was," the center fielder said. "It just came out different. They know big words. I don't know a lot of big words. I wasn't trying to hurt anyone's feelings. The media there had some fun with it. They said I called him a bust. I didn't call him a bust. I said in time he may be one of the great pitchers, but it's not fair to compare him to great pitchers now."
 
Turn Two? Not Against Biggio
 Last year, Craig Biggio, the Houston Astros' outstanding second baseman, became only the third player in major league history to go through an entire season playing a minimum of 150 games without grounding into a double play. Playing in all 162 games, he joined Dick McAuliffe of Detroit (1968) and Augie Galan of the Chicago Cubs (1935).
Biggio recalled one instance in particular in which he thought he would be out at first. "I had to thank Tim Bogar," he said. "He went in real hard to second and wiped the guy out, and he airmailed the ball to first."
Reflecting on his rare feat, Biggio added: "You don't really think about it, but when the season is over, you do and say, 'Wow.' You're going to hit into one or two or three no matter who you are, no matter how fast you are. You have to have luck on your side to go through a season without hitting into one."
Luck evidently abandoned Biggio this year. He grounded into a double play in his second time at bat in the Astros' opener against San Francisco.
If luck had been by his side again, the wicked one-hopper that Biggio hit to third base would have gone a few inches to Bill Mueller's right. But the ball sped directly at Mueller, who fielded it on his knees, then got up and threw to second to force Brad Ausmus.
Unlike Bogar last year, Ausmus did not have a chance to take out second baseman Jeff Kent, whose throw to J.T. Snow easily got Biggio.
 
Crowns and Crowds
 Before their game with Milwaukee today, the Florida Marlins will present World Series championship rings to their players. The ceremony will take half the time it normally might take because half of the players are gone.
In shredding their World Series team, the Marlins forfeited the economic boost that baseball history shows comes from a championship. The economic benefits for a team come not necessarily in the championship season, but in the following year. Of the 10 previous World Series champions, eight experienced an increase in attendance the next season.
Of those eight, four set team attendance records the season after: the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993, the Oakland Athletics in 1990, the Minnesota Twins in 1988 and the Mets in 1987. The Blue Jays drew more than four million fans, the Twins and the Mets exceeded three million, and the A's reached what was for them an astronomical total, 2.9 million.
The two teams that did not have higher attendances, the 1991 Cincinnati Reds and the 1989 Los Angeles Dodgers, dropped off by mere thousands, the Reds by 28,000 and the Dodgers by 36,000. The Marlins are expected to draw closer to their 1996 attendance of 1,746,767 than the 1997 total of 2,364,387.

HEADLINE: U.S. Auditing Five Hospitals In New York

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
Five teaching hospitals in New York City and Long Island are being investigated by the Federal Government to determine whether they submitted fraudulent Medicare bills for tens of millions of dollars.
The audits are part of a nationwide effort to determine whether hospitals overbill the Government for treatment by highly paid senior doctors when the care is actually given by doctors in training. The Government is also looking into whether doctors and hospitals charge Medicare for more complex -- and expensive -- treatment than they actually provide. 
 The Government first put the nation's 1,200 teaching hospitals on notice that it planned to vigorously pursue such overpayments three years ago, when it announced that the University of Pennsylvania's health system, while admitting no wrongdoing, had agreed to pay $30 million to settle complaints that it had improperly billed Medicare for doctors' services. Since then, three other hospitals have paid a total of $37.6 million to settle similar charges.
But this latest round of audits is the first to involve hospitals in New York State, which has the greatest concentration of medical schools and teaching hospitals in the nation and trains about 15 percent of the nation's medical residents. Of the 105 teaching hospitals in the state, 77 are in the New York City metropolitan area.
If the Government examines the records of all of them and seeks reimbursements and penalties in line with those announced in other states, hospitals in New York might have to pay collective penalties of several hundred million dollars, health care economists said .
Hospitals and trade organizations around the country have denounced the audits, asserting that hospitals submitted bills in good faith and that the Government is retroactively applying standards that were only recently clarified by the Health Care Financing Administration, which is the Department of Health and Human Services agency that administers the multibillion-dollar Medicare program for the elderly and disabled.
The audits cover the period from July 1, 1995, to June 30, 1996. Guidelines that made the existing regulations more understandable were announced in December 1995 and took effect on July 1, 1996.
But Federal officials and several health care economists said most hospitals were well aware of the standards and merely took advantage of lax enforcement.
"People get comfortable with what they are doing and forget to follow the regulations," said Michael Mangano, principal deputy inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services. "The first line of defense of anyone who gets confronted by an audit is to say the rules were vague. And then when we show them the rules were spelled out clearly, they turn and say, 'But you never enforced them.' Well, we're calling people on it now. Taxpayers have a right not to pay for what they don't get."
Mr. Mangano did not have an estimate of the costs related to this type of Medicare fraud.
Mr. Mangano would not confirm that any New York hospitals are being audited, and would say only that 40 audits are under way across the country. But hospital officials in New York said the state hospitals facing audits are Mount Sinai Medical Center and Beth Israel Medical Center, both in Manhattan; Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens; University Hospital of Brooklyn of the State University of New York Health Science Center (commonly known as Downstate), and University Hospital of SUNY at Stony Brook, on Long Island. Officials at the hospitals under review declined to comment on the record for fear of antagonizing the auditors.
Investigators and hospital industry analysts said the inquiries conducted so far have not only revealed abusive financial practices in some of the nation's teaching hospitals, but have also highlighted how often novice doctors treat patients without proper guidance and supervision.
Time and again, investigators said, the records at teaching hospitals have shown that senior doctors responsible for training new physicians leave diagnosis and treatment in their inexperienced hands -- then review the decisions by reading patients' charts and cosigning the entries. Those senior doctors then charge the Government as if they had played a bigger role, Government officials said.
In doing so, officials say, they are billing the Government twice for the same service. The officials explained that under what is known as Part A, Medicare already pays a share of the residents' salaries and many of the indirect costs connected with graduate medical education.
Senior doctors may charge for patient care, under what is known as Medicare Part B, when they deliver it themselves or provide direct supervision of a resident's work beyond the tutorials that go on during rounds. In both cases their participation must be properly documented.
But before July 1996, hospital officials say, regulations spelling out how much oversight and hands-on participation a senior physician needed to give before billing the Government, and how to document that involvement properly, were vaguely worded. Moreover, the officials say, the rules were inconsistently publicized and applied by the dozens of intermediary carriers across the country that handle Medicare billing.
In preparing hospitals for their audits, the health department's Inspector General provides copies of documents that the Government says show whether the local carrier gave clear billing directives.
In the current audits, the Government has decided not to investigate hospitals whose carriers gave unclear directions or guidelines that conflicted with Federal policy.
The main carrier for the New York metropolitan region is Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. New York hospital officials contend that much of the material the Inspector General provided to them was isolated paragraphs and pages from a newsletter dealing with Empire's main line of insurance business, a publication they say providers were never told to regard as the official source for Medicare billing information. They point out that the newsletters were filled with seasonal pictures of Santa Claus and pumpkins and tidbits about Empire employees.
They contrasted the directives from Empire with more formal and explicit ones distributed by carriers in other states.
"We have hospitals that underwent periodic audits, had their charts reviewed and their billings approved, and they don't conform to the new standards," said Susan Waltman, senior vice president and general counsel of the Greater New York Hospital Association, an industry group. "How can the Government now turn around and say we should have known that our practices were wrong? Our practices were cleared by the carrier."
The biggest concern for hospitals is whether a senior doctor's cosignature alongside a chart entry written by a resident for work basically carried out by the resident is sufficient proof that a senior doctor supervised the work and is entitled to payment.
The clarified regulations clearly state that the underlying note must mention the senior doctor's involvement or the senior doctor must write a detailed addendum. Hospitals say that in the past, Empire and other carriers routinely accepted a cosignature alone as sufficient. But Government officials say many of their audits have shown that doctors were out of the hospital, even out of the state, when the treatment was rendered, then cosigned the charts at a later date and billed for the work.
Hospital officials also complained that the audit process itself is coercive. The Inspector General offers hospitals two audit options: Have the Government pay for auditors or be viewed as cooperative and hire an outside auditor acceptable to the Inspector General. If hospitals pick the first option and the auditors find false claims, the hospitals are liable for costs up to triple the loss to Medicare plus up to $10,000 per billing, because the investigations come under the Civil False Claims Act. If they pick the second option, they risk only double penalties.
"It's a classic Hobson's choice," said a senior-level employee at Mount Sinai who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. "And it's distressing that the Government goes into this viewing every error in billing as fraud."
The Greater New York Hospital Association, along with Beth Israel, Mount Sinai and New York University Medical Center, plan to file a lawsuit challenging the audit process in New York, contending that there was no clear guidance from Empire regarding the level of senior physician presence and the type of documents required before billing.
A similar suit challenging the overall fairness of the audit process was filed last fall in a Federal District Court in California, with arguments to be heard this month.
Government officials discounted the hospitals' arguments. They said their best proof that the rules were clear is that two hospitals -- Yale-New Haven and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H. -- went through audits, were found to have acceptable error rates and did not have to pay either reimbursements or penalties.
Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University, said audits like these are an efficient way for the Government to hold down fraud. "For every one place they hit, 10 other places are trembling in their boots and cleaning up their act," Dr. Reinhardt said. "It's like cops on a highway. They can't go after every speeder, but knowing that the one they go after could be you keeps people more honest."

HEADLINE: Peril of Politics in Japan

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 4

 BODY:
As the world's second-largest economy lurches to a standstill, possibly threatening to cause a global slowdown, paradoxically the fundamental reasons are not economic.
Instead, they are political. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is a weak leader governing with a fragile coalition of parties and factions that seldom agree with each other, so the Government finds it difficult to shift economic directions even as it becomes clear that the Japanese ship of state is heading toward an iceberg. And the Japanese system is based on consensus, which has always made decision-making here difficult in a crisis. 
 "The Hashimoto administration is in a terrible situation," said Makoto Sataka, a writer on economic issues. It is flying a plane, he said, and the "destination of such a plane is a crash."
On Friday President Clinton renewed his pressure on Mr. Hashimoto, calling on Japan to "take a bold course" and stimulate its economy. But the problem in a sense is that there is no counterpart to Mr. Clinton here. Tokyo is a hydra, with each head looking the other way and blaming the next.
"There is wealth here in Japan, there are diligent people here in Japan, there is obedient labor in Japan," said Ryuji Konishi, former managing director at the Long-Term Credit Bank, one of Japan's largest financial institutions. "However, there is no leadership."
Yet, equally paradoxically, the problem is not simply a lack of decisiveness. A year ago, the leaders in Mr. Hashimoto's Government were unusually decisive -- in pushing through a tax increase, cutting public spending and suspending tax breaks. But all that helped steer Japan toward its present economic disaster.
Having established that policy direction a year ago, Mr. Hashimoto's Government is finding it extremely difficult to be decisive once again and to switch course. So now Japan is paying the price for those fiscal austerity measures, and for seven years of delays in confronting the country's economic troubles. A result is that consumers' willingness to spend has fallen to its lowest level in nearly three decades, unemployment has soared to a 45-year high, unsold products are piling up in warehouses and wages and industrial production and corporate profits are all sliding.
Many economists say Japan is now headed for its first major recession in a quarter-century. Such a downturn, they say, could prompt Japanese companies to cut back or abandon operations in the United States and elsewhere, or to sell some of the country's $800 billion in net assets abroad. It would also threaten prospects for a recovery in the Asian financial crisis.
Asian countries dependent on exports desperately need buyers for their goods, and so far the United States has filled that role. But Japan, the world's largest creditor nation, with an economy twice as big as the rest of Asia combined, has so far been unable to absorb many additional products from countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea. Because its own economy is so weak, it cannot be Asia's buyer of last resort.
The United States -- along with many private Japanese economists -- is urging two strategies to revive the Japanese economy and avert a dangerous downturn. The first is a huge fiscal stimulus, some combination of deficit spending and tax cuts. The second is far-reaching economic deregulation.
The Government has made some headway in both, but not much.
Prime Minister Hashimoto has been reluctant to pursue the fiscal stimulus, because until a few months ago he was hailing as a major triumph his opposite strategy: fiscal austerity measures intended to put the Government on a sounder financial footing. During the last few months, under strong American pressure, he has agreed to take some degree of stimulus measures, but it is not clear how much.
"We will boldly do what we have to do," Mr. Hashimoto told Japanese reporters on Friday.
In fact, some Western economists say the Government has a reasonable position in its concern for fiscal deficits. The aging of the Japanese population is projected to lead to huge spending in the coming decades, and that makes it all the more important to cut deficit spending now -- and Japan has a huge budget deficit already.
Yet the general verdict is that while the Government has a legitimate concern, it has been obsessed with the issue. These days, many say, the risk of a recession is so severe that some greater fiscal stimulus is essential, even at the risk of worsening the Government's accounts.
"The Government should borrow," said Shijuro Ogata, a former deputy governor at the Bank of Japan. "We have enormous savings. The Government should not worry about borrowing, for the sake of the country, for the sake of Asia and for the sake of the world."
Yet the Government has another practical reason for delay. The fiscal stimulus will come in a supplemental budget that can only be drawn up after the regular budget is approved later this month. So under the rules of the political game here, Mr. Hashimoto cannot really begin talking about the details of a fiscal stimulus for a few more weeks.
The other approach to stimulating the economy -- deregulation -- will be difficult because most of the proposed efforts at deregulation are opposed by key interest groups and cannot simply be pushed through Parliament by a weak leader like Mr. Hashimoto.
On Wednesday Japan did introduce a wide-ranging financial deregulation package called the Big Bang, for which many have high hopes. But just a day earlier, the Government reverted to a traditional tactic of propping up stock prices with public money to help support banks that rely on stocks to boost their capital base at the end of each fiscal quarter.
A broader problem is that Japan has been so used to the idea of Government direction of the economy that few leaders seem to have a vision of the direction that most of the industrialized world is headed.
"I don't think they fully understand what the market means," said Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst at SBC Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo. "They lack a fundamental understanding of a market economy. They are more worried about farmers losing jobs in construction work. To me, it's a simple mismatch of the system."
To be sure, Japanese leaders have taken some important measures in recent months: a $15 billion tax cut, a $222 billion bank bailout, a $120 billion package of economic stimulants. "Japan is starting to take correct action," said Richard Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute. "Public spending always works."
But some economists say the problem is that Japan's leaders waited too long. The tax cut put $15 billion into the pockets of Japanese consumers in February, but the effects were negligible. So economists worry that a bigger tax cut may not give as big a boost to the economy as is hoped.
The $222 billion in public funds for the banks has helped increase the capital base of the banks and thereby brought some stability, but there is still a credit squeeze because banks remain reluctant to lend in a time of rising corporate bankruptcies.
The $120 billion package is currently being drafted, but economists say they fear that much of the package will be in the form of Government loans that will replace bank lending, rather than actual money that will stimulate the economy.
Japan's economic troubles began when the speculative bubble burst in the early 1990's. Since then, Japan has been battling a banking crisis caused by a plunge in the property market that led to bad and doubtful debt of more than $600 billion, an amount larger than the size of the entire Chinese economy.
Then last fall, four financial institutions collapsed, leading to a sharp financial crisis, and corporate bankruptcies are now soaring. With economies in Asia shrinking, and therefore the appetite for Japanese exports declining, Japan's economy is suffering its worse crisis in decades.
"The real fact is that there is no magic bullet, and they have a very complex economic adjustment going on," said Jesper Koll, economist at J. P. Morgan Securities Asia Ltd. about the Japanese leaders. "We are in a period of crazy ad hoc-ism."

HEADLINE: DISMISSAL OF SUIT PUTS CLINTON BACK ON CENTER STAGE

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
For two years, President Clinton and the Republicans were locked in an uneasy embrace that allowed them to enact a number of major initiatives like the balanced budget agreement while containing their mutual hostility.
But the eruption 10 weeks ago of accusations regarding Mr. Clinton and a former White House intern upset that delicate balance, as the White House devoted much of its private and public energies to dealing with the potentially fatal accusations and as the Republicans awaited, mostly in silence, the outcome of the investigation. 
 This week, a Federal judge's surprising dismissal of Paula Corbin Jones's sexual misconduct lawsuit against the President promised to change the political calculus once again. But it was not clear at week's end that the old Clinton-Congress relationship could be restored to anything resembling the balance of power that existed in the age of relative innocence before anyone had heard of Monica S. Lewinsky.
With Congress gone for a two-week Easter recess and the Paula Jones debacle quieted, at least for now, the President is preparing to change the subject and reclaim the public stage. Mr. Clinton will try to appeal to a scandal-sated electorate with a new series of policy proposals built on the foundation laid in January in his State of the Union address, which has been largely drowned out in recent months by the Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones matters.
Less than 12 hours after returning from a 12-day trip to Africa, Mr. Clinton was before the cameras in the White House Rose Garden on Friday to criticize Republicans for their $1.73 trillion budget plan that ignores many of his priorities, to press for a tobacco bill and to raise questions about Tokyo's management of the Japanese economy.
The President is planning a full week of domestic policy pronouncements: Monday on crime, Tuesday on Social Security, Wednesday on education standards, Thursday on tobacco, Friday on school safety. He is using the breathing room that a Federal district judge, Susan Webber Wright, gave him by dismissing Ms. Jones's lawsuit to bring pressure on Congress to begin to deal with his priorities for this year.
At the White House, aides see an opening for the President to recover some lost ground.
"We're going to try to show a picture of the President busy at work on important issues and try to pull the media into covering the President busy at work," said a senior White House aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
This official said the Jones decision should be taken by Republicans in Congress as a sign that it is time to resume cooperating with the White House on issues -- like tobacco -- where compromise is possible and the political benefits are substantial and bipartisan.
But this aide said: "There has always been a wing of their party that believed that pushing scandals as an issue was a political strategy for them. There's not much evidence that it's right; and now there is a lot of evidence that it's wrong."
Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant, agreed. He said Republicans should focus on the handful of items they agreed on internally -- tax overhaul, restructuring of the Internal Revenue Service and an emphasis on private savings accounts as a solution to the looming Social Security shortfall -- and use them to draw distinctions with the President's agenda. Beating up on the President on the issue of morality will only anger the public and cost Republicans votes in the midterm elections in November, Mr. Luntz said.
"Some Republicans keep waiting for the other shoe to drop on Clinton," Mr. Luntz added. "It never happened. Bill Clinton is a survivor. In a tornado, he'll be in the eye; it's a way of life for him. Some Republicans still just don't accept that."
White House aides insisted that Mr. Clinton never stopped attending to what he calls "the job the American people hired me to do," even as the newspapers and airwaves were soaked in humiliating accounts of his encounters with various women over the past 20 years and political coverage was devoted to examining a "Presidency in crisis."
"We've done a good job of continuing to do our stuff in the wake of this barrage," the senior White House aide said. "What has changed is that maybe now we'll be able to be better heard."
Until Mr. Clinton's well-received trip to Africa, the President's substantive exploits were relegated to small corners of inside newspaper pages and short items in the evening news broadcasts.
The White House policy shop has continued to produce briefing papers and policy proposals, under strict orders from Erskine B. Bowles, the chief of staff, to stick to business as usual. But the White House political apparatus, which in ordinary times would be pushing policy and public relations initiatives, has been consumed with monitoring the scandal and trying to contain its fallout.
As public attention focused on Mr. Clinton and his legal difficulties, the President and Speaker Newt Gingrich quietly carried on discussions aimed at finding common ground, particularly on Social Security and tobacco legislation.
Mr. Gingrich, in an interview late this week, said the President had not been personally engaged in recent debates on Capitol Hill on campaign finance, transportation issues and the budget. Nor does he expect Mr. Clinton to become visibly involved with Republicans on the Congressional agenda in the coming months.
"I don't think there's much up here to engage him," Mr. Gingrich said. "Remember, last year we only engaged on a handful of very big things. I think this year we'll eventually engage on a handful of very big things."
He singled out Social Security, on which both he and Mr. Clinton are committed to fundamental change, although their approaches are at odds. Mr. Clinton advocates reserving any budget surplus until the retirement system is put on firm financial footing while Republicans propose partial privatization.
"We both believe we should deal with Social Security," Mr. Gingrich said. "We both believe that our generation should solve it now before we're older because it gets a lot more painful if you wait very long. So that's huge."
For now, the issues related to Mr. Clinton's private life have moved from the critical list to the chronic care ward as the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, continues his investigation of the President's personal and public conduct over the past two decades. But that investigation still poses a substantial threat to the President -- and a challenge to Republicans.
"Starr and his report still hang over all of Washington's political players," said Stuart Rothenberg, publisher of a political newsletter here. "The President because he doesn't know what's in it, the Republicans in Congress because they don't know how to deal with it."
But in this climate, Mr. Clinton has at least a momentary advantage, Mr. Rothenberg said, because he has a clear agenda for the year while the Republicans are united on only one proposition -- that he is a cad.
"He comes back from Africa more focused, while the Republicans are merely trying to stagger through to November," Mr. Rothenberg said. "The Republicans are on the defensive, trying to explain why they brushed off campaign finance reform, trying to figure out what to do about tobacco. Their whole focus is to avoid screwing up and to avoid a debilitating internal battle."
Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, essentially dismissed the possibility of impeachment arising from Mr. Starr's various investigations. Mr. Specter, a former district attorney in Philadelphia, said this week that Congress would probably not even consider an impeachment inquiry unless it was presented with "an open-and-shut case" that would lead to the President's resignation, as in the case of President Richard M. Nixon.
Mr. Specter said Judge Wright's decision to dismiss the Jones lawsuit had changed the political climate in Washington, even though the judge did not rule on whether Mr. Clinton had made a "boorish" sexual overture to Ms. Jones.
"It changes the political atmospherics because Judge Wright's opinion will be widely read as to say that Ms. Jones should not have bothered the President to start with or should not have brought the lawsuit," Mr. Specter said. "The political atmospherics have changed in the President's favor."

HEADLINE: In Little City Safe From Violence, Rash of Suicides Leaves Scars

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: PIERRE, S.D.

 BODY:
Sometime on the afternoon of Dec. 2, after he grabbed lunch with a school buddy, rode around town in a pickup truck and bought Christmas presents with his pocket money, 15-year-old Kenny White shredded the secrets of his short life when he gripped his father's pistol and shot himself in the head.
"I really don't know what to say in these dam things, but I want you to know that I love you mom and dad," Kenny had scribbled on notebook paper found in the bedroom next to his slumped frame. "I'm not in English class so my spelling doesn't have to be perfict." 
 He asked his mother to quit smoking and his parents, separated for 10 years, to remarry. "Take good care of my cat, Smokey Jr.," he wrote. "Also, I'm putting my will in this letter." He said his baseball cards should go to Steve, "my bee-bee gun collection" to Ricky, "my Minnesota Twins jersey" to Steven, adding: "It also needs to be washed. It's in my back pack."
It was the cipher of a child, giving no real inkling of what could drive someone so young to suicide. But to the people of Pierre, the most frightening thing was that they had seen it too often before.
In the last three years, Pierre -- the capital of South Dakota, though a city of only 13,000 people -- has been wrenched by a series of suicides, most of them young people. Eleven people from 13 to 23 years old, including 8 teen-agers, have killed themselves, about 13 times the national rate of 13 per 100,000 population per year.
The suicides have begun to haunt Pierre (pronounced PEER), which sits on a skinny elbow of the Missouri River and has one high school, one hospital and one shopping mall.
In the treeless center of this corn-stubbled state, in the gullet of the Great Plains, Pierre is such a safe place that the police captain rarely locks his house, and he cannot remember the last time someone so much as stole a car.
In January, when a 21-year-old man killed his 19-year-old former girlfriend and then himself, it was the city's first murder in nine years.
"People just don't kill each other around here," said Velda Bartel, whose son John, 19, committed suicide the summer before last. "They kill themselves instead."
Now, after the death of Kenny White, who had shown few signs of severe distress, and a State Health Department report on the extraordinary suicide rate, people in Pierre have begun an impassioned effort to stop the suicides. For many, this meant swallowing their ambivalence, hurt and pride to seek advice from around the country, as they realized how ill-equipped the city had been to cope with such trauma.
"We're the capital city, but we've been just brutalized with all of this," said Ellen Lee, executive director of St. Mary's Foundation, a health education organization, and head of Pierre's new Suicide Prevention Committee of parents, students, teachers, clergy members, health professionals and law-enforcement officers. "We have to do something."
Strings of suicides have struck other areas, including Westchester County in New York, Bergenfield, N.J., Plano, Tex., and last year, South Boston. In some places, including on some Indian reservations, the suicides seem to have root causes or common threads, like socio-economic despair or heavy alcohol use. But in many places, like Pierre, the causes have less clarity.
"Why do you have a suicide in one community and nothing else happens, and why do you have another community where one suicide follows another?" said Dr. Madelyn S. Gould, an epidemiologist and associate professor of public health at Columbia University, who is studying 49 suicide clusters around the country from 1988 to 1995. "We haven't found any striking pattern. We've seen it in affluent areas and poor areas, in rural communities and urban communities."
Pierre's suicide rate is "clearly exorbitant," said Dr. Gould, who was recently contacted by the South Dakota Health Department. "In such a small population that's a very significant increase."
More critically, Pierre had little in the way of professional services to handle such a situation.
 
Emotional Strain In an Isolated City
Although government jobs and politics draw people to its regal black Capitol dome, Pierre remains remarkably isolated, ringed by a vast, grassy moonscape and bracketed by the Bad River and whistles of water with names like No Heart Creek, Whisky Gulch and Tall Prairie Chicken Creek. The Interstate is 35 miles of two-lane hardtop away, the closest big city (Rapid City, population about 55,000) is three hours away and only small planes fly here.
There is no psychiatrist, only periodic visits from those in Rapid City or Sioux Falls, 225 miles east, which also have the nearest centers for treating youths under emotional stress. And until recently, when suicidal people called 911 for help, they were not taken to a hospital, but sent to a jail cell, until they could be evaluated by a mental health expert.
"It's a really terrible deal to take someone who's depressed and put them in jail," said Sheriff Mike Leidholt, who has pressed for a hospital "safe room" where suicidal people can be treated. The city is working to create such a room. At least one depressed teen-ager who was put in jail subsequently hung himself, and the prospect of jail makes teen-agers reluctant to seek help for themselves or troubled friends.
For families, navigating each suicide's aftermath has been especially difficult. When Michelle Cox, 18, stayed home from church one Sunday and killed herself with her father's shotgun, her parents, Kenneth and Katherine, both 58, appreciated the sympathy of friends but still felt emotionally stranded.
"A lot of people in town knew Michelle had problems," said Mrs. Cox, a nurse, "but a lot of people, you know, don't like to ask, and you don't stand on the corner on your soap box all day either." She and her husband, an engineer for the state transportation department, found no support group in Pierre, and waited 18 months for a spot in a suicide survivors' group in Rapid City.
"You get to a point where you want to stay in bed and cover up your head and not want to deal with anything and not have any feelings," Mrs. Cox said, her eyes wet, as she sat in her living room. "It's a terrible way for a child to leave you."
After John Bartel locked the door of his basement bedroom, cranked up the music and shot himself in the chest, "for about six months I prayed that I would die," said his mother, Velda, 42, who works for a guardianship agency. She and her husband, John, sent their two daughters, Kelsey, 15, and Katie, 12, to a therapist, but did not seek treatment themselves until last fall, when Kelsey overdosed on Tylenol P.M. trying to end her own life.
Kenny White's sister, Lori, a year younger but in the same grade, was so upset over her brother's suicide that her grades plummeted and her behavior suffered. Kenny's friend, Ted Voigt, makes pilgrimages to Kenny's grave, even taking his date there before the high school's King of Hearts Dance.
"I sit and talk to him, get things off my chest," said Ted, a gangly 16-year-old.
 
Risk Factors Unclear in Pierre
"You get to this point, you want to try to figure out what you can blame," said the Rev. Charlie Wharton, the police chaplain. "Believe me, I've looked."
No one seems to know why this is happening in Pierre, where many "risk factors" that experts tie to suicide are not apparent. Middle class, with no great pockets of wealth or poverty, it has good graduation rates from solid schools and large numbers of educated, working parents. It is quiet, but residents say there are things to do, like fishing, water skiing and going to movies. Teen-age drug and alcohol use seems no greater, and high school cliques no crueler, than in similar cities.
The teen-agers who killed themselves came from diverse family, economic and academic circumstances and the suicides, each a few months apart, appeared to be unrelated. Michelle Cox had been in therapy, but most others had not. Two boys, a handsome 16-year-old football star and a 13-year-old with artistic talent, had alcohol habits, teachers and friends said. John Bartel had a learning disability that led to feelings of failure, his parents said.
Dr. Gould said research elsewhere had shown later suicides often had only peripheral relationships to earlier ones and seemed to involve less severe psychological problems.
Strikingly, John Bartel, Michelle Cox and Kenny White each told family members or friends after the early suicides that they could never kill themselves because it would hurt those left behind.
There are strands of stress in the city's fabric. With nearly half the work force employed by the state, some families have been unsettled by government layoffs. Since state employees often transfer here from other areas, many residents have shallow roots in Pierre and few relatives close by. And in the middle of a half-plains, half-mountain state, Pierre seems unsure if it is more "Mayberry" or "Old West," Mr. Wharton said.
"It's a very transient town," Mrs. Bartel said. "It's a political town. It's got all the makings for things that can be disruptive."
Guns, the most common suicide weapon, are rife in its hunting culture, where children, allowed to drive at 14, often handle firearms earlier. Police scanners are as popular as television sets.
"Stuff doesn't happen here that people don't know about," Mr. Wharton said.
Suicide, jarringly, is in the vernacular here now. Students in school readily told a visitor about their own suicidal feelings and pointed out siblings of students who killed themselves. A pet-sitter in town spoke of her helplessness and guilt when a client's son committed suicide two weeks after the sitter noticed he seemed unhappy.
Still, for a long time, Pierre has been torn over how to handle the suicides. Newspaper obituaries of the suicides used the euphemism "died at home."
At Riggs High School, some parents believed open discussion would romanticize suicide or plant the option in students' heads. Others "wanted us to do all these assemblies," said Gary Schneider, a guidance counselor.
Then, after assemblies about suicide, said the principal, LeRoy Fugitt, "we get bombarded with people saying enough is enough."
 
Coming Together In School and City
By January, Allyson Friez, 18, became so concerned that she successfully ran for student vice president promising not "let's have parties, let's have dances," but "let's get help."
Others in Pierre felt the same. The Suicide Prevention Committee began meeting at Pierre's Chamber of Commerce. It has already hooked Pierre to a suicide telephone line at a Sioux Falls hospital, pasting its number on posters and a billboard and distributing "yellow ribbon cards" containing a message the bearer can use to ask for help.
Suicide intervention classes are available for all residents, adults are volunteering to be mentors to teen-agers, student drama groups are taping public service announcements for radio and television, and Ms. Friez, who recently became Miss Teen South Dakota, brought a speaker to the city to talk about self-esteem.
The school is monitoring students closely for "even a casual reference about not being able to go on," said the superintendent, Ken Rasmussen.
All this is heartening, if painful, parents say.
"It's just awesome how the community just pulled together," said Terri White, Kenny's mother, whose family inadvertently galvanized the town when, to dispel any "gasping behind your back" about "what's wrong in that home," they began talking about Kenny's death and wearing sweatshirts with his photograph.
"You never think it will happen to you," said Rick White, who moved from the apartment where his son died, but is in an identical one a few doors down, blaming himself for not taking the pistol he uses as a private investigator with him that one awful day. "So many whys and ifs."

HEADLINE: DESPITE AN EASING OF RULES, MILLIONS EVADE 'NANNY TAX'

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Four years ago, after President Clinton withdrew Zoe Baird's nomination to become Attorney General because she had not paid taxes on her children's nanny, Congress simplified the requirements for reporting wages paid to nannies, maids and other servants and for paying the employer's share of Social Security, Medicare and Federal unemployment taxes.
The new law also added a line to the 1040 individual income-tax form -- line 52 -- asking for the amount of Social Security and Medicare taxes owed on wages paid to household help. Because the form is signed under penalty of perjury, people who employ household help must choose between declaring the taxes due and lying to the Government. 
 The response was immediate, if not exactly what Congress had in mind: The number of people paying the tax on household help fell 40 percent, from nearly 500,000 in 1994 to just below 300,000 in 1995, the year the new law took effect, and 314,000 in 1996, and the Internal Revenue Service expects little change for 1997.
Based on I.R.S. estimates that as many as four million people owe nanny taxes each year, that means that fewer than 1 in 13 are obeying the law, compared with 1 in 8 under the old, more cumbersome reporting system. And some people have even figured out how to combine a legal tax break for child care with tax evasion, in essence double-dipping the system.
Of course, the main reason for the cheating is probably that it is so easy to get away with: Of the millions who have flouted the new law, only two have been charged with wrongdoing.
"My accountant told me I have to stop this and issue paycheck stubs and report what I pay to the I.R.S.," said Elaine, a divorced 42-year-old mother of two who covers Hollywood for a magazine and asked that her last name not be used. "But since no President is ever going to nominate me for the Cabinet, what do I care about paying this stupid nanny tax? And if I get caught, I'll just pay the fine and go on doing what I am doing."
The spread of noncompliance among such people raises troubling questions for some about whether the foundation of the tax-collection system in the United States -- the assumption of honesty by filers -- is crumbling.
"A culture is being created that this is fair game to do," said Jay A. Soled, a Rutgers University tax expert who has studied tax cheating by people who consider themselves honest. Political attacks on the current tax system as unfair only encourage people to cheat on the ground that "this is our way of evening the playing field," he said, adding, "This is a dangerous game."
Dangerous or not, Elaine is probably right not to fear the wrath of the tax collector. There is no national nanny-tax enforcement effort because of a lack of staff, said Tom Burger, the I.R.S. official in charge of employment taxes. Indeed, the service has never pressed a civil case in court and has filed criminal charges only twice, both times as part of a more serious criminal prosecution.
The law requires anyone who pays a nanny or other servant more than $1,100 this year to report those wages to the I.R.S. Assuming that only one in 13 is doing so -- and that the tax evaders spend as much on household help as the upright citizens do -- the Federal Government is losing $1.2 billion a year in Social Security and Medicare taxes.
To be sure, some people question whether the problem is as serious as the I.R.S. contends. Michael Graetz, a Yale Law School professor and former Bush Administration tax official, said he thought the agency's estimate was inflated. And he says fewer people may be reporting because their accountants advised them that they were exempt from nanny taxes because their maid or gardener was arguably an independent contractor, not an employee.
For those who know they are cheating, the motive is often not only to save money but also to avoid paperwork and the inevitable exasperation that comes with dealing with the tax bureaucracy.
"The truth is that Government has not made it easier to comply," said Roger L. Conner, executive director of the American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, a Washington nonprofit group that urges people to become more involved in their local communities. "Congress made it easier on the Federal level, but you also have to pay state taxes and pay state unemployment taxes, and if you live in one state and your nanny in another, then you are forced to master the arcana of Social Security and Federal unemployment taxes plus two state unemployment and tax systems."
James Neff, a journalism professor at Ohio State University who writes books on crime, said he discovered how frustrating complying with state requirements could be after he used three nannies last summer. Together they made slightly more than $1,500, the threshold for paying quarterly state unemployment taxes, and Mr. Neff discovered that he had to cope with complex state tax forms designed for corporations, not individuals.
Worse, even though Mr. Neff only used nannies in the summer, the state required him to file every quarter and report zero as the amount due for the other three seasons.
In interviews, parents in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Virginia and the District of Columbia reported similar difficulties dealing with state tax forms designed for corporations rather than individuals. One of their greatest frustrations was navigating through bureaucracies that they said were unresponsive or, worse, behaved as if their efforts to comply were a nuisance.
Mr. Neff and others who pay the taxes say they do so not only out of moral duty but also because they or their spouses hold jobs that require scrupulous compliance with all laws. Mr. Neff's wife is a Federal prosecutor; Mr. Conner's organization preaches self-reliance and individual responsibility for the welfare of communities.
Many Americans legally avoid the nanny tax by sending children to day-care centers or by hiring maid services or lawn-care companies rather than paying individuals directly. Also, maids who bring their own tools and cleaning solutions are arguably independent contractors, not employees, and thus might be exempt from the nanny tax.
Even if an employer wants to go by the book, household servants -- many of whom are immigrants or welfare recipients, or juggling more than one job -- often accept money only under the table.
In Central Park in New York, a nanny who was taking her charge to a playground and who identified herself only as Elena said her weekly pay included a $100 check and $260 in cash. The check allows her employers to take advantage of a tax break known as a flexible spending account in which $5,000 is deducted from their paychecks and then reimbursed when they produce canceled checks and a Social Security number for their nanny. The I.R.S. does not routinely match these payments with tax returns, however.
Thus, they benefit twice, saving as much as $1,980 through a legal deduction and almost $1,400 more by evading their share of the nanny's Social Security and Medicare taxes.
Michael Josephson, founder of Character Counts in Marina del Rey, Calif., which promotes ethical behavior by youngsters, said he did not even know the nanny tax existed until the Zoe Baird hearings. He said he then felt compelled to pay five years of back nanny taxes, penalties and interest.
Mr. Josephson said he thought the Government should either enforce the nanny tax or repeal it. "Congress needs to be thinking about this law that makes honest people feel like fools," he said.
There is no move in Congress to overhaul the system at the moment, and tax specialists say they see no easy solution. But, they say, some of the more promising ideas being kicked around include making all household servants independent contractors, responsible for their own taxes; raising the threshold to $5,000 or higher from $1,100, then making a greater effort at enforcement and imposing a surtax somewhere else, perhaps a fraction of a penny on each gallon of gasoline, to cover the lost Social Security and Medicare taxes.
Failure to pay the nanny tax can boomerang in the long run, for both parties involved. Social Security benefits are now based solely on reported wages, so household servants who never report their income can face poverty in old age unless they plan to return to countries where their needs will be met in other ways.
They might also make life difficult for their former employers by reporting the income years later in an effort to get more Social Security money.
Mr. Josephson recommended making nanny-tax compliance an issue in audits of all higher-income people because "almost everyone over a certain income, especially when both of the couple work, has a maid, a nanny or both."
Turning a blind eye to the problem, he added, is the worst possible way to deal with it. "When the Government encourages systematic lying, it undermines the whole notion of voluntary compliance" on which the tax system rests, he said. "It has an incredibly corrosive effect on people voluntarily complying with all tax laws."

Cone Keeps Insisting He Knows His Limits

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif.

 BODY:
THE meter was running on David Cone. Tick. Tick. Tick. He has been hearing the voices -- including his manager and pitching coach -- telling him he now has 100 pitches, 110 tops, in any given game.
Fast approaching that agreed-upon limit, Cone was struggling in the sixth inning yesterday. His 99th pitch became a grand slam by Scott Spiezio that put the Yankees, if not Cone himself, in a certifiable slump. 
 The Yankees lost this one, 7-3, to Oakland, which means they have lost all three games this season and that the molten ash from Mount St. Steinbrenner will soon be settling on the Yankees if they don't do something quick.
After suffering from an aneurysm in 1996 and shoulder surgery last fall, Cone has decided that trying to strike out every batter may have been dangerous to his health.
"The days of 150 pitches and nine innings are over," he said Friday night. "I'm going to have to squeeze as much as I can out of 100 pitches. If I want to pitch nine innings, I'm going to have to economize."
"We'll just tap him on the shoulder," Joe Torre, the manager, was saying.
Cone started off economically yesterday, giving up no hits for two innings, and single hits in the third and fourth innings. Then the pitch total started to rise as old Rickey Henderson slapped a two-run single in the fifth. The the A's loaded the bases in the sixth with Spiezio, a .247 hitter with a bit of power, coming up.
Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach, visited the mound and talked to Cone. Managers and coaches praise a star pitcher who tells the truth about what he has left. The only thing they value more is the starter who absolutely loathes coming out.
"We'll ask him and he'll say, 'I can get this guy out,' " Torre said. "He'll never say, 'I'm done.' "
Stottlemyre's presence was already a tipoff that Cone did not even have to argue. He was pitching to Spiezio. The 99th pitch hit a concrete abutment above the 362-foot sign in right-center.
"Sidearm slider to Rickey, cutter to Spiezio right over the plate, two awful pitches," Cone said afterward. "I felt good but I let the game get away."
Torre insisted that Cone had not looked tired as his pitch count ticked upwards through the 90's.
"Bad location but good stuff," the manager said. "Mel was checking him out, just giving our bullpen a chance to get going, but you want to give a David Cone a chance to lose his own game. You don't want somebody else to lose it for you."
The words don't sound positive, but the thinking behind it makes sense. Cone has earned the right to decide his own games, although it conflicted with the pitch-total conversations of previous days. Cone does not want to put pressure on himself by pitching until his arm falls off. That may be how he hurt the shoulder originally.
Cone wrecked his shoulder in 1995 by willing himself deep into the fifth playoff game in that classic series with Seattle before ultimately walking Doug Strange for the tying run. After the Yankees lost, he went home with a dead arm and an empty feeling of having let his team down. The physical problems that he and the Mariners' Randy Johnson had in 1996 can certainly be traced directly to their extra heroics in 1995.
Even in these highly technical days, with computer printouts on everything, managers and pitching coaches of Cone and Johnson were willing to ignore the pitch quotas set for just about everybody else.
"He's always been a gamer, a team player, who's not going to let his team down," said Torre, who wasn't there in 1995. "That's his mind set."
It was also the Yankees' mind set. Torre cited the 1996 World Series, after Cone had suffered an aneurysm during the season but somehow came back. The Yankees lost the first two games at home but were still encouraged when they went to Atlanta, "just knowing he's going to pitch," Torre said.
Last year Torre and Stottlemyre kept Cone under 120 pitches in every start but one. Cone finished third in the league in strikeouts with 222, but he also missed a month after feeling twinges in the shoulder in early August.
"If I had managed it better, I wouldn't have missed six weeks," he said the other night. "I probably pushed too hard. I've always been stubborn."
This year, he said, "I'm trying to put a little margin between pain and injury." He was out with tendinitis from Aug. 18 to Sept. 20, and when he came back, he was not right. In his first playoff game against Cleveland, he lasted only three and a third innings and two weeks later had arthroscopic surgery.
Torre said Cone reported "in better shape this spring than in the first two years I had him," because Cone worked out in the off season, rather than resting his arm.
The manager had hoped Cone could lead the Yanks out of this early miasma. Cone undoubtedly has more heroics in his future, but for the moment, the little voices are telling him, "Don't be a hero."

Tugboat Pilots Strike, Seeking Increase in Pay

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, April 4

 BODY:
Angry tugboat pilots pushing cargo-carrying barges pulled off to the side of the Mississippi River today and walked off the job in a dispute over pay.
The United States Coast Guard said an estimated 600 barges were stopped along the river, which is the nation's primary inland waterway. 
 "They're pulling off to the side and they're telling the barge companies to send a relief pilot if they want the barge moved," said Petty Officer Paul Painter of the Coast Guard.
The strike began after a loosely organized group called Pilots Agree tried unsuccessfully to meet with transport companies for salary talks. When the companies failed to send representatives, the pilots, meeting in Memphis, voted to walk off the job.
The group is thought to include about one-third of the nation's 3,000 tugboat pilots.
A Pilots Agree leader, Dicky Mathes, said he had begun organizing the group several months ago. He said the pay for tugboat pilots, who make an average of $50,000 annually, should be doubled.
The Coast Guard said in a statement that it would not interfere as river traffic was not obstructed.
The river barges, which are also used in the Intracoastal Waterway that spans most of the Gulf Coast, haul grain, petroleum products, chemicals and steel.
An extensive and long-lasting strike could have widespread effects on the nation's economy, officials at the Port of New Orleans said.
"Give it a day or two, this might fade," said Al Warriner, owner of the Pearl River Navigation Company. "If it does take hold it could be devastating."

HEADLINE: '97 Middle-Class Tax Relief Benefits Wealthy First

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Last August, with Speaker Newt Gingrich at his side, President Clinton signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, praising it as a milestone that focused most of its benefits on the middle class through a $500 child tax credit, education tax breaks and the new Roth individual retirement accounts.
But as 174 million Americans struggle to file their 1997 income tax returns before April 15, only 1 in 17 poor and middle-class taxpayers will enjoy any tax relief because the benefits aimed at the middle class did not begin to take effect until this year. 
 Only one tax break became effective last year, a reduction of capital gains rates on the sale of stocks, art and other assets that have increased in value and are owned primarily by the affluent.
The cut in the capital gains rate means that the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers will enjoy $1,189 of tax benefits in 1997 for each dollar of tax relief enjoyed by the bottom 80 percent of Americans -- the 97.6 million tax-paying households that earned less than $59,000 last year, according to a new analysis of Government data by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal nonprofit organization in Washington that believes that the tax system favors the affluent.
The Treasury Department did not dispute these figures. "Our numbers are similar," said Dan Israel, a Treasury Department spokesman.
And Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas and the chief tax writer in Congress, said that the group's "raw data is generally accurate."
However, Mr. Fleischer called the organization "a liberal group funded by unions" that had made "a tortured analysis" of tax benefits. He said that to realize the tax benefits, the rich would have to pay more in total tax dollars. And both Mr. Fleischer and Ginny Flynn, the spokeswoman for Senator William V. Roth, the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, emphasized that beginning this year the middle class would receive the bulk of the 1997 law's tax cuts.
The different views of the law's effects stem from how each side wants taxes examined. To the Republicans, a cut in the tax rate is an increase in taxes because they expect the affluent to cash in so many assets that their total tax bills will actually rise.
But Citizens for Tax Justice wants to focus on effective tax rates -- that is, on the share of income that goes to the Government. For 1997 such rates are virtually unchanged for everyone making less than $200,000, according to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. In the case of people making $50,000 to $75,000 a year, the effective rate is 20.3 percent, the same as a year earlier. But the top income group, those making $200,000 or more, will have their effective Federal income-tax rate cut from 30.2 percent to 28.3 percent.
The analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice found that the top 1 percent, who averaged $666,000 of income last year, saved an average of $7,315 in 1997 because the rates were cut. The bottom 80 percent, those making $59,000 or less, saved an average of $6.
This is not the way the Republicans want to focus the debate. They want to concentrate on how many tax dollars are paid. By that measure, those making $10,000 to $30,000 in 1997 are expected to pay a smidgen more than in 1996, about $23 million extra, because of minor changes in the tax code.
Those making more than $200,000 are expected to pay $5.6 billion more because the joint committee assumes that these people will cash in more of their assets to take advantage in the reduction of the top rate on capital gains to 20 percent from 28 percent.
So both sides may be correct: The wealthy get bigger tax benefits because capital gains rates were cut, and if they sell more assets to increase their incomes they will pay more in taxes.
For 1998 the distribution of tax benefits changes as the child credit, expanded retirement savings and cuts in the Earned Income Credit for the working poor start to take effect. The joint committee estimates total tax relief in the new law at $22 billion for this year, saying all of the benefit will go to those making less than $200,000 this year. The joint committee treats the lower capital gains tax rates as a tax increase and estimates that the rich will pay $1 billion in additional taxes this year because of the changes in the law.
Margot Thorning of the American Council for Capital Formation, an advocate of lower capital gains rates who maintains that they spur investment and economic growth, said the proper focus on the effect of the 1997 law was on the child credit and other tax relief aimed at the middle class.
But Representative Bob Matsui, Democrat of California who was one of only 43 members of Congress to oppose the bill even though he favors capital gains cuts aimed at job creation, said, "This bill was cleverly sold as being a middle-class tax cut, but as the real numbers come out it is clear that the benefits will go disproportionately to the wealthy."

HEADLINE: Disney Wished Upon Times Sq. And Rescued a Stalled Dream

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
On a breezy summer day in 1993, a top Disney executive picked his way along 42d Street with a video camera, the viewfinder filling with images of the crumbling theaters and shuttered storefronts slung between Eighth Avenue and Broadway. It was not a vision he wanted to take back to California, where his bosses were weighing a radical idea: lending Disney's wholesome name to a street that had become a byword for urban decay and failed renewal plans.
"It wasn't so much that it was scary," recalled the executive, David L. Malmuth, then vice president of Disney's development company. "It was dead. It was this odd street in the center of the city where there was almost no life." 
 Only five years later, a relative blink of the eye in the world of New York City development, that 42d Street is a dim memory. Times Square is a swirl of theaters, theme restaurants, tourist buses and construction cranes. It has become arguably the most sought-after 13 acres of commercial property in the world. And the sale this week of rights to the last two office tower sites along Seventh Avenue means that the final pieces of a grandiose four-tower plan -- long at the heart of the renewal and long presumed unworkable -- are in place.
How the pieces came together with such speed after languishing for more than 15 years -- spanning two economic downturns and the administrations of three governors and three mayors -- is a story that has as much to do with chance and perception as it does with careful urban planning and corporate muscle.
Almost in spite of the mountains of blueprints and contracts, the emerging Times Square is a mix of the pure confection of the earliest plans (one discarded plan included a 15-story indoor Ferris wheel) and the button-down vision of the 1980's, when developers wanted to make the area into an office park resembling Rockefeller Center.
And the hundreds of millions of corporate and entertainment dollars flowing into Times Square have come in large part, many developers say, because of a comparatively trifling amount pledged by a single company, Walt Disney. In late 1993, the company agreed to put up just $8 million of its own money -- less than the bonus earned last year by its chairman, Michael D. Eisner -- toward the renovation of the New Amsterdam Theater.
But that commitment, which city and state officials jumped through hoops to secure, was a catalyst more powerful than anyone expected. It opened the floodgates just as a confluence of other forces -- the reviving economy, the return of retailers to inner cities and the rise of entertainment and communications giants -- readily supplied the flood.
"What made it possible," said Richard A. Kahan, the former president of the state's Urban Development Corporation, "was Disney and the basic change none of us could have anticipated in American urban retailing, technology and the communications industry."
"It's what people dreamed of: very high energy, people-oriented entertainment," he added. "It reverts back to what it once was in New York City history."
Seven years earlier, at what was perhaps the project's lowest point, few people believed that it could happen. The dream of reclaiming Times Square had already been around for more than a decade and had produced little more than sweeping announcements, false starts and 47 lawsuits.
The list of potential developers whose plans had been shelved was a Who's Who of real estate: Trammell Crow, the swaggering Dallas builder; Cadillac Fairview and Olympia & York, the now-bankrupt Canadian giants; Tishman Speyer, an owner of Rockefeller Center, and Helmsley Properties.
By 1991 the project was at a dead stop. The state had used its power to condemn and acquire property along 42d Street, but the developers who had been selected by city and state officials as the best hope -- George Klein, an heir to the Barton's kosher chocolates fortune, and the Prudential Insurance Company of America -- said they did not want to build. There were layoffs at most major companies in the city. Office vacancy rates were soaring.
By the next year, the project had fallen so far off the screen that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo failed even to mention Times Square in his State of the State Message among the projects intended to jump-start the economy.
But while the recession was responsible for stalling the renewal, another problem preceded it and would continue to plague the project: deeply conflicting visions of the future shape of Times Square.
Under the master plan approved in the early 1980's that had framed thinking for a decade, Mr. Klein and Prudential were to build four granite office towers at the intersection of 42d Street, Broadway and Seventh Avenue that would give Times Square a toned-down image far removed from the neon and pop culture that had made the area famous.
In exchange for enormous tax breaks, Mr. Klein and Prudential were also to pay for a $127 million renovation of the subway station and the restoration of nine theaters.
"There was a common theme for these four regal towers," said Brian J. Strum, the former chief executive of the Prudential real estate group. "The buildings made Times Square respectable."
But in 1991, Prudential surveyed the weakness of the economy and demanded a 10-year hiatus from the commitment to build the towers, hinting that it would pull out of the project if it was forced to build in the middle of a recession.
Vincent Tese, then the State Commissioner of Economic Development, and Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Corporation, saw an opportunity in the impasse: redefine the project by emphasizing Times Square's historic connection to entertainment and retailing. It was a decision that could have mired the project further. It turned out to be almost prophetic.
"Times Square had been about entertainment since 1893, when the first theater was built on 42d Street," said Ms. Robertson, now the director of real estate for the Shubert theater organization. "The office market had died in the 1990's, but retail was doing great. We had the Broadway theaters. There were 16 million people a year -- the same number of people that went to Disney World -- going through Times Square. All the elements of what became known as urban entertainment were here."
They were certainly hard to find among the cracked sidewalks, vacant buildings and flashy neon peep shows that lined 42d Street. But after a series of tense meetings between developers and officials in 1991 and 1992, the state agreed to delay the towers for up to a decade, so long as the developers agreed to attract bright, dazzling stores to the vacant buildings on 42d Street and provide $20 million to restore the theaters. As a concession to the developer, the state dropped the demand for an important public benefit: the subway renovation.
Mr. Klein and Prudential fiercely but unsuccessfully opposed parts of what became known as the interim plan for Times Square, which required them to concentrate on retail and entertainment businesses and to install spectacular neon signs. Mr. Klein feared that the return of a honky-tonk atmosphere would repel the kind of corporate interests he wanted to attract.
"There were some heated moments," Mr. Strum said. "We were still convinced that this was an office market for financial corporations. If you had this glitzy retail, with all the signage, the tenant would say, 'What do I need this for?' "
But even as the city wallowed in the recession, there were signs that this kind of retailing, which had fled the cities for suburbs and malls in the 1960's and 70's, was returning, and with it, the idea of urban theme parks.
Andrew Tansley, executive director of the Tussauds Group, had been scouring Times Square for much of the early 1990's for a site for a New York outpost of Madame Tussaud's wax museum in London.
"The saddest thing was to see all the tourists going to Times Square because of its international reputation," Mr. Tansley recalled. "But there was nothing there except for sex shops."
But it was the emergence of Disney that would serve as what one city official described as the "bell cow" to lead other reluctant companies into Times Square.
Despite its friendly image, Disney was a relentless negotiator, unwilling to lend its imprimatur to such a risky venture without numerous assurances and steep public subsidies. City and state officials resisted weakly. "The policy was simple," Mr. Cuomo said. "The policy was: get Disney's name." Disney eventually agreed to put up the $8 million to renovate the New Amsterdam Theater, while city and state officials agreed to provide more than $30 million in low-interest loans.
"By Disney standards, it was a small deal," Mr. Malmuth conceded. But he added that the company was putting something greater than money on the line. "It was the brand risk," he said. "We were terrified that we would go forward and there would be some unspeakably horrible act on 42d Street."
Ultimately, they decided that the potential profit from a theater in a tourist-rich Times Square was worth the risk.
Even as the project seemed to be coming back together, there were many moments when it threatened to fall apart. Both Governor Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins, whose term expired at the end of 1993, were desperate to conclude a deal with Disney before a new administration at City Hall created uncertainty in the company's mind.
They were so desperate that on Dec. 30, 1991, Barry Sullivan, the city's Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, signed a memorandum of understanding with Disney atop the metal detector near the doors of City Hall as he left the building for the last time. The papers were rushed the next day to Mr. Malmuth in Burbank, Calif., for his signature.
City and state officials deftly seized on the momentum generated by Disney to generate even more. The 42d Street Development Corporation hired a public relations firm and began leaking to the media details of negotiations with Warner Brothers, MTV and dozens of other companies that came hunting for space.
Meanwhile, the Giuliani administration, and later Gov. George E. Pataki, wrestled over the final terms of a deal with Disney, which was not interested in being the only pioneer on 42d Street. In a move that served to intensify the cleanup and development, Disney demanded that the state evict the remaining peep shows from 42d Street and sign deals with Madame Tussaud's and the AMC Theaters chain before it made a final commitment.
Officials negotiated those agreements only hours before a news conference announcing the final deal with Disney.
With Disney signed, the city and the state rapidly struck an agreement with the developer Bruce Ratner to build an entertainment complex on the south side of 42d Street that would include Madame Tussaud's museum and a 25-screen theater. On the north side of 42d Street near Eighth Avenue, Tishman Speyer was selected to build a luxury hotel and entertainment complex.
Even with the momentum generated by the Disney deal, city officials have continued to dole out tax breaks. Last November, Reuters, the British information services company, got a $26 million tax break to build a headquarters on a parcel at 42d Street and Seventh Avenue that already had tens of millions of dollars of tax breaks. And the city is negotiating with Mr. Ratner for subsidies for a hotel that was never part of the redevelopment project, even as Planet Hollywood is building a 50-story hotel five blocks away without any tax breaks.
Rather than leading the revival of Times Square, the plan to anchor the square with four massive office towers resurfaced only after many of the other pieces were in place. Douglas Durst, the developer whose family once opposed the state's redevelopment of Times Square because it would compete with their nearby office towers, was the first to move in. Mr. Durst bought control of a site from Prudential for a 48-story tower that will be home to Conde Nast Publications.
It was an especially bitter moment for Prudential's partner, Mr. Klein, who privately blamed Mr. Durst for 45 of the 47 lawsuits that had delayed the project in the 1980's.
In short order, Prudential sold a second site to a joint venture of the Rudin real estate family and Reuters.
And finally, last week, Prudential reached a tentative agreement to sell control of the remaining two tower sites along Seventh Avenue to a joint venture that includes Mr. Klein.
When the deal was announced, Mr. Klein -- whose long struggle to redevelop Times Square had become a potent symbol of its difficulties -- said his vision for the area had been "vindicated." But the neon-infused retailers and the brash entertainment executives who will soon roam the streets and office corridors of Times Square bear little resemblance to what he originally planned.
Eighteen years ago, Edward I. Koch, the Mayor who originally selected Mr. Klein to clean up Times Square, warned: "New York cannot and should not become Disneyland -- that's for Florida. We've got to make sure we have seltzer instead of orange juice."
In the end, Times Square got both.

HEADLINE: An Uneasy Alliance

BYLINE: By Lucinda Franks; Lucinda Franks, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, writes frequently about children. Her last article for The Times Magazine, "Little Big People," about parents and children, appeared in October 1993.

 BODY:
There were so many layers of satin to the white christening dress that Rose could hardly find the baby inside. If only this little burden would always stay so light, she thought as she found herself standing at the baptismal bowl, the only white woman in an evangelical church in Brooklyn, about to become the godmother of her nanny's illegitimate child.
It was a bit more than she had bargained for six years ago when she hired Jacqueline to care for her children, organize their schedules, buy and cook the meals, keep her house clean and generally make the life of her family possible. Jacqueline -- who is identified by her middle name to protect her privacy, as are all the other characters in this story -- had broken the news of her pregnancy seven months before. She had dragged the vacuum cleaner halfway up the stairs, sat down and begun to cry. Rose, a psychotherapist, had never seen her like that. Normally stalwart, Jacqueline had brought structure, discipline and neatness to the household. As she consoled her nanny, Rose saw her own tightly woven existence unraveling. She could not have been more undone had her husband announced he was leaving. Without Jacqueline, she could not manage. 
 As water was dripped onto the baby's head, the congregation murmured, Oh yes, Lord, and Rose's daughter, Tecla, age 6 at the time, gazed wide-eyed at a woman swaying and bowing behind her. Rose worried that Tecla would ask loudly what was wrong with the woman, a worry that reflected her deeper fear of what the future might hold for a white woman with a black godchild. Yet as she beheld the chocolate-colored face, and the faces of her own family -- Tecla, her husband, Ira, and son, Louis -- sitting in the pew, she also felt the exhilaration of having ascended a mountain.
Across the economic spectrum, child care in America is generally inadequate. Even if mothers have finally started to win acceptance in the workplace, their children often still pay a heavy price. The poorest mothers rely on friends or relatives, sometimes barely out of childhood themselves. In urban areas, some middle-class women hire immigrant labor, often illegal and inexperienced. These nannies work 10 to 16 hours a day, 5 or 6 days a week, living with their employers in cramped apartments as closely as roommates.
Green cards, which enable aliens to work legally, can take years to obtain. Until they get theirs, immigrant women remain trapped in legal limbo without health insurance, social benefits or job security. Parents, for their part, turn over the most precious part of their lives to a stranger whom they have known for little more than the hour it takes for a job interview. For Rose and Jacqueline, as for thousands of others, it is an intimate and unlikely cross-cultural alliance, often just the other side of the law, textured with deception and affection, mistrust and trust.
Jacqueline, 34, grew up in the flat farmlands of a Caribbean island. She set up house in a one-room apartment with her common-law husband, a fireman, and had two children. But when her daughter was 7 and her son was 2, she became restless. Her aunt, who had emigrated, told her that in America you could live in a real house and still send home enough goods and money to lift your kids out of poverty.
I kept saying, should I do it, or should I not, Jacqueline says. It was so hard to leave. My son was very attached; he slept with us, he breast-fed until he was 18 months. Finally, I just closed my eyes and said this is the only chance my kids will have, and I left them with their father.
She went to New Jersey and worked for two years for an elderly invalid. Meanwhile, in Manhattan, Rose was coping with the newborn, Tecla, Louis had attention-deficit disorder and the family had begun renovating their Upper East Side town house. Rose stopped working and looked for more stable help than the au pairs she had been using. I needed someone to be me when I wasn't there, Rose says. My walls were half down and I was a wreck. Jacqueline had a quiet confidence; she came in and she knew just what to do.
Jacqueline had never lived with a white family before, and it felt strange. They made big meals with so many different kinds of food, and the children, not the adults, were like the high point of everything.
About half the nannies she knew were unhappy, stuck in situations they likened to a 1990's form of slavery: white parents who delegate all responsibility for rearing their children to an overworked, often illegal immigrant. They treat their help like she's not human, Jacqueline says. They make her come at 7 A.M. to get the kids up and ready for school so they can sleep late, and then they work all day and go out at night. One woman out in the Hamptons, you always see her carrying two separate bags of groceries. She had to buy her own food, even though she cooked for the family. They even had a lock on the icebox."
Jacqueline quickly found that she was one of the lucky ones. Rose and Ira treated me with respect. We did things together. They had nice friends, not the type that are way up there and you're down here and they pass you by like you're furniture. She was able to send home $100 a month and still afford to telephone her kids regularly. She tacked up pictures of them in the smart new American clothes she had sent. She grew attached to Tecla and Louis, and particularly liked shooting baskets with Louis.
Rose opened up the world of America to Jacqueline. She sent her to driver's education, taught her to stand up for her rights against the bureaucracy in the torturous process of getting a green card and set up bank accounts for her, giving her two checks a week, one to put in savings. She paid her doctor's bills, went to her aunt's wedding, got her cousin a nanny's job two doors away and ended up going over to help whenever the cousin, who was inexperienced with children, called in tears. When the father of Jacqueline's two children came to visit, Rose let him stay at their house in the Hamptons. Jacqueline gave in kind to Rose. She was better at some aspects of mothering than I am, Rose says. I'm a pushover. She would make them sit down at mealtime and take a bath every night. Instead of letting them sit in front of the television, she played board games with them for hours. I would tear my hair out after five minutes of those games. I watched the kids become more and more attached.
Jacqueline tried to nudge the kids toward Rose when she wanted them, for she knew how it felt to be afraid you were losing your kids. But Rose faced her own jealous feelings head on. When the kids would start to run to Jacqueline instead of me, I would just run and put myself between them. Rose's children are adopted, so their devotion to Jacqueline had particular resonance. You fret sometimes -- do they really have any special attachment to you? One day, when we were preparing to leave for my dad's birthday, Tecla whined, 'How come Jacqueline isn't coming?' and I said: 'Because you and Louis and Dad and me, we are a family and this is a family gathering. Jacqueline lives with us but she is not family.
Jacqueline's own children remained out of her reach. She was unable to travel home -- her green card application was still pending, so she could not have gotten back into the country. Nor could her children visit, because the American authorities in Caribbean countries routinely reject such visa applications.
 After a year or so, jacqueline's children stopped asking when she was coming home. Her son learned to talk, her daughter learned to read and they seemed to grow out of one set of clothes before Jacqueline could send them another. When she picked up the phone to call them, her heart would race. You know who this is? she would ask, and then heave a sigh of relief when her boy or girl said, Of course, it's you, Mommy. Small things, especially ironing Tecla's and Louis's clothes, could set her off. A pair of jeans, a little velour dress, sometimes I just held them up and thought about my kids. I kept saying, one day they'll be with me, we'll be back together."
Rose was as skillful as Jacqueline in denying the troubling aspects of her separation from her children. My fantasy about Jacqueline is that she is very much like me. She did what she was supposed to do. She had her kids and then she dared to go after something different. I just did it in reverse order. If I was stuck in some backwater and there was a world out there I wanted to be part of, I think I would leave my kids with my sister. It's not as though you lose them forever.
Rose, 51, who grew up in an extended Italian family, and Ira, 55, who is proud of his working-class roots, came to depend on Jacqueline's solid values to counteract the consumerism that saturated their children's world. "She had this folk wisdom," Rose says. "Like one time Louis came home complaining that his new shoes were not Gucci's like his friends'. She told him, 'Listen here, Louis, they are nice shoes, and it doesn't matter whether they are Gucci or Pucci or any other label."'
Ira says: "We gave Jacqueline complete authority. We told our kids, when we are not here, you listen to Jacqueline. She is the mommy."
Jacqueline plays her daughter's life like a movie in her head, picturing her traveling to and from one of the island's best high schools, which is far from her home. Jacqueline had paid for a tutor to prepare her for the school's rigorous entrance exams, and had sent her a couple hundred dollars for books and the $5 daily taxi fare. Still, she worries that none of this will make up for what her daughter, now 16, is missing. "I want her to have that mother-daughter thing. I keep saying it will happen one day, but then one day, they are almost grown up and you still haven't got them here."
Jacqueline panicked when she realized she was pregnant with her third child. "What was I going to do? Send another child away? But how could I raise it in this country? And then I remembered it wasn't my decision alone."
Jacqueline, Rose and Ira had a meeting after the children were asleep. Ira cleared his throat. Jacqueline was the caretaker of his family, and that in itself meant he must ultimately take care of her. She was his third adopted child. Now must he acquire a fourth? This could not have come at a worse time. He was changing jobs, Louis was changing schools -- the family was in flux.
Ira, a financial consultant, was a conservative who often held forth on the evils of big government and the welfare state, which he believes encourage poor single women to have children. He tried to fall back on these abstractions. Jacqueline, do you expect us to be responsible for your mistake?" he asked. "What is the father going to do?" Jacqueline shook her head: nothing. Such a question was seldom asked in her culture.
"What kind of a message is that going to send to Tecla and Louis? Being pregnant and not married. Bringing up a child without a father."
"I can take care of it," she replied.
"You can't. And I'm not going to. If I did, it would violate all my beliefs about the obligations of people to face the consequences of their own actions." Rose looked daggers at him; he did not notice that Jacqueline was quietly crying.
Such is the nature of the relationship that while the employer regularly unfurls his feelings, the nanny, by dint of culture and necessity, sits mute. "I could have said something, but I chose not to," Jacqueline says. Instead, she resolved, then and there, to have the baby and keep it, whatever the consequences. "I was very, very hurt. I'd been working there six years and felt so comfortable with them and I understood what Ira was saying about not being married and all, but nobody was thinking about me. Don't I get to have a little taste of life, even if it isn't supposed to be like this?"
Jacquelne proceeded to take chunks of time off for prenatal appointments, turning over to Rose the job of toting her children around to sports and ballet lessons. Rose went around looking stunned, saying to her friends: I can't believe it. I just can't believe this is happening. What am I going to do?
Rose worried about her children's reaction to the advancing pregnancy and the issues it would raise about their unmarried birth mothers not having kept them. But Louis, then 9, appeared to care not at all about Jacqueline's condition and Tecla acted delighted, touching and even kissing her stomach. Ira felt easier about appearing to condone unmarried motherhood by implying that the father of her other children was also the father of this one. To his surprise, friends and neighbors said not a word about her swelling size.
Rose and Tecla got into the spirit, buying baby clothes, collecting hand-me-down equipment from cousins, calling Jacqueline's nanny friends and organizing a baby shower. Jacqueline worked until three weeks before she was due. Rose and Ira gave her paid maternity leave for the summer, and on July 18, 1996, she gave birth to a healthy eight-and-a-half-pound girl. She named her Shemel. "I was so happy," Jacqueline says. She filled that big empty spot inside. It was like having my other children here. In September, she returned to work, paying her landlady to look after the baby. At night and on weekends, she returned home to Shemel. It is an uneasy alliance at times. Shemel and Rose compete for Jacqueline's attention. "With Tecla and Louis in school all day," Rose says, "I really need a sitter in the early morning and evenings."
Says Jacqueline firmly: "That's when my baby needs to know I'm there -- that I make her breakfast and come back home at night to put her to bed." That winter, the baby came with Jacqueline for a week in the Hamptons, and Tecla and Louis diapered and played with her constantly. But when Rose packed up to spend the summer in the Hamptons, Jacqueline reluctantly sent Shemel to stay with relatives in the Caribbean. "I needed to work to make money, and I knew I couldn't bring her along. She was too little. When I put her on the plane with my sister, we both wept." At the time, Jacqueline hadn't any idea how she was going to get Shemel home. It wasn't until the end of August that a tourist was found who agreed to shepherd her home.
Shemel has given Jacqueline a little more of the aura of equality. More than ever, Rose feels self-conscious about the tremendous financial gap. She and all the other nannies have to pass all these pricey children's clothes shops near the schools. I have taken to cutting the price tags off things I bring home. You feel guilty and you try to hide the difference, but of course, you cannot.
Sometimes the two of them have a silent battle of wills. Rose gets sharp-tongued and Jacqueline narrows her eyes and sulks. The two are capable of spoiling each other's day. "In an office, grumpiness is dispersed among the sheer numbers," Rose says. "You give a report to a secretary to do and boom, it gets done. I can give Jacqueline all the prioritized lists in the world and she will do things in exactly the order she wants. For instance, she loves to do laundry, but only all at once. She will iron every single undershirt, and heaven help the streaks and fingerprints on the mirrors. On the green marble kitchen table is a plant whose parched leaves slowly lift as Rose waters it. She gives a little smile. "This particular plant is our Gettysburg. It's a contest to see who will be the one to let it die."
Jacqueline says: "Well, you have to work how you work best. I have my own rhythm -- and my pride. Also, you know white people have attitude, too, and, boy, do they let it hang out." Late one recent Friday, Jacqueline was preparing to leave for the weekend while Rose was taking an important phone call. Louis burst in, declaring he was hungry. Without bothering Rose, Jacqueline ducked out to the deli and came back with some cheese, which is all Louis will eat these days.
"Mmm, what a great-looking sandwich," Ira says, coming into the kitchen as Jacqueline butters fresh pita bread and piles on the cheese. "You know, Jacqueline claims she can't cook." Rose laughs. "She can cook, but she won't," she says, looking at Jacqueline. "I even tried therapy on you to get to the root of this cooking phobia, right?"
Jacqueline puts the cheese back in the fridge. "I have to be in the mood," she says coyly, then rolls down the extra-long sleeves of the special shirts Rose buys her and puts on her coat. Rose looks longingly at the highly piled sandwich. "Gosh, that does look good!" Jacqueline asks her if she wants one and turns to take out the cheese, but Rose waves her on.
I drive Jacqueline to her apartment in Brooklyn, and when I park in front of her small brick row house, she disconnects the car phone and hides it under the seat. "We will keep an eye on the car from the living room," she says.
The stairway is battered, but inside, the apartment is cozy and the few pieces of furniture--two white sofas, blond dining-room set, single decorative fern, antique mirror--are immaculate. There are three tiny bedrooms, one each for her cousin, her sister and herself. Out toddles Shemel, then 18 months old, in a lovely pink sweater set, with her fine hair arranged in seven tiny braids around her head. She brings out her toys, a black doll, a white clown and a toy telephone to show me, a stranger, while ignoring her mother. "I phone her during the day so we can hear each other's voices," Jacqueline says. "But she still punishes me for leaving her all day."
Shemel is a beautiful and engaging child with delicate, impish features. She holds the receiver to her ear and cries, "Dadadada, yayaya, uh-huh, uh-huh," and then hangs up, grins at me and turns to throws her arms around her mother. The toddler leads me to her bedroom, where she gives me a pair of smart patent leather hiking boots to put on her so she can do a little dance. Her snowsuit and four outfits hang on a wall bar. Beneath it is her crib, and flush with that is her mother's double bed. Squeezed nearby is a long bureau, half devoted to Jacqueline's toiletries and half to Shemel's Pampers and baby paraphernalia. In between are two pictures in identical frames: one of Jacqueline's son and older daughter, who have her heart-shaped face, and the other of Jacqueline surrounded by Louis and Tecla.
Although it is usually past 8:30 when Jacqueline gets home at night, the first thing she does is pack Shemel's bag with clothes and toys and Pampers for the next day at the landlady's apartment downstairs. Then she will eat a little something, drink a cup of tea and lie with her baby until she sleeps. She has cut back her monthly checks home to $50. "I'm saving up so that whatever it takes, I'll get my other two over here so we can, for a while, be a family. It's been too hard to explain to them why I left, but I have to now or it will be too late for them to forgive me."
Before I go, Shemel puckers her little lips to kiss me and points to a picture taped to the wall -- a glittery scribble of yellow that Tecla helped her draw during a recent weekend when Tecla stayed with them. Rose worried the whole time, even though I knew Jacqueline would guard her with her life. Tecla has begged to go back, but Rose wants to keep her from getting any more attached to the baby. "I need to wean Tecla away from Jacqueline because if she leaves. . .I mean, she does have her own family now. How is it going to affect my kids?"
Rose wants to ask Jacqueline what she sees in her future. "Does she see herself going back to the Caribbean? Or staying with us for the rest of her life? I'd like to ask her where she feels her real home is, but the truth is, either way, I'm afraid of what the answer will be."

RACE PRIDE AND THE AMERICAN IDENTITY
 By Joseph Tilden Rhea.
 163 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
 Harvard University Press. $25. 
 SINCE the late 1960's, blacks, Indians, Latinos and Asian-Americans have increasingly reclaimed their heritage from public notoriety or neglect. In documenting their campaigns to influence repositories of the past, ranging from museums to battlefields, Joseph Tilden Rhea shows how assertions of "race pride" have transformed our cultural landscape as surely as civil rights campaigns have reshaped our politics.
Rhea argues that the jockeying over cultural symbols itself shapes collective memory. This has certainly been evident in the well-publicized controversies over the Vietnam Memorial, the Smithsonian's Enola Gay exhibition and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial. But Rhea's focus is on ethnic campaigns, which, he contends, have reinforced a larger movement for race pride. This is a movement that lacks organizations and common leaders, but cumulatively its struggles have infused historical presentations with an awakened sensitivity to minorities on the part of the white majority.
Rhea, an assistant professor of sociology at Arizona State University, cites Indian protests as an example of how changes in American culture owe as much to activists as to academicians. Using militant tactics that included defacing a mass grave of slain white soldiers, the American Indian Movement insisted that George Armstrong Custer was no martyr to Western progress but a brutal Indian killer. Prodding the Federal Government in 1991 to drop Custer's name from the site of his famous last stand and instead to highlight Indian language, artifacts and perspectives, the American Indian Movement, in Rhea's words, achieved "as complete a victory" as Sitting Bull's against Custer over a century ago. "The victors of the Battle of the Little Bighorn," he observes, "had at last won the power to write its history."
The outcomes of such ethnic battles have been uneven, Rhea says. African-Americans have done the most to enrich the national memory, building not only on civil rights triumphs but also on a tradition of cultural protest going back to Frederick Doug-lass, who warned whites against too much "generous forgetfulness" of the wrongs done to blacks. And Japanese-Americans have induced Congress to approve a memorial (and, later, financial compensation) to those interned for their Japanese ancestry during World War II. But Chicano activists have fared less well in pressing to have the Alamo in San Antonio reflect Mexican culture, in part because their myth of a glorious "bronze race" failed to inspire or even to interest other Hispanic Americans.
While most of "Race Pride and American Identity" is soundly argued, the book occasionally labors with unresolved tensions. Rhea notes the limited power of cultural memory to solve such problems as poverty, yet he repeatedly criticizes the Martin Luther King Jr. Museum for slighting King's late economic radicalism. And while stressing the crucial bond between political and cultural protest, he claims that civil rights laws "could do nothing to redress" the "persistent culture of racism." In fact these laws helped curb racist rhetoric as newly respectful Southern white politicians seeking black votes began celebrating diversity.
Rhea also overburdens his subject by asserting without argument that "memories which become embedded in physical space are somehow more powerful than those which find no material manifestation." This is a questionable claim, given the central role of the news media in stirring awareness of white racism and sympathy for minority aspirations. During the 1960's, news photographs and film of police dogs attacking peaceful civil rights marchers galvanized crucial white support for racial justice, while the 1977 television drama "Roots" riveted 140 million viewers with tales of black freedom struggles. Surely Rhea does not have to exaggerate the impact of museums and other physical memorials to justify his otherwise searching study.

HEADLINE: Venture Capital Is Alive, and Plentiful

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
Late last year, Timothy C. Draper, a West Coast venture capitalist, found himself listening to a pitch from two 20-something entrepreneurs who were insisting that their computer networking "company" -- basically a good idea in search of early-stage financing -- was worth a whopping $15 million.
"It was outrageous," Mr. Draper, the managing director of Draper Fischer Associates in Redwood City, Calif., recalled recently. "They were just starting out." 
 But not long afterward, the two young men, whom Mr. Draper declined to identify, did find other investors who agreed to buy a big share of the company based on a valuation of $20 million. The punch line: The entrepreneurs and investors then together sold the company to a large corporation for $30 million.
Longtime venture capitalists say such stories are not unique.
In the world of computers and information technology, investors are laying out record levels of venture capital -- the seed money from professional fund managers on which many a high-technology start-up is nurtured. The accounting and consulting firm Coopers & Lybrand estimates that venture investments totaled $12.2 billion in 1997 -- nearly half of it going to software, communications and electronics -- up from a total of $10.1 billion the previous year.
The surge, driven by investors seeking the annual returns of 30 percent or even higher that some venture funds have realized in recent years, is causing the cost of investing in young companies to skyrocket. In some cases, bidding wars are erupting over unproven technologies.
As a result, some established venture capitalists are growing leery of the inflated bets they see eager novices willing to place in a game with notoriously high rates of failure.
"I'm walking away from a significantly higher number of deals than ever before," said Lucio Lanza, a managing partner of U.S. Venture Partners, situated on the famed Sand Hill Road venture-capital power corridor in Palo Alto.
Venture firms say that the stimulus is a combination of so-called weekend venture capitalists -- wealthy individuals enamored of the idea of high-risk, ground-floor investing -- and more risk taking by many traditionally conservative institutional investors like pension funds, endowments, universities and major corporations.
Indeed, a growing number of corporations have developed discreet venture-capital arms intended to nurture companies that fit into the strategic direction of the corporation. Neil Weintraut, of 21st Century Internet Venture Partners, based in San Francisco, said that 21st Century gets at least a call a week from a corporation looking for advice on how to start a venture fund.
Also, industry executives say that corporations with existing venture capital arms are increasingly active. The Intel Corporation, for example, said it made 100 venture capital investments last year, twice as many as in 1996.
Generally speaking, the phenomenon is parallel to what is taking place in the stock market, particularly in the high-technology sector, where investors have been willing to take chances on nascent technologies in hopes of getting in on the ground floor of the next high-rise stocks like Yahoo or Netscape.
A handful of top-tier venture firms boast annual returns higher than 40 percent on some of their funds. Hummer Winblad of San Francisco, for example, returned $260 million in four years on a $35 million investment made in 1990. Historically, the annual returns have hovered around 20 percent for the industry, according to Venture One Corporation, a San Francisco-based venture capital research group.
But many experienced venture capitalists insist that these high returns are becoming harder to get, as more money chases more deals. Last year, there were 2,706 new companies financed by venture capitalists, compared with 2,163 in 1996, according to Coopers & Lybrand.
Ann Winblad, a founding partner of Hummer Winblad, said that venture capitalists were having to go after the best prospects more aggressively, hoping to get to them before a competitor does. And her own company, she said, is now doing what was once unthinkable: looking outside Silicon Valley, where many other venture capitalists have yet to wander. Hummer Winblad's last two deals were in Atlanta and Seattle.
One company that has benefited from the venture frenzy is Snickelways Interactive, a New York start-up company that provides corporations with the technical wherewithal for electronic commerce. In October, the company raised $600,000 from so-called angels -- individual investors. Now that it is seeking to raise $5 million from venture funds, it has no shortage of suitors, said Snickelways' chief executive, Paul Cimino.
"We have people contacting us every week -- not necessarily with term sheets, but with offers," Mr. Cimino said.
The phenomenon has wrung a defensive tone from some traditional venture capitalists. They insist it is not nearly so easy to succeed in the early-financing game as some of their returns might imply. They say their success lies not just in their knack for picking the right companies but with the ability to then steer the companies, hire the right managers and help fit the technology squarely into the proper market. They refer to themselves as professional investors to distinguish their ilk from the "newbies" of venture capital.
As for the traditional venture capitalists, there is at least one upside to all this new money: they seem to have as much of it as they want.
Bill Davidow, a general partner in the Sand Hill-based Mohr, Davidow Partners, said he recently raised $120 million for a new venture fund but could easily have raised $250 million. He had to turn down investors, he said, because the company did not think it could judiciously oversee that much investment.

HEADLINE: The Truth About Switzerland

BYLINE: By Hans Schaffner; Hans Schaffner was head of the Swiss Federal Office of War Economy from 1939 to 1946. He served as an elected member of the Swiss Federal Council from 1961 to 1970 and as President of Switzerland in 1965.

DATELINE: BERN, Switzerland

 BODY:
Once again debate has arisen concerning the measures that should be taken by Switzerland to settle the claims of Holocaust victims whose stolen property made its way into Swiss banks. The compensations provided by my country to date have been widely portrayed not as an honorable act of compassion but as evidence of a guilty national conscience.
This confusion comes after two years of accusations that Switzerland collaborated with Nazi Germany in World War II by stealing Jewish property and mistreating refugees. These charges were not based on any new information. All the relevant details have been available since 1946. But what is new is the surge of resentment against Switzerland, and the ignorance that underlies it. 
 Since I directed the Swiss war economy during the menacing years of World War II, when we had to prepare against Nazi aggression, I'm appalled to see Swiss wartime actions misrepresented so consistently. It is time to set the record straight.
To begin with, Swiss neutrality during the war was not an opportunistic subterfuge. It was a continuation of our policy, maintained over centuries, of achieving permanent armed neutrality. That neutrality is based on explicit provisions of international law recognized by the Allies, and it includes the obligation not to take sides with any belligerent nation.
It has never implied moral indifference. During World War II, the vast majority of Swiss sympathized with the Allies and our shared democratic traditions. That is why Hitler continually expressed contempt for us. Many who now criticize Switzerland's neutrality overlook the contributions it enabled us to make. Our International Red Cross was permitted into Germany and Japan, where it saved the lives of many Allied prisoners of war.
Neutrality also enabled Max Waibel, a Swiss intelligence official, to assist in arranging a conference at which Allen Dulles, then an official with the American Office of Strategic Services, met with the German commanders in Italy to negotiate an early German surrender, thereby reducing bloodshed and destruction in the final days of the war.
This same spirit animated the efforts of Walter Stucki, a Swiss diplomat who prevailed upon the Germans to hand over the city of Vichy to the Allies peacefully. These are just two examples of many acts of mercy and courage shown by the Swiss people.
Switzerland wasn't fully free, however, to act as it wished during the war, as President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill both understood. We were blockaded by the German Army on one side and by the Allies on the other.
To avoid economic strangulation we had to negotiate constantly with both sides. Swiss industries developed armaments for our own defense and supplied them to Germany at its demand and to the Allies at theirs.
Despite these constraints, we defied Germany by sending the Allies precision instruments from our watch industry. We also smuggled plans and know-how to the Allies so they could start up their own production of these items.
And while the Germans forced us to expand our credit lines so they could import more Swiss goods, we used German coal, oil, steel, cement and food to build our mountain fortifications and the guns that held off the threat of Nazi invasion.
Some have argued that we should have been tougher with the Germans after the fall of Stalingrad in 1943, which reduced Nazi power in Europe and slightly eased our long-term military concerns.
But that turn of events also made Hitler desperate and multiplied the risk of his making unpredictable moves against Switzerland.
The issue of Jewish property has also been misunderstood. First, Switzerland was not the preferred destination for those trying to get their holdings out of Europe. The United States was. Even Switzerland kept the bulk of its gold reserves in Fort Knox. As far as I know, aside from a few isolated instances, Swiss banks did not pocket unclaimed deposits. These accounts continue to exist and are still available to legitimate claimants and their heirs.
I'm confident that current investigations will show that only a tiny fraction of those accounts are associated directly with the Holocaust. In any case, those records are available for inspection. Other countries, including the United States, simply took the money after a period of time and destroyed the records.
There is also a good deal of confusion about Switzerland's handling of gold transactions with Nazi Germany. Some of the gold the Germans sold us had apparently been looted from Jews. But we had no way of investigating this.
Furthermore, international law required the Swiss National Bank to deal equally with every country, including Germany, that wanted to buy our currency with gold. We lacked a legal basis, not to mention the military might, to cut the Germans off.
In 1946, the Allies and Switzerland signed the Washington Agreement, which settled the postwar claims of various European banks. Initially, the United States still held six billion francs in frozen Swiss assets as well as gold payments owed to the Swiss National Bank. Because international law supported the Swiss position, the United States released the assets.
Switzerland, like the United States, made a contribution to the recovery of Europe at that time because she had suffered less than most. The attempt to reopen this settlement a half-century later is scandalous.
Of all the allegations that have been made against Switzerland, nothing disturbs me more than the charge that my country was insensitive to the plight of wartime refugees. In 1938, when it became clear that substantial numbers of people would soon be fleeing German control, an international conference was held in Evian, France.
The Swiss offered to take an unlimited number of refugees on a temporary basis. Despite our tiny population (about half that of New York City), we accepted more than 300,000 people. It is true that we turned away 30,000 Jews. But we sheltered 25,000 other Jews at a time when other countries, including the United States, shut their doors firmly against Jewish refugees. Some have pointed out that many refugees were housed in temporary camps, along with the thousands of Allied soldiers and pilots who sought internment in Switzerland rather than be sent to Nazi prisons or face death. Yet how else could a small mountainous country deal with a sudden population increase of nearly 10 percent -- in wartime?
Today a generation that knows nothing about World War II is being misled about my country. To compare a diplomat like Walter Stucki with an SS executioner, as some have done, is untrue and shows bad faith. The same holds for those who have referred to the defensive strategy of Gen. Henri Guisan as a "submissive gesture," when in fact the Germans hated Guisan because of his visceral distaste for Nazism.
It is time for these falsehoods and half-truths to stop. All my life I have done my best to foster good relations with America, Switzerland's great sister republic. But good relations must rest on truth.

HEADLINE: MEDIA: ENTERTAINMENT;
The threat of a strike by actors remains despite a tentative labor agreement.

BYLINE: By Bernard Weinraub 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD

 BODY:
SHERRY LANSING, chairwoman of the Paramount Motion Pictures Group, said simply, "You have to prepare for the worst, but hope for the best." Across town, Bill Mechanic, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, said: "You do what you can. You plan for contingencies."
The two executives are hardly talking about a new deal with James Cameron -- the studios financed "Titanic" -- or a blockbuster gone awry. What's on the minds of Ms. Lansing and Mr. Mechanic is the possibility of a strike by actors that would not only damage the entertainment industry but also Southern California's economy. About 262,000 people work in the television and movie business in the Los Angeles area. 
 Although the three-year contract between the producers and actors -- represented by the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Radio and Television Artists -- does not expire until June 30, negotiations grew intense last week. Both sides bargained all weekend and reached a tentative agreement early yesterday morning.
But the situation remains delicate and volatile. The agreement is subject to approval by a board representing both groups. And then the joint membership of 130,000 must vote on it, too. So must members of the management side, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
Richard Masur, head of the Screen Actors' Guild, said yesterday that he expected the membership to vote on the proposal in the next few weeks. "I feel very secure that when we have a chance to present what's in the package that there won't be any disappointments," he said.
The last actors' strike came in July 1980, stirring turmoil mostly with that year's fall television schedule until the actors returned to work three months later. But the most serious Hollywood strike in recent years took place in 1988, when the Writers Guild of America went on strike for 22 weeks. The walkout cost the industry and writers an estimated $500 million. (The writers, whose East and West Coast branches have engaged in a high-profile squabble in recent months, are now in negotiations on a new contract with producers and the networks. The deadline is May 2, but, for the moment, studios seem to think that an actors' strike may be a more immediate threat than a writers' walkout.)
At issue in the talks between the actors and management is the subject of foreign and cable television "residuals" -- the share of revenues that actors earn when their films are shown abroad or on cable. The unions insist that it is time for studios and companies to share the wealth they are reaping from such sales. They argue that the residual formulas -- set up in the 1980's, when the lucrative foreign marketplace was less developed and cable channels less numerous -- are outdated.
Producers, on the other hand, insist that expenses have exploded: the average cost of making and marketing a movie has reached $75.6 million. Producers say that keeping costs down, and companies profitable, can create more jobs for actors.
Under the tentative contract, both sides agreed to undertake a joint study to define the structure for a deal on the residual issues. The study is expected to be completed in two years.
A strike would hardly affect the fortunes of Leonardo DiCaprio or Jerry Seinfeld. But 8 of 10 members of the Screen Actors Guild earn less than $10,000 a year from acting, and most hold down other part-time jobs to pay the rent.
Mr. Masur of the Screen Actors Guild has said that a strike is just about the last thing his members want but that the union will call one if the members see no progress in their key demands.
Film studios are reacting nervously to the threat of a strike. What especially concerns studios is the possibility of a strike in the midst of making a film.
"We're taking precautions," Ms. Lansing said. "We are not shooting any pictures that don't finish before a strike." Ms. Lansing said that she was hopeful, in fact, that films currently in production would be completed three weeks before the June 30 deadline. "We want to have a three-week cushion," she said.
Like many other studios, Fox is to start filming several new projects in July -- not May or June. So if a strike takes place, the studios would simply delay new productions.
Mr. Mechanic, the Fox executive, said, "Everything should either be wrapped or ready to start. We won't get caught in the middle."
Mr. Mechanic said that the last thing the movie business needed was a strike. "A strike is obviously bad -- and the only positive that could come out of it will be to perhaps slow down production," he said. "Maybe all the studios will decide that less may be better and that the costs of movies are out of control. Maybe we'll get sane at the same time."
Not every studio is alarmed about a potential strike. Dreamworks, for example, is moving ahead with film production that could be interrupted by a strike. And producers said that if a top star became available, other studios would take the risk, too. "Believe me, if Tom Cruise said he wanted to start a movie before that deadline date, they'd start it," said Scott Rudin, one of Hollywood's most prolific producers. Mr. Rudin has three new movies about to start production -- a remake of "Shaft," the adaptation of the book "Angela's Ashes," and the film version of the television show "South Park." None of them are starting before June 30.

HEADLINE: Shareholders Push for Tighter Rules Abroad

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Once seen as the exclusive concern of a handful of shareholder groups in the United States, corporate governance issues are going global.
That reality was driven home last week, when an international panel submitted recommendations to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development intended to improve the accountability of foreign companies to their shareholders. 
 And it will be underscored today with the release of a new international survey of more than 350 institutional investors.
Commissioned by Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive search firm, and conducted by Wirthlin Worldwide, an opinion research organization in McLean, Va., the survey, "Furthering the Global Dialogue on Corporate Governance," polled fund managers and institutional shareholders in Australia, France, Britain and the United States.
Russell Reynolds commissioned two previous governance surveys, which were limited to the views of American fund managers and institutions. But changes in the global economy drove the firm to seek a broader frame of reference.
"This survey is mirroring the flow of capital and the internationalization of capital markets," said John T. W. Hawkins, managing director of the global board practice at Russell Reynolds.
Further, "the whole information revolution and the Internet have eased communication to the point that it has facilitated cross-border discussions on these issues," he said. "And the introduction of the euro is making European investors expect greater transparency and the unification of principles and codes of conduct on the Continent."
Indeed, because three-quarters of the investors surveyed have holdings in companies outside their organization's home country, it is perhaps not surprising that a significant percentage endorsed the development of a global set of corporate governance standards.
More than 25 percent of American institutions said realization of that goal was either extremely important or very important to them; the figure was more than 60 percent in France, 52 percent in Australia and 27 percent in Britain.
And there seems little doubt that interest in corporate governance issues is increasing.
Sixteen percent of the American organizations surveyed said that in the last year they had participated in four or more investor activities like voting for a shareholder resolution or writing a letter to the company's board relaying the institution's point of view. In 1996, only 6 percent of those who responded to the poll reflected that level of activity.
Last year, just 25 percent of the American institutions surveyed said that the quality of a company's board was an extremely or very important factor in making an investment decision. In this year's survey, the figure is 35 percent. The numbers are even higher in Australia (83 percent) and Britain (58 percent), but lower in France (16 percent).
A majority of investors in all countries said one of the most critical responsibilities of a board was to determine whether an underperforming chief executive should be forced to resign.
Half of the American institutions surveyed said boards should play a critical role in determining the compensation of senior management and the chief executive. And 55 percent of the United States institutions said the board, and not the chief executive, should play a critical role in developing management succession plans.
The survey results are considered accurate to within plus or minus five percentage points.

HEADLINE: 8 Countries Agree to Fight Environmental Crime

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LEEDS CASTLE, England, April 5

 BODY:
Ministers from Russia and the Group of Seven leading economies agreed today to step up their cooperation against environmental crime, a market estimated at $20 billion a year.
"We want to declare war on the smugglers who trade illegally in banned products such as endangered species, the ozone-depleting substances and hazardous wastes," Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott of Britain said.
The meeting of environmental ministers from Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia was held in advance of a gathering of national leaders in England in May.
Mr. Prescott said he wanted to see the equivalent of an Interpol for environmental crime.
He said the illegal trade in endangered species was estimated at $5 billion a year; the figure rises to $20 billion when illegal fishing, logging and trade in bootleg chlorofluorocarbons are included. Those gases, which deplete the ozone layer, are still produced in Russia, China and some other countries. Environmental crimes can be as profitable as drug crimes, Mr. Prescott said.
The meeting highlighted continuing differences between the European Union and the United States about how governments should carry out the Kyoto conference agreement to cut emissions of greenhouse gases.
The pact, which Mr. Prescott helped negotiate in December, agreed that industrialized nations should cut emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average 5.2 percent between 2008 and 2012, with a 7 percent cut for the United States and 8 percent for the European Union.

HEADLINE: Privatizing Social Security Gains Backers in Congress

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
Just a few years ago, Cynthia de Lorenzi, a stay-at-home mother in Dallas, knew little about investing and found the topic intimidating.
"It was like knocking on the doors of a world I'd never been invited into," said Ms. de Lorenzi, who was forced to confront the subject after a divorce left her in charge of her own finances for the first time. 
 These days she spouts investment jargon, debates the merits of technology stocks and rattles off names of mutual funds.
With the stock market having gone up and up since her first tentative investments three years ago -- the Dow Jones industrial average topped 9,000 briefly for the first time on Friday, up from 4,000 in 1995 -- Ms. de Lorenzi now feels confident turning her modest savings over to Wall Street. So much so, in fact, that she enthusiastically supports what would be one of the most fundamental changes to the Government's compact with its citizens in decades: the proposal to remake Social Security by giving individuals the right to invest some of the money they normally pay in taxes to finance the retirement system, granting them a shot at a pot of gold but also exposing them to new risks.
"Be afraid not to do it," she said, "because you'd be missing the opportunity of a lifetime to get control of your life."
Not everyone shares her outlook. Among those who believe that stock markets go down as well as up, and others to whom Wall Street might as well be on another planet, the notion of turning Social Security into an investment program is often seen as irresponsible or at least unnecessary.
"There are tens of millions of people who have no familiarity with financial affairs," said Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the research group. "Even among those who are sophisticated, we tend to be lulled into a false sense of power and competence by what has happened recently in the U.S. with this perfectly marvelous period of rising share prices."
But as Congress and the White House debate how to insure that Social Security will be able to weather the retirement of the baby boom generation in coming decades, members of both parties are taking seriously the idea that this has become a nation of money managers, knowledgeable and secure enough, like Ms. de Lorenzi, to take on at least partial responsibility for what has long been a Government guarantee against poverty in old age.
The issue is sure to be central to a public discussion about Social Security's future that President Clinton will lead on Tuesday at a bipartisan forum in Kansas City, Mo., the first in a series of events he will hold this year on how to prepare for the aging of the 76 million Americans born in the 18 years after the end of World War II.
When the baby boomers start retiring in droves in about a decade, they will drain Social Security's reserves rapidly, and by 2029, if no changes are made, the system will be able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits. Defenders of the current system say the problem can be taken care of through relatively modest steps like accelerating the planned increase in the retirement age to 67, raising payroll taxes slightly and trimming cost-of-living increases.
It remains unclear which way the debate will tilt, or whether the solution might be found on some middle ground like having the Government invest the Social Security system's money directly in the markets in search of higher returns rather than turning that job over to individuals.
That such a national discussion is taking place at all reflects the changes to the nation's psyche wrought by the stock market's unprecedented surge and the proliferation of investment vehicles like 401(k) programs, mutual funds and Individual Retirement Accounts.
Just to touch Social Security was long considered political suicide in Washington, an attack on what is arguably the most popular and successful of Federal social programs.
But privatization proposals that even a year or two ago were heard only at conservative think tanks are now being bandied casually about Congress with no apparent political backlash. With little fanfare, the Senate last week passed a nonbinding resolution calling for private investment accounts to be part of any Social Security reform package. Even Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat who is a staunch defender of Social Security, set out an approach last month that includes private accounts.
Most of the privatization proposals call for a portion of the payroll taxes levied on workers and employers to finance Social Security to be diverted into individually managed accounts that could be tapped only in retirement. The Government, under these proposals, would continue to pay a reduced but guaranteed benefit as a safety net for the elderly. Under the current system, known as pay as you go, each generation of workers pays for the benefits of people then in retirement.
"Stock ownership is now wide but not terribly deep, and clearly that fact along with the extraordinary upsurge in the market has changed the way people think about savings and retirement," said Robert B. Reich, who was Secretary of Labor in Mr. Clinton's first term.
"This debate was ostensibly triggered by fears about the solvency of the Social Security trust fund. The real source of this debate is the increase in stock market participation."
The percentage of Americans owning stocks doubled, to 21 percent, in the 25 years up to 1990, said a report done last year for the Nasdaq stock market by Peter D. Hart Research Associates. In the next 7 years, it doubled again, to 43 percent.
The same study reported that ownership of mutual funds jumped to 40 percent of adults in 1997 from 13 percent in 1990. The number of people in 401(k) programs jumped to 27 million last year from 7.5 million in 1984, the Labor Department said.
Yet, if there is clearly a constituency for a more investment-oriented approach to Social Security, the data also show a sharp divide between people who invest and those who do not.
The 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances conducted by the Federal Reserve, the most recent detailed nationwide look at household finances, found that among respondents who identified themselves as professional and managerial, 70.3 percent had some form of retirement account, 26.1 percent owned individual stocks and 21.3 percent owned mutual funds. Among respondents who identified themselves as machine operators and laborers, 47.3 percent had retirement accounts, 9.0 percent owned individual stocks and 6.9 percent owned mutual funds.
Moreover, for 16 percent of the nation's elderly, Social Security's old-age benefits are their only source of income; and for two-thirds of the elderly, Social Security is the major source of income.
Defenders of the current system and proponents of a major change have been arguing heatedly in the last several months about the relative rates of return available from the stock market over the long run versus the payback workers can expect from their contributions to Social Security.
From 1926 through 1996, the stock market generated an annual average return of 7.56 percent after factoring out inflation, far higher than almost anyone working today can expect to get back in retirement benefits from their Social Security contributions. But critics of the investment-oriented approach said the overall figures mask long periods in which returns have been weak or even negative.
None of the counterarguments shake the faith of Ms. de Lorenzi in the power of investing. She has started appearing on a radio program in Dallas to urge people, especially women, to save and invest more, and she has joined a grass-roots group, Economic Security 2000, that advocates individual investment accounts as one element of a plan to fix Social Security.
"When we first started talking about this, it was a taboo subject, as if you had showed up in your underwear," she said. "Now people are constantly talking about the stock market, and becoming very comfortable with the language. And as they become more comfortable, they're more accepting of the idea."

HEADLINE: A Bad Law Breeds New Trouble

 BODY:
For a decade now, through administrations Democratic and Republican, the New York State Legislature has persistently struggled to subvert the Constitution on behalf of the small but politically influential enclave of Kiryas Joel. That Hasidic village in Orange County has been waging a long battle to establish its own school district so its disabled students can get publicly financed remedial education without being exposed to the secular world. Whatever the good intentions of parents and politicians alike, this is a demand for government-subsidized segregated schools that the courts have rightly and repeatedly struck down.
The Legislature's contorted efforts to accommodate the Hasidic parents will eventually encourage other communities that would like to keep their schools homogeneous. There are some signs that this is happening already, and it is time for Gov. George Pataki to declare that he will sign no further laws on behalf of Kiryas Joel. 
 After passing three laws, losing two battles before the state's highest court and one in the Supreme Court, the state was rebuffed again last week when the State Supreme Court in Albany struck down the latest law that would permit Kiryas Joel to keep its own special public school district. The ruling, by Judge Joseph Teresi, indicated that the state's judicial system is losing patience with the Legislature's repeated attempts to find a constitutional way to accomplish an unconstitutional end.
Allowing very small communities to establish their own school districts is contrary to state policy because it is economically inefficient. The Legislature keeps trying to draw up a law that would set standards for secession narrow enough to include the 12,000-resident Kiryas Joel without opening the doors to a statewide balkanization of education. The most recent attempt would be applicable to only one other community, Stony Point in Rockland County. The reaction by Stony Point shows the danger of continuing any further down this road. Residents of that largely white district are circulating petitions to set up a school system separate from the more heavily minority neighborhoods around them.

HEADLINE: Farewell to Rust and Ripped Upholstery;
The Commuter's Frugal 'Station Car' Is Replaced by Luxury and Leasing

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: SCARSDALE, N.Y., April 5

 BODY:
A generation ago, every commuter railroad station had a parking lot full of rusty Nash Ramblers or dented Ford woodies, cars with a hundred thousand miles on the odometer, stuffing oozing from the upholstery and at least one door that could be opened only from the inside.
Known as station cars, these beat-up vehicles, with just enough life to get from the house to the railroad, were proud badges of frugality, even in well-to-do suburbs, for men raised during the Depression. But 30 years later, these cars are all but invisible in these parts, as rare as unlocked doors, clotheslines and aluminum siding. In their place are leased Jeep Cherokees and BMW's, shiny and fully loaded. 
 Jon Epstein, a real estate executive, says that nobody he knows buys cars anymore and thus there's nothing in the garage long enough to qualify as a station car. As he climbed into his new Grand Cherokee Laredo at the train station here the other night, he said he could imagine only one situation suitable for a jalopy. "For my sons, for their first car, I might go out and buy a clunker," he said.
Automotive experts cite three intersecting reasons for the decline of the station car: the acquisitive nature of baby boomers and their younger siblings who want the latest status symbol, the enormous increase of wealth in already prosperous suburbs like this one and the advent of leasing, which allows people to drive high-end models and move on before the cars lose the new-car smell.
Chris Cedergren, the managing director of Next Trend Company, which takes the pulse of the auto industry, said the primary explanation is the image consciousness of today's consumers, whose "desire to make a certain statement about themselves" is facilitated by new wealth and the economics of leasing. He puts himself squarely in this category. He loves fancy cars, keeps his money in the stock market and leases a new BMW every two years.
The surge in wealth this decade, fueled in the New York metropolitan region by the buoyant stock market, is paying for the luxurious vehicles left out in the rain at railroad stations in Westchester and Fairfield County, two of the richest areas in the nation. Similar cars are found at stations in Summit, N.J., and Great Neck on Long Island, pockets of comparable plenty.
George Pipas, the sales analysis manager for the Ford Motor Company, pointed to eight years of business expansion, the huge sums of money people are making on Wall Street and the lowest interest rates in years. "Tons of people have done extremely well for themselves," he said. 'It's gotten so bloody bad the word millionaire doesn't mean anything anymore."
At the same time, leasing automobiles, once the province of corporations with fleets of cars, has become a popular alternative. "Leasing has just gone into orbit," said David Cole, the director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan.
In 1984, just 2.5 percent of the new cars and light trucks acquired by individuals were leased. By 1990, the percentage was 7.3 and headed sharply upward -- to 13.5 percent in 1992, 23 percent in 1994 and 30.5 percent in 1997. According to projections by CNW Marketing/Research, by 2001 more than one in three personal cars on the road will be leased.
Because the cost of leasing depends on the residual value of the car when it is returned, high-end brands, like BMW's, and fashionable models, like sport utility vehicles, are especially well priced. And although the price of leasing a luxury car is higher than that for other cars, that price is a smaller percentage of the car's purchase price. This economic anomaly allows people to lease fancier cars than they could afford to buy, said Bob Casey, the curator of the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich., and to switch readily to the car of the moment. It also means less worry about leaving a car in a lot all day, subject to the harsh sun and the dings left by strangers.
Then there is image, what a car tells the rest of the world about its owner. "Nowadays anybody who has a beater has got to be a loser," said David Lewis, a professor of business history at the University of Michigan, using a synonym for jalopy. "When you see a car belching black smoke and rattling along, you feel sorry for the person driving it."
The few beaters found during a random survey of a half-dozen railroad parking lots in Westchester and Fairfield Counties seem to be owned by people who take a stubborn pride in not keeping up with the Joneses. In Westport, Conn., 75-year-old Charles Temko, a patent attorney, said his neighbors all drive Mercedes-Benzes, BMW's and sport utility vehicles while he gets along nicely in a 1985 Ford Crown Victoria. "At my age I don't need status," he said.
"The way America lives today, people drive expensive cars they have no business owning," Mr. Temko said. "There are loads of people up here making 70 or 80 thousand and trying desperately to live like they make 125."
In neighboring Fairfield, Mike Esposito, who builds the sets for the soap opera "The Guiding Light," said no car has soul unless it has chrome bumpers, like his 1973 Chevy Impala. "It runs nice and clean," he said. "Mechanically it's 100 percent. It's safe. So what if nobody looks at me and gives a thumbs up?"
Irwin Schildkraut, an engineer who commutes from Fairfield, also thinks it is the mark of good judgment to drive a station car, in his case a battered 1988 Subaru. "Who's going to steal it?" he asked. "And if they do, who cares?"
But Mr. Schildkraut's wife and children don't see it his way. His wife, who drives a 1996 Taurus, "has this thing about my car -- she doesn't want to be seen in it." And his children, 13 and 9, argue for family outings in Mom's wagon because it has a compact disk player and boom-box quality speakers.
The small number of station cars in communities like Scarsdale is one way to measure the new trend. Perhaps more telling is what passes for a beater these days. A leased Jeep Cherokee is the family car in his household, said Rick Knief, car keys in hand as he loped into the parking garage here the other night. But he wanted something modest for trips to the station or the golf course.
His choice? A 1990 Mercedes.

HEADLINE: EMPLOYERS HUSTLE TO FILL JOB ROLLS, WITHOUT PAY RISES

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Unable to recruit enough workers, Otto Engineering Inc. near Chicago lowered its standards. Assemblers of its electronic switches no longer need to score at a sixth-grade level on a math test. Fifth grade is now enough. The Walt Disney Company, trying to hire for its theme parks in Florida, is recruiting for the first time in Puerto Rico, where unemployment is three times that in the United States. And Rubbermaid Inc., chronically short staffed at a toy factory in Ohio, hired a temporary help agency to run a recruiting center at the plant.
Not since the early 1970's, when the unemployment rate was last below 5 percent, have America's employers scrambled as much as they have in recent months to find workers. A quarter-century ago, they relied chiefly on higher wages. Wages are beginning to rise now, even for people with only high school educations, but not by so much as in the past. Far more than in the 1970's, companies are using other recruiting tactics to dilute wage pressures. 
 In previous periods of economic growth, the wages of most workers rose early in the upturn. This time the opposite happened; the median weekly wage, adjusted for inflation, fell in each of the first five years of the recovery, rising modestly for the first time in 1997, according to Labor Department figures. All the while, the unemployment rate has been falling, getting as low as 4.6 percent last November. Since then, it has ticked back and forth between 4.6 percent and 4.7 percent, edging up last month to 4.7 percent.
"New and aggressive hiring tactics postponed wage growth, and they continue to suppress it," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Corporations say they have no choice -- they cannot raise prices as easily as in the past, and they must sustain profits. But Mr. Bernstein, echoing a view widely held among labor economists, said, "A lot of employers have grown accustomed to a culture in which they don't need to give real wage increases to hire and hold workers."
What no economist or policy maker can know is how long companies can fill hundreds of thousands of new jobs and also resist bigger wage increases, which could squeeze profits. Perhaps a slowing economy will bail them out, easing the demand for workers and raising the unemployment rate from its remarkably low level. That does not seem likely to happen soon, despite the occasional months, like March, when the work force shrinks instead of expanding.
Still, there are big pockets of potential workers that have yet to be reached. Despite the low unemployment rate nationally, joblessness is just beginning to decline significantly for those without high school diplomas and for black and Hispanic people. And there are regions where unemployment is still relatively high, prompting companies to go where the people are.
Many companies enlist their own workers as recruiters, awarding bonuses or prizes for each new employee they bring in. Some, like XL Connect near Philadelphia, which employs 1,500 people skilled in computer networks, pay as much as $1,000 to an employee who recruits someone who stays six months. "Even then we hired and trained 900 people last year to retain 500," Tim Wallace, XL's president, said. "But we can't pay more than our billing rate, and when others offer higher salaries, we have to let them go."
The General Electric Company finds itself moving more quickly than in the past to hire experienced candidates, often offering a job within two weeks of meeting a promising applicant. "These are valuable mid-career people seeking new jobs," said Robert Corcoran, a human resources manager, "and if we delay a decision, others have time to grab them, perhaps at a higher wage."
The Maytag Corporation, adopting a growing corporate practice, now lists job openings on the Internet -- appealing nationwide for applicants. It is also recruiting, for the first time, among minority organizations, including an association of black men and women who have master's degrees in business. "We would probably have done this anyway," said Kim Miller, Maytag's manager of employment, "but we are certainly doing it in a tight labor market."
Like numerous companies forced to choose between raising wages and lowering standards, Otto Engineering decided to accept less math proficiency but hold to a $6 hourly wage for assemblers. Maytag has also lowered standards. Community college graduates with two-year degrees now get jobs in sales and marketing that once went only to those with four-year degrees. And Maytag for the first time is beginning to train computer programmers instead of hiring fully trained ones.
"It could be production folks, nurses, clerical staff," Ms. Miller said, "anyone already on staff who shows an aptitude for programming might come into the training program we are now setting up."
Rubbermaid, which makes plastic kitchenware and toys, gave ground on wages, but only as part of a broader recruiting tactic. Unable to hire enough people for its Little Tykes toy factory in Hudson, a suburb of Cleveland, it raised the starting wage last August by $1, to $8.07 an hour, roughly the going rate for entry-level factory workers in northern Ohio.
"We had been drawing applicants who were unemployed or on welfare, and when the wage went up, we started getting people who had jobs and wore clean shirts and ties," said Scott Silver, vice president for human resources.
But with the factory's employment rising to 1,000 from 700 in 1996, the higher wage was not enough, and like many companies across America, Rubbermaid turned to the temporary help industry, which acts increasingly as a clearing house, bringing workers and companies together. Rubbermaid asked the Olsten Corporation to open a recruiting office inside the factory. And Olsten for the first time sent recruiters deep into the surrounding communities, tapping church groups, bowling leagues and immigrant organizations for people willing to work for $8 an hour -- initially as Olsten employees but shifting in two or three months to Rubbermaid's payroll.
"People often see us as a vehicle to gain access to first-line companies that they don't think they can get into on their own," Dan Brunell, Olsten's regional director in the Cleveland area, said.
Other companies are going even further. With a fourth theme park opening next month in Florida, Disney has set up recruiting offices in five Puerto Rican cities, mostly to recruit low-wage workers. And Burrelle's Information Services, a newspaper and television clipping service based in Livingston, N.J., is hiring and expanding in Presque Isle in northern Maine.
Burrelle's employs 1,000 people at its main sites in Livingston and in Provo, Utah, but has trouble finding workers in these cities for $7 an hour. Rather than raise the wage, it is expanding employment at a newer office in Presque Isle, where the unemployment rate is still above 6 percent. The office now has 700 workers earning $7 an hour, including some with college degrees.
"You have to be flexible this way, and move where you can get the people," Robert Waggonner, the chief executive of Burrelle's, said. He rents quarters in Presque Isle, reluctant to build and then face rising wages as other companies tap into northern Maine's labor pool, just as they once did in Provo.
Ohio is demonstrating a newfound flexibility as well. The Department of Economic Development, like other state agencies everywhere, has spent years trying to persuade companies to come to Ohio and hire its residents. But workers are suddenly in short supply. Last month, the department started placing television ads, even on the "Larry King Live" show, to encourage people to move to Ohio and take jobs.
"You cannot bring a company in, even with tax breaks, unless you can show you have an available work force," John Damschroder, the department's director of special projects, said. Ohio's unemployment rate is less than 5 percent.
In pursuit of that work force, the ads offer a toll-free number. The operators direct callers to a new site on the World Wide Web that lists hundreds of unfilled jobs in the state, or they mail out a promotional booklet. "We have gotten 500 calls, mostly from people who hold jobs elsewhere but have family here or once lived here and want to come back," Mr. Damschroder said.
Kenneth Vaughn of Torrance, Calif., an aircraft inspector for American Airlines, saw the commercial and dialed the number. He grew up near Cincinnati and is trying to persuade his wife -- also an Ohio native -- that northern winters are not so bad after all. He may return in July, when he can take an early retirement agreement that will give him $31,000 a year.
The tight job market in states like Ohio, Mr. Vaughn said, convinces him that at age 52, he will not have trouble landing another job that pays enough to bring his income up to $75,000 a year. That would match his current earnings at American, including overtime. "My children say, 'We will be poor,' " he said, "but I don't think so. I'm ready to try something new."
Oklahoma also worries about having enough workers for the industrial companies already there or thinking about coming. The state Commerce Department plans to circulate a directory of M.B.A. graduates of Oklahoma State University and the University of Oklahoma -- each with a photo and biographical sketch -- to local businesses.
"It will look like a football program," said Ronald Rosenfeld, the Secretary of Commerce. "Many of our companies don't recruit on our college campuses, so we will bring the candidates to them."
The Boeing Company, which employs 1,600 people at two aircraft operations in Oklahoma, is also concerned. At a recent dinner at the governor's mansion, Boeing executives said they wanted to bring in more bright young engineers and technicians, Mr. Rosenfeld said.
"They were saying that in order to get people to leave places like Seattle to settle in places like Tulsa," Mr. Rosenfeld said, "they would probably have to provide the additional inducement of subsidized vacations" to ski in Colorado, go sailing off Seattle, where Boeing is based, or attend the theater in New York.

HEADLINE: Report Says Quality of Life Rises Slightly In Connecticut

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
An annual report that traces a wide array of social indicators in Connecticut found that the state's overall quality of life rose slightly in 1995, researchers said yesterday. But they cautioned that social conditions were not improving as rapidly as the economy and that reports of child abuse were rising at an alarming rate.
The report, by the Institute for Innovation in Social Policy at Fordham University, is commissioned annually by the state government and the Graustein Memorial Fund in New Haven. It tracks conditions in a variety of categories, like unemployment, health care and teen-age birth rates. 
 "One of the things that really bothered us this year was the child abuse rate," said Marc L. Miringoff, a Fordham professor and the principal author of the study, whose findings were released in January. "The preliminary data for 1996 showed the same jump. That's why we're concerned."
From 1994 to 1995, the number of children reported to be at risk or suffering from neglect or physical or sexual abuse rose by 9,000, bringing the total to 37,043, Professor Miringoff said. No changes were made in the state's reporting system during that period, he said. Since 1990, the report found, reports of child abuse in the state more than doubled.
While indicators of the strength of the state's economy improved, a handful of indicators of social conditions worsened sharply. "What we're seeing is that the social health is not improving as quickly as the economy of the state," Professor Miringoff said.
The report said that unemployment declined for the third consecutive year, violent crime declined for the fifth consecutive year and the cost of a single-family home declined for the sixth consecutive year. But income disparity in the state widened from 1994 to 1995. Health care costs fell during that period, but so did average weekly wages.
The study found that while child abuse rates rose, infant mortality rates fell from 1994 to 1995. Youth suicide and teen-age birth rates also dropped, and high school graduation rates rose.
The report gave the state an overall score of 44.5 for 1995 out of a possible 100, a slight increase from 42.7 in 1994. In 8 of the last 10 years, the state's score dropped, with a decline of roughly 20 points since 1984. Connecticut's 1995 score roughly matched the standard of social well-being for the nation in a similar study by Professor Miringoff. The state's highest score was 74 in 1973, and its lowest was 42 in 1992.
High school completion rates were among the report's bright spots, with 81.5 percent of enrolling freshmen graduating in 1995, an increase from 1994 and the highest rate since 1973.
But a public opinion poll of 1,000 state residents in December 1997 and released with the study found mixed views. Connecticut residents who were polled thought that economic conditions had improved since 1995, when the last poll was taken.
The poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, found that perceptions of job opportunities improved, with 47 percent saying that job opportunities were good in the current poll, compared with 24 percent in 1995.
Although most of those who were polled responded that conditions had improved in the state over the short-term, many said conditions were worse than they were five years ago. Fifty-one percent of those polled said the standard of living in the state had decreased in the last five years, and 41 percent said safety had decreased during the same period.
There was also little optimism for the future. Forty-two percent of those polled said they believed that the overall standard of living in the state would decline, and 36 percent said conditions will stay the same in the next five years. The area of highest optimism was education: 39 percent expected the quality of education to improve, and 35 percent expected it to stay the same.
Finally, the poll found that residents still have a stubbornly persistent perception of two Connecticuts -- an issue that has long vexed the state. In a /2 percent increase/ from the 1995 poll, 80 percent of those polled said they agreed strongly or agreed somewhat with the statement, "There are two Connecticuts, one prosperous, one poor."

Fifty Years Later, Israel Seeks to Define Its Identity
A remarkable ethnic and cultural diversity has evolved in the half-century since Israel was founded as a Jewish state. But whether that diversity marks the success or failure of the Zionist experiment is a matter of considerable debate among Israelis, heading toward the anniversary on April 30. A1
 
Kosovo Rebels Gain Strength
Guerrilla bands from the Kosovo Liberation Army, who are fighting for an independent state in the Serbian province, have dramatically strengthened their presence in the region. Rebel groups that a few weeks ago numbered four or five guerrillas have quadrupled in size, swelled in part by an infusion of troops and weapons smuggled in from Albania. A3 

Talks on Ireland Progress
Religious and political leaders of the Irish Republic and Britain continued to work toward an agreement to end the violence that has racked Ireland for 800 years. Prime Ministers Bertie Ahern of Ireland and Tony Blair of Britain say they are optimistic about the proposals they have developed. The ideas are to be transmitted to the chairman of the talks, who will submit them to leaders of the northern parties. Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary said that some issues remained unresolved but that she thought there could be agreement by the talks' deadline on Thursday. A4
 
Concern Over Iranians' Visit
The Clinton Administration said it hoped that Iran did not misinterpret the short detention of Iranian wrestlers by immigration authorities when the athletes entered the United States last week to take part in a wrestling tournament. Members of the group, the first Iranian sports team to visit this country since the fall of the Shah in 1979, were detained for two hours, photographed and fingerprinted when they entered the country at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. They were on their way to the World Cup of Freestyle Wrestling championships at Oklahoma Sate University. A8
 
Ukraine Mine Explosion Kills 63
A gas explosion killed 63 Ukrainian coal miners in one of the country's worst mining disasters, officials said. They said the bodies of all those trapped below ground when the methane gas blast ripped through a new seam on Saturday had been recovered. (Reuters)
 
Koreas Agree to Talks
South Korea said it would accept a North Korean proposal to reopen talks on economic aid and other issues. On Saturday North Korea proposed that officials at the deputy minister level meet in Beijing next weekend. The talks, if held, would be the first contact between the Governments since 1994, when deputy prime ministers of the two sides met. A summit meeting then in the works was canceled after Kim Il Sung, the North Korean leader, died a few weeks before it was to be held. (AP)

U.S. to Ban Import Of Some Assault Weapons
The Clinton Administration plans to announce today that it will permanently ban the importation of 58 types of military-style assault weapons, blocking the entry of more than a million high-powered guns into the United States. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms found that the 58 types of guns cannot be classified as sporting weapons and therefore are banned under a 1968 gun-control law. A1
 
Remaking Social Security
After a divorce left her in charge of her own finances for the first time, Cynthia de Lorenzi learned quickly about the world of investing. Now she is a strong supporter of a proposal to remake Social Security by giving individuals the right to invest some of the money they normally pay in taxes to finance the system, granting them a shot at a pot of gold but also exposing them to new risks. The issue is sure to be central to a public discussion of Social Security on Tuesday, led by the President. A14

Giuliani Seeking Power To Name Housing Judges
Charging that the city's Housing Court is stacked against landlords and that judges refuse to apply strict new rent laws, the Giuliani administration strongly urged that the power to appoint housing judges be taken away from court officials and given to the Mayor. Rudolph W. Giuliani has repeatedly sought to exercise more personal discretion over the judicial appointments he controls. It remains unclear whether lawmakers will agree to a law that could draw the ire of the state's powerful tenant lobby. B3

HEADLINE: The Middle Class Can Live Here

 BODY:

To the Editor:
As a recent Brooklyn home buyer, I could appreciate "For Middle Class, New York Shrinks as Home Prices Soar" (front page, April 1). You do not mention, however, that while the middle class has been priced out of neighborhoods like Yorkville, the West Village and Brooklyn Heights, this is an excellent time to explore more racially and economically integrated areas of the city. 
 Neighborhoods like Prospect Heights, Williamsburg and Fort Greene in Brooklyn, for example, offer beautiful old homes, tree-lined streets and the opportunity to raise a family in an ethnically diverse setting. Perhaps the city, instead of investing in cheaply constructed new high-rises, should provide incentives for middle-class buyers to renovate old homes in these historic neighborhoods.

HEADLINE: Time and Technology Threaten Digital Archives . . .

BYLINE: By STEPHEN MANES 

 BODY:
JEFF ROTHENBERG, a senior computer scientist at the Rand Corporation, is fond of quoting Shakespeare's 18th sonnet, the one that begins "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" But in keeping with his interest in the preservation of digital data, he prefers the final couplet: "So long as men can breathe or eyes can see/So long lives this and this gives life to thee." Referring to the poem itself, the lines attest to the poet's faith in the staying power of ink on paper.
Today's digitally processed words and images may not be nearly as stable or long-lived. In a recently revised paper, "Ensuring the Longevity of Digital Documents," Mr. Rothenberg noted that a modern-day Shakespeare bent on accuracy might be forced to write, "So long as the magnetic flux on this disk has not been disturbed, and so long as humans retain the appropriate size and speed disk drives, and so long as they have hardware controllers and software device drivers capable of reading the bits from this disk, and so long as they have access to the software that encoded the file structure and character codes employed in the bit stream of this document, and so long as they can still find or recreate the computing environment necessary to run that software, and so long as they can still breathe or see/So long lives this . . ." 
 As that suggests (and as anyone who has lost the only copy of precious computer data can confirm), preserving information in digital form is far more daunting than filing sheets of paper or shelving rolls of microfilm. The problems have been studied in library, archive and academic circles, but their implications are now becoming clear to the wider world.
Donald Waters, director of the Digital Library Federation, a consortium of large research libraries and archives, said the issue was not merely a matter of technology. "It's also legal, organizational and financial," Mr. Waters said. The simple question of how much information has already been lost is difficult to answer. "There are lots of examples, but people are very unwilling to talk about them," he said. "This is a very sensitive topic."
The instances most often cited date to an era that in computer terms is ancient history. From 1976 through 1979, the National Archives worked on recovering certain 1960 census data from tapes designed to run on long-obsolete machines. By the mid-1980's, computerized land-use maps of New York State produced in the 1960's became unavailable; the State Archives found that the software required to analyze the data had not been stored with it and that the hardware and operating system no longer existed, so the original data remain available only in printed form. In another instance, satellite observations of Brazil in the 1970's were lost irretrievably.
Newer material, particularly complex multimedia software, is hardly immune. Last year, when a museum asked Jaron Lanier, a pioneer in virtual reality research, to display a video game called Moondust, which he had written in 1982 for the popular Commodore 64 computer, he had to track down a machine of precisely that vintage (but no newer), along with a joystick and video interface that could work with it. To play a CD-ROM called "How Computers Work" in a traveling exhibit recently, Carl Goodman, a curator of digital media at the American Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, had to borrow a vintage Macintosh; current models could not read the disk.
The archival problems begin with the furtive nature of digital data storage itself. Paper may crumble, but its condition is usually obvious based on its appearance. But for a typical disk or tape, short of running it in the proper computer, there is no easy way to determine whether it holds data or whether the information is deteriorating. For a variety of reasons, including the life of coatings and physical materials and the deterioration of magnetic impulses, magnetic media like tape and disks do not last nearly as long as acid-free paper even when they are merely sitting on a shelf. Not even optical media like CD-ROM are permanent.
Data from the National Media Laboratory suggest that the longevity of tapes and optical media depends not only on their quality, which can vary widely, but also on storage conditions, cold and dry being better than warm and humid. Without special storage, lower-quality media should typically survive two to five years, but only certain high-quality optical media are likely to last 100.
That is why Bill Gates's privately held image-bank company, Corbis, "refreshes" its data tapes by copying them every few years onto more advanced ones that typically hold more data in the same space and last longer. Still, Tony Rojas, the company's president, said that of the company's 1.3 million digital images, 50 had been lost because of media failures. The National Archives keeps two copies of its tapes and refreshes them every 10 years.
But physically maintaining data does not begin to guarantee their survival because the devices that create the data quickly disappear. "The media become obsolete even faster than they become unreadable," Mr. Rothenberg said.
A standard cassette tape holding information created on a now-vanished early personal computer is likely to be unreadable even if it still retains its data. Eight-inch floppy disks and drives, popular as recently as a dozen years ago, are now virtually extinct, and their 5 1/4-inch successors are rapidly disappearing. Optical and magnetic disks recorded under nonstandard storage schemes will be increasingly useless because of the lack of working equipment to read them.
"People are also talking about the notion of migration," Mr. Rothenberg said, "which means you not only have to copy the bits, you have to worry about the fact that the software that you used to create and read the document has become entirely obsolete." Documents created with obsolete word processors or old versions of current processors can often be converted to newer formats, but formatting and even footnotes may be lost in the process, which may have to be repeated again and again over the years. Mr. Rothenberg likened it to the parlor game of telephone, where a whispered message is often garbled beyond recognition by the time it is repeated five or six times.
Storing the information in standard formats can minimize the readability problem, which is why repositories like the National Archives insist on receiving documents only in the most plain-vanilla forms, like ASCII text. But standard formats typically do not retain information about such things as fonts and formatting, and they are hopelessly inadequate for representing files with hypertext, sound or video. Moreover, formats that seem standard today may change; today's ASCII scheme, for example, may one day give way to a standard known as Unicode, which is better able to represent the characters of languages other than English.
Mr. Rothenberg prefers the idea of storing documents in their original forms and formats, with the software that created them and is typically required to view them. But 100 years hence, what machines could possibly run that software or understand those documents? Instead of the actual hardware, which is likely to deteriorate anyway, Mr. Rothenberg favors storing detailed, complete descriptions of it. Then one day software could be created that would let the hardware of the future mimic the hardware of today.
The idea of using one computer to emulate another is not new; the technique is used to let Windows programs run on current Macintosh computers. More than 20 years ago, Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Monte Davidoff developed the original Microsoft BASIC by using a big computer at Harvard University to emulate the dinky Altair 8800, one of the first personal computers, without ever having seen one. An Internet cult has been developing emulators to run code from creaky video arcade games on fast modern computers. Given the speed improvements in computers, said Mr. Rothenberg, "the thing I worry about most is that if I emulate current software 100 years from now, it will work too fast."
But emulating today's complex systems is not easy. In a posting to the Web site for the Time and Bits conference in Los Angeles in February at the Getty Museum, Mr. Lanier was skeptical of this approach. In attempting to move his virtual worlds from their original software platform to others, he found that "the transfer process turns out to be impossible," and came to believe it "unlikely that complex, deeply interactive systems will ever be documented to the point of perfect completion." He added that "unlikely" does not mean "impossible" and called the problem "the Everest of computer science."
It is also just the beginning of a mountain of legal, cultural and financial issues that archiving will inevitably entail. For example, the Internet Archive (www.archive.org) stores "snapshots" of the Net for posterity and keeps "dead" content publicly available after it has officially disappeared. The practice raises knotty questions not only about whether storing someone else's data and making them available to the public violates copyright laws, but also about how best to prevent institutions from unmaking history by removing information from public view and how best to maintain archives without compromising creators' intellectual property rights.
Digital archives have the potential to avoid pitfalls that have beset their traditional forebears since the days of the Library of Alexandria. Because perfect digital copies can be made with ease and maintained in a small space, storing precious information at multiple sites can minimize damage from the fire, flood and fungus that threaten traditional media.
Handling can be virtually eliminated; fingers that can damage paper are kept well away from digital media. And digital archives can be much more accessible then their current counterparts. But just because an archive is maintained in digital form does not exempt it from the disastrous consequences of the kinds of decision-making that caused television producers to erase and reuse archival videotapes and film studios to reclaim the silver from one-of-a-kind negatives.
Don Whiting, assistant secretary of state for Washington State, oversees an office charged with maintaining the government archives and grappling with these problems on a daily basis. "One of the things that may make it hard to answer the kinds of questions people face is that the technology moves so fast," Mr. Whiting said.
He knows that problem all too well. In his spare time at home, he is refreshing and upgrading his personal archives. Many of his old files are stored on 5 1/4-inch floppy disks, which his newest machine cannot read. They were created and stored in the format of a program called Framework, which disappeared from the market about a decade ago. In the computer world, those bygone times seem positively Elizabethan.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Ink on paper, as Shakespeare pointed out, can endure for years; witness the shelves of the Library of Congress, right (United Press International). But some computers, like those in a 1970's I.B.M. office, are regarded as part of ancient history. (International Business Machines Corporation); Some forms of data storage, like the eight-inch disk, above, are out of favor, and few computers can accommodate them. Zip and Jaz disks, right, are among today's options, but technology changes rapidly.

HEADLINE: Broadway's Impact On Economy Grows

 BODY:
The Broadway theater generated $2.7 billion in the city's economy in the 1996-97 season, much of it in restaurants, hotels and other services used by tourists who said they came to New York primarily for a show, a study by the League of American Theaters and Producers says.
That is a 37 percent increase from the economic impact figures in a similar study five years ago, said Jed Bernstein, executive director of the league. 
 The study, produced in partnership with the Alliance for the Arts, found that there was $485 million in direct spending on Broadway. The largest contribution came from indirect tourist spending, which had an economic impact of $1.7 billion, the study concluded.

Sorry, Game Over

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
At this time each year world leaders prepare for the annual June G-7 summit meeting by asking themselves: What should we talk about this year? Every year they come up with some phony theme. Well, I've got an idea. Let's have them talk about something really important. Let's make this year's G-7 about Japan. Even though this year's summit will be in Birmingham, England, I say serve those G-7 leaders sushi and rice for every meal, make them attend origami classes and tea ceremonies, and list every item on the agenda as: "Discussion about Japan." That's right, let's really spotlight Japan. Who knows, maybe that will help trigger the only thing that will really stimulate Japan's economy: a revolution.
Why should you care? Because Asia today is sinking into recession. In an effort to climb out, all the Asians are trying to use their cheap currencies to increase exports and stoke up growth. But someone has to buy all those exports. And if Japan, the world's second-largest economy after the U.S., won't take its share, everyone is going to try to export to America. That, in turn, could send the U.S. trade deficit soaring, shrink the earnings of U.S. multinationals, spark a strong protectionist backlash in America and end the long boom in the U.S. economy. 
 I'd say that's worth talking about at a G-7 meeting, especially since Japan, despite seven lean years of virtually no growth, still can't stimulate its economy, because it has political and economic arteriosclerosis. Politically speaking, Japan today is like Japan near the end of World War II: Tokyo was burned to the ground, Nagasaki and Hiroshima had been flattened, the Japanese fleet was at the bottom of the ocean. But the Japanese political leadership would meet each day in the Emperor's bunker and none of them could bring themselves to tell him: "Game over." Finally, the Emperor had to do it himself, telling the Japanese people they had to swallow their tears and surrender.
Well, today unfortunately there is no all-powerful Japanese Emperor. So Japan's politicians are home alone in their bunker, still dithering over who will tell the people that they have to surrender to the global economy. The old Japanese system -- top-down capitalism, protected by high trade barriers -- cannot be sustained in today's new, fast-paced, integrated information age.
"Japan can't stimulate effectively unless the system is changed," argues Clyde Prestowitz, head of the Economic Strategy Institute and a longtime analyst of the Japanese economy. "You cannot have a macroeconomic solution in Japan without a micro solution."
That's because Japanese consumers won't spend and Japanese banks won't lend -- without radical reforms. Japan's banks are in feeble shape, notes Mr. Prestowitz, so when the Government tries to inject money into the banking system (usually by propping up the stock market), the Japanese banks keep the money to shore up their balance sheets, and don't make any new loans. Until the Japanese Government does an American-style S.&L. bailout, and takes the bad loans off the books of the Japanese banks, it will be hard for them to contribute to a stimulus.
Meanwhile Japanese consumers, who in the best of times save too much and in uncertain times do so even more, tend to take tax cuts and stuff a lot of it in their mattresses. One reason Japanese consumers don't spend is because everything in Japan is so expensive, because the economy is so regulated and full of hidden monopolies and tariffs. Without some real move to open the Japanese economy, Japanese consumers, who have trillions of dollars in savings stashed away, are never going to buy enough from the rest of the world.
But Japan's macroeconomic policies have also been wanting. The Japanese Government keeps offering what the U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary, Lawrence Summers, rightly calls "virtual fiscal policy" -- phantom spending programs and voodoo tax cuts that not only haven't stimulated the Japanese economy but have actually left it contracting at a time of already slow growth, a la Herbert Hoover.
Japan needs an economic revolution. For now, though, there is no ruling or opposition figure there to articulate and lead that revolution. So either America and its G-7 partners will do it, by hammering Japan, or a major economic catastrophe will do it, by hammering us all.

HEADLINE: U.N. Report Criticizes U.S. for 'Racist' Use of Death Penalty

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, April 6

 BODY:
The United States has been accused of unfair, arbitrary and racist use of the death penalty by a United Nations special investigator in a report here at a meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
Overriding American objections, the commission voted last week for the second year in a row to call for a worldwide moratorium on executions. 
 The author of the United Nations report, Bacre Waly Ndiaye, a lawyer from Senegal, wrote that "race, ethnic origin and economic status appear to be key determinants of who will, and who will not, receive a sentence of death" in the United States. The report was presented to the commission last week.
Mr. Ndiaye is an independent expert appointed by the commission to investigate extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions worldwide.
He traveled in the United States from Sept. 21 to Oct. 8 last year and based his findings on meetings with Federal officials and officials in New York, Florida, Texas and California, and on visits to death rows.
In the 65-page report, Mr. Ndiaye said he found "a significant degree of unfairness and arbitrariness" in the death penalty's use. Considerations aside from the crime itself often influence whether the death sentence is imposed, he said, contending that such considerations include the race and economic level of both the victim and the accused. Mr. Ndiaye urged that the United States stop executions at least until it can assure fair and impartial application.
He rejected the argument that there is broad public support for capital punishment in the United States. "In many countries, mob killings and lynchings enjoy public support as a way to deal with violent crime and are often portrayed as 'popular justice,' " he wrote. "Yet they are not acceptable in any civilized society."
He said that "allegations of racial discrimination in the imposition of death sentences are particularly serious in southern states such as Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia and Texas, known as the 'death penalty belt.' "
Some Federal and state officials refused to see him during his visit. Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the mission an "absurd U.N. charade," and urged the State Department not to cooperate. He made his comments in an angry letter to the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, who later commented that the report would only "collect a lot of dust."
Mr. Ndiaye's report was issued late Friday, just before the Commission voted 26 to 13, with others abstaining, to continue its call for a general moratorium on executions, with the goal of eventually abolishing them globally.
The Commission has 53 delegate nations at any one time, with a system of rotating three-year terms.
In addition to the United States, the opponents included China, Congo and the Sudan. George Moose, the American delegate to the United Nations in Geneva, defended each country's right "to decide this issue through its own democratic process."
"We believe that in a democratic society, the criminal justice system, including the punishments prescribed for the most serious crimes, should reflect the will of the people freely expressed and appropriately implemented," Mr. Moose said at the commission meeting.
Despite the commission's vote, many countries retain the penalty. A recent report by the United Nations Secretary General says that 90 countries have capital punishment, while 61 have formally abolished it.
But while the number of countries doing away with the death sentence has been increasing, the United States has greatly extended its use, since it was reinstated in 1976, particularly to punish Federal crimes, Mr. Ndiaye said.
The United States, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen are the only countries where offenders under age 18 can be executed, the report said, adding that this violates international law.
Executing mentally handicapped defendants, a practice allowed in 28 of the 38 American states that have capital punishment, is a breach of international standards, the report said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Networks Turn to Affiliates To Defray Program Costs

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
Since the earliest days of radio in the 1920's, one principle has governed the relationship between networks and the hundreds of stations around the country affiliated with them: The networks put on the programs and they paid the stations a fee to broadcast them.
Now, in what would be a fundamental restructuring of the economics of broadcasting, executives at several of the networks are trying to redefine that relationship. In interviews over the last week, several senior network executives, including Robert A. Iger, the president of ABC Inc., and Neal Braun, the president of the NBC television network, argued that the system was anachronistic and increasingly unrealistic at a time when program costs have escalated and network profits have eroded drastically. 
 In recent months, networks have asked stations to help defray the costs of specific programs like National Football League games. But the executives latest proposals would go further. Among the changes being contemplated: selling affiliated stations commercial time now owned by the networks during the prime-time hours and ending program exclusivity arrangements with affiliated stations so that networks can sell more of their programs to secondary buyers like cable channels.
Any such moves will likely bring the networks into conflict with the affiliates, whose executives have resisted any actions the networks have suggested that would reverse the policy of paying fees, called compensation, for carrying network programs. They have also pointed out that the networks are now owned by huge conglomerates, such as Walt Disney, which owns ABC, and General Electric, which owns NBC, that can easily absorb the extra cost of programs.
The three major networks -- Fox pays no compensation -- now pay between $175 million and $200 million each annually to hundreds of affiliated stations. The new moves are designed to raise money from affiliates without taking them on directly over the issue of compensation. The $175 million paid out by ABC last year was almost equal to the network's total profit on more than $3 billion in sales.
"The economic model that exists between networks and stations has to be re-examined," Mr. Iger said. "Competition has increased for viewers and advertisers and program content. We are going to need help and we are going to have to get it. I'm not embarrassed about having asked for it and I'd be very disappointed not to get it."
Mr. Braun said: "The world has changed. The historic relationship between affiliates and networks no longer works on an economic basis."
Mr. Iger said that stations would have to begin helping pay their networks for the cost of such high-priced programming as N.F.L. football, the Academy Awards, and the drama "E.R."
Mr. Iger, who addressed the need for change in the network-station relationship in a keynote speech at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas, Nev., yesterday, said last week that ABC had a plan that would allow local stations to buy commercial time from ABC that is actually more valuable when sold locally.
"If we have a spot that sells for, say $100,000, the local stations might be able to sell it collectively for $150,000," he said. Without specifying figures, Mr. Iger said the amount of money ABC could recoup in this way was significant. "It will help us with the N.F.L. deal," he added.
Mr. Iger said ABC was challenging affiliated stations by beginning to replay programs on cable channels that compete with the the network's affiliates. That policy is bitterly opposed by many station managers, who insist that they have exclusive rights to network programs for at least one year.
At NBC, Mr. Braun said the network had put together a large-scale proposal to restructure the network-affiliates relationship, which he said he intended to send to affiliates in the next month. Mr. Braun said the affiliates continued to resist the notion of helping networks because "they don't want to cross that line -- it's ideological."
The networks, in recent months, have made several expensive programming deals. ABC committed to spend $550 million a year for "Monday Night Football" this coming season, up from $230 million. (It also committed to paying $600 million for Sunday night football on its all-sports cable channel, ESPN, up from $124 million.)
Similarly, NBC agreed to pay $13 million an episode for "E.R.," a total of of $286 million a year, up from about $40 million. The deal, along with higher rights fees for National Basketball Association basketball, is expected to cut deeply into NBC's substantial profits this year, estimated at more than $500 million.
CBS also spent so lavishly on football -- $500 million a year -- that it is widely expected that the network will not make any profit next year.
CBS had asked stations to help defray the costs of football programming, but CBS executves last week declined to comment on whether they would see further changes.
The affiliates are made up of small, individually owned stations and large groups owned by such companies as the Gannett Company and the A. H. Belo Corporation. Station profit margins can reach as high as 50 percent and the value of stations has increased markedly in the last decade as more and more stations have become affiliated with networks.
David Barrett, the chairman of the ABC affiliate board, has already informed ABC that affiliates "would be strongly opposed to contributing cash" to help pay for the football deal. Mr. Barrett, the executive vice president of Hearst-Argyle Broadcasting, which owns 10 ABC affiliates, sounded a note cited by many affiliates managers when he categorized the football deals as a "strategic corporate decision" by Disney, which "will derive benefits far beyond the price they are paying." Disney, for example, could make N.F.L. games the centerpiece of many other ESPN programs.
In 1994, the networks were forced into long-term deals with local stations -- some as long as 10 years -- after the upstart Fox network stole a large number of affiliated stations away from the other three networks.
Had the raids not occurred, Mr. Iger said, "I think you would have seen at least a leveling off and probably a continuing decrease in compensation." Instead, he said, "compensation went up hundreds of millions of dollars."
Mr. Braun said he had hopes that station managers would respond to NBC's proposals. Otherwise, he said, the conversations might get a lot tougher as affiliate deals begin to run out. "If these network-station issues are not addressed, there is going to be some sort of adversarial escalation," Mr. Braun said. "I'm desperately trying to avoid an adversarial escalation."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Closes Above 9,000 For First Time

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Propelled by news of the biggest corporate merger in history, the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 9,000 for the first time yesterday.
The blue-chip barometer, which crossed 8,000 less than nine months ago, has ridden a swell of money into stock mutual funds and a conviction that the current benign economic conditions can continue indefinitely. 
 But the last 1,000-point move has been one of the rockier ones in recent memory, including a period of worldwide unease when Asian economies were in turmoil.
The Dow crossed the 9,000 level on Friday, only to back off, but climbed 49.82 points yesterday, to 9,033.23. The biggest gainer in the index was Travelers Group, which announced in the morning that it would merge with Citicorp to form the world's largest financial services company in a stock swap valued at more than $70 billion. The news buoyed shares of other financial services companies, including J. P. Morgan and Merrill Lynch, as investors placed bets on further combinations.
Despite the Dow's historic climb, broader market gauges faltered. Citicorp's gain of 37 5/8 was not enough to bolster the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which slipped 1.32 points, to 1,121.38. And the Nasdaq composite index, a key technology barometer, fell 26.26 points, to 1,829.14, led by losses in Microsoft, Intel and Dell Computer.
On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,727 to 1,318.
The lackluster performance of other market gauges reflected some analysts' concerns that stocks might be overvalued and some uneasiness about first-quarter earnings reports, scheduled to begin in earnest next week.
"I'm not sure it would have gotten there without the merger," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company. "This market is probably a little ahead of itself."
In fact, mergers have played a big role in the market's gains this year. As of yesterday, more than 2,500 deals valued at more than $316.5 billion had been announced, according to the Securities Data Company. That represents an increase of more than 50 percent from the $200 billion worth of deals announced in the comparable period of 1997. So far this year, there have been fewer deals over all, but an increasing number of very large deals, with many being done for stock. To many investors that indicates that corporations do not believe that market values are too high.
While earlier concerns about Asian economies seem to be lessening, economists still expect the slowdown in that region to thwart strong worldwide growth of American companies.
South Korea expects this week to borrow $3 billion from bond investors, paying interest rates far less than would have seemed possible only a few months ago. At the same time, Robotic Vision Systems, a maker of vision systems that examine semiconductors for flaws, became the latest company to point to Asia as a source of trouble, saying it expected to post a loss for its second quarter because of a slowdown in the semiconductor industry, which it attributed in part to Asia's economic crisis.
Yesterday, Asian markets were mostly lower, although Japan's benchmark Nikkei rose 1.21 percent, posting its first gain in four days.
The Dow's move has come despite evidence that the United States economy is slowing. Last week, the Government reported that the number of people with jobs declined in March, and so many companies have posted disappointing profits that I.B.E.S. International now says Wall Street analysts expect first-quarter profits for the companies in the S.& P. 500 to decline from a year earlier. As 1998 began, those analysts expected a 9.7 percent gain.
Nonetheless, investors appear to be generally optimistic that Asia's woes, which have hurt some corporate profits, will not cause a serious problem for the American economy.
And despite the notes of caution, most analysts and investors are betting that the bull market will continue once first-quarter earnings have been digested.
"Investors are willing to buy stocks because they think the profit growth will continue," said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company. While corporate earnings growth may not be as robust as it has been, "what matters is the durability and the longevity" of the trend, she added.
There was no such confidence in October, when the Dow completed its first-ever 1,000-point decline, having fallen to 7,161.15 on Oct. 27, from 8,259.31 on Aug. 6. Then there was worldwide concern that the Asian crisis would have dire effects. But markets rallied after that, and rising prices reassured investors.
The run of the Dow also marked another milestone. On March 2, the index passed 8,546, meaning it was up 1,000 percent from the 1982 low of 776.92. That 1,000 percent move took less than 16 years. By contrast, the previous record for a 1,000 percent rise, coming off the Depression low in July 1932, took 23 years.
Earlier this year, the flow of money into stock mutual funds seemed to be slowing, perhaps because of Asian concerns. But it has picked up dramatically in recent weeks, in part as investors put money into individual retirement accounts.
The run from 8,000 to 9,000 has nonetheless been a shaky one. Of the 30 Dow stocks, nine are lower than they were when the average hit 8,000. Those are, by and large, industrial and commodity companies, including Boeing, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Alcoa and International Paper, which need a strong world economy. The leaders are much more reliant on a healthy American economy, where the current low-interest rate environment has facilitated some of the merger moves. The eight Dow stocks up more than 30 percent are AT&T, Travelers, Wal-Mart, Walt Disney, Merck, American Express, General Motors and J. P. Morgan.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Trade Group Strikes Blow at U.S. Environmental Law

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
In a decision that could undercut the use of trade sanctions to promote global environmental goals, the World Trade Organization ruled today that the United States was wrong to prohibit shrimp imports from countries that fail to protect sea turtles from deadly entrapment in the trawls of shrimping boats.
The decision by a three-member panel in Geneva was the latest sign that when free trade conflicts with environmental protection, the international trade body is unlikely to swerve from its central mission of promoting trade. 
 The Clinton Administration responded defiantly, but officials did not detail how they would pursue a policy required by United States law.
"We believe the W.T.O. panel reached the wrong conclusion," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative. She said it "does not affect our efforts to protect endangered sea turtles."
The large reptiles, at risk of extinction, are especially threatened by the shrimping boat nets that entangle and drown them.
The United States requires shrimpers in its waters to equip nets with metal grills that exclude turtles and other large animals, and in 1989 Congress passed a law prohibiting shrimp imports from countries not requiring these devices in their fleets.
Shiv Mukherjee, the minister for press at the Indian Embassy in Washington, called his nation's petition to the W.T.O., which was joined by Thailand, Pakistan and Malaysia, "a matter of principle" in opposing trade barriers.
"Our shrimp exports are one of our significant items on our export list," he said, adding that shrimping is a labor-intensive industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people. "That was a demand of the United States that would have had a significant impact if allowed to stand."
The panel found that even under the provisions of the W.T.O. agreement that allow environmental exceptions, the United States would not be permitted to force other nations to adopt policies to protect an endangered species like the turtle.
"There isn't a strong basis for arguing a pro-environment position within the W.T.O.," said Robert F. Lawrence, an international trade lawyer with Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. "The environment is going to take a back seat whenever there is a direct and open conflict with open and free trade."
The trade body has ruled before against the United States on issues involving protection for dolphins and requirements for cleaner-burning gasoline, but conservation groups reacted especially strongly to this case, citing its broad implications as well as the plight of the turtles.
In affirming an earlier, preliminary decision that the American embargo violated trade rules, the trade organization said that while environmental considerations were important, the primary aim of international agreements on trade remained the promotion of economic development through unfettered trade.
Clinton Administration officials, who had expected the ruling, said they would likely appeal. But they said several other options were also under consideration -- including simply disregarding the report, which could lead to fines or countervailing trade barriers against the offenders of the turtle protection law.
The trade organization has no power to overturn a United States law. If the Administration does not win on appeal, it may try to change the shrimp import rules to accommodate today's ruling, although officials said they were unsure how they would accomplish that.
Conservation groups called on the Administration to defy the W.T.O. decision and seek international talks aimed at reshaping how the trade group addresses environmental issues.
"It is unthinkable that we should not be allowed to mitigate the impacts of our own shrimp markets on endangered sea turtles," said Deborah Crouse, senior conservation scientist at the Center for Marine Conservation, a Washington-based advocacy group.
"This entire life form is threatened with extinction," she said.
The United States imports most of the shrimp that Americans consume, some caught in the wild but most raised in coastal farms.
After prohibiting imports of shrimp caught by boats that might kill turtles, the United States negotiated agreements with several countries, especially in the Caribbean region, to protect turtles from shrimping boats. The United States provided foreign aid to help pay for the expense of installing turtle excluders. More than three dozen countries have been certified by the United States as safe shrimpers, either for having adopted the devices or as fishing only in waters where turtles are not usually found.
Daniel Seligman, director of the responsible trade campaign at the Sierra Club, said the trade organization's decision was much broader and made it difficult to envision how trade sanctions could be used to promote environmental causes.
"This is the clearest slap at environmental protection to come out of the W.T.O. to date," he said.

HEADLINE: A Good Time to End Tobacco Quotas

BYLINE: By Richard G. Lugar; Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican, is chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Several anti-smoking groups, including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association, have recently taken a position that is at odds with their goals. They want the comprehensive tobacco legislation, currently being debated in Congress, to preserve a Federal program that regulates the amount of tobacco that can be grown and the price at which it is sold.
Currently only farmers with Government-granted quotas may grow tobacco, and they profit heavily from this control. Anti-smoking groups believe that this system keeps the price of cigarettes higher than it would be otherwise. 
 But maintaining the Federal Government's sponsorship of tobacco production, marketing and warehousing is wrong -- both morally and economically.
Ending the program would have a negligible impact on the price of cigarettes. True, cutting quotas would cause the price of leaf tobacco to fall. But only six cents of the approximately $2.00 cost of a pack of cigarettes is attributable to the tobacco itself.
Economists testifying in Senate hearings estimated that ending quotas would cause the price of domestic leaf tobacco to drop by about 25 percent, as more and more farmers entered the market, increasing supply.
This would translate into only about a 1.5-cent difference in the price of cigarettes. Nobody can reasonably argue that a penny and a half would have any effect on teen-age behavior or consumer demand. Moreover, if Congress passes the comprehensive tobacco bill it is considering, the price of cigarettes might rise as high as $3.50 per pack. In that event, the one-and-a-half-cent difference would amount to less than one-half of 1 percent of the price of a pack of cigarettes.
Health groups are also concerned that the drop in the price of tobacco will raise the profits of cigarette companies. But with Congress about to pass legislation that would raise cigarette prices by as much as $1.50 per pack, why would we use a byzantine Federal program to protect 1.5 cents of the current price? Would it not make far more sense to offset the drop in tobacco prices in whatever legislation Congress may pass?
As everyone involved in the debate over smoking recognizes, we cannot end the price supports for tobacco unless the tobacco bill not only raises the cost of cigarettes and limits advertising to children, but also forces cigarette companies to pay hundreds of billions of dollars in smoking-related health care costs. Otherwise, there would be no money to buy out the tobacco farmers.
As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I have introduced a bill that would be part of the comprehensive tobacco legislation. It would buy out the tobacco quotas of farmers at $8 per pound. This one-time cost of $15 billion would end Federal price supports, while fairly compensating farmers who have depended on these quotas.
Many farmers want out of tobacco farming, but cannot afford to abandon it without help. Continuing the current program would not only trap the Federal Government into aiding the production of tobacco, it would trap many individual farmers as well.
The tobacco price supports probably cannot be sustained in any case. Domestic demand for tobacco is falling, and the quality of foreign tobacco continues to improve. The tobacco legislation may be our last chance to do right by these farmers.
Comprehensive legislation would not have been possible without the work of anti-smoking groups. But if the Federal Government's anti-smoking efforts are to succeed, its policies must be consistent. The Government should not support the production of tobacco, while it spends billions of dollars on tobacco-related health care costs and anti-smoking campaigns.
This dual course is simply contradictory and wrong, and it weakens the Government's message to the public about the dangers of smoking.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS: THE MARKETS -- Market Place;
Motorola issues some relatively good news, then some bad.

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
MOTOROLA Inc. reported late yesterday that it had managed to match Wall Street's diminished expectations for its first-quarter earnings, but any likelihood that investors in technology companies would take that as good news was dashed when the company warned that its second quarter was shaping up much more poorly than projected.
"This doesn't look good," said John Lazlo, who follows technology stocks for Paine Webber in San Francisco. "Most people felt that the first quarter would be the trough." 
 Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., said that it earned $180 million, or 30 cents a share on a diluted basis, in the first quarter, down 45 percent from $325 million, or 53 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues were $6.9 billion, up 4 percent from a year earlier.
Excluding $54 million from asset sales and other one-time gains, the telecommunications and semiconductor giant had operating earnings of $142 million, or 23 cents a share, right in line with what analysts had projected after being warned a month ago to reduce their estimates.
Last month's warning had focused attention on the problems Motorola and other major technology companies were facing as a result of Asian currency declines and the resulting economic woes in several key Asian countries. Motorola had issued its bad news on the heels of a warning from the Intel Corporation, another technology bellwether, that its earnings would be below projections. But at the time Motorola had also injected a note of hope when it said that it had seen signs that Asia's economic problems were abating.
Yesterday, though, Christopher Galvin, Motorola's chief executive, said that problems in Asia might continue for "several more quarters." The company also said that it was being hurt by weakening demand for pagers and analog cellular telephones in the United States.
"Second-quarter sales are expected to be below those of a year ago," Mr. Galvin said. "Second-quarter earnings are expected to be well below current investment community expectations and could be equal to or less than 1998 first-quarter earnings."
The earnings and disappointing forecast were released after trading had ended on the New York Stock Exchange, where Motorola's share price fell 31.25 cents, to $59.875. Analysts were awaiting the chance to question the company in a conference call scheduled for early today.
Motorola has long been among the most widely held of technology stocks, but its usefulness as a barometer for the sector has been questionable for some time. Analysts say that many of its problems, especially in the wireless communications business, result from poor execution rather than industrywide pressures.
Motorola's largest business, the cellular phone group, increased sales to $2.81 billion in the first quarter as demand grew for the company's new digital products, but overall orders were flat and operating profits dropped as sales of its older, analog products fell sharply. The semiconductor business, which sells many of its products to the cellular group and other Motorola operations as well as externally, had a 4 percent decline in orders, although sales edged up 1 percent, to $1.83 billion.
Motorola's radio sector had a 27 percent increase in sales, to $1.24 billion; increased profits, and a 2 percent growth in new orders. But that was partly offset by the messaging sector, which includes paging products, where sales tumbled 25 percent, to $693 million, orders fell 21 percent and Motorola lost money. Motorola said that the paging decline reflected efforts by retailers to reduce inventory and that sales to consumers in the key North American and Chinese markets appeared to still be growing.

HEADLINE: Union Organizer's Warm and Chilly Reinstatement

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: SOLVAY, N.Y., April 6

 BODY:
More than a year after being dismissed from her job, Kathy Saumier went back to work at a plastics factory here today with a little band of union supporters outside to applaud her, and her dogged effort to unionize workers still ahead.
It was the first time Ms. Saumier had stepped inside Landis Plastics since February, 1997, when the company charged her with sexually harassing male workers and dismissed her. Over the months of her appeals, Ms. Saumier has become something of a local hero in this factory town just northwest of Syracuse, especially since March, when a Federal District Court judge issued a preliminary injunction ordering the company to take Ms. Saumier back. The judge said the dismissal was in reprisal for Ms. Saumier's pro-union activities, rather than for sexual harassment. 
 If anything, the time off has re-energized Ms. Saumier, a product of the city's working-class West Side.
"I'm going to go back and do the job I get paid for, and I'm going to go in and organize this place and get a union in there," Ms. Saumier said in an interview Sunday night. "I'm going to do what I have always done."
About a dozen supporters, including two prominent religious leaders in Syracuse, gathered in the chill of the early morning to see Ms. Saumier back to work.
"In this Holy Week we think of Moses going to the Pharoah to let his people go," the Rev. William L. Coop, a Presbyterian minister who heads the Labor and Religion Coalition of Central New York, said to the little band. Turning to Ms. Saumier, he continued, "Maybe you're going to be not only Norma Rae but Moses as you go back in there and help your people get fair representation in a safe workplace."
Bishop Tom Costello of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse also came to show his support. He said he first began following her case when she raised concerns about the plant's poor safety record, and became a supporter when she was dismissed.
"Some of us feel that Kathy was done an injustice," Bishop Costello said, "and we did not want her to think she didn't have any friends."
Inside the plant, which is appealing the injunction, Ms. Saumier did not face as welcoming a reception. Most workers on the floor who could take time to answer questions were noncommittal about her return. And Kimberly Holden, a vocal union opponent and a critic of Ms. Saumier, strongly objected to the religious leaders' accompanying Ms. Saumier. "They're not reading the same Bible I read," Ms. Holden, a stacker at the print machines, said.
At first, it might seem odd that there would be any doubts about organizing a plant here in central New York, where big industry and big unions have long worked together at places like the Crucible Steel Company, the Anheuser-Busch brewery and the Carrier Corporation air-conditioning equipment plant.
Yet the idea of voting in a union still seems to scare some of the workers at Landis, most of whom are women, and many of those single mothers. Several said they were a job or two away from fast-food work, which pays much less than the $7 to $9 an hour that is a typical wage in this plant.
Random and unsupervised interviews inside and outside the plant today revealed some distinct support for a union, some adamant hatred of the very idea, and a lot of wariness in between. "This is a particularly vulnerable group of people, or at least, they feel vulnerable," said Robert J. Rabin, a law professor who follows labor law issues at Syracuse University. "They feel terribly uncertain about their place in the economy, and Landis is a newcomer -- they have facilities in other states -- and I think people are afraid that if Landis is unhappy with the outcome, it could pick up and move."
Tenille Terranova, 21, who makes $9.70 an hour stacking and inspecting yogurt cups that tumble from a machine, could be one of the women Mr. Rabin had in mind. "If there was an election right now? I think I'd vote no, personally," she said. "I don't really see where we need a union, and there seems to be a lot of trouble around them."
Trouble is what Ms. Saumier got in buckets when the optical shop she was working for closed and she got a job at the Landis plant in April 1995, six months after it opened.
A 36-year old single mother of two, she began attending organizing meetings held by the United Steelworkers of America so she could raise her complaints about unsafe working conditions around the big, chugging machines, and about undependable worker compensation payments.
With the union's help, Ms. Saumier obtained Landis's workplace injury reports and discovered that the company was one of the most accident-prone in the region, with four workers losing their fingers or parts of fingers in one 13-month period. She also found that the family-owned company, based in Chicago Ridge, Ill., was underreporting its injury rate to the New York State Workers' Compensation Board and to the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
In late 1996, the Workers Compensation Board fined Landis $48,000, which it paid, for failure to report on-the-job injuries, and in January 1997, OSHA imposed one of its heaviest fines ever, $720,700, on the plant for deliberately underreporting the number and severity of injuries there. Landis is contesting the Federal fine.
Although they disputed the severity of their safety record at the time, Steve Ellis, the plant's manager, conceded today that accidents had gone unreported, and that a large investment in safety equipment made last year was badly needed. And in a speech to company employees on Friday, Greg Landis, the company's chief operating officer, told the plant's 250 workers to accept Ms. Saumier's return.
"Everybody is to be treated equally, with dignity and respect," Mr. Landis said, according to an abbreviated version of his talk released by the company. "Whatever your feelings may be about Kathy, leave 'em outside."
Whatever the workers think of Ms. Saumier and her return, their ideas about forming a union at Landis seems to have more to do with their own experiences and struggles in life.
Evelyn Davis, for example, said she did not mind Landis's practice of imposing penalty points for tardiness that, if accumulated, can lead to dismissal. "I think it's good that they just give you points," Ms. Davis said, "because you have a chance to work them off if you're not late for a while."
Ms. Davis, 28 and with a young son to care for, said she had worked at a linen service that docked her pay 15 minutes in wages for every 5 minutes she was late.
Besides Ms. Saumier, a second worker, Clara Sullivan, who was dismissed on charges of racial and sexual harassment, was also returned to work today under the order. Judge Rosemary S. Pooler ordered the reinstatement of the two workers after the National Labor Relations Board filed 77 charges against Landis, accusing it of unfair labor practices involving the two workers and several others.
But Judge Pooler's ruling is only a preliminary one. An administrative law judge is expected to rule over the next few months on all 77 charges, including the charges involving the two women.
The Steelworkers have refused to hold a union vote at Landis until all 77 charges have been resolved. To do less, Jim Valenti, a senior union official, said, would be like letting the workers vote "while Greg Landis has a gun to their head."
As for being a symbol of labor, Ms. Saumier just shakes her head.
"I don't know how I got that," she said at last, smiling. "I never asked for it. I just got ticked off."

HEADLINE: Some Black Americans Find Only a Chill in South Africa

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, April 6

 BODY:
Charles T. Moses, raised in New York City and once Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's adviser for black affairs, lives these days in the northern suburbs of Johannesburg, eager to make a contribution to the new South Africa.
With a master's degree in business administration, Mr. Moses says, he has skills to offer a country that has too few educated blacks and which -- since voting in its first black government in 1994 -- has suffered a huge brain drain caused by fleeing whites. 
 But like many African-Americans who come here, some with an almost missionary zeal, he has not always been received with open arms by black South Africans. For Mr. Moses, a recent Op-Ed article in an influential Johannesburg newspaper suggesting that black Americans were taking jobs that would otherwise go to black South Africans was the last straw.
"While black South Africans say African-Americans leave something to be desired, some African-Americans can offer similar comments," Mr. Moses wrote in The Sunday Independent, which published the article to which he was responding. "Many of us have been lied to, misled and abused by our South African brothers and sisters, usually out of jealously and ignorance."
While President Clinton's recent trip to Africa was aimed at focusing the world's attention on this continent, many black Americans turned their attention here long ago and in recent years have come to South Africa in the hope of helping to build a prosperous black nation.
After Mr. Moses' article, South Africa's Oprah Winfrey, Felicia Mabuza-Suttle, devoted two one-hour programs to the subject of tensions between black South Africans and black Americans, putting a spotlight on difficulties that have largely, until recently, just been whispered about.
The South Africans on her show, an academic and two business executives, pulled no punches. The Americans, they said, were patronizing, socialized among themselves and believed they were owed something because of their efforts to support anti-apartheid boycotts.
One of the panelists was Makaziwe Mandela, President Nelson Mandela's daughter and an executive with the state-owned rail company.
Despite the public airing of tensions, the topic remains sensitive and South Africans and Americans are reluctant to be quoted on the subject. But one South African executive involved in helping American companies settle here said that at least one company she knows of has decided not to send African-Americans here anymore.
"A lot of the black Americans come here expecting to find their brothers and sisters," the executive said. "But they don't share a common language or culture or background. All they share is their black skin."
Moreover, she said, "a lot of South Africans see the black Americans as false affirmative action and there is some resentment for companies that do it."
The tension is particularly heartbreaking for Americans like Mr. Moses, who say they came here with the best of intentions.
"We are here to help if we can," he said. "We want them to succeed. It's a vicarious pleasure thing."
Though there are no accurate statistics, most experts estimate that about 1,000 black Americans are working here. Many have come as representatives of the 300 American companies that have established footholds here. But others come to work for nonprofit groups or as freelancers.
For many the experience is also a way of getting away from the difficulties of being black in America.
Junette Pinkney, a former producer for "The Phil Donahue Show" who came here six months ago to do freelance work, said that being in a country where most people are black has been wonderful.
"There is an enormous psychic relief," Ms. Pinkney said. "The American dream never got to be real for me and I'm one of the successful ones. Here, I feel there's the possibility of becoming truly part of this society, of being at home in a way that America will never be home."
Many black Americans do have positive experiences. And in many cases, their color is seen as an asset. One panelist on Mrs. Mabuza-Suttle's program acknowledged that despite his anger at African-Americans he would still rather do business with them than with American whites -- who are also seen as aggressive and insensitive. But the panelist, Peter Luvuyo Ntshona, an executive for Iscor, a major steel producer, said that many black Americans came here with an offensive attitude.
"There is always a paternalism, a sense that we can show you the way," he said. "Now we have a nation and we want them to treat us with dignity, respect and equality."
Too often, he said, the Americans talk about making a sacrifice by coming to what they call a developing country. Mr. Ntshona calls that ludicrous, since most of them live in the fanciest white neighborhoods and have maids and pools.
"They have a wonderful life here," he said. "They are not suffering."
One problem, say some Americans who have been here many years, is that after the 1994 election African-Americans came to South Africa eager to do business. Four years later, many of the projects they touted have not materialized.
"When they didn't happen, people got disappointed and they said African-Americans are all talk," said Julia Wilson, an African-American who moved here in 1994 and started a business, Wilson Global Marketing. One of the services she offers is telling American companies how to behave if they want to succeed.
Mzimkulu Malunga, an editor at The Financial Mail, a weekly business magazine, says black Americans are seen as wanting black South African partners to pave their way into the market here, only to dump them later. White Americans, said Mr. Malunga, might do the same thing. "But at least they don't come here claiming they are home."
In fact, the bond that many black Americans feel with Africa is a source of tension. Ms. Wilson said recently she found herself sitting with a group of South African friends watching a black American entertainer performing in South Africa. The South Africans began betting on exactly when the entertainer would get tears in her eyes and say, "Oh, I'm home, I'm home."
Ms. Wilson says she started to laugh.
"I could see how to them it looks so strange," Ms. Wilson said. "They say: 'But you have no family here. You have nobody waiting for you here. You know nothing about the culture. What are you talking about?' But the Americans are serious. They really do feel like they are home."
Ms. Wilson says that being black can be an asset if you are willing to listen and learn. But she has seen some Americans leave totally crushed. One friend she said cut his two-year contract short after nine months. "He was practically in tears," Ms. Wilson said. "He said,'If a black man cannot be accepted here, where can he go?' "
One especially sensitive point of contention is just how much credit the Americans deserve for bringing apartheid to an end. Mrs. Mabuza-Suttle interspersed her television program with taped interviews with some prominent black Americans, including one with the Rev. Leon Sullivan, who described with obvious pride his role in combating apartheid. Mr. Sullivan devised a set of principles in 1977 for American companies doing business in South Africa; in 1987 he called for corporate withdrawal and disinvestment.
When the tape had finished, a clearly agitated Ms. Mandela said she wanted to make it clear that it was not Americans who were responsible for the end of apartheid, but the children of Soweto who had died in countless demonstrations. The audience, made up largely of South Africans, cheered.
Another criticism of Americans is that while they may be here now, they have no real stake in the success of the country. On Mrs. Mabuza-Suttle's show, Dr. William Makgoba, a professor at Witwatersrand University, argued that Americans needed to leave South Africans alone to decide the future of the country because the South Africans were there for the long haul.
But many of the Americans say that the success of the new South Africa is actually a long-term commitment for them too.
"Where is the hope for us in America?" Mr. Moses said. "We will never be in charge. We will always be 10 percent. We will always be fighting to keep some cop from shooting us in the back. But here it's worth the battle. You can win this here."

HEADLINE: After a Good Day, the Nikkei Retreats

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, April 7

 BODY:
Stock prices here fell moderately early today, as many investors displayed caution ahead of an important economic meeting to be headed by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Friday.
Despite Wall Street's record closing, the benchmark Nikkei stock average of 225 issues fell 65.83 points, or 0.42 percent, to 15,640.16 points in the first hour of trading. On Monday, the Nikkei index gained 188.21 points, or 1.21 percent, in reaction both to last week's sharp declines and to the latest indications of possible tax cuts to help the economy. Some investors were cheered by a promise by lawmakers of a $118 billion package of spending programs and tax cuts to shore up the battered economy. 
 Over the weekend, governing party officials promised the package would include $59 billion of real spending on public construction projects, the biggest outlay ever in a Government economic stimulus plan. They also called for income tax cuts.
Japan has been under criticism by the United States and other trade partners for failing to stimulate its economy.
Investors also remain worried about the ailing economy and want assurances that the Government will follow through on its promises to help growth.
Traders attributed Monday's rise largely to a technical rebound after the Nikkei average had lost more than 1,000 points since April 1. The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues on the exchange's first section was down 4.97 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,193.84. It rose 14.91 points, or 1.26 percent, on Monday.

Citicorp and Travelers Plan Biggest Merger Ever
Citicorp and Travelers Group, two of America's biggest companies, agreed to a $70 billion merger, the largest in history.
The deal, which would create the world's largest financial services concern, is remarkable for its brashness. Given the nation's ample regulatory curbs on how actively banks can sell insurance and the law separating commercial and investment banking, the proposed merger challenges regulators and lawmakers to end these restrictions, scuttle the deal or force the merged company to scale back.

HEADLINE: SHAPING A COLOSSUS: THE REGULATORS;
Financial Services Heavyweights Try Do-It-Yourself Deregulation

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
For two decades Washington has tried and failed to update the Depression-era laws governing the rapidly changing financial services industry. Today the industry took matters into its own hands.
In going ahead with a merger despite the current ban on combinations between banks and insurers, Citicorp and Travelers Group are gambling that they can use their political muscle and the sheer weight of the marketplace to break down the longstanding barriers that have impeded but not completely stopped the creation of vast financial supermarkets. 
 Congress came very close to moving ahead on the necessary legislation just last week. But the Republican leadership in the House pulled the bill at the last minute when it became clear that it would once again fall victim to the Byzantine politics that has afflicted similar efforts since 1979, when Congress first began trying to update the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act and the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act, the main laws separating banks, Wall Street and insurance.
The House is scheduled to take up a modified version of the bill again in early May. Whether it can pass -- or whether Citicorp and Travelers can find ways to make their merger work even in the absence of new legislation -- were hotly debated topics today. But it was clear that their announcement, if nothing else, was forcing Washington to confront the issue anew.
And this time, analysts warned, a failure to set clear ground rules -- whether or not they would allow the Citicorp-Travelers deal to go through -- would hurt the American financial services business in its effort to compete around the world.
Indeed, Washington's stalling has been rewarded by a flow of campaign contributions from all the interest groups affected by the legislation. That has left Congress looking narrow minded at a time of rapid change in the marketplace.
"This transaction places tremendous pressure on Congress to pass some kind of legislation this session," said Peter Wallison, a lawyer at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who was general counsel of the Treasury Department during the Reagan Administration. "I don't think that will happen because there are still very major issues for Congress to resolve."
Banks and securities firms have been merging at a faster pace in recent years under new, more liberal rules set out by the Federal Reserve, the main regulator of bank holding companies. Banks have also won new authority to get into selling insurance -- although not, generally, the right to underwrite insurance -- in a series of decisions from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is principally responsible for regulating the operations of national banks.
Citicorp itself, through a loophole that long ago was closed for others, has the right to underwrite life insurance through a subsidiary in Delaware. Some analysts said today that the provision could be one way for the merged companies to make an end run around Washington if Congress does not change the main banking legislation. Another way might be for Citicorp to abandon its banking charter, relying on Travelers' existing savings and loan operations to handle all its banking while conducting insurance and brokerage work through other subsidiaries.
But both companies clearly hope that the problem will be solved by the type of legislation that is currently languishing in the House, which would generally allow banks and insurers to own each other. Citicorp helped kill the version of the bill that came before the House last week, although it said that it supports the general concept of modernizing the law. Travelers supported the bill.
"We think the odds are very strong that the laws are going to change," John M. Morris, the spokesman for Citicorp, said.
Breaking the legislative deadlock will require considerable work. The process has long been hampered by a regulatory rivalry between the Federal Reserve, which would like to keep control over how the financial services industry is reshaped, and the Comptroller of the Currency, which has granted banks under its purview considerable freedom to get into new lines of business.
Moreover, while failure to act has left Congress somewhat red-faced, the deadlock has in many ways been good for those legislators on the committees that oversee financial services. With banks, securities firms and insurers all battling over how to rewrite the rules of the game -- and looking to deny any advantage to their current and future rivals -- members of Congress have seen their campaign coffers swell from a constant flow of money from companies and lobbying groups.
Citicorp and Travelers began making their case in Washington even before announcing the deal publicly. The two chairmen, John S. Reed of Citicorp and Sanford I. Weill of Travelers, met last week with Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and also put in a courtesy call to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. And they notified President Clinton of the deal Sunday night.
Aiding Citicorp and Travelers on Capitol Hill is a veritable army of lobbyists and lawyers on their payrolls. Citicorp's lobbying presence is one of the largest among banks, with a multimillion-dollar operation that employs 15 in-house lawyers along with 7 different law and consulting firms. Citicorp paid $4.1 million in lobbying expenses in the first half of 1997, the most recent figures available.
Citicorp also has a corporate political action committee that raised $784,000 in 1996 and 1997 for campaign contributions and, by the end of 1997, had only $68,000 left.
In lobbying, Travelers spent a total of $629,000 and Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Travelers, spent $780,000 for a total of $1.4 million during the first half of 1997. And last year, Travelers alone made $239,000 in campaign contributions, with donations to many banking and commerce committee members, while Salomon's donations from its political action committee totaled $192,000.
The Glass-Steagall law was passed during the Depression as a way of trying to keep the problems on Wall Street from infecting the banking industry and thereby exacerbating the nation's economic woes. Congress applied the same principle to insurance companies two decades later, leaving banking, securities and insurance separated by barriers that have been eroded but never removed.
As long as the legislative prohibition on banks and insurers owning each other remains in place, the Federal Reserve would have no choice but to condition any approval of the merger on Travelers' divesting itself of its insurance businesses, which accounted for 47 percent of its operating profits last year.
But the two companies have some time to maneuver. They said they would have at least two years -- and up to five if the Fed grants them extensions -- in which they could push for a legislative change before they would be forced to sell the businesses.
It is still too soon to handicap the prospects for any banking bill to pass the House next month. Even if a bill did pass, it is not certain the Senate would have the time or the inclination to take it up this year.
Although it would be difficult for the Senate to act, it might do so if banks and insurance companies came together to support a single approach, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said today. Mr. D'Amato has previously been reluctant to take up the bill, fearful of becoming bogged down in the same political swamp that has slowed the bill in the House.
"This merger demonstrates that we really should move forward despite the intransigence or opposition of some in the financial services industry to creating a level playing field," Mr. D'Amato said.
Representative James A. Leach, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, said, "This merger underscores the need for prompt Congressional action on financial services modernization legislation to insure that America's competitive position abroad is enhanced, with proper functional regulation at home."
Although there are also restrictions on combinations between banks and securities firms, Citicorp and Travelers should be able to take advantage of the same regulation that has allowed a wave of deals between banks and brokerage houses in recent years.

HEADLINE: SHAPING A COLOSSUS: THE HISTORY;
An Evolution of Pre-Victorian Pin Stripes to One Big Red Umbrella

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
They are two of the most venerable names in American capitalism, but Citicorp and Travelers Group have taken decidedly different paths to the pinnacle of the financial services business.
Citicorp first opened its doors at 52 Wall Street as the City Bank of New York on Sept. 14, 1812, only months after the War of 1812 had begun. It has had only one significant merger in its 186-year history, when it joined forces with the First National Bank in 1955. 
 In contrast, Travelers Group, which was not born until late 1993, would be a mere speck on the corporate landscape if not for mergers.
If Citicorp, today the nation's second-largest bank holding company behind Chase Manhattan, is a byproduct of nearly two centuries of American and world economic history, Travelers is the work-in-progress of Sanford I. Weill, the Wall Street executive who since 1986 has transformed a string of ailing financial companies into powerhouses.
Since its creation, Citicorp has profited from booms and has been the leader among American banks in overseas expansion. It has generated a slew of product innovations, from traveler's checks (introduced in 1904) to credit cards for the middle class (the Everything card, introduced in 1967). In 1929 it became the first bank to open a personal loan department, establishing ties to less-than-affluent retail customers that are a critical element of its success and reach.
But the bank is no stranger to adversity.
Citicorp, which adopted its current name in 1974, has endured market panics, two World Wars, the Depression and, more recently, two financial events that nearly brought the franchise to its knees in the early 1990's: the Latin America debt crisis and a mountain of bad loans in commercial real estate.
Once the world's biggest commercial bank, Citicorp faced financial problems so severe that on Oct. 15, 1991, it suspended dividend payments on its stock for the first time. When the payments were resumed, in April 1994, the bad loans written off and the strategy of Citicorp's chairman, John S. Reed, to mine retail banking around the world firmly in place, the company was well on the road to recovery.
At its nadir in the early 1990's, Citicorp stock could be bought for $8.50 a share. The shares closed at $142.875 last Friday, before soaring $37.625 yesterday, to $180.50.
"Back then, nobody would have dreamed that John Reed would be presiding over the largest merger in history," said Ron Chernow, the author of several books about the financial industry, including "The House of Morgan."
Mr. Reed is the seventh chairman of Citicorp, a position that did not exist before 1909, when the legendary James Stillman, banker and confidant of William Rockefeller, the president of Standard Oil of New York, assumed the post.
Travelers Group has had only one chairman, Mr. Weill.
Before December 1993, when the current Travelers took shape through his acquisition of the insurer by that name, Mr. Weill was the chairman of a decidedly less august-sounding enterprise, the Primerica Corporation.
Primerica then consisted of the Commercial Credit Corporation, an ailing consumer-loan business Mr. Weill had bought in 1986 from the Control Data Corporation, and Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, the investment bank.
Mr. Weill would soon add to his brokerage holdings: in 1993, he bought Shearson, the firm he had built, back from American Express for $1.1 billion.
But rather than continue to operate under the Primerica name, once the acquisition of Travelers was complete Mr. Weill quickly adopted what he characterized then as "one of the most identifiable names in the financial markets."
The Travelers, as it was then known, was founded in 1864 by J. G. Batterson, a Connecticut businessman, and wrote its first insurance policy in a Hartford post office.
James E. Bolter, a local banker, accosted Mr. Batterson, asking what he would need to pay for accident insurance from the post office to his home, where he planned to have lunch.
Two cents, Mr. Batterson quickly replied, and tucked the money into his vest pocket. The two pennies are still in the company's possession at its Hartford headquarters.
In the years since, the company has underwritten more significant ventures and has long lived under one of the best-known logos in American business -- the umbrella it created in its advertising in 1870, only six years after the company had been established, to symbolize protection.
In 1897, the Travelers sold the first automobile policy. In 1919, it issued the first air travel policy, to President Woodrow Wilson. In the late 1960's it issued space accident insurance for the Apollo 11 astronauts in the first lunar landing.
The current Travelers red umbrella trademark made its debut 40 years ago this week at the Masters, the prestigious golf tournament the company still sponsors.
Citigroup, as the combination of Citicorp and Travelers is to be called, will be merely the latest addition under the umbrella.
In what was then his biggest transaction, Mr. Weill stunned the financial world last September when he acquired Salomon Inc., the parent of Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street powerhouse, for more than $9 billion in stock.
With the addition of Salomon, the financial press said that Travelers had entered an elite group of financial companies that included Merrill Lynch & Company, the American Express Company, a smattering of European and Japanese financial companies and Citicorp.
At the time, Mr. Weill said the Salomon deal was the culmination of a lifelong dream, to build what he called "a great financial services firm without parallel."
In retrospect, it seems clear his dream was not yet fulfilled.
"No other merger compares with this," Mr. Chernow said. "This creates a new paradigm."

Gambling Industry Spins From Red to Black

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
After posting a net loss of $257 million in 1996, the state's gambling industry was officially back in the black last year, with a net income of $6.4 million in 1997, the State Casino Control Commission announced yesterday.
Gaming analysts played down the significance of the net income figure; more indicative of the industry's health, they said, are gross operating profits, which rose to $886.7 million last year from $809.2 million in 1996. Mark Grossman, a spokesman for Bally's Park Place, which was the city's most profitable casino last year, attributed rising profits to improved efficiency and the opening of Wild Wild West, Atlantic City's first theme casino. 
 Larry Klatzkin, a gaming analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, predicted that profits would continue to rise. Marvin Roffman, an analyst with Roffman Miller Associates, was less optimistic. He said growth in the total revenue of $4.2 billion in 1997 did not keep pace with inflation.

IN LARGEST DEAL EVER, CITICORP PLANS MERGER WITH TRAVELERS GROUP

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Two of America's largest companies, Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc., agreed yesterday to a merger that would create the world's largest financial-services concern. Not since the freewheeling pre-Depression era would so many different financial businesses be corralled under one roof in this country.
The transaction was valued at $70 billion in stock when it was announced, making it the largest merger in history. Both companies' stock prices soared on the news, adding another $14 billion to the value of the transaction by the end of the day. 
 The deal is remarkable not only for its size but for its brashness as well. While banks like Citicorp and insurance and brokerage firms like Travelers have made substantial inroads into one another's businesses, there are still ample regulatory restrictions on how actively banks can sell products like insurance.
Just last week, a bill seeking to end laws dating back as far as the Depression that separate commercial and investment banking and limit the types of financial products that banks can offer was withdrawn in the House of Representatives. This proposed merger challenges regulators and lawmakers to either end these restrictions, scuttle the deal or force the merged company to cut back on what it offers the customer.
Whatever the outcome, the deal promises to ignite an intense legislative battle in Washington over the shape and future of financial services in America. It is also expected to speed the pace of merger activity across the financial landscape.
Competitors in Europe and Asia already have the ability to offer an array of banking and insurance products under one corporate umbrella. Now American companies are aggressively pushing for the same rights, in this case under the bright red umbrella that Travelers uses as its logo.
Travelers and Citicorp are betting that their profits and competitiveness would be enhanced by offering one-stop shopping for a broad range of services, from savings and checking accounts, credit cards, mortgages, stock and bond underwriting, homeowners, auto and life insurance, asset management, mergers and acquisitions advice, commercial loans, and derivative securities and foreign exchange trading.
Citicorp's chief executive, John S. Reed, and Travelers' chief executive, Sanford I. Weill, would jointly run the new company, to be called Citigroup Inc. "Frankly, we're probably talking about a restructuring of the financial services industry," Mr. Reed said of the agreement.
But it is not quite that simple. The transaction would have to negotiate a maze of regulations governing the banking industry that were put in place precisely to prevent the creation of the type of company Travelers and Citicorp now aim to put together. Those laws were enacted in response to public concerns about unfettered financial power and the economic consequences when such giants collapse.
Assuming that legal barriers are overcome -- Mr. Reed and Mr. Weill said they believed that Federal Reserve officials were kindly disposed toward the transaction but regulators at the Comptroller of the Currency still have to weigh in -- there are other sizable hurdles the merged company would face. Chief among those is the challenge of running a global company that would have revenues of about $50 billion, assets of $700 billion and a market capitalization of more than $140 billion.
The new company would vault ahead of other global financial giants, including Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. and Deutsche Bank A.G., both of which already offer the menu of financial products that Citicorp and Travelers are trying to put together. The size of the deal would easily eclipse the largest merger agreement to date, Worldcom's bid to acquire MCI Communications for $37 billion.
The merger of Citicorp and Travelers "creates a big firm but they still have to do something with what they've got," said Peter Davis, a financial services consultant with Booz Allen & Hamilton. "The challenge is managing a financial service conglomerate, adding on new retail distribution and expanding investment banking internationally."
The transaction would also combine two companies with very different cultures and chief executives. Although Citicorp is much more aggressive than some of its peers, it still tends to fit the profile of a cautious buttoned-down bank. Travelers, by contrast, is marked by the entrepreneurial style of its chief executive.
As recently as the early 1990's, Citicorp, currently the nation's second-largest bank after the Chase Manhattan Corporation, was teetering on the brink of insolvency as piles of bad real estate and Latin American loans threatened to swamp the company.
Citicorp, and other big banks caught in the same perilous position, pulled through the crisis largely because of a generous interest-rate environment engineered by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. Mr. Greenspan kept interest rates unusually low, allowing banks to borrow money cheaply and lend at higher rates while they worked to get rid of bad loans.
Citicorp eventually recovered and by the mid-1990's it had emerged as one of the most competitive and profitable banks in the country. The 59-year-old Mr. Reed, as able a corporate survivor as there is among prominent chief executives, managed to keep the bank's board in his corner by never permitting a strong No. 2 to stay very long at Citicorp.
Under Mr. Reed's direction, Citicorp in recent years has emphasized its global consumer business, which includes such things as credit cards and savings accounts, while decreasing the bank's involvement in domestic wholesale businesses like corporate lending. Overseas, however, Citicorp still focuses its energies on corporate lending, because the bank has a competitive advantage in many emerging markets. In 1997, Citicorp had profits of $3.6 billion on revenue of $23.3 billion
For Mr. Weill, a dapper, thick-set executive who, at 65, keeps in shape riding a knobby-tired bicycle through the woods of his weekend home in upstate New York, the deal capped nearly 40 years of scrappy, Wall Street deal-making. He has built a huge personal fortune, but he has talked for years not only of making money but also of building a company with worldwide impact. He took a step in that direction last September with the purchase of Salomon Brothers for $9 billion.
Last year, with Salomon under its wing for the final quarter, Travelers reported net income of $3.1 billion on $27.1 billion in revenues.
More than half of Travelers' revenue comes from consumer finance, individual investments, investment banking and bond underwriting and trading. It sells life insurance and annuities through two subsidiaries, including Primerica Financial Services, which specializes in term or basic insurance without investment features. Travelers is the sixth-largest property and casualty insurer in the country, selling auto, homeowners and commercial coverage, with $8.6 billion in premiums last year.
By adding Salomon Brothers to its Smith Barney brokerage and investment banking arm, Travelers became the third-biggest stock underwriter in the United States and the fourth biggest in the world. It also moved into first place in underwriting municipal bonds, and second in overall underwriting of American and international debt offerings.
Mr. Reed and Mr. Weill first discussed a merger on Feb. 25, during the Business Council's annual economics and public policy conference of the nation's top corporate chieftains. At a dinner that evening in Washington, Mr. Weill invited Mr. Reed to his hotel room at the Park Hyatt. When Mr. Reed arrived, Mr. Weill, known on Wall Street as something of a deal maven, made a marriage proposal.
"Gee, I didn't think that was what you were going to talk to me about," Mr. Weill recalled Mr. Reed as saying. Mr. Reed, who has had a longstanding aversion to the investment banking business, said that the logic of the deal was compelling enough for him to put his reservations aside. Mr. Weill was less successful last year when he approached J. P. Morgan & Company about a merger and was rebuffed.
Oddly enough, in 1996 Mr. Reed negotiated with but decided against completing a merger with Mr. Weill's old employer, the American Express Company, because of power-sharing problems with that company's chief executive, Harvey Golub. Even Mr. Weill, during his American Express days, was once considered anathema at Citicorp, having been portrayed as a feared competitor in an in-house video made years ago at Citicorp.
But Mr. Reed and Mr. Weill have a friendship spanning three decades and both men said they believed that they could make their unusual corporate relationship work if the merger was completed.
Although analysts have been concerned about Citicorp's continued exposure to economic turmoil in Southeast Asia, Mr. Weill was briefed on the bank's prospects there and said he was not concerned that he was taking on any undue risk by merging with the company. Indeed, he said Citicorp's broad international presence, almost unmatched among American banks, was attractive to Travelers, which has been looking for ways to expand abroad. As for Travelers, it offers Citicorp a way to build on its securities and insurance offerings.
Investors appeared to share the executives' favorable assessment; the stock of Citicorp soared yesterday, rising $37.625 to close at $180.50. Travelers stock rose $11.3125, to $73.
With its suggestion that regulatory barriers might be forced down, yesterday's transaction resounded like a starter's pistol to some analysts, signaling the beginning of a great race for the country's insurance companies. "Most life and annuities companies are now candidates for takeover or merger," said Andrew Kligerman, an analyst at Schroder & Company.
Some of the largest insurers, like American International Group Inc., might seek to acquire banks, analysts said. But most said that banks, with far greater assets, were likely to be the more powerful shoppers. The banking industry has already undergone a wave of consolidation in the last few years.
The prospective merger partners proved to be politically astute, quietly lobbying banking regulators and government officials for their tacit support before they announced the deal. This included a conversation by Mr. Weill and Mr. Reed with President Clinton on Sunday night to brief him on the transaction. And Mr. Weill and Mr. Reed kept their negotiations largely between themselves, their boards and regulators, helping to keep the transaction a secret until yesterday's announcement. No investment bankers were retained.
Big job cuts are not expected to be part of the merger, although there will undoubtedly be a serious winnowing of senior management ranks at the combined company. The transaction will be effected through a merger of Citicorp into Travelers, and Travelers plans to apply to the Federal Reserve to become a bank holding company.
Under the Bank Holding Company Act, enacted in the 1950's, all existing businesses, including insurance, can be retained and operated by the combined company for two years, a period that can then be extended by the Federal Reserve for three additional one-year periods. Citicorp and Travelers said they plan to reassess their options once that five-year dispensation ends, but in the meantime they will undoubtedly push hard to change existing laws.
Although Citicorp cannot offer property or casualty insurance, it already has the right to offer life insurance and annuities because of a legal loophole it took advantage of in the late 1980's when the Bank Holding Company Act was briefly amended. The amendment allowed banks to establish separate insurance subsidiaries offering such products. Lawmakers closed that loophole in the early 1990's.
Congress has so far been unable to overhaul the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law separating commercial and investment banking, but bank regulators have moved independently over the last decade to erode the act's limitations.
Analysts said life insurance companies would now be the prized targets of banks on the prowl. Life insurance policies are often seen as a means of saving, and many banks now sell mutual funds that are similar to the variable annuities sold by life insurers.
To be sure, many insurers are likely to prize their independence more than the opportunity for potentially higher earnings as a subordinate unit of a bank. But Steve Hilbert, the chief executive of Conseco, one of the nation's largest publicly traded life and health insurance companies, said that his hat was off to Mr. Reed and Mr. Weill for breaking new ground.
"It's absolutely fabulous," Mr. Hilbert said. "Companies that thrive going forward are going to have to deal in several sectors like insurance, consumer finance and banking."

HEADLINE: The Skies Are Getting Friendlier for the Rest

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I read Robert B. Reich's remarks on air travel (Op-Ed, April 5) while flying coach from San Jose to Chicago aboard an old 727. As in so many older planes, the seating was cramped, as compared with newer planes like the Boeing 777, which seems to have greater legroom and wider seats. Service and food in coach is getting better, not worse. 
 Mr. Reich implies that as airlines add more first-class seats, accommodations in economy class grow more cramped. In reality, it just means that there are fewer economy seats on the plane, which is hardly a problem when nearly every airline on average carries less than 70 percent of its passenger capacity.
The airline industry is finally profitable, after disastrous years in the early 1990's. As the airlines improve service in first class, they are able to charge more and sell the marginal seat space in economy for less. Indeed, according to Clifford Winston of the Brookings Institution, deregulation has saved passengers about $12.4 billion annually.
That's a long way from the regulated era when airlines offered only one class of service -- first class -- and the Civil Aeronautics Board regulated the thickness of sandwiches on board aircraft to prevent competition.

HEADLINE: 9,000 Job Cuts To Save Xerox $1 Billion

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation, citing the need to compete against more efficient rivals, announced yesterday that it would eliminate about 9,000 jobs, or nearly 10 percent of its worldwide work force, over the next two to three years.
About half the cuts will be in the United States. While only a handful are expected to come at the company's headquarters in Stamford, Conn., about 1,400 will be in Rochester, where the Eastman Kodak Company, the area's biggest employer, is already cutting more than 6,000 jobs. 
 Xerox said the cuts, combined with a program to consolidate accounting, service and other support functions in Europe, would save the company $1 billion annually. G. Richard Thoman, Xerox's president, said at least half the savings would be used to improve the sales, marketing and other functions aimed at increasing revenues.
"We haven't had solid double-digit sales growth since the mid-1980's, and that's what we want now," Mr. Thoman said. "And you can't grow fast without being efficient enough to have flexible pricing and advertising."
Political leaders in Rochester, and in Stamford, where Xerox has 500 employees, seemed to buy that argument. "Xerox needs to maintain its international competitive edge, and if that means we lose some jobs, we understand that," said Mayor Dannel P. Malloy of Stamford, who noted that Stamford's unemployment rate is only about 3 percent.
The ax falls heavier on Rochester, of course, where Xerox and Kodak together account for 10 percent of the city's jobs, and where unemployment is closer to 5 percent. Few people there doubted that Kodak, whose profits have been plummeting, had to cut back. Xerox, in contrast, is having a strong year.
"There's kind of a bewilderment around here," Eugene Fram, a marketing professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, said. "Everyone is asking, 'If things are going well, why do they need to do this?' "
Still, since The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle first reported two weeks ago that cuts were expected, there had been speculation that several thousand jobs might be lost in Rochester, making the actual number almost a relief.
"There's no rejoicing when you hear people will lose their jobs, but this could have been a lot worse," Mayor William A. Johnson Jr. of Rochester said.
Mr. Thoman flew to Rochester to personally announce the cuts yesterday. Mr. Johnson said that he had a 6:30 A.M. meeting with local Xerox executives in which he was briefed before the announcement was made.
"I realize Xerox did what they had to do to survive in an eat or be eaten environment," Mr. Johnson said.
Xerox stock had been steadily rising since the first reports of the company's expected job cuts, but closed yesterday at $106.8125, down $1.3125.
Slow revenue growth will continue to be an issue, "but they are doing the heroic things you need to do to get into the double digits," Peter J. Enderlin, an analyst with the First Albany Corporation, said. Indeed, many analysts scrambled after the announcement to increase already upbeat predictions of how Xerox's earnings and stock price would perform.
"A billion dollars is a huge chunk of change," B. Alexander Henderson of Prudential Securities Research said.
Jack L. Kelly of Goldman, Sachs added, "There's a real paradigm shift here, from an engineering-driven company to one that really knows how to rip out infrastructure to get costs down."
The vast majority of the cuts will come out of the sales and general administration ranks. Although Xerox's profits have risen, the company's expenses in these areas have been rather high, amounting to 28.8 percent of revenues last year.
That was less of a problem when Xerox was sticking to high-ticket analog copiers that it sold directly to corporate customers. But digital technology continues to blur the line between computer printers and copiers, and Xerox continues to push into lower-priced, lower-margin products that are sold through retail outlets. Thus, Xerox now must compete with highly efficient concerns like the Hewlett-Packard Company, where sales and general administration expenses are much lower.
"We're where they want to be, and they have a long ways to go before they catch up," Lawrence Tomlinson, Hewlett-Packard's treasurer, said. Mr. Thoman readily concedes the point. "We know our costs are higher than the companies we now compete with," he said.
Xerox said the reorganization would drive its sales and general administration costs to the low 20's as a percentage of sales over time, a move that analysts said was essential. "The idea is to make Xerox more lean and mean so it can compete effectively down the road," Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said.
In cutting costs during profitable times, Xerox is following a precedent set by no less a profit machine than the General Electric Company. When John F. Welch Jr. became G.E.'s chief executive in 1981, G.E. had 404,000 employees, generating some $27 billion in revenues. The company was hugely profitable, yet Mr. Welch immediately began trimming jobs. "He felt it was best to cut from a position of strength," a G.E. spokesman said. Last year, G.E.'s revenues topped $90.8 billion, yet it had only 276,000 employees.
Now some analysts suggest that reorganizations from a position of strength may become more common. "If the leading companies start cutting costs and restructuring, the No. 2 players can really never catch up," Mr. Henderson said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Level Surged in February

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
Borrowing by American consumers increased by more than double the expected amount in February on a surge in credit card debt, data released today by the Federal Reserve showed.
Borrowing rose by $7 billion for the month, to $1.244 trillion, after rising a revised $4.6 billion in January. Previously, the Fed said January borrowing had increased $2.9 billion. Before today's report, analysts had expected a rise of $3.3 billion in February. 
 The biggest component of the February increase was credit card debt, which rose to $3.9 billion from $2.1 billion in January.
Still, recent increases in consumer credit have been more subdued than just a few years ago, when they often ran into the double digits. Banks and other lenders have been less aggressive in extending credit to consumers after a surge in personal bankruptcies for which credit card debt was partly to blame.
Rising incomes and low interest rates, meanwhile, have allowed many consumers to pay cash for purchases, and consolidate or even retire existing debt.
"Banks are being more selective, and people are paying down debt," said Peter Kretzmer, an economist at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities in New York.
In addition, many people are using lower interest rate home equity loans to consolidate their debt, and that type of lending is not covered by the Federal Reserve's statistics because it is secured by real estate.
Banks, for example, have reported an increase of $13 billion in the volume of outstanding home equity loans the last year at the same time the volume of revolving consumer loans at banks has declined by about $18 billion, Mr. Kretzmer said.

HEADLINE: New U.S. Diplomat Tries to Speak Japan's Language

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 7

 BODY:
As everyone from President Clinton down hammers Japan these days to stimulate its economy, Thomas S. Foley is being a little bit more polite.
Mr. Foley, the former Speaker of the House who is the new American Ambassador to Japan, is conveying much the same message. But right now in Tokyo, his soft and diplomatic style may make him a more welcome envoy in the offices of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. 
 Mr. Foley lives in a luxurious mansion, catered to by a domestic staff of 13 -- not including his two Japanese bodyguards -- and enjoys the status and privilege of a minor deity in Tokyo. But even Mr. Foley, who at 6 feet 2 towers over his Japanese counterparts as he exhorts them on weighty issues like the economy, is careful not to drop the full weight of American pressure on the leaders here.
He knows himself what it is like to be put regularly in his place, especially by a small, elderly woman wearing a traditional kimono: his Japanese teacher.
"She has a very acute sense of what the proper Japanese form is," Mr. Foley said. "I'm looking for the shortest, quickest, easiest phrase, and she's, 'No, no, that's not really the best.' "
Mr. Foley is unlikely to be taken any time soon for a native Japanese speaker. But as he wrestles with beginning language classes, he also has an image to overcome as a longtime friend of Japan.
There was some grumbling in American business circles here, and even in the American Embassy, that Mr. Foley throughout his career had been too cozy with Japan and that he might not be tough enough.
His predecessor, Walter F. Mondale, was a tough negotiator, while some trade hard-liners worry that Mr. Foley may be a member of what is derisively referred to as the Chrysanthemum Club, meaning those who applaud Japan a bit too heartily.
They note that Mr. Foley has long been warmly regarded here, partly because of his roots in the Pacific Northwest, where trade with Japan is significant. He was only the fourth American ever to receive Japan's highest civilian honor, the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun, Paulownia Flowers, named after one of Japan's national flowers.
That is an awkward criticism to rebut, and for his part, Mr. Foley does not try to fight it by suggesting that he is unfriendly to Japan. Rather, he says he pays little attention -- and he has been dogged in his first few months in pushing American interests in Japan.
Indeed, since he arrived in November, Mr. Foley has cut ribbons at American trade shows, trudged through snow to offer remarks at a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet, eaten grilled salmon cooked in American styles and held breakfasts for local American business groups.
Mr. Foley has also tried to use his long friendship with Japanese officials to his advantage. As an American Congressman for 30 years, 5 as Speaker, Mr. Foley regularly visited Japan.
"He has been pretty visible," said Glen Fukushima, president of the American Chamber of Commerce of Japan and a former official in the Commerce Department. "He's built up a Rolodex of Japanese contacts over the years, especially in politics."
Yet Mr. Foley has been a bit less public than some other American officials in twisting Japanese arms to get Tokyo to stimulate its economy. In the last few months, Clinton Administration officials have been increasingly blunt in demanding that Japan take major steps to boost its economy to help Asia out of its financial crisis and avoid a global downturn.
Mr. Foley has argued the same case, but -- at least publicly -- with a bit less heat than some officials in Washington. Still, Mr. Foley met briefly today with Prime Minister Hashimoto, who plans to announce tax cuts on Wednesday. And he held a series of meetings at the Finance Ministry last December just a day or so before Mr. Hashimoto announced a surprise tax cut of nearly $16 billion. It seems that Mr. Foley leaned heavily on Japan to take such a step, but he is careful not to claim credit for determining Japanese economic policy.
"We're not pulling our punches," Mr. Foley said in an interview at his residence. "We're being frank and candid on the economic side. We can give our advice and recommend, but ultimately it's not a matter where we can determine the decision."
Some trade hard-liners have been concerned not just about Mr. Foley, but about the entire leadership of the embassy. The deputy chief of mission is Christopher J. LaFleur, the son-in-law of former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
While Mr. Foley did not criticize the relentless pressure that American officials put on Japan three years ago to open its market to American cars, he did suggest that excessive pressure was not always useful. He cited a complaint from a Japanese official, whom he did not identify, that Japan feels it is being bullied by foreign countries.
"I think people who believe in somehow pounding the table or raising the voice are sort of not in a context that's real either," Mr. Foley said.
In some ways, though, table-pounding is almost exactly what has been coming out of Washington recently. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin; the trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky; the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and Commerce Secretary William Daley have led the chorus of voices urging Japan to stimulate its economy and help pull the region out of its economic mess.
To an extent, the exhortations from Washington allow Mr. Foley to tone down his own discussions with Japanese officials here so they will not feel particularly bullied by all Americans. For some critics, Mr. Foley and his bosses in Washington appear to be performing a good cop, bad cop routine, but for others, results are what count, and the jury is still out.
"When he meets people here, he can be nice and soft," said Yoshio Murakami, executive editor of The Asahi Evening News, a leading English-language daily. "When he reports back home, he could be very, very American."

HEADLINE: Patchwork of School Financing Schemes Offers Few Answers and Much Conflict

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

DATELINE: SANTA FE

 BODY:
If there is anywhere where the struggle over school-financing disparities ought to be over by now, it is in New Mexico.
After all, New Mexico took drastic action back in the early 1970's, when the first round of lawsuits challenging school-financing systems got under way. To level the field between rich districts and poor ones, and avoid the mire of litigation, New Mexico limited the amount districts could spend on their own schools and made the state, rather than local property taxes, the main source of money to operate schools. 
So why, 25 years later, does the school in the fancy part of Santa Fe have a physical education teacher paid for by parents, while the school on the poor side of town has none? Why do the schools on the Zuni reservation have so little money for maintenance and repairs that they have had to lock up the swimming pool?
And how is it that Michael Davis, the State Superintendent of Education, and his staff still spend a third of their time defending -- and adjusting -- the school-financing formula?
"The fight over equity never goes away," Mr. Davis said. "And it never will. I'm very proud of our formula, which I think is the fairest in the nation. The state provides more than 90 percent of school operating funds, so we can give every child in New Mexico access to the same educational opportunities. But it's always going to be a work in progress."
There is no move afoot to abandon New Mexico's financing formula altogether -- and everyone seems to agree that the state's system is far closer to equitable than in the old days. And nationwide, most experts say, there has been real progress in reducing disparities.
But there is an increasing recognition that leveling the field financially is not the only issue, and that it is also important to concentrate on making sure that, even in poor states like New Mexico, each child gets a decent education.
If financial equity was the issue of the 70's and 80's, the issue of the 90's -- and the touchstone for much of the litigation now in the courts -- is the adequacy of the education the state offers children.
"I'm not sure equitable means much if there's not enough money to provide an adequate education," said Allan Odden, a school-financing expert at the University of Wisconsin. "I think maybe we've kind of dragged out our focus on equity long enough and are now shifting to something more substantive. New Mexico's a good example, and California's another one, that sets spending at the state level, and no one can go above that level, which is very low. So it's equal -- but there's not enough money."
School financing remains one of the knottiest problems of education, not just in New Mexico but throughout the nation. Most states have faced lawsuits over financial equity. But two decades of state supreme court rulings -- 18 of them striking down school-financing systems as unconstitutional -- have produced conflicting standards for determining the fairness of financing schemes.
And in many states, the school-financing battles are still raging, both in the courts and in local politics. It is an issue that will not go away, in part because education represents the largest single component of most state budgets.
"It is always, everywhere, an extraordinarily powerful political issue," said John G. Augenblick, a Denver education consultant who has been involved in many states' school-financing debates. "Not every legislator has a hospital or industry in his district, but everyone has a school district, and so everyone will fight endlessly over how much of the pie they should get."
There is tremendous variation in how states pay for their schools. In New Hampshire, where there is a strong tradition of local control and no statewide tax, 90 percent of the money comes from local property taxes -- but that will be changing due to a December court ruling declaring the system unconstitutional. Hawaii, at the other end of the spectrum, has a single school district, which gets 90 percent of its money from the state.
While there is tremendous variation from state to state, the trend since the 1970's has been for states, as in New Mexico, to assume a greater share of the responsibility for school financing -- and to impose some kind of ceiling on affluent districts' spending.
But within these more-equal systems, some schools and some districts are, as George Orwell would have it, more equal than others. In Santa Fe, for example, Partners in Education, a local nonprofit group, raises $300,000 a year, mostly for grants to teachers for art projects, field trips and a literary magazine.
Even within Santa Fe, there are differences. Many years ago, when the state cut the budget for physical education, parents at the Acequia Madre Elementary School on the city's east side, near where tourists come to stroll among art galleries and tasteful adobe houses, raised money to keep their teachers. But on the west side, home of trailer parks and storage warehouses, parents do not raise much money for the Agua Fria Elementary School, and there is no physical education teacher.
In some states, court challenges have led not just to school-finance reform but a whole new system of governance, academic expectations and accountability mechanisms. Kentucky was forced to revamp its school system completely: It increased per-pupil spending by 34 percent in the first three years of reform and, at the same time, rewarded schools that performed well and gave more power to schools.
Increasingly, education experts have been trying to codify just what it takes -- in terms of teachers, curriculum and expenditures -- to provide an adequate education.
And over the next decade, Mr. Odden and others said, educators, state budget officials and judges handling school-finance lawsuits will be increasingly developing standards of adequate education, and then thinking about how to make sure each school has the money to meet those standards, even in poorer states.
"It's a much broader question of school reform, rather than just looking at equity," Mr. Odden said. "It may also be a Federal issue, because if states like New Mexico don't have enough money, they may need extra Federal support. That's an issue that's going to have to be on the table."
The Federal Government, on average, provides 7 percent of each state's education finances. And there has been strong resistance whenever it has made any move to increase its involvement in what has always been a state function.
Legally, the idea that education is a Federal responsibility has been resoundingly rejected: In a 1973 Texas case, the Supreme Court ruled that education was not a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution. It was that decision that led to the onslaught of litigation challenging school-financing systems under state constitutions' requirement for "ample," "thorough," "efficient" or "adequate" public education.
In several states, school-financing litigation has become one of the constants on the docket: In New Jersey, Ohio, Texas and elsewhere, there have been generations of court rulings that toss the ball back to the legislature, only to have a revamped system face a new challenge back in the courts. But there is no consistency in the decisions, no single standard has emerged by which to guage how much equity is required, and how much has been achieved.
As has been apparent in New Mexico, it is never as simple as providing the same amount of money for each child, for there are profound differences in children's needs. For example, high school students cost more to educate than third graders; students in sparsely populated areas, who must be bused long distances, cannot be schooled as cheaply as those in cities where the economies of scale come into play. And students who are not native English speakers, or those with physical or mental disabilities, often need expensive special services.
The New Mexico formula has always recognized these differences, with a "rural isolation" factor, for students spread over the state's mountainous desert expanses and a density factor for poor urban children -- a factor that recently, after a court challenge, was converted into an "at-risk" factor for districts with a lot of poor, non-English-speaking children.
But because each district has unique needs, the push to adjust the formula never stops. Right now, the Santa Fe schools are seeking a cost-of-living factor, since teachers in the capital pay such high rents -- on average salaries of $28,000, well below the national average -- that in one recent survey, 8 in 10 teachers reported that they were thinking of leaving.
"The cost-of-living situation is so severe, we have teachers bail out midyear," said Aaron Trummer, the principal of Santa Fe High School, a 22-building campus spread over 90 hilly acres south of town.
This year, the Governor approved a $75,000 study on housing costs in the state, and how they affect teacher recruitment and retention.
Meanwhile, on the Arizona border, the Zuni School District wants more money for capital spending: since the whole district is on Indian land, Zuni has no tax base to finance building and maintenance. Zuni students, taken to Santa Fe in February to plead with legislators for more capital money, told of their school's gas leaks, leaking roofs, inadequate wiring and mildew smell. And in a hot, dry remote reservation with little organized recreation, a beautiful swimming pool in a building next to the middle school sits drained and locked, with no money for the repairs it would take to make it operable.
"We don't want to scrap the whole formula," said Marisa Sanchez, a first-grade teacher at the Dowa Yallane school, whose 14-year-old son, Eriq, testified in the capital. "That wouldn't be fair to anyone. But our children deserve the same kind of schools the kids in Santa Fe have, and the way the formula works, they're not getting it."

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
THE airlines' battle for on-time bragging rights, giving the carriers the right to boast in ads that they are No. 1 in flights arriving on schedule, may undergo some wrenching moments if the Department of Transportation follows the recommendation of its Office of Inspector General.
At stake are not just bragging rights but the competition for business travelers, who pay premium fares in the expectation of arriving on time. On-time performance, remember, is the most important factor in the J. D. Power & Associates evaluation of customer satisfaction among business travelers who average 25 round trips or more a year of 500 or more miles. 
 Following a recent audit, the Inspector General, Kenneth W. Mead, made two major recommendations last week: that the department define "arrival" as the opening of the aircraft's passenger door at the gate, and that the department disclose in its rankings whether the arrival times for each airline are recorded manually or by an automated system. Now the department must decide whether to accept the recommendations and turn them into enforceable regulations.
On time is currently defined as the arrival of an aircraft at "the gate or passenger loading area" no later than 15 minutes after the scheduled arrival time. But under that definition, Mr. Mead said, an aircraft could land within 15 minutes of its scheduled arrival yet be reported as late if it did not reach the gate in time. And, he added, the 10 reporting carriers (all the big airlines) currently use five different methods to report arrival: when the plane's parking brake is set, when the engines are shut off, when the blocks are placed behind aircraft wheels, when either the passenger or cargo doors are opened, and when the passenger door is opened.
The investigation was sparked by a complaint from an unnamed airline that two other unnamed carriers using the manual reporting system were submitting falsified arrival times for the purpose of scoring higher in the department's monthly rankings. The only large carriers using the manual system are Southwest, America West and Alaska Airlines, each of which has denied falsifying reports. But since Southwest is always among the top in on-time performance, as well as the carrier whose low fares often drive competitors to distraction, you can be sure Southwest was one of the targets of the auditors.
But after conducting unannounced observations of 372 arriving flights of the two unnamed carriers in January, the auditors said they "found no evidence that either carrier was submitting falsified data." But Mr. Mead added that while manual systems afforded greater leeway than automated systems, the Department of Transportation made no distinction among carriers using the different systems.
Continental Airlines wasted no time hailing the Inspector General's recommendations. It said that since 1996 it has excluded carriers that report manually when it calculates its own employee bonus plan -- $100 for each employee every month Continental ranks first in on-time arrival and $65 in months when it hits an 80 percent on-time rating, or ranks second or third.
 
For Train Travelers
Business and leisure travelers can both benefit from the recently published "Eurail and Train Travel Guide to Europe" (third edition) and "Eurail and Train Travel Guide to the World" (28th edition). Both books, edited by Gena Holle and recently published by Houghton Mifflin, contain fares, timetables and sightseeing notes for cities all over the world. Especially useful is the listing of international rail connections. The books cost $15 and $19, respectively.

HEADLINE: New Breed of College All-Star;
Columbia Pays Top Dollar for Economics Heavy Hitter

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
The University of Chicago's Sherwin Rosen has been chronicling the "Economics of Superstars" since the beginning of the 1980's. But even he was astounded to learn that Columbia University has just agreed to pay nearly $300,000 a year to lure Robert J. Barro, one of the nation's most distinguished economists, away from Harvard.
The kind of six-figure salary that Professor Barro, 53, will command at Columbia, while perhaps commonplace for economics Ph.D.'s on Wall Street and not unheard of for finance whizzes at major business schools (including Columbia's), is a record-breaker in the market for academic economists who work in more traditional fields like macroeconomics and trade theory. It exceeds by roughly $100,000 the most lucrative offers reported for leading university researchers just a year or two ago. And it is roughly twice the current salary caps for arts and sciences faculty at Harvard, Columbia and other elite universities. 
 "This is a big deal," said Claudia Goldin, a colleague of Professor Barro at Harvard. "It's broken the sound barrier."
An ex-New Yorker with attitude, Dr. Barro has exuded stardom since his graduate school days at Harvard in the late 1960's. He has changed the way economists think about everything from the long-run effects of government deficits to the forces that favor economic growth. A mainstream conservative with a libertarian streak who writes for The Wall Street Journal and Business Week, he has produced scholarly articles that are cited by other researchers as often as those of Paul Samuelson, Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas.
As the bidding for Professor Barro shows, the market for top economists is starting to look like those for movie stars, basketball players and bond traders. It carries all the trappings, too -- complex negotiations, signing bonuses and highly organized raids. And the forces that have turned top economists into what the Columbia provost, Jonathan R. Cole, ruefully calls "free agents without salary caps" are not all that different: lots of customers (rising enrollments), lots of cash in a few pockets (swelling tuition payments and endowments at elite institutions) and a tight consensus on who the most valuable players are.
Add to that the growing feeling among a number of institutions of higher learning that as one academic put it, "If you don't have a good economics department, you can't have a great university."
The focus on money has moved into the uppermost tier of schools, which have traditionally counted mostly on their reputations to lure talent. "At the top schools, there's been a reluctance to play the game, to think that we can score a tremendous coup if we pay a lot for X," said Peter Kenen, an economist at Princeton University who was chairman of Columbia's economics department in the 1960's. "But the pressure to push against salary caps and exceed them is getting stronger and stronger."
In making its dramatic bid, Columbia hopes to break back into the top league, where it used to rank alongside Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, M.I.T. and the University of Chicago. It sees Professor Barro as a kind of franchise player who can not just pull up the team by his mere presence but also act as a magnet for talented young faculty.
For Harvard's highly ranked economics department, which has not lost a senior professor to a rival department since Stanford recaptured Kenneth J. Arrow in 1979. Columbia's coup has come as a wake-up call. The faculty dean, Jeremy Knowles -- who used to brag that "I have never matched an outside offer!" -- is, by all accounts, building a war chest to fend off future raids.
Just as extraordinary as the salary Columbia will pay is the cornucopia of perks and privileges Professor Barro won in months of negotiations. To lure him, Columbia helped place his teen-age son in an exclusive Manhattan private school, offered a $55,000-a-year university post to his wife, Judy, who is just returning to the work force and eased out the prior tenant of a 2,300-square-foot university-owned apartment on Riverside Drive, which the Barros coveted. The rent is subsidized at half the apartment's estimated market rate, with a lavish renovation, courtesy of Columbia, thrown in for good measure.
While Professor Barro also has other sources of income, it all adds up to at least a $150,000 gain for his family.
Other parts of the deal entail even heftier investments by Columbia. Professor Barro will occupy three spacious offices on the impossibly cramped and overcrowded campus. He will direct a sizable chunk of resources at the university's new social science research center. Most important, Professor Barro will have a green light from the administration to recruit a half-dozen promising younger economists.
The whole thing started more than a year ago when Professor Barro, who was feeling underpaid, began dropping hints that he might be willing to move. The first to respond was Boston University, which failed to put together a $250,000 offer last spring. When Columbia heard that he might be "gettable," the economics department and business school teamed up to go after him. Until the deal, which has not been made public, was finally consummated in February, hardly anyone at either Columbia or Harvard expected it to come off. Around Christmas, a Harvard friend offered Columbia's department chairman 20-to-1 odds against Professor Barro's accepting.
The extras clinched it. The Columbia dean, David H. Cohen, made the salary offer at the beginning of the negotiations and hardly raised it. The promise that Professor Barro would have six new slots to fill was made in October.
Soon afterward, however, the negotiations almost foundered because Columbia was unable to find a suitable apartment. But by the time Dean Knowles of Harvard invited Professor Barro to a long, wine-drenched dinner in February to present Harvard's counteroffer -- involving a new research center -- Ms. Barro was already meeting with architects, their son had received his acceptance letter from the Dalton School and a job offer was about to go out to one of Professor Barro's former students, Casey Mulligan at Chicago.
Harvard was too late, if not exactly too little. "If he had offered me in November what he did in February, I probably would have stayed." Professor Barro said.
To be sure, academic recruiting beyond the junior level -- particularly in New York, where housing and schools are major stumbling blocks -- has always been a complex, expensive undertaking. But Columbia's willingness to put together a deal of these proportions shows how much it expects to benefit from Professor Barro's presence. "We're capturing a lot of the surplus that Robert will generate," said R. Glenn Hubbard, an economist in the business school and one of the main flag carriers in the Barro negotiations.
Economics is now the No. 1 major at Columbia. As enrollments have doubled, the faculty has shrunk. The business school, now one of the most competitive in the country, also considers a highly rated economics department vital to its own continuing success.
The business school dean, Meyer Feldberg, consulted Milton Friedman on the hire. "Milton was very positive," Dean Feldberg recalled. "He said: 'Barro's young. He's got visibility. People are drawn to him.' "
Not all of Professor Barro's peers are equally enthusiastic. Some consider his recent empirical work superficial, others feel his theoretical work is less elegant than, say, that of Professor Lucas, who first coined the phrase "rational expectations" and is revered for his rigorous, spare style. Still others point to Professor Barro's prickly persona. (He was known, as a young professor at the University of Chicago, for his outbursts during debates and his scathing attitude toward less stellar colleagues.)
But even his critics acknowledge that Dr. Barro is productive, influential and a "builder," who in the early 1980's strengthened the economics department at the University of Rochester, and he continues to train an impressive number of first-rate students -- Barroids as they are called.
The notion that a big push can restore Columbia's faded glory is a tantalizing one. Columbia once had students like Kenneth Arrow, Milton Friedman and Alan Greenspan. Its faculty included some of the great pioneers of empirical economics -- Wesley Mitchell, Arthur Burns, George Stigler. But by the time Gary Becker, who taught at Columbia throughout the 60's, decamped for the University of Chicago in 1970, student revolts, a dysfunctional administration and New York City's decline were pulling the university down and the economics department with it.
That said, Columbia boasts some remarkable thinkers, one or more of whom could easily win a Nobel Prize. These include Jagdish Bhagwati, Kelvin Lancaster and Robert Mundell in trade, Edmund Phelps in macroeconomics. (William Vickrey, a member of the department, died within days of receiving a prize last year.) But this group is about to retire. Columbia also has some promising researchers recently out of graduate school. What it lacks is a vital middle -- those in their prime years of 35 to 55 -- that normally forms the intellectual and administrative leadership. It is this "great void" that Professor Barro has been elected to fill. As Professor Bhagwati put it: "The students don't care if we get four Nobels. They want to learn the latest stuff."
In the past, great departments were built slowly. But armed with a growing endowment and emboldened by the comeback of New York City, Columbia thinks it might just be able to engineer a big leap up by buying its way into the top bracket. "We saw a chance to jump-start the process," said George Rupp, the president of Columbia.
In one of the earliest rounds of talks last summer, Professor Barro handed Professor Cole, the Columbia provost, a list of 10 to 12 "young seniors" he would like to see at Columbia. (Young seniors are newly tenured professors or those about to be tenured.) They included Caroline Hoxby, Ed Glaeser and David Laibson at Harvard as well as Michael S. Kremer, a MacArthur Fellow at M.I.T.
"It's a great test," commented Kevin Murphy at the University of Chicago. "I'm a little skeptical, but if it's successful, it will change the way people think about the build-or-buy decision: money will talk and blitz campaigns will work."
The trouble is, says Dale Jorgenson, former department head at Harvard, "Everybody's trying to do the same thing. It's happening all at once."
Senior hiring, as angling for stars is called, has been hot and heavy for a while. Princeton has lucrative offers out to "half of the Chicago department," as one Chicagoan anxiously put it. Upwardly mobileschools like Boston University have been making aggressive offers, as has New York University, which is paying one of its home-grown stars, Boyan Jovanovic, a macroeconomist, a cool $200,000.
Well-heeled business and public policy schools are also eager to hire economists. Harvard's Kennedy School, under its dean, Joseph S. Nye, has been on a shopping spree, with handsome offers currently out to five economists, including Alan Krueger and Ken Rogoff at Princeton. .
"Everybody's budgets have been liberated," complains Professor Rosen, the expert on superstars. "Recruiting is getting harder."
Harvard's newfound determination to fight back partly reflects the fact that Professor Barro's departure comes on top of others in the core economics disciplines. Lawrence Summers left to join the Treasury Department; Andreu Mas-Collel decamped to the presidency of a research university in Barcelona. Now Princeton and Berkeley are making aggressive plays for a key price theorist, Drew Fudenberg.
The risks are not all Harvard's of course. Professor Barro will be leaving behind world class students and younger colleagues. "Robert is making a terrible mistake," said Jeffrey Williamson, chairman of Harvard's economics department. "It's a big step down."

While Harvard's Robert J. Barro was being courted by Columbia, Harvard tried to persuade him to stay. Over dinner, its dean of faculty, Jeremy R. Knowles, drew a diagram to illustrate how Dr. Barro's standing in the economics world -- his cosmic distinction -- would suffer if he went to Columbia. Here is a look at Dr. Barro's credentials.

HEADLINE: The Chinese Burst Onto the Tourist Scene

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: PATTAYA, Thailand

 BODY:
At a wildlife park called the Nong Nooch Tropical Garden, a gaggle of camera-toting tourists from China jostled for position at a souvenir stand to buy gaudy knickknacks, while others took turns riding elephants adorned with red-and-green silk saddles.
"I need a picture with the orangutan," said Chen Yiren, 28, sounding breathless with the excitement of taking her first trip outside her native China. "No one will believe I came if I don't have pictures." 
 Chinese tourists are flocking overseas, spending handfuls of cash and reflecting a new economic reality. As Southeast Asian nations struggle to recover from a devastating financial crisis, China has suddenly emerged as a major source of tourists, bolstering an industry hurt by a severe falloff in visitors from South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Planeloads of Chinese tour groups now arrive in Thailand each day, filling hotels, restaurants and tourist shops.
At the same time, China is relaxing restrictions on overseas travel, permitting ordinary citizens to go abroad. In 1997, China allowed 2.6 million citizens to leave the country on tourist visas, up from 1.6 million in 1996, and the number is expected to increase further this year.
Not long ago, groups of Chinese officials who traveled overseas were kept in groups to make sure no one tried to emigrate. But tourists are now given plenty of opportunity to roam unattended, and many seem to use their free time to shop.
"The whole situation has changed," said Wu Derong, sales manager of the China Youth Travel Service in Shanghai, counting off the reasons why Chinese tourists now dominate the trade. "The exit procedures are easier, the entry visas to Thailand are easier, the prices are going down, but most of all, Chinese people have money to spend."
Traveling to Thailand has suddenly become one of the hottest fads among young professionals in China's larger cities, but it is also popular among retirees, many of whom are sent by their children.
"Several of my friends came last year, so I wanted to come too," said Wang Liping, 26, a Shanghai marketing executive. "I really wanted to see the transvestite performance."
The high point of a five-day Thailand tour, Ms. Wang said, was indeed a glitzy nightclub act performed by Thai transvestites, whose spectacular costumes, slick stagework and lip-synching to well-known pop songs wowed an audience of Chinese visitors. After the show, the parking lot was packed with Chinese tourists posing for photographs with heavily made-up transvestites.
Thailand is the most popular destination for Chinese tourists, in part because it is the most affordable. China's tourist agencies offer a five-day trip to Thailand from Beijing or Shanghai for less than $500, including air fare on Chinese or Thai carriers, hotel, meals and local transportation.
For slightly more, other travelers are venturing to Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. Last year, China approved Australia as a tourist destination as well.
"We'd like to be able to take tourists to Hawaii in the future," said Mr. Wu, the Shanghai travel agent. But the United States is not yet issuing tourist visas to Chinese routinely, and requires applicants for official, business and student visas to produce a letter of invitation from an American host.
On one recent tour group to Thailand from Shanghai, half of the tourists were young professionals, the other half retirees. For roughly two-thirds of them, it was the first time out of China.
In addition to the wildlife park and the transvestite show, the itinerary included a series of state-run shops in Bangkok that eagerly accepted Chinese currency, the yuan, which was shunned until recently because banks will still not freely convert it into Thai baht or American dollars.
No longer shy at spending, Chinese tourists are now among the biggest buyers of gold and other jewelry, leather goods and traditional medicine at Thai tourist shops. Thai officials estimate that the average Chinese tourist spends nearly $40 a day on shopping, almost as much as the $45 spent by the average Japanese tourist.
One required stop for Chinese tour groups is a traditional medicine store. There visitors are encouraged to buy capsules of snake oil and of a powder supposedly concocted from snake penis -- particularly popular among Chinese men, who believe it enhances virility.
At the Bangkok Handicrafts Center, more than a hundred Chinese-speaking sales clerks are at the counters each morning as the busloads of Chinese tourists arrive. In the afternoon, they are replaced by English-speaking clerks, for the European groups.
"We used to train tour guides to speak Korean and Japanese," said Surachai Achasewin, a tourism official in Bangkok. "Now Mandarin is the language we need most."
The tourists lining up to take elephant rides at the Nong Nooch Tropical Garden were easily identifiable by tour tags bearing the names of various travel agencies in the Chinese cities where they originated.
Outside, the tour buses told the story in numbers: of 38 buses in the parking lot, 34 carried tourists from mainland China, 2 were from Taiwan, and 2 carried Germans.
Many Chinese visitors are arrogant about the superiority of their own cuisine and culture, especially compared with that of their Asian neighbors.
"I hate Thai food," said Chen Jing, 32, a factory manager. "I think China has many more places worth visiting than Thailand."
On Mr. Chen's five-day tour, all the arranged meals were Chinese except for a single Thai buffet on the final day. Even then, most members of the Chinese group kept to simple foods like fried vegetables and soup.
Chinese tourists, compared with travelers from other Asian countries, are generally quiet and group-oriented, separating in their free time to hit the Thai department stores.
Before the rush of tourism began in 1996, most Chinese visitors to Thailand were officials on "inspection tours" paid for by local government offices. Many visited sex shows and Thai bathhouses, where prostitutes with a number on their bathing suits sit on view behind a window as they wait to be chosen by a customer.
But since most of today's booming tourist crop are young professional or retired couples, they stick mostly to a daytime itinerary of parks, temples, water sports and shopping.
Bai Guangming, 36, a manager at a privately run manufacturing business in Shanghai, said he had been trying for more than a year to arrange time off to visit Thailand.
"I wanted to get away," Mr. Bai said, sounding like a typically harried executive. "It was hard to get the time off."
Like the others on his trip, Mr. Bai had obtained a special Chinese passport for one-time travel, which cost $35. This was issued routinely after he showed a letter from his travel agent saying he had already paid for a trip to Thailand. In the past, Chinese authorities issued passports and exit permits only to officials, businessmen and students who could provide a letter of invitation from an overseas sponsor.
Only a few years ago, Chinese tourists were largely limited to trips within China organized by their factory or office. But today's travelers are spending their own money, and often seem most interested in finding bargains and value.
At an informational meeting in Shanghai a few days before the tour departed, Chu Yiqian, a 24-year-old graduate student, piped up.
"I have one question," she said. "Can I use my Visa card in Thailand?"

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT PRESSES DEBATE ON CHANGE IN SOCIAL SECURITY

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 7

 BODY:
With charts at his side and an array of solutions being debated before him, President Clinton began trying to build consensus today on addressing Social Security's looming financial problems, and he said he thought the job could be accomplished without raising the payroll taxes that finance the retirement system.
Speaking to the first of four regional conferences on Social Security this year, Mr. Clinton for the most part kept to generalities and left open the possibility of sweeping changes, including the proposal to make individual investment accounts a part of what until now has been solely a guaranteed Government benefit program. 
 He all but ruled out increasing the 12.4 percent payroll tax rate, split equally between employees and employers, as a way to close the financial gap that Social Security will face as the baby boom generation retires in coming decades. And he said he would be reluctant to eliminate the cap on earnings, now $68,400, above which workers pay no further payroll taxes for Social Security.
Mr. Clinton said the debate was critical now, when the strong economy and the nation's newfound fiscal health present "a rare opportunity to prepare our nation for the challenges and the opportunities of the 21st century, or in the words of an old saying, to fix the roof while the sun is still shining."
"If we act now," he said, "we can insure strong retirement benefits for the baby boom generation without placing an undue burden on our children and our grandchildren. And we can do it, if we act now, with changes that will be far simpler and easier than if we wait until the problem is closer at hand."
Generally, Mr. Clinton stuck to his strategy of neither endorsing nor shooting down any of the major options for reshaping Social Security and of calling on Congress to leave any future budget surpluses untouched until Congress and the White House have settled on a plan.
Pressed by questioners to take a specific position, Mr. Clinton said that doing so now would inhibit the national debate and that he would put his ideas on the table in December at a bipartisan White House conference.
Mr. Clinton suggested, and his aides later confirmed, that the Administration would be willing to consider individual accounts as part of a comprehensive solution only if the overall plan insured that Social Security would continue to provide recipients with a guaranteed retirement benefit.
"Social Security must provide a benefit that people can count on," Mr. Clinton said. "Regardless of the ups and downs of the economy or the financial markets, we have to provide a solid and dependable foundation of retirement security."
But there was plenty of evidence right on the platform with Mr. Clinton that allowing investments in Social Security would be central to the debate over how to prepare the system for the retirement starting in about a decade of the 76-million- member baby boom generation.
The two speakers immediately following Mr. Clinton in the first portion of the daylong program -- Senators Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a Republican, and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a Democrat -- backed the idea of private accounts. A third, Representative Kenny Hulshof of Missouri, a Republican, said the idea deserved study, and a fourth, Representative Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota, a Democrat, said the Social Security system itself might invest in the stock market.
Other options being discussed are cutting benefits, accelerating a planned increase in the retirement age to 67, increasing taxes on benefits received by the affluent and using Federal budget surpluses -- projected by the White House at more than $1 trillion over the next decade -- to extend Social Security's solvency. Without any changes, Social Security will run short of money starting in 2029 and would thereafter be able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits.
Mr. Clinton said that each $100 billion dedicated to Social Security would extend the program's solvency by a year.
But his aides said Mr. Clinton had yet to decide how much of any surplus he would like to dedicate to Social Security, despite his challenge to Congress not to spend any of the surplus until Social Security's problems had been dealt with.
Republicans have been wary of letting Mr. Clinton manage the national debate. Republicans in the House are pressing for creation of a Congressionally mandated commission to come up with a legislative proposal, but the Administration rejected that in favor of a White House conference in December.
Mr. Pomeroy said he was encouraged that the debate over Social Security as an investment program versus an insurance program had not become a partisan chasm and that there appeared to be broad agreement that the system should retain some guaranteed benefit.
"The rest we can negotiate," Mr. Pomeroy said.
For Mr. Clinton, today's event, held in a gym at Penn Valley Community College and sponsored by the American Association of Retired Persons and the Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group, was an opportunity to plunge into the details of a policy debate and leave behind the scandals in Washington.
Fielding questions in the afternoon from an audience selected by a market research company to reflect the demographic and economic characteristics of the Kansas City area, Mr. Clinton touched on an array of issues relating to retirement security, health care and taxes.
Members of the audience added their opinions.
"I don't know if privatization of Social Security is a good idea or not," said one woman, who identified herself as a nurse, while addressing a question to Mr. Clinton. "My husband and I can afford it. We have an income of over $100,000 a year. There's people in here, though, who don't, and I guess I have several challenging questions."
Foremost among them, she said, was that if the nation allocates some of Social Security's money for private accounts, "then, are we really socially secure and not taking out that security piece?"
Ultimately, Mr. Clinton told the audience, it would be up to the nation to tell political leaders how they would make tradeoffs between options like raising the retirement age, eliminating the income cap and establishing private accounts.

HEADLINE: Pataki Donor Under Inquiry Settled Previous Tunnel Case

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
A construction company that is the subject of Federal investigations into whether it obtained a $97 million state contract in return for donations to New York's Republican Party was earlier accused of mismanaging a related project, according to interviews and state records.
The company was never penalized for its performance on the first project -- repairs to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel between 1993 and 1996 -- and was even paid extra by the state after the company's owner raised more than $100,000 in 1995 for Gov. George E. Pataki and the Republicans, the interviews and records show. 
 The state agency that operates the tunnel, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, reached a settlement with the company soon after the Governor and his senior economic development adviser attended a party for the Pataki campaign at the home of the company's owner. Two years later, donors connected to the company, Silverite Construction, gave another $100,000 to the Republicans around the time that the company received the $97 million contract, also for work in the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.
Aides to Mr. Pataki and M.T.A. officials said there was no connection between the way that the authority supervised projects and political contributions. They said that career civil servants without ties to the Pataki administration made all the decisions on the tunnel projects.
The authority originally chastised Silverite for "serious and material contract breaches" on the earlier project because of a major violation of asbestos procedures in the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. Despite this finding in late 1994, the authority awarded the company the $97 million contract last year.
Silverite's owner, Angelo J. Silveri, is one of the biggest financial backers of Mr. Pataki and the New York Republican State Committee. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and Manhattan are investigating the awarding of the $97 million contract to Silverite Construction, and both offices have subpoenaed Mr. Silveri. It is not known whether prosecutors are looking into the earlier project.
The $100,000 that was given last year brought the total contributions that Mr. Silveri and donors linked to him have given the Pataki campaign and the Republicans since October 1994 to more than $335,000, records show. That figure includes the more than $100,000 that he raised in two months in 1995.
A spokesman for the authority, Tom Kelly, said its management had not been aware of contributions linked to Mr. Silveri, which include his own donations and others by his family members, business associates, companies that he controls and a political action committee that Silverite Construction established. "There is no way for anyone associated with the M.T.A. to know anything about campaign contributions," Mr. Kelly said.
He dismissed the authority's criticism of Silverite over the asbestos procedures on the earlier project, saying that it was part of the "contract management evaluation process." Mr. Kelly noted that the authority's final assessment of the project had found that Silverite had done a satisfactory job.
Asked how often the authority accuses a general contractor on a major project of "serious and material contract breaches," Mr. Kelly said that, "it happens all the time."
Mr. Kelly also blamed the asbestos subcontractor that had been hired by Silverite for some of the problems. He said that Silverite ended up working with the authority to insure that the asbestos was removed properly. He said that because of that cooperation, the company was neither penalized nor disqualified from receiving the $97 million contract.
The authority awarded the 1997 project to Silverite and another company, Frontier-Kemper Constructors, after originally determining that the two companies were not qualified.
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, acknowledged that the Governor attended a party at Mr. Silveri's home in Oyster Bay, N.Y., on May 4, 1995, along with his senior economic development adviser, Charles A. Gargano.
"It was a fund-raising-related event and it was attended by 20 or so people," Mr. McKeon said. Asked whether Mr. Pataki discussed state contracts with Mr. Silveri at the party, Mr. McKeon said: "It's a ridiculous question. I think that people have more respect for the Governor than that."
Edward M. Shaw, a lawyer for Mr. Silveri, said, "Most emphatically, the contributions had no relationship whatsoever to any issues relating to the contract."
The M.T.A. awarded Silverite a $14.1 million contract in 1993 to repair the roadway and fresh air ducts in the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. At that time, Mr. Pataki's predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, was Governor and controlled the authority.
Early on Friday, Sept. 23, 1994, the authority discovered that workers were removing asbestos from the tunnel's fresh air duct in what inspectors deemed an unsafe manner, according to letters that the authority later sent Silverite. The authority temporarily halted the project and kept one of the tunnel's two tubes closed until 9:45 A.M., creating traffic jams.
A senior authority official involved in the project, who spoke on condition of anonymity, recalled in a recent interview that the discovery of the improper asbestos procedures was an "awful situation," saying that as a result, the M.T.A. had contemplated removing Silverite from the project. The authority considered the potential health risks so serious that it conducted an internal investigation into how such incidents could be avoided, officials said.
The authority ordered Silverite to fire the subcontractor that Silverite had hired to remove the asbestos, a company called East Coast Services. But in letters to Silverite over the next two months, the authority said Silverite was solely responsible for the violations of asbestos procedures. The authority said it had the right to demand "reimbursement from the contractor for extra costs incurred by the authority in connection with these serious contract violations."
Silverite contended that the authority owed it $2 million in additional compensation because it had to hire a new asbestos subcontractor and adopt more costly asbestos removal procedures.
On March 8, 1995, while the dispute continued, the New York Republican State Committee received donations of $25,000 each from Mr. Silveri and three family members, according to campaign finance records.
In late April, Mr. Pataki took control of the authority when he appointed E. Virgil Conway as its chairman. On May 4, 1995, Mr. Silveri held the party at his home, which was attended by Mr. Pataki. On May 20, 1995, the authority reached a settlement with Silverite, said Mr. Kelly, the authority spokesman.
The authority gave Silverite an extra $400,000, rather than the $2 million it had initially requested. In July 1995, in its first formal review of Silverite's performance, the authority gave the company satisfactory marks, with no bad grades, including any connected to the asbestos removal, Mr. Kelly said. He added that since the asbestos problems at the tunnel, the M.T.A. had refused to allow East Coast Services to work on the authority's projects.

HEADLINE: SHAPING A COLOSSUS: THE VISION;
The One-Stop Financial Mall: Is It What Peoria Longs For?

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Though the planned combination of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc. has drawn superlatives on Wall Street, it gets much of its inspiration from the more mundane confines of the shopping mall.
As the companies see it, consumers who once abandoned the Main Street butcher, baker and candlestick maker for giant stores in the suburbs are now eager to see their insurance agencies, bank branches and securities brokers as financial supermarkets: stocks and bonds in aisle 1, property and casualty policies in aisle 3, mortgages in aisle 5, all passing through the same checkout counter. 
 There is no question that the creation of Citigroup Inc., the behemoth that will emerge if the merger is completed, represents a milestone in financial history. The deal, valued at $70 billion in stock at the time it was announced on Monday and more than $84 billion later in the day as Citicorp's shares rose, would be the biggest ever. Still, some of the initial euphoria among investors waned yesterday, trimming the value to $78 billion. Page D1.
And some observers wonder what is in store in the new world promised by this mega-merger. "If the result of this merger is four insurance brochures on a rack in a bank branch, then it's going to be failure," said Charlene Stern, president of Stern Marketing Group, a Berkeley, Calif., consulting firm. "They've got to learn from the best retailers out there -- and not each other -- about how to sell all these products effectively. Cross-selling has not been overwhelmingly effective at any bank yet."
Indeed, no one should know better the potential pitfalls of one-stop financial shopping than the two engineers of this deal, John S. Reed of Citicorp and Sanford I. Weill of Travelers. Although Mr. Reed noted on Monday that Travelers had had success cross-selling its arsenal of financial products, Mr. Weill was an executive at the American Express Company when that prestigious corporation's experiment with one-stop shopping failed in the 1980's.
Even so, Mr. Reed defended the concept, arguing that superior salesmanship and marketing practices will allow Citigroup to succeed where others have failed.
"It's a business proposition whose time has come," Mr. Reed said, noting that customers in the future will not "want to go from place to place" to manage their personal finances.
Despite the past failures, one-stop shopping remains the Holy Grail for many financial services concerns. Fueled by a historic bull market in stocks and increasing consumer sophistication, financial products have leap-frogged apparel as the third-largest source of consumer purchases after food and gasoline, according to Ms. Stern.
Moreover, Mercer Management Consulting Inc., said that only 10 percent of bank customers deliver about 90 percent of the profits -- and those are the customers who use several products supplied by the same bank.
"If Citicorp and Travelers do it right, they will change the industry," said Scott Birnbaum, Mercer's director of global financial services consulting. "If they don't succeed, somebody else will step up to the plate because there are huge economic opportunities there."
Complicating Citigroup's attempt to create a financial supermarket is a thicket of regulatory issues that the company must still negotiate, as well as public concern about the dangers of financial concentration.
"With one-stop shopping malls like this the potential for abuse is enhanced," said Samuel Hayes, a Harvard Business School professor. "Regulators, especially the Securities and Exchange Commission, are going to have to watch all of this with a particularly jaundiced eye."
Smaller competitors of the merged company also have concerns about financial supermarkets. The Independent Bankers Association of America, a Washington, D.C., trade group that represents community banks, said it was worried that a combination of Citicorp and Travelers might drive out competition and limit small towns' access to financial products and services.
Other than local competition there is historical precedent for large financial combinations opening the door to abuses or risky financial practices. Consider the following:
In 1933, Congressional hearings disclosed that a major bank, the National City Company, had repackaged bad loans as bonds and then dumped them into the laps of unwitting investors who did business with its securities affiliate. And six decades later, Deutsche Bank A.G. was forced to bail out Metallgesellschaft A.G., a corporate borrower in which it held a 13 percent stake, after the company was hammered by losses from risky derivatives trading.
To be sure, regulators are more vigilant and sophisticated now than they were earlier in the century, and the risks of integrating financial and commercial companies may have more to do with lax management than with the threats posed by big mergers. Still, the proposed merger of Citicorp and Travelers would create a corporation of distinctly large proportions. "This is the biggest thing since the creation of U.S. Steel in 1901," said Robert Sobel, a financial historian at Hofstra University. "We're in territory that we haven't seen in a long, long time. I don't know what it means yet."
Beyond the public policy concerns, Citigroup's management will still face a daunting task: proving that as a financial superstore it can deliver a wide array of financial products cheaply and efficiently.
Other companies that have tried to refashion themselves as financial Wal-Marts, selling everything from credit cards to stocks under one roof, have run into trouble. Besides American Express, Sears, Roebuck & Company also failed in its effort to cross-sell financial goods.
Analysts said that even with one of the most venerable retailing traditions in the country, Sears was unable to make Dean Witter, Discover & Company's stocks and credit cards attractive to customers for one simple reason -- customers were not ready to buy financial products in a store they associated with televisions, gardening tools and cheap clothing.
And American Express was so swept up in the notion of assembling a juicy buffet of financial services that the day-to-day management of each business, such as its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. brokerage unit, was unfocused and therefore unappealing to customers. For example, Shearson was notably scattershot in some of the merger advisory work it attempted to deliver to large corporate clients.
But Citicorp and Travelers said they planned to bring superior salesmanship and marketing to their efforts -- even though Citicorp has already had problems selling financial extras to its credit card holders.
"This is not Sears and Dean Witter selling stocks and socks," said Mary McDermott, a Travelers spokeswoman. "We're not necessarily trying to be all things to all people. This idea of a financial supermarket is a media creation. We're trying to take our capabilities on a global scale."
Other banks are also pursuing the one-stop-shopping ideal, albeit on a far less grand scale than what is envisioned by Citicorp and Travelers. That is most obvious in the flurry of recent brokerage firm acqusitions made by banks: the Bankers Trust New York Corporation's purchase of Alex. Brown Inc., the BankAmerica Corporation's acquisition of Robertson Stephens & Company, and the Nationsbank Corporation's purchase of Montgomery Securities Inc.
But other very profitable banks, perhaps most notably the Bank of New York Company, have opted out of the financial supermarket hustle, choosing instead to tie their fortunes to a narrower range of businesses such as securities processing and old-fashioned, local banking.
Still, chief executives were buoyed by the merger announcement.
"I think this is going to change how we do business and think about business," said Saul Steinberg, chairman of the insurance giant Reliance Group Holdings Inc., who was rebuffed by regulators 30 years ago when he made a bid for the old Chemical Banking Corporation. "There are no limits on our imaginations now."

HEADLINE: 'Nanny Tax' Law Should Be Revised;
Unfair Worker Burden

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your April 5 front-page article says that "maids who bring their own tools and cleaning solutions are arguably independent contractors, not employees, and thus might be exempt from the nanny tax." According to the Internal Revenue Service, a maid is an employee and not an independent contractor. 
 You also report that one of the more promising ideas for dealing with tax evasion is to make all household employees independent contractors, responsible for their own taxes. Such a move would unfairly shift the Social Security tax from employers to low-wage workers.
In addition, as nonemployees, maids and nannies would be excluded from unemployment compensation.

HEADLINE: Side Air Bags To Be Offered On More Cars

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 7

 BODY:
Side air bags will soon be much more common in cars on the American road.
The Ford Motor Company, expressing concern about the death rate of people in cars hit from the side, plans to announce on Wednesday that it will offer side air bags on all of its cars and Ford Windstar mini-vans over the next several years, company officials said today. 
 Ford will become the first mass-market auto maker to offer side air bags on all its cars; it has not offered such devices on any of its United States models.
The General Motors Corporation already offers side air bags on a half-dozen of its 81 models. And G.M. said today that it planned to add 15 more over the next two years. Luxury car makers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo also offer side air bags, and now Ford and G.M. think their customers will want them, too.
Ford's side air bags will be built into the outer side of both the driver's seat and the front passenger's seat, and will inflate to protect the occupant's neck and head. They will be offered first as options on the new Mercury Cougar coupe this spring and the redesigned Ford Windstar this autumn. Ford had said in 1995 that it would install some side air bags, but never made the broad commitment to do so in its entire lineup. Ford executives said today that as each model undergoes even modest redesigns, side air bags would be added, with virtually all models getting them over the next 2 years.
The side air bags will be standard equipment on Ford's luxury cars, particularly Lincoln sedans. They will become standard equipment on less-expensive models as soon as buyers start consistently choosing them as an option, said Robert L. Rewey, Ford's group vice president for marketing, sales and service. Ford is still working on side air bags for sport utility vehicles, but safety research has found less of a problem when these off-road vehicles are hit in the side.
Side-impact collisions have in recent years accounted for a growing proportion of all deaths in traffic collisions -- now 30 percent -- as air bags and seat belts have made frontal collisions less dangerous. Nearly 7,000 Americans a year die just in side impact collisions involving two vehicles. Federal regulators, insurance industry researchers and the auto makers' own safety experts have grown increasingly worried in recent months that the spread of light trucks, including sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, may mean that more of the collisions will be deadly.
A report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in late February found that while sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans make up only a third of the vehicles on the road, they are the striking vehicles in nearly 60 percent of all fatal side-impact collisions. Some full-sized sport utility vehicles have hoods that are nearly as high as the roofs of mid-sized cars, so they tend to strike a car occupant higher than a car would.
New Federal rules now taking effect require greater protection for the heads of car occupants during collisions from all angles. Neil W. Ressler, Ford's vice president for advanced vehicle technology, said Ford could meet the standards by installing more cushioning in the ceilings of passenger compartments. But still greater protection can be provided with side air bags, he said.
"They really work; the way people get hurt in side impacts is almost always that their heads are injured," Mr. Ressler said.
Other auto makers are also looking for ways to improve protection for car occupants. Robert Lange, the top safety official at General Motors, said in a recent interview that the main safety issue associated with the spread of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks was side-impact collisions. He said G.M. would soon be offering more side air bags, and predicted that Federal regulators would soon begin looking for ways to further tighten regulations on side-impact protection.
Side air bags have recently become standard on G.M.'s Cadillac Seville and DeVille sedans and on its Chevrolet Venture, Oldsmobile Silhouette and Pontiac Trans Sport mini-vans, and are optional on the Chevrolet Prism sedan. Kyle Johnson, a G.M. spokesman, said 21 G.M. models would have side air bags by the end of the 2000 model year.
The Chrysler Corporation does not offer side air bags on any of its models, but is reviewing whether to do so, said Michele Tinson, a Chrysler spokeswoman. With the exception of a few models like the Toyota Corolla and Camry, which have optional side air bags, most Japanese cars do not have them. Luxury European manufacturers like BMW and Volvo already offer side air bags as standard equipment.
Ford said in 1995 that it would install side air bags at some point but provided few details then. Its decision could put pressure on other auto makers to follow suit. Ford cars and light trucks consistently score better than other manufacturers' models in Federal crash tests, and the addition of side air bags could widen this gap.
Federal regulators declined to comment on Ford's plans tonight.
The latest cars and most light trucks are already required to carry air bags in front of both front seats to protect occupants from frontal collisions. Regulators estimate that these air bags have saved 3,000 lives over the last decade, but the force of inflation has killed 96 people, mainly children or elderly people who were not wearing seat belts and were sitting very close to the air bags.
To improve overall safety, auto makers have slowed the rate at which air bags inflate and have urged parents to keep children in the back seat. Regulators have allowed air bags to be disconnected by people who request permission for a number of reasons, including shortness, frailty and a need to carry a child in the front seat.
Side air bags are designed to avoid some of these problems, and have been much less controversial. They inflate parallel to a car occupant sitting upright, rather than toward the occupant. Even for models on which side air bags are standard, Ford will allow customers to order cars without the air bags directly from the factory. Or, the devices could be disconnected.
Mr. Ressler said Ford's decision was based on a broad commitment to safety rather than a specific response to the spread of large sport utility vehicles and pickups. Recent tests by the insurance industry have found that side air bags provide a lot of protection for the occupants of cars that slide sideways into fixed objects like trees and bridge abutments. But Helen O. Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for environmental and safety engineering, said last fall that Ford was working hard on side air bags because of concerns about crashes with light trucks.

HEADLINE: After Compromises, Indonesians Reach 3d Pact With I.M.F.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Wednesday, April 7

 BODY:
Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund reached basic agreement on Tuesday on the third plan in six months for rescuing the country's economy. The plan is yet another effort to get Indonesia to comply with conditions allowing it to receive $43 billion in aid.
The fund made concessions that permit President Suharto to continue heavy subsidies on food and fuel; the prospect of ending the subsidies has led to anti-Government riots. 
 Mr. Suharto also made concessions, including closing more insolvent banks belonging to his close friends and supporters, according to officials familiar with the document.
Speaking in Tokyo today, Stanley Fisher, the No. 2 official at the I.M.F., gave some details of the agreement but said final language on a few points was still being worked out.
To assure compliance, the fund will withhold billions of dollars from the Indonesian Government until it takes a series of painful steps that it has so far resisted.
Even then, according to officials familiar with the complex negotiations, the fund will give emergency cash to Indonesia in small amounts as the country fulfills its commitments. These include steps to contain runaway inflation and talks with banks around the world over how Indonesia will repay more than $70 billion in corporate debt.
American and I.M.F. officials described the accord as Indonesia's last chance at fiscal redemption. But it also marked an effort to show some deference to Mr. Suharto, and fund officials went to considerable pains to portray parts of the program as Indonesia's initiative, rather than their own.
That is a sharp contrast to when the last agreement was signed, on Jan. 15. At that time Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the fund, stood over Mr. Suharto with his arms folded. The image of the fund appearing to dictate terms brought a political backlash in Indonesia, and emboldened the Government to ignore many of the conditions placed on the $43 billion aid program.
On Tuesday there were no top I.M.F. officials in Jakarta, and it seems unlikely that Mr. Suharto himself will sign the revised agreement. Nonetheless, fund officials and their American counterparts say they are sure that Mr. Suharto, now beginning his fifth term in office, understands that quick fixes to artificially bolster the Indonsian currency will not work.
While the fund had promised Indonesia a $43 billion package, so far it has turned over only $3 billion. And after the bitter experience of watching Indonesian officials sign agreements that they failed to carry out, both the fund and the United States, the biggest voice in the I.M.F., are clearly cautious.
"There will be a period of testing" before Indonesia gets its next injection of aid, Mr. Fischer, the fund's first deputy managing director, said recently. "What the world needs to see is performance, not signatures."
An American official involved in the delicate negotiations said: "We believe this has key ingredients for Indonesia's economic recovery. But what will be key in the days ahead is for Indonesia to carry out its commitments, and there will be a step-by-step monitoring."
There are also disturbing signs that President Suharto's relatives are continuing their search for ways to avoid any of the fund's conditions that threaten their wealth.
On Tuesday the Government announced a new partnership with a company to distribute nonessential goods like soap and toothpaste to Indonesia's 200 million people. But the business selected to do the job is run by Mr. Suharto's son, whose Government-favored car project and monopoly on the cloves were rejected by the fund several months ago.
Aside from financial questions, the subtext of the talks has been whether Mr. Suharto will be forced to surrender economic control over a country that has essentially been run like a family business.
The President could not openly defy the I.M.F., for fear of permanently scaring away investors, many of whom say they will not return to Indonesia until they are convinced that Mr. Suharto's rule will not end in a bloody struggle for succession.
But Mr. Suharto is not the only one with much at stake in how the agreement works out.
The fund is trying to calm opponents in Congress who have questioned why the Administration is seeking to inject another $18 billion into the I.M.F. to bolster its efforts to fight off economic crises like the one that seized Asia eight months ago. How tough a line it takes with Mr. Suharto has become a key test.
In a recent letter to President Clinton, 27 members of Congress argued that the Administration is propping up Mr. Suharto by requiring him to meet certain economic conditions but not to improve the country's human rights record.
"How is it," the letter read, "that we can muster the indignation, and subsequent pressure, to reverse an Indonesian Government decision to implement a currency board, but we are unable to react similarly when fundamental human rights to religious, political and economic freedom are blatantly trampled by the Indonesian Government?"
The fund's decision to back off its requirement that Indonesia immediately end its heavy subsidies for food and fuel was hardly surprising: fund officials conceded that they did not foresee how such a step could lead to social unrest. While the rioting has so far been sporadic, there are fears that it could worsen this summer as food shortages grow more severe and layoffs affect more people.
In fact the new agreement suggests that far tougher times are ahead. The January accord estimated that the Indonesian economy would grow by 4 percent this year; the new agreement estimates it will shrink by 5 percent. The fund now estimates that inflation could hit 47 percent this year.
The agreement also permits Indonesia to run a larger budget deficit than previously envisioned, chiefly to pay for the food subsidies.
And the fund is insisting that interest rates remain extraordinarily high, an effort to lure investors back. But that is also likely to increase the number of bankruptcies.
Perhaps the most complex task ahead for Indonesia is negotiating with lenders, chiefly in Japan and Europe, for more time to pay off a crushing debt. Those discussions are just beginning.
But there is a model: South Korea convinced its lenders to give it more time, and now, for the first time since the onset of its own financial crisis, South Korean Government officials are preparing to borrow billions of dollars on world bond markets. A few months ago, when the country was days from default, that would have been unthinkable.
Indonesia's recovery is likely to take far more time.
"But you have to say that things are better than they were a month ago," said Steve Radelet, an economist with lengthy experience in Indonesia who now works at the Institute for International Development at Harvard. "The fund will never get exactly what it wants, and the Indonesians will never get exactly what they want."

HEADLINE: JAZZ REVIEW;
A Saxophonist's Warm-Up Ends

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF 

 BODY:
A decade ago, major record labels yanked promising jazz players out of music school, offered them contracts and asked them to earn a place in history. Such invitations are rare these days, but the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, who's into his 30's and has only now released his first big-label record ("Mark Turner," on Warner Brothers), is a beneficiary of current jazz economics: he's ready, whereas many who came before him were not.
Mr. Turner opened a three-night run at Sweet Basil on Tuesday and demonstrated his trademarks. One begins high on the horn in a wheezed note and takes the shape of a long, trickling downward run; once at the bottom, he ascends again, starting even higher. Another is his generous use of arpeggios in improvisation, the Bach-like sound of chords cycling around. And another is more constant: he makes his tone quiet and firm, running off even streams of single notes while riding on a rhythm section's most volatile rhythms. When his rhythm section cut up steady time, blurring it and making it Cubist with superimposed ideas, Mr. Turner kept a cool head, going through gymnastics of harmony, limiting his projection. 
 His style isn't based in brashness or conscious understatement, but a maturity in between. At times, he sounds unabashedly reminiscent of Warne Marsh, the saxophonist closely associated in the 1940's and 50's with the pianist and composer Lennie Tristano. At Sweet Basil, Mr. Turner played an original called "Lennie Groove," directly replicating the rhythmic style of its namesake's music: fast, dry streams of single notes played in tandem with the pianist George Colligan, with double-time whirls stitched in.
Mr. Turner sounds natural within this pinpointed, scientific approach, but he can also play a devastating ballad. After three pieces, Tuesday's set broke off into a five-minute solo saxophone improvisation, and then he sounded the five notes signaling "Autumn in New York." He didn't aim for harmonic vertigo but for a pretty tone: he played thick sighs in the horn's high register, fully honoring the song's romanticism.

HEADLINE: WNET Appoints a New Chairman

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
After helping WNET, Channel 13 in New York, raise $78 million in a capital campaign that was the largest ever by a public television station, the financier Henry R. Kravis has told the station's board that he will step down as chairman. The board has chosen Steven Rattner, deputy chief executive of the investment firm Lazard Freres & Company, to succeed him.
The formal announcement is expected in two weeks at the station's annual fund-raising dinner, and the board's vote to approve Mr. Rattner as chairman is scheduled for its next meeting, in May. 
 "If Henry had to step down, there would be nobody I could think of better to replace him than Steve," said William F. Baker, the station's president, confirming that the board had unofficially approved Mr. Rattner, who was selected after a search by its nominating committee, led by Michael I. Sovern, a former president of Columbia University.
Mr. Kravis said he wanted to devote more time to his role as chairman of the New York City Investment Fund, a $60 million venture-capital fund he founded in 1996 to spur investment in the city's economic development. Having been chairman for eight and a half years, he also said it was time to "let other people have a chance."
"I'm thrilled to turn it over to someone with such a strong background in the telecommunications field," Mr. Kravis said of Mr. Rattner.
Mr. Rattner, who has been on WNET's board for eight years and vice chairman since 1995, has been an adviser on a number of major media transactions, including a $1 billion investment by Microsoft in Comcast, the sale of Continental Cablevision to U S West, and the sale of Paramount Communications to Viacom. Before becoming an investment banker in 1982, he spent nine years as a correspondent for The New York Times.
His experience will be especially valuable, Mr. Baker said, as the station makes the mandatory transition from analog to digital broadcasting in the next year or so, as all broadcast stations must do.
Mr. Kravis said his most important legacy was not just the capital campaign, which he initiated and which gave the station its first endowment to cushion its $120 million annual budget. "No. 1 was that I wanted to change our mission," Mr. Kravis said, "so that everything we did was focused on education, through our programming, through our media lab, through our teacher-training institute and other things. We are not just a television station but an educational organization."
The Kravis Multimedia Education Center, started in 1992 with a $5 million gift from Mr. Kravis, has helped forge new ideas for the convergence of computers and television, and has adapted Thirteen's programs and educational services for new formats like CD-ROM, DVD and the Internet.
"Henry has left the station in much, much better shape than ever before," Mr. Rattner said, "not just financially but in terms of its mission and spirit." He praised Mr. Kravis for knowing "how to motivate management by showing them you're involved, but not de-motivate them by meddling."
Mr. Baker agreed, saying: "He set parameters. He insisted we stay on budget, and he wanted the highest quality programming around, and he was all over us about education being our heritage. But he never tells you how to do it; he gives management their heads."
Mr. Kravis said he had pressed management to improve programming, too, and was satisfied with the results.
"We're winning all sorts of awards again now," he said. "I think we have a superb management team and the station is in excellent shape. It's well positioned for the 21st century."

HEADLINE: The Tobacco Industry's Defiance

 BODY:
Cigarette manufacturers pulled out of the search for a comprehensive tobacco deal yesterday after Steven Goldstone, the chairman of RJR Nabisco, railed against the tobacco bill approved by the Senate Commerce Committee as sure to produce bankruptcy for tobacco companies, the loss of countless jobs and creation of a rampant black market for cigarettes. But the industry's resistance and unrealistic doomsday scenarios should not weaken Congressional resolve to forge ahead with strong legislation to protect public health and curb smoking among youths. This exercise, after all, is not about protecting the financial interests of the cigarette producers.
The bill drafted by Senator John McCain is much tougher than the settlement negotiated between the tobacco industry and 40 state attorneys general last June. Mr. Goldstone and other tobacco leaders want desperately to get the earlier settlement approved by Congress because it is far more favorable to them. It required the industry to pay $368.5 billion over 25 years but granted the companies significant legal protections, including immunity from future class-action lawsuits and punitive damages for past misconduct. In exchange, the industry agreed to end advertising and marketing efforts aimed at young smokers. Although the advertising controls were attractive, the total payment was too low to raise the price of cigarettes sufficiently to reduce teen-age smoking. 
 The McCain bill is a significant improvement. It would raise industry payments to $506 billion over 25 years, and would not provide immunity from lawsuits, though it would cap industry payouts for legal awards to $6.5 billion in any single year. We have argued that cigarette prices must increase by at least $1.50 per pack to make a significant dent in consumption, and many experts think a bigger price hike is needed. To achieve such levels, industry payments would have to be raised even higher than required by the McCain bill.
The industry's decision to walk away from the legislation does not hamper Congress's ability to go forward. Congress can force the price of cigarettes up through a new tobacco tax. It can give the Food and Drug Administration ample power to regulate tobacco and nicotine. It can write into law many of the advertising controls included in the attorneys general settlement, though the industry will fight those in court. That is a chance worth taking.
The fact remains that the industry has much to lose by walking away. Without the legislation it would be back at square one, fighting dozens of state lawsuits over Medicaid claims related to smoking. It would have no control over potentially enormous damage awards. Fatigue and the threat of financial instability drove the industry toward a settlement last year. Those conditions remain unchanged. Mr. Goldstone and his allies are probably hoping that threats and scare tactics will drive Congress to do their bidding, but their defiant posture is a mark of desperation.

HEADLINE: Risky Budget Optimism

 BODY:
After three years of preaching austerity, Gov. George Pataki proposed a New York State budget in January with tax cuts and generous spending increases designed to appeal to voters in an election year. Now the Legislature is proposing even more spending and tax cuts. The lawmakers assume that the money to pay for their programs will continue to flood in from the Wall Street boom, and it is true that the state's fiscal situation is better than it has been in years. But the Legislature's budget is risky. It would saddle New York with multibillion-dollar deficits in future years that will be difficult to close if the economy turns sour.
Most of the Legislature's priorities are worthy, but they drive the budget into fiscal irresponsibility. Spending for child care, education and school construction would be boosted, and the proposed tax cuts would accelerate relief for low-income elderly homeowners and help middle-class purchasers of clothing and shoes. But the cuts, which would cost $100 million this year, would grow to more than $700 million in the years ahead. 
 Governor Pataki has promised to veto any items that exceed his overall budget ceiling of $71.6 billion. His aides warn that simply assuming that Medicaid expenses will go down, as the Legislature did, without adopting measures to control costs, makes no sense. Fiscal experts in the Legislature maintain that their practice of re-estimating costs downward in Medicaid, welfare and debt service has worked in previous years. But obligating the state to programs that generate deficits in the future, and rely on good times continuing forever, has helped give New York State one of the lowest credit ratings in the country.
The encouraging development about the budget is that it is being adopted earlier, with less acrimony, more participation and more openness than anyone can remember. The Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-controlled Senate agreed early to their own estimates of how much money is available and hashed out many of their differences in public meetings of budget conference committees. The old scenarios of the budget being decided behind closed doors by two legislative leaders and the Governor, the infamous "three men in a room," have been scrapped.
But openness does not guarantee the right result, and Mr. Pataki should now subject the budget to rigorous analysis and veto pieces of it if necessary. If he does not exercise caution, the next Legislature and Governor will be back to the dismal task of revising their spending and tax-cut schemes in the light of fiscal reality.

HEADLINE: Taking Care of Workers And Business, Too;
When Quality Is Key in Health Benefits

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Four months after multiple-bypass heart surgery, Gordon Kernan, 52, was back at work testing products at the Black & Decker Corporation. But his diabetes grew worse after the operation, so he now monitors his health with the help of a counseling program that his employer helped create.
Every few weeks, Amie Layman, a trained diabetes counselor, calls Mr. Kernan and his wife, Mary, with encouragement and advice on exercise and diet. When one medication caused problems, Ms. Layman suggested seeing a specialist, who quickly switched Mr. Kernan to a different medicine. "If it hadn't been for Amie," Mrs. Kernan said, "I could have lost him." 
 Faced with a backlash against penny-pinching managed health care, more and more companies like Black & Decker are taking a harder look at that care, often sponsoring programs to help employees and their families cope with chronic maladies.
Employers and health plans have long paid lip service to quality, of course, but cutting costs has usually been paramount. "Economists told employers there was no way to differentiate health care based on quality," said Dr. Joshua Freedman, a Los Angeles psychiatrist who developed a program at the Southern California Edison Company for workers seeking help with depression. "So they went for the lowest bid."
But some of that is starting to change. Suzanne Mercure, who initiated the program for Edison, added: "The patient is the customer. Satisfying patients is where the action needs to be."
Companies, while continuing to insist on keeping costs as low as possible, are now pushing for quality in a variety of ways. And beyond the motivation of keeping employees happy, many companies are also trying to appear responsive to such concerns to help avoid more intrusive Government regulation.
Some companies work directly with doctors and hospitals on improving treatments, while others press insurers and health maintenance organizations to offer special programs for conditions like high cholesterol, depression and breast cancer.
The General Motors Corporation dispatched some experts on improving quality to help streamline hospitals near G.M. plants in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and upstate New York. And in central Pennsylvania, the Fort James Corporation, a paper products maker, prodded local doctors to agree on "best practice" standards for treating the lower-back strain and repetitive-motion trauma that plague factory workers.
In the long run, companies say quality care makes excellent financial sense. Black & Decker began to pay attention to diabetes after discovering that diabetes-related medical costs were growing three times as fast as other health costs, said Raymond J. Brusca, vice president for benefits. So he worked with Healthcare Management Solutions, a privately held company in Roanoke, Va., to put together the counseling program that helps Mr. Kernan.
Big corporations are not the only ones zeroing in on better care. Smaller employers often push for quality by pooling their market power in local coalitions of health care buyers.
Reflecting the widespread backlash against managed care, Congress and the states are considering tighter laws and regulations. And last month, a Presidential advisory commission recommended steps to establish standards to try to narrow the wide differences, from doctor to doctor and hospital to hospital, in treating the same conditions. President Clinton announced that Vice President Al Gore would convene a panel of private experts in June to draft national standards for measuring quality.
Employers, though, want to preempt any new regulation. "Unless we can demonstrate that we are as concerned about quality as about costs, it will be tougher and tougher for us to keep our options open," said Steve Wetzell, an official of Buyers Health Care Action Group, a coalition of 38 employers in four states that is based in Minneapolis.
Defining and measuring quality is far from easy. Even most big companies do not have enough employees to gather statistically valid information. And many insurers and H.M.O.s track only the clinical results important customers demand. Even when there is agreement on the best practices, those may soon be outdated by medical breakthroughs.
Employers must also be careful not to trespass on legally protected privacy rights. And every health plan seeks to stay clear of the appearance of having administrators practice medicine, which is illegal in some states and can open the door to malpractice lawsuits.
"Confidentiality is a major concern," said Kathleen Angel, a benefits vice president at the Digital Equipment Corporation. She said Digital was careful to work through outside firms when it recently offered advice on health questions to employees who consulted an interactive Internet site. "Digital does not know the results," she said. "We just pay the premiums."
Dr. Cris Bisgard, health services director of Delta Air Lines, said the company had "pushed Cigna Health Care to develop care management programs for asthma, diabetes and low-back pain."
Carina Orraca, the ebullient 11-year-old daughter of a Delta reservations agent, was not getting the relief she needed from her asthma medicine, so her pediatrician referred her to an asthma counselor provided for Delta people.
The counselor, Brenda Scott, sent Carina back to the pediatrician with suggestions for more effective medicine and gave Carina a lung monitoring device. "Now the episodes don't happen as often," said Carina's mother, Marta Orraca, a teacher in Peachtree City, outside Atlanta. "We're very pleased."
Dr. Bisgard said Delta was also "leaning particularly hard" on Cigna to help workers who experience low-back pain so they would miss fewer days of work, spend less time in the hospital and help keep productivity high.
Other companies, like Motorola Inc., which has an array of programs to help workers with a variety of diseases, later ordered their own versions of the diabetes program from the Roanoke firm or other insurers.
Some employers tell employees which doctors groups and health plans have the best track records. The California-based Pacific Business Group on Health, a group of big employers, is conducting its second survey of the health status of 58,000 workers who are members of 58 H.M.O.'s in the West. The results, which will be available on the Internet next year, can then be compared with a similar survey two years ago.
A few big companies -- like G.M., the General Electric Company, Motorola and the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company -- have sent their own in-house experts to H.M.O.'s, medical groups and hospitals to explain methods of quality improvement used in the companies' own operations.
Some of the most extensive quality programs are sponsored by the auto makers, spurred by the knowledge that G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation combined spent $6.7 billion for health care in 1996, a larger cost than all the steel that goes into their vehicles. In the 1980's, when they were losing ground to the Japanese, American auto companies adopted the Japanese practice of helping suppliers meet industrywide standards for everything from brakes to windshield wipers.
Recently they have applied this idea to hospitals. "That approach became a model for us," said James B. Kenney, president of the Greater Detroit Area Health Council.
For example, G.M. experts, though claiming no knowledge of surgery, recently worked with Rochester General Hospital in upstate New York to reduce the time patients spent in the operating room undergoing heart bypass procedures.
Now some steps are performed simultaneously instead of consecutively, surgical procedures are standardized and patients spend a shorter time with an uncomfortable breathing tube down their throats. Though it is too soon to look at long-term survival rates, the hospital said it had reduced readmissions of heart patients and reduced costs.
Ford and Chrysler also have a number of projects to lift the quality of care, and the United Automobile Workers union, which has rebuffed the sharing of health costs that most employers insist on, is cooperating in these programs.
But experts on health quality, like Mr. Wetzell of the Minneapolis buyers group and Dr. Robert Brooks, director of health policy research at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., say the employer-sponsored programs cannot by themselves improve the nation's health care. They say quality improvement should be based on wide-ranging national research, probably requiring Government financing.
"We need a massive ongoing search for best practices," agreed Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University. "We have zillions of groups, and each does some little thing really well. But it doesn't add up to anything authoritative."
The 34-member Presidential advisory commission, which included health insurance executives, doctors and consumer advocates, skirted the question of financing the writing of national standards. Instead, the group recommended that Congress establish a new national council, which would set goals for improving quality, and rely on the Gore panel of private experts to attack the nuts-and-bolts issues in measuring and reporting on quality improvement.

Chart: "Weighing Employees' Health Care Coverage"
Rather than simply paying for the least expensive health plans and assuming that workers are getting adequate care, many employers are starting to take a closer look at the quality of medical care their employees receive. A 1996 survey of plan members in California, Oregon and Washington found that the plans did a reasonably good job of addressing high-blood pressure, but cholesterol and preventive counseling were not handled as well.
 
PREVENTIVE CARE -- On average, only about one-third of the employees said that they got advice on how to stay healthy. Preventive care services were better, though about a third of respondents said they did not get recommended flu shots.
 
CHOLESTEROL -- About 80 percent of the enrollees had their cholesterol checked. Of the ones who reported having high cholesterol, fewer than half said their cholesterol was now under control.
 
HYPERTENSION -- Almost all enrollees said their blood pressure was checked. Of those who had high blood pressure, about four out of five said it had been brought under control.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Who gets information first on auto sales figures can be critically important, and controversial.

BYLINE: By Robyn Meredith 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
INVESTORS, stock analysts and even Federal Reserve officials eagerly await the release each month of auto makers' sales for signs of the condition of individual companies and the health of the economy as a whole.
Some people, though, wait longer than others. 
 Most of Wall Street's automotive stock analysts, along with the auto companies, subscribe to data services that break out the monthly sales figures. The leading provider of this data is the Autodata Corporation in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
Auto makers send their monthly reports to Autodata at least several hours before they announce them publicly. "In some cases, we can get it a day early," said Ronald J. Pinelli, president of Autodata.
While the big three American auto makers ask that the data be embargoed until their announcements, the data for others, including Nissan, Honda and Toyota, are plugged into spreadsheets and immediately released to Autodata's subscribers. "Our Wall Street clients are the ones where the timing is really critical," Mr. Pinelli said.
Indeed, sales results can move stock prices. So a window of opportunity exists for a select group of people to use the information.
"We're dealing with a problem of selective disclosure, which is not quite as egregious as insider trading," said John C. Coffee, a Columbia University law professor who specializes in corporate, securities and criminal law. "What we're really talking about is whether there is a level playing field between institutional investors and individual investors."
Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, criticized selective disclosure in a speech in February, pointing to corporate executives' habits of phoning favorite stock analysts to discuss earnings results before releasing that information to the public. Trading in the company's stock may be heavy as analysts digest the information and await the public reaction. Generally, the practice does not raise legal questions unless the person who tips off outsiders benefits in some way. Legal issues aside, the selective distribution of information is ethically wrong, Mr. Levitt said, since small and big investors should have equal opportunities.
The S.E.C. refused this week to comment further on the distribution of auto sales results and whether the practice amounts to selective disclosure. But the issue of selective disclosure "is something that we take an interest in, and it is as much a fairness issue as a legal issue," said Brian J. Lane, director of the agency's division of corporation finance. "We'll be keeping our ears open to persons that have complaints or concerns about particular situations and see how the practices are evolving."
Others said the selective distribution appeared to run afoul of stock exchange rules. Companies "can't selectively disclose material information and not put it out in a press release," said Louis M. Thompson, president and chief executive officer of the National Investor Relations Institute, a Vienna, Va., trade group for corporate investor relations officers, which held a symposium yesterday in Washington on the practice of selective disclosure. "You have to put the release out first."
The rules for Nasdaq, where Toyota and Nissan American depository receipts trade, as well as for the New York Stock Exchange, where Honda's A.D.R.'s trade, require companies to distribute market-sensitive information immediately to the news services before they give the information to others, according to representatives of the two exchanges.
Data companies said they were not trying to give anyone an unfair edge. "There is no plan as far as the companies doing this," Mr. Pinelli said. "It just works out this way.
"We're certainly not in a position here to gain financially or for our clients to gain financially," he added.
One reason auto makers give Autodata the numbers early is that they are eager to get back the entire industry's performance so they can gauge their own, he said.
Auto analysts said they could not recall Autodata transmitting the most market-sensitive results -- sales of the Big Three American auto makers -- before the official release crossed their computer screens in reports from news services like Reuters, The Associated Press and Bloomberg News.
But for the foreign auto makers, "just because it is not out on the wires doesn't mean it hasn't hit the trading desks," said David M. Garrity, an auto analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer. The monthly sales results "could have an impact" on the A.D.R.'s of those companies, he said.
Autodata's stance is that "unless we're told that something is embargoed, we can release it," Mr. Pinelli said. "When we receive it, we assume the information is released, except in the case of the Big Three," he added, referring to the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation.
The most recent sales results for other auto makers, though, were available to Wall Street well before they were officially released. On April 1, some Wall Street analysts rattled off the March sales results for Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda and Volkswagen. For Toyota, Honda and Nissan, analysts knew results several hours before the companies issued releases. Mazda and Volkswagen did not publicly release their sales data until the following day.
In the case of Mazda and Volkswagen, "I don't think that their stocks would really react because their sales are so small in the U.S.," said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch. But the A.D.R.'s of the large Japanese auto makers like Honda, Toyota and Nissan "definitely are influenced by U.S. events," Mr. Lobaccaro said. In fact, "their profits are all pretty much in North America these days," he said, because of the recession in Japan.
Mazda does not have A.D.R.'s, and those of Honda and Toyota did not seem to be affected by their United States sales this month, analysts said. The A.D.R.'s of Nissan, whose sales fell 42 percent in March, closed down 5.5 percent on April 1, on triple the trading volume of the previous day.
Nissan said other factors might have been more important than its sales decline. "It was more likely affected by financial announcements coming out of Tokyo," said Gerry W. Spahn, a Nissan spokesman. "The U.S. sales are such a very small factor on what happens on our A.D.R. market -- those are mainly focused on our price on the Tokyo market."
Honda acknowledged that it sent sales data early to Autodata and other companies. "We've never been concerned in the past," said Art P. Garner, a Honda spokesman. "If people thought it were a problem, we would certainly revisit that."
The question is whether "sophisticated insiders have access to more information than others," said Joel Seligman, a securities law expert and dean of the University of Arizona's law school. Equal disclosure would mean "your Aunt Mimi in Omaha will have at least theoretical access to information at the same time" as Wall Street's top analysts, he said.

HEADLINE: Ruffled, Japan Advises U.S.: Mind Your Own Business

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 8

 BODY:
As a parade of American officials all the way up to President Clinton have told Japan how to fix its slumping economy, the Japanese have grown increasingly offended.
So specific have the American economic prescriptions become that they leave political leaders here little room to save face: no matter what they do now, they will appear to be caving in to "gaiatsu," or foreign pressure. While the Japanese routinely protest the time-honored tactic, it has often been welcomed, indeed invited, by specific interest groups in Japan who use it to press for change. 
 Gaiatsu has in the past been credited by officials at the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Trade and Industry with wringing much needed change from a system intended to protect the status quo.
But there is a growing sense here that American officials have taken gaiatsu too far, that their demands have become so specific that they border on orders: Pump an amount equal to at least 2 percent of your gross domestic product into your ailing economy. And by the way, be sure to include income tax cuts and think about rolling back the increase in the consumption tax that is blamed for sending the economy into a tailspin.
"Inappropriate!" snapped Taku Yamasaki, the powerful chairman of the Policy Research Council of the governing Liberal Democratic Party when asked what he thought of the specific recommendations made by United States officials.
Koichi Kato, the general secretary of the party, who is mentioned as a potential Prime Minister, was apparently so offended by American demands for a rollback of Japan's sales tax that he began blaming Washington for Japan's growing budget deficit. "We have no intention of organizing our policies at the suggestions of other countries," he said at a lecture recently.
"For years we have been executing reflation measures in response to American demand, and the debt of the central Government has reached a level as large as the GDP."
Even Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, whose political precariousness has made him wary of making even the most tepid comments publicly, is bristling, suggesting after Mr. Clinton's remarks at a press gathering on Friday that the President would do well to contact him directly rather than conduct a campaign in the news media.
Speaking in London on Friday when he announced he would reconvene the panel that imposed fiscal restraint upon Japan so it could reconsider its actions, Mr. Hashimoto testily told reporters, "I'm not doing this because I was told to do it by America."
American officials say they conveyed their concerns to Japan privately -- including at meetings between Mr. Hashimoto and President Clinton -- for more than a year, to no avail. The decision to criticize the Japanese publicly was a calculated one, Mr. Clinton's advisers say, after they had concluded that business groups in Japan who had been pressing for far stronger Government action needed allies. Europeans and International Monetary Fund officials have made similar pleas that Japan pump up its economy.
On Thursday, Mr. Hashimoto is expected to formally announce the details of a plan to cut taxes and increase spending to help revive economic growth. Today, the Parliament approved a $582 billion budget for next year, clearing the way for the Government to consider the Prime Minister's plan.
So hasn't gaiatsu worked in this case?
"If the Japanese people didn't want the economy to be reflated, you could say it was a case of gaiatsu working," said Saadaki Numata, the Government spokesman. "Gaiatsu is something that forces you to do something you don't want to do. We've always been interested in stimulating the economy."
Japan has tolerated an unusual level of United States "advice" since the days when it was under Gen. Douglas MacArthur's administration. But the relationship between the two countries has shifted in the last decade, as Japan emerged as an economic powerhouse and a new generation of leaders took over from those whose actions and words were colored by Japan's experiences in the aftermath of World War II.
"The generation who feels the two countries are completely equal is in charge of politics now," Mr. Yamasaki said.
He is particularly annoyed by specific suggestions about how Japan should manage its economic affairs, annoyed enough to have accepted an interview to discuss gaiatsu when he normally shuns meetings with foreign journalists.
"It is fine to comment on macroeconomic matters," he said. "But we cannot accept all kinds of comments about the contents of policies. It is like Japan telling America when to cut taxes or lower the unemployment rate and ordering it to take this policy for that purpose."
Such comments make American experts on Japan like John Neuffer, a political analyst at the Mitsui Marine Research Institute, chuckle. He worked for the Japanese Foreign Ministry in New York in the 1980's, when Japanese companies were buying up American icons like Rockefeller Center and Columbia Pictures and books predicting imminent Japanese supremacy were a dime a dozen.
"Ten years ago, the Japanese were telling Washington the world needed some real leadership from the U.S.," he said. "Now the shoe is on the other foot."
That sentiment is echoed by the new American Ambassador, Thomas S. Foley. "I think the message has pretty clearly been given, and we've tried to do it politely but consistently," he said.
But many here say that the Americans are failing to account for Japan's political realities.
"The amount of expertise on Asia and Japan is the lowest I've ever seen," said an American economist here. "No one in this administration has a longstanding understanding of this part of the world."
The Japanese budgetary system, for instance, made it difficult for Mr. Hashimoto to introduce a supplementary spending proposal for the economy before the budget itself had been approved. Nonetheless, a number of American officials demanded prompt action while the budget was still pending.
The Japanese have also been reluctant to take bold measures to stimulate the economy because doing so would swell Japan's budget deficit, one of the largest in the world.
Mr. Hashimoto, who has made trimming the deficit a top priority, is politically very weak. Any of the measures the United States has recommended to stimulate the economy would require backtracking on fiscal reform as it is currently embedded in law, and any sign of backtracking by Mr. Hashimoto is sure to result in calls for his head by the party's internal opposition.
"I'm not so sure people realize the sensitivity of the political situation in Japan," said Katsuhiro Fujiwara, a managing director at the Keidanren, Japan's powerful business association, which has itself advocated same sort of stimulus measures the United States has proffered. "Many in the party see this as the best chance to upset the Hashimoto team."

Partial privatization of Social Security looks very possible.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
TWO years ago Social Security privatization probably had no more support in Washington than the legalization of marijuana. Today, the notion is being entertained by such heavyweights as Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. Privatization has become a very real possibility in part because big budget surpluses are apparently available to help pay for the transition.
"Something labeled 'partial privatization' is bound to be included in any broad-based Social Security reform," predicted Sylvester Schieber, an economist at Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a pension consulting company, and a member of the Government's Advisory Council on the system. 
 But getting from here to there will be tricky. The seeming convergence on the idea of privatization masks deep differences of opinion. Consider the playing field:
THE LIBERTARIANS For some conservative intellectuals -- namely Carolyn Weaver of the American Enterprise Institute and Jose Pinera at the Cato Institute -- privatization is a matter of cutting Washington down to size. As long as the Government stands ready to play nanny, workers will have little incentive to plan for their own retirement. And as long as pension income amounts to a gift from Government, political coalitions will work to keep the checks rolling in.
This is surely the oldest and most principled argument for privatization. Though legislators talk the libertarian talk, few really walk the walk. The libertarian stance does, however, offer a high-minded rationale for policies based on other considerations.
THE ECONOMISTS -- To many technocrats -- Edward Gramlich, the former chairman of the Social Security Advisory Council who is now a governor of the Federal Reserve, comes to mind -- Social Security's "crisis" boils down to the collective failure to save enough to pay for the retirement of the huge baby-boom generation. Higher taxes, or bigger budget surpluses achieved through lower Government spending, would do the trick. But forced saving in personal pension accounts could prove more palatable since people would rather put away dollars in their own names than send them into the black hole of the Treasury.
This argument for partial privatization apparently carries a lot of weight with the pragmatists in the Clinton Administration. And while he would hardly put it in these terms, the idea meshes with the proposal from John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, to dedicate budget surpluses to private Social Security accounts.
THE GENERATIONAL PEACEMAKERS -- While Social Security taxes and benefits create a tangled web of income redistribution, most of the transfer is from young to old. Not surprisingly, some politicos fear the losers will eventually take out their wrath on pensioners -- and on Washington. In this scheme of things, partial privatization would serve as a peace offering to the young and the restless.
Senator Moynihan, for example, wants to cut payroll taxes and retirement benefits along with opening the door to tax-sheltered personal Social Security accounts. This would mean lower costs and subsidized savings for those not yet retired, and would make friends for the embattled public pension system.
THE NEW DEALERS -- For some analysts, including the M.I.T. economist Peter Diamond and Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, privatization is a solution in search of a problem. There is much right with Social Security, they say, and nothing that cannot be fixed with a few nips and tucks and modest tax increases.
But, they reason, if you can't lick 'em, join 'em. The privatization could be transformed into something useful, namely a broader Social Security trust fund that includes private stocks, which have historically generated bigger returns than Government bonds.
Most who favor private investment by the trust fund don't kid themselves that the shift would increase the total size of the economic pie. But it probably would give lower- and middle-income retirees a bigger slice, since Social Security accounts for a bigger portion of their retirement funds than it does of the wealthy. "Why should the rich get all the benefit from the 'equity premium' that comes with taking modest risks in the stock market?" asks Mr. Diamond.
The lure of privatization has turned a no-win political debate about how much to cut benefits and how much to raise taxes into an exercise with interesting possibilities. That fact alone makes a major overhaul of Social Security more likely in the next few years.
But the new form is hardly clearer than it was when privatization was just a gleam in the eyes of assorted libertarians. So much of the support for privatization is purely as a means to an end that policy makers inclined toward big changes will be deeply reluctant to clarify the issues.
Something akin to a consensus on Social Security privatization is perhaps within reach. But the consensus is more rhetorical than real.
