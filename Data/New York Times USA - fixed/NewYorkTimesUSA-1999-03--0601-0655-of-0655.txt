HEADLINE: Computer Games Venture Into the World of Gun, Bow and Big Game

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The business mastermind behind one of the hot trends in computing today is not Bill Gates or Michael Dell, and not some Internet whiz kid from Silicon Valley or Seattle, but an anonymous middle manager from Bentonville, Ark.
Yet Robert Westmoreland of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., has been the driving force behind the phenomenal success of computer hunting games, led by Deer Hunter and Cabela's Big Game Hunter. It was Mr. Westmoreland who, by all accounts, prodded the software industry to make hunting games and then promoted them heavily at Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer. 
 "He's the man," observed Robert Kotick, chairman of Activision Inc., whose Head Games unit created two best-selling Cabela games.
The hunting game phenomenon is a sure sign that personal computing is moving to the masses. These digital diversions are priced below $20, less than half the cost of classic personal computer games like Doom, Quake or Starcraft.
The hunting games are also an early wave of what industry analysts call casual games, easier to play and more mundane in appearance than the special-effects-on-a-screen adventures preferred by what the industry considers hard-core gamers -- male techies in the 16-to-35 age range. Computer Gaming World, the bible of computer game purists, once criticized Deer Hunter as "boring" and "repetitive" with "lame" graphics.
The outdoors games -- whose audience, though still mainly male, is often older and less technophile than gamers have been in the past -- took off last year, as computers priced below $1,000 became commonplace and the proportion of American households with computers rose to 50 percent.
Five of the 20 top-selling computer games last year were low-cost hunting titles, according to PC Data, a research firm. And so far this year, the latest versions of Deer Hunter and Cabela's Big Game Hunter are high on the best-seller lists -- and more sequels are in the works. Even a spoof of hunting games, Deer Avenger, in which deer stalk people, has recently entered the top 10 list.
The hunting games have prompted an elitist backlash, derided as "red neck," "Bubba" or "trailer park" software. Yet others see the hunting-game phenomenon as simply a sign of the times.
"The computer is a personal medium, and as it is more widely available and affordable its use will reflect the diversity of society," said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, a research group in Menlo Park, Calif. "Bubba software is one aspect of that diversity."
And, of course, commercial success tends to breed respect, even if grudgingly. At the start of this year, Jeff Green, a columnist for Computer Gaming World, conceded that the industry first made fun of Deer Hunter, then scrambled to copy it. "You don't have to admire the game itself," he wrote, "but you've got to love anything that makes the entire gaming industry, press included, look stupid."
Certainly, Mr. Westmoreland, Wal-Mart's computer software buyer, faced considerable skepticism a few years ago when he first suggested the idea of inexpensive games for a mass market of newcomers to personal computers. Mr. Kotick of Activision recalled a meeting with Mr. Westmoreland in a Las Vegas hotel room during the Comdex computer trade show in the fall of 1996.
At the time, Mr. Westmoreland's concept was sharply at odds with the prevailing thinking and culture of the PC game business. The major game companies regarded video games, running on the console technology of Sony, Sega and Nintendo, as the mass-market channel.
Personal computers, by contrast, were viewed as the preferred technology for hard-core gamers. PC games, with multimillion-dollar production budgets and priced in the $40 to $50 range, strove for Hollywood-style special effects best displayed on turbocharged, cutting-edge PC's.
So at that 1996 meeting, Mr. Kotick listened in disbelief to Mr. Westmoreland's suggestion. "He described his grand vision of under-$20 software, and I looked at him as if he had three heads," Mr. Kotick recalled. "I almost walked out of the room on him. But he was absolutely right."
By last June, Mr. Kotick was ready to reverse field and plunge into the market for low-cost PC games, as Activision purchased Head Games Publishing of Minneapolis, producer of Cabela's Big Game Hunter.
But Mr. Westmoreland had found a more receptive audience when he met in Minneapolis with executives of the Wizardworks unit of GT Interactive Software in April 1997. Seeing the large sporting goods sections in Wal-Mart and the falling price of computers, Mr. Westmoreland began to think that an inexpensive hunting game for PC's could be a winner.
"He said, 'You make me a deer-hunting title, and I'll get behind it,' " recalled Paul Rinde, a senior vice president of Wizardworks.
Wizardworks, based in the Midwest, was perhaps less influenced than game developers elsewhere by the industry penchant for Hollywood-style productions and cutting-edge computing. Like most software publishers, Wizardworks taps a network of contractors.
In May 1997, Mr. Rinde visited Anthony Campiti, president of Sunstorm Interactive Inc. in Indianapolis. Sunstorm was a six-person software developer working on PC versions of simple games like pool and darts, and when Mr. Rinde suggested a deer hunting game, Mr. Campiti had his doubts.
"I asked," Mr. Campiti recalled, " 'How in the world can you make a game about sitting in the woods for three hours, doing nothing?' "
But Wizardworks was offering Sunstorm a job it needed. So Mr. Campiti, not a hunter, started researching the subject. He talked to hunters, read hunting magazines and gained respect for the sport. "I learned there is a lot of skill involved in hunting," he said.
Mr. Campiti ended up designing a simple hunting-simulation game in which the virtual hunters can use decoy calls, cover their scent and choose their weapons (rifle, shotgun or bow). It was called Deer Hunter, and it proved a stunning success.
"In hindsight, everyone is a genius," Mr. Westmoreland said. "Did the sales of Deer Hunter surprise me? Of course. But what did not surprise me was that there was a big market for casual gaming software, priced below $20, waiting to be tapped."
Mr. Rinde agrees that the timing is right.
"The growing installed base of PC's and expanding demographics have created the casual gaming market -- the hunting games are just the beginning," Mr. Rinde observed. "This is PC game software for the rest of us. People who don't care about being transported to the year 3000 and battling aliens on the planet Zorak."
"The casual game market," Mr. Rinde added, "is for people who want to do much the same things on the computer -- hunt, fish, play cards, whatever -- that they do in real life."
The other lesson of the hunting game phenomenon is that as software becomes more a mass-market product, the mass-market retailers -- more than specialized computer stores -- may become the vital channel of distribution. In short, Mr. Rinde said, "Wal-Mart can make a title, if they get behind it."
And the Bubba market is not without its ironists. Wal-Mart shoppers have also helped make the satirical "Deer Avenger" game a best seller. "There's a good-sized crossover market of Wal-Mart customers who do have a sense of humor," said Brian McCann, the game's creator and a writer on the television show "Late Night with Conan O'Brien."
But beyond mockery, Mr. McCann contends that his game is simply more compelling to play, with its "kill scenes" in which a deer can use everything from slingshots to bazookas to zap the virtual humans. "It's far more rewarding than watching a deer slump over sadly," he said.
The business model in the casual game market is a world apart from the glitzy, fantasy war-and-strategy games. Production schedules tend to be four months instead of two years, and production budgets generally range from $150,000 to $200,000 instead of $2 million to $4 million.
The low-cost economics are opening the door in the PC game market for the first time in years to tiny start-ups with bootstrap financing. One such fledgling venture is Rise Software in Rogers, Ark. Its assets so far are story boards for a few games and hopes of success.
Its founder and chief executive is a 32-year-old entrepreneur who started puttering with PC's as a 12-year-old and who may have some useful experience and acquaintances in the industry. His name: Robert Westmoreland, whose last day at Wal-Mart will be this Friday.
"I'm going down the road myself, trying to capitalize on this emerging market," he said.
He would not discuss his product ideas, except to say they will not be hunting games.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: THE RUSSIANS;
A Team of Moscow Mediators Arrives in Yugoslavia With a Plan for Peace

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, March 28

 BODY:
A Russian delegation met here today with the United States special envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, before attempting to travel by road to neighboring Yugoslavia to present a peace plan to President Slobodan Milosevic.
The three prominent liberal politicans from Moscow warned that NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia had severely damaged Russia's relationship with the United States. 
 The group said its mission had been approved by the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, and that its primary goal was to stop NATO air attacks against Yugoslavia. They also said the Clinton Administration made a serious miscalculation by expecting that bombs would bring Mr. Milosevic to the negotiating table and by failing to understand how the bombing would inflame anti-American feelings in Russia.
"We think the continuation of the fighting and bombing in Yugoslavia is extremely dangerous for the world," said Yegor Gaidar, a member of the delegation and the Acting Prime Minister in 1992 after he helped set in motion the shock therapy reforms of the Russian economy. "If the situation continues in the direction it is going now, we are confronted with a serious danger of the cold war re-emerging."
Mr. Gaidar and the other members of the delegation, Boris Fyodorov, a former Finance Minister, and Boris Nemtsov, a former Deputy Prime Minister, said that they had several specific peace proposals to present to Mr. Milosevic, but that they would not disclose them until after they met with the Yugoslav leader. The Russian group was reported to have reached the Yugoslav capital this evening.
Mr. Milosevic's response to previous mediation efforts suggested that the Russians' chances for affecting the course of the war were slim.
On Saturday, Mr. Milosevic met with a Ukrainian delegation led by Foreign Minister Boris Barasyuk which, like the Russians, had traveled to Belgrade in an effort to mediate an end to the conflict. There was no indication that they had met with any success.
In Belgrade, an official at the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry said that efforts were being made to set up a meeting for the Russians, but that he had no other details.
After meeting here with the Russians, Mr. Holbrooke, who is in Budapest on private business, said that while he wished the peace delegation well, he wanted to make clear that the Moscow group would not be carrying a message from the United States to Yugoslavia.
"We reviewed the American position," said Mr. Holbrooke, who failed last week in talks with Mr. Milosevic aimed at persuading him to accept a plan for peace in Kosovo. "There is no change in that position in the sense there is a clear disagreement between the Russian Government and NATO, but that does not mean we cannot still continue close contacts."
A senior Western diplomat said after the meeting that the Russian delegation was extremely unlikely to make any headway with Mr. Milosevic and that its presence in Belgrade would have no effect on NATO's bombing campaign. But the diplomat said the mission represented "a genuine desire" on the part of Western-minded reformers in Russia to limit, and, if possible, reverse a marked deterioration in American-Russian relations since the bombing began last Wednesday.
Members of some NATO Governments suggested today that the Russian Government itself could be useful in negotiating with Mr. Milosevic to stop armed attacks by Serbian forces in Kosovo against ethnic Albanians and in bringing an end to the bombings.
President Jacques Chirac of France has urged the Russian Prime Minister, Yevgeny Primakov, to go to Belgrade to ask Mr. Milosevic to end the crisis, French officials said today.
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey called on President Yeltsin to help find a political solution to the conflict. "I think an intervention by Mr. Yeltsin to persuade Serbia to a more reasonable position would be most useful," he said.
The Dutch Foreign Minister, Jozias van Aartsen, also said the Russians had a key role to play in resolving the conflict over Kosovo.
In an interview here, Mr. Nemtsov said the bombing of Serbia was an "enormous miscalculation" that had infuriated an overwhelming majority of Russians.
Mr. Nemtsov said the bombing, if it continues, could provoke a powerful anti-American political movement that would severely weaken the influence of pro-Western reformers in Russia. He made his remarks before hearing word of shots being fired today in Moscow at the American Embassy.
"I know Milosevic," Mr. Nemtsov said. "I know that bombing is not going to make him change his mind. It has made him a hero to the Serbian people. The United States made a big mistake."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Balkan Policy, as Seen From a Former Insider-Dissenter

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE first NATO missiles and bombs were only a few hours from striking Serbian targets last week when James R. Hooper, once the State Department's senior dissenter on Balkan policy, sipped his coffee a few blocks from the White House and talked of ground troops likely to follow.
"We now are going to have to consider a NATO protection force on the ground to go in on very short notice if the bloodletting escalates suddenly," Mr. Hooper said, characteristically speaking the politically unspeakable on the Balkans without apology. 
 It has been two years since Mr. Hooper, the very model of an earnest Foreign Service careerist, quit the Government in frustration after 26 years of toiling at diplomacy. He joined a handful of pioneer State Department dissenters who left across two Administrations protesting Balkan policy. It was not the easiest of choices.
"I had wanted to be in the Foreign Service since I was a teen-ager and read 'The Ugly American,' " Mr. Hooper said of the novel about intrigues and frustrations of laboring abroad. "It got me mad and interested in foreign affairs."
Now he plays the role of articulate, impassioned gadfly as executive director of the Balkan Action Council, one of this city's countless independent pressure groups that nip at the heels of Government.
"It's as if there's a destiny," he said of his sudden decision to retire from the Foreign Service to promote his views from the outside. "I wanted to follow my dream, and now here's the Kosovo issue front and center."
Mr. Hooper, who was once the State Department deputy director of Eastern Europe in charge of the Balkans, can sympathize with the American public in its bewilderment over the region.
"To be honest, I didn't know a damn thing about it," he said, referring to his taking on the Balkans portfolio a decade ago after years of specializing in the Middle East.
He soon came to conclude that Serbian ultranationalism was a threat to European order and to American leadership rooted dearly in the Allies' anti-Fascist victory in World War II.
In the midst of the modern Balkan violence, Mr. Hooper's father, a veteran of World War II, told his son he had finished that war in Czechoslovakia yet only lately understood what was at stake more than 50 years ago. The son tries to stay mindful of his father's lesson.
"The United States has to be prepared to use force abroad to protect democratic values and our interests," Mr. Hooper said.
"I think we're still living off the patrimony of the policies of the Truman Administration," he said of such bulwark measures as the Berlin airlift and NATO itself.
"Truman's the politician I admire most," he said, finding President Clinton lacking the statesman's instinct of Harry S. Truman. "You get that for being willing to step out into the dark to take risks, to take responsibility for policies when you don't know the outcome."
Studying the confrontation as an expert in the American home front's considerable confusion, Mr. Hooper discusses the complex problem in terms of two dominant personalities: the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, and Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Hooper finds the authoritarian Serbian leader cunningly using force to test the American leader, a poll-driven consensus politician who turned late -- not too late, Mr. Hooper hopes -- to forceful intervention and to an overdue lesson for the public about global leadership.
"Now the President has to restrain himself from stopping the NATO attacks too early," said Mr. Hooper, who was dubious about Mr. Clinton's latest burst of tough talk about Mr. Milosevic until the first NATO missiles hit Serbian targets.
"To pause would be projected as weakness toward Milosevic," he warned, estimating that if Mr. Clinton remained resolved and committed ground troops, if necessary, the outcome in Kosovo could prove as successful as intervention in Bosnia.
Mr. Hooper graduated from the School of International Service at American University and received a master's degree in Middle Eastern studies from Columbia University. His reading ranges from George F. Kennan, the former Ambassador to Moscow and Sovietologist, to escapist books on mountain climbing.
"You've got to get away from all this in order to survive," he said of his preoccupation with the Balkans.
At the age of 52, Mr. Hooper, a native of Grand Rapids, Mich., misses the friends and economic security of the Foreign Service, but not at all the careerist pressures that can make change from within a difficult task at any of this city's institutions of power.
ASKED about role models, he talks simply of his mother's lesson in persistence in gaining a college degree late in life when she was going blind. He talks of steady guidance from his wife and two grown children.
"It seems to me the fun in life is to try and get as far as you can by being yourself and sticking to your principles," he said.
"I was always conscious that we were bureaucrats back in Washington trying to change the policy," he said of his State Department days in wrestling with the Balkans.
"I would drive home every night, and the greatest threat I faced was the traffic, while there were people out there who were doing the real fighting and dying," he said as he tracked the NATO bombs and missiles falling on the forces of Mr. Milosevic.

HEADLINE: Questioning Three Gorges Dam

 BODY:
In China, where even a slight relaxation in suppression of debate can indicate a softening of official policy, it is encouraging that some publications have cast an increasingly critical eye on the Three Gorges Dam being built on the Yangtze River. The official line is that there is no turning back on a project that will destroy one of the world's great scenic areas, inundate hundreds of archeological sites and force 1.3 million people to resettle elsewhere when the dam's 400-mile reservoir floods towns and farmlands. But the insoluble social, environmental and technical problems that have plagued the project cannot be wished away, and they may now be getting some consideration.
The dam has been a matter of internal disagreement within the Communist Party for some time. As far back as 1956, a vice minister of electric power, Li Rui, produced a report arguing for smaller dams on tributaries of the Yangtze rather than a 600-foot behemoth at the Three Gorges. In 1992, when the final vote to approve the Three Gorges project was taken in the National People's Congress, a third of the delegates abstained or voted against it, even though the dam was championed by Li Peng, who was then Prime Minister. But all public debate on the project has been banned since the Tiananmen demonstrations in 1989. 
 So it is noteworthy that the Chinese journal Strategy and Management, a publication with some links to the Government, printed an article by a scholar under a pseudonym detailing the failure of resettlement efforts so far, and the extreme problems of relocating hundreds of thousands of people into steep hillsides that are barely habitable. In February, People's Daily, the party-controlled newspaper, ran articles on engineering issues and problems with excavating cultural relics that would be destroyed in the flood zone. Other newspapers have reported on official corruption connected to the project. Chinese media reports have also noted that existing flood-control systems and older dams are neglected and in danger of collapse as attention is diverted to new projects like Three Gorges.
Last December, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who is considered neutral on the project, raised concerns about the project's safety and suggested it may be necessary to bring in international experts to monitor the engineering. Li Peng, who now heads the National People's Congress, is expected to fight any retreat on the project. But the thaw in repression of criticism suggests that altering and even halting the project may yet be possible.
That is why it is crucial for American financial institutions to refrain from underwriting bonds for Chinese entities, like the State Development Bank, that finance construction of the dam. China cannot finance the dam, which is expected to cost well over $25 billion, without foreign capital. The United States Export-Import Bank and the World Bank have refused to support the project because of its disastrous environmental and social consequences.
The world is beginning to change its views on large dams. The World Bank has sponsored creation of the independent World Commission on Dams to assess the effectiveness of such projects and alternatives, with a report due next year. Major dams have been stopped in mid-construction in Malaysia, India and Eastern Europe when the governments found that the benefits were uncertain and the costs enormous.
The Three Gorges Dam is a throwback to failed development strategies of decades past. This is an important moment to show China's leaders that the international community wants no part of this destructive, gargantuan project.

HEADLINE: Super-Fast Computer Virus Heads Into the Workweek

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif., March 28

 BODY:
With tens of thousands of computers thought to be affected already, corporations and network security professionals said today that they were bracing for the continued spread of the "Melissa" computer virus with the beginning of the workweek on Monday.
Over the weekend, computer security firms said they had received an unusually large number of calls for assistance from companies affected on Friday and Saturday. Melissa, which is carried by E-mail, appears to be one of the fastest replicating viruses ever detected. It automatically tries to mail itself from each recipient's machine to 50 other E-mail addresses, computer security experts said. 
 "This message may be sitting in a lot of mailboxes, dormant," said Jeff Carpenter, the incident-response team leader from the Computer Emergency Response Team, an emergency security service at Carnegie Mellon University financed by the Department of Defense and now known simply as CERT. "When people go to work and open it up, a large number of organizations could be negatively affected."
Mr. Carpenter said the response team had received 50 to 60 telephone calls on Friday and Saturday from organizations. Most of their mail servers were incapacitated by an overwhelming volume of mail.
So far, it appears that the biggest threat from the virus is that it overwhelms networks because it reproduces so rapidly but it is not expected to otherwise attack the machines it infects. Also, the infection appears to become dormant after once using a recipient's computer as a platform to re-send itself.
As the virus continued to spread over the weekend, a debate emerged over whether it was intended as a malicious attack or was actually an Internet marketing ploy that spun out of control. The E-mail message that carries the virus includes an attachment that lists several dozen Web sites with pornographic content.
Computer security experts speculated that the virus program might have been written as an effort to promote the pornographic sites by automatically spreading them across the Internet in a way that made each message appear to have come from an acquaintance of its recipient.
Eugene H. Spafford, director of the Center of Education and Research in Information Insurance and Security at Purdue University, said Melissa could be a malignant form of "spam," as unsolicited advertising by E-mail is known.
When a user opens the file labeled list.doc attached to the E-mail, it executes a Microsoft Word macro, a sort of rudimentary program that searches the recipient's hard drive for an address list produced by one of two Microsoft E-mail programs, Outlook or Outlook Express. It then copies the message to the first 50 names in the address book, giving it the appearance of having been sent by someone known to the recipient.
"This person may have an economic incentive," Mr. Spafford said of the virus's creator. "He may be trying to propagate his list far and wide."
If, on the other hand, the program is actually intended to create havoc in Internet mail servers, Mr. Spafford and other security experts said it could have been much worse. The virus could have been written -- and could yet be modified -- to carry a far more dangerous payload, like a program that deletes data.
"It's entirely possible that within hours to months, we will see something worse" Mr. Spafford said.
Network security experts continued over the weekend to search for the origin of Melissa. One lead that several said they were exploring involved a posting made to a sex-related Internet discussion group early on Friday morning, just before the virus started spreading.
The posting came from an address on America Online that included the same list of pornography sites carried by the virus. In at least one other instance, in December 1997, a person using the same E-mail address posted lists of pornographic Web sites and passwords that also contained viruses.
"The virus hit Friday afternoon, and this message was posted at 7 A.M.," said Richard M. Smith, president of Phar Lap Software, in Cambridge, Mass. "One could assume that this message was the first time the virus existed."
Eric Allman, co-founder of Sendmail, the software company in Emeryville, Calif., which makes the Internet's most popular post-office program for directing E-mail, said, "Word macros are probably more powerful than they ought to be, but you do get something for that power."
Since the virus appears to affect only computers that are loaded with both Word and either Outlook or Outlook Express, it seems designed to take advantage of three of the most popular programs on personal computers.
Security experts said that computers loaded with Word and one of the two Microsoft E-mail programs are vulnerable even if the default E-mail program on the computer is a competing product like the Netscape Communications Corporation's Navigator mail or Qualcomm's Eudora.
Generally, Mr. Allman said, consumers need to be more aware of what information they are accepting on their hard drives and other storage devices when they download an E-mail attachment. A setting within Microsoft Word cautions users when they are about to open an unknown document that contains a macro and asks if they would like to continue.
One lasting impact from the attack of the virus is that it appears to alter the user's settings within Word so that the program no longer warns users if they are about to open a file with an unknown macro, Mr. Spafford said. The virus "turns the protections down on the machine to the lowest setting," he said.
Users can tell if they have been infected by the virus by checking the Windows registry, which is a database that contains a list of programs downloaded onto the computer.
Among the corporations infected by the virus on Friday were Charles Schwab & Company, Lucent and the Intel Corporation. An Internet posting from the Department of Energy's Computer Incident Advisory Capability noted that the virus is "spreading widely within and without the D.O.E. complex."

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: IN BELGRADE -- NATO Planes Step Up Attacks on Serb Troops;
Support for Homeland Up as Sirens Wail and News Is Censored

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, March 28

 BODY:
Slobodan Milosevic, defiant as ever and proud of his nation's resistance to NATO's air attacks, staged an eerie celebration today -- a rock concert in the center of Belgrade to show solidarity with the soldiers facing down the allied assaults.
Few of the thousands of Serbs who attended were unaware that this was also the 10th anniversary of the day when Mr. Milosevic stripped broad autonomy from Kosovo, just after his security forces had killed some 30 ethnic Albanian protesters in Pristina, Kosovo's capital. 
 Today, the Serbian security forces are sweeping through Kosovo, driving tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians into panicked flight and provoking what Western officials described as the worst refugee crisis that Europe has seen in 50 years.
In Belgrade, given strict censorship rules and the patriotic fever of wartime, few Serbs seemed to know much about events in Kosovo, or the Western reaction. They poured their scorn on the Americans, rejoicing in what Serbian television persistently called the shooting down of an F-117A stealth jet, and rallied around their nation -- and, by extension, its leader, Mr. Milosevic -- in a way not seen here in years.
The rock concert organized to celebrate the holiday known as "the day of Serbia's statehood" bore an ironic resemblance to similar concerts held by anti-Milosevic demonstrators during the mass pro-democracy demonstrations of 1996-97 in Belgrade.
The same bands played today to some of the same people, by their own account, symbolizing the unifying effect that air strikes have had on the general population. "Forget who is supporting whom, this is no time for divisions," said one of the leading singers at the rally, Dejan Cukic.
Many of the thousands at the afternoon rally -- called "Songs Keep Us Alive and United" -- wore small placards on their chests displaying a black target. One placard referred to the downing of the stealth aircraft, and read: "F-117A. Sorry, we didn't know that you are invisible." Another redefined NATO as "New American Terrorist Organization," while others compared President Clinton to Hitler, whose air force bombed Belgrade in 1941.
During much of the rally, Belgrade was under an air raid alert. The first bombs fell today at about 4 A.M., and then again at 8 A.M., with their detonations preceding any air raid sirens. Air raid warnings continued to howl after dark. Tonight, however, in contrast to Friday and Saturday night, when the city was plunged into darkness, most of Belgrade's street lights stayed on.
Mr. Milosevic held a meeting of his Cabinet and military leaders and issued a statement praising the army and the citizenry. The two were linked "by strong unity, a high patriotic conscience and determination to endure in the just struggle against the criminal aggressors," the statement said. "Our citizens are demonstrating high personal responsibility and a high degree of mutual solidarity."
There was no reference to increasingly blunt Western charges that Mr. Milosevic's armed forces and police units are engaged in widespread atrocities in Kosovo.
Western reporters with no access to Kosovo were largely reduced to interviewing the ethnic Albanian refugees pouring across its borders, a situation reminiscent of Cambodia in the mid-1970s, when the victorious Khmer Rouge emptied the cities and reporters had to piece together the scale of atrocities from the refugees who straggled into Thailand.
On Serbian state television's evening news, the Serbian Minister for Refugees, Bratislava Morina, whose late husband was a Kosovo Albanian Communist, suggested that ethnic Albanians were fleeing NATO bombs, not the Serbian military. "If NATO wants these people to return to their homes, it should stop this aggression immediately," she said.
Still, the official Tanjug news agency did announce that NATO planes attacked before and after sunrise, targeting the air force base in the Belgrade suburb of Batajnica for the fourth consecutive day. Two other explosions cracked windows at Belgrade's main civilian airport, Surcin, 15 miles from the city center. Other missiles fell near Cacak, the site of a huge military factory in central Serbia, Tanjug said. In Kosovo, four bombs hit an army barracks outside Prizren, the agency said. There was no report of any casualties. To date, the Yugoslav media has talked of dozens killed in the air raids.
At the rally, words of general patriotism came from noted performers like Mr. Cukic and Momcilo Bagajic, known as Bajaga, who said, "We should defend ourselves." Mr. Bagajic is known not to be a rabid nationalist, and he has played in other parts of the former Yugoslavia, like Slovenia.
He wrote a hugely popular and moving song about the Yugoslav civil wars, largely initiated by Mr. Milosevic, that says, "My friends are pearls scattered all over the world." Ironically, the Government is now playing the song often on state television as a backdrop to patriotic pictures of the Yugoslav armed forces.
One member of the Children of Bad Musicians, a popular group, told the crowd, "I used to play sax, but since that sex maniac plays it, I don't touch it anymore."
Olga, a 43-year-old economist wearing a fur vest and Italian shoes, said she never went to the air raid shelters because she could not bring her English setter, Loli. She is no fan of Mr. Milosevic, she said, but war is no time for divisions. "I was in all the demonstrations for democracy," she said, "but now I have to be in favor of defending my homeland."
In an interview, Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party and an organizer of the pro-democracy demonstrations, noted the irony. "The bombs have marginalized any dissenters here, and there's little we democrats can do to affect the situation," he said. "The same is also true of those democrats and moderates among the ethnic Albanians," he noted.
Washington has spent more on one day's bombs than it ever spent helping the democracy movement in Yugoslavia, Mr. Djindjic said bitterly. "Milosevic could be far more easily eliminated through the development of democracy here than through air strikes," he said. "Every crisis strengthens him. The only players that matter now are Milosevic, the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Americans."
The consequences of the air strikes are "this radicalized and pauperized Serbia and a destabilized Montenegro," whose independence Washington wants to encourage under President Milo Djukanovic, Mr. Djindjic said. Yugoslavia consists of Serbia and Montenegro, and Mr. Djukanovic is a former protege of Mr. Milosevic who in the last year has turned against the Yugoslav President. "Now Djukanovic is compromised by the bombs, and there is more anti-American feeling in the entire region," Mr. Djindjic said.
There are Yugoslav military and police depots and headquarters in Montenegro, and NATO has bombed them freely, despite a statement by Mr. Djukanovic that Montenegro would stay neutral in any fight between NATO and Serbia.
Mr. Djindjic and Mr. Djukanovic are close, and Mr. Djukanovic told him the day the bombs started dropping that no one in the American Government ever telephoned to explain the situation or to warn him, Mr. Djindjic said. "Ordinary people in Montenegro will now say that Djukanovic based his entire policy on America, but we're getting bombed just as badly as Milosevic," Mr. Djindjic said. "This will make it much more difficult for Montenegro to secede."
The evening news gave a hint of a Russian initiative to solve this crisis, announcing that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and Mr. Milosevic had exchanged letters. But the Yugoslav Ambassador to Moscow, Mr. Milosevic's brother, Borislav, said he could not confirm that the two Presidents would meet, and there was no indication that a Russian delegation, which arrived tonight and includes former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, would get anywhere with its own peace initiative. France said it was pressing the Russian Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, to seek a diplomatic solution. Russia is a traditional backer of Serbia.
For the first time today, the Yugoslav Government organized a junket for some 70 foreign journalists here -- dominated by non-NATO countries like Japan -- to the site where the F-117A crashed, in Budjanovci, 30 miles northwest of Belgrade. Reporters, in two buses, were only allowed to see the remains of a wing while local villagers danced with evident joy at this small triumph of their hugely outgunned military.
A young boy wearing a knitted cap with the logo of the Chicago Bulls stood on the American Air Force star painted on the wing, while the assembled cameramen scrambled for angles. The boy had a toy pistol in one hand while he tried to make the Serbian victory sign with the other.
The evening news said that, in addition to the wartime censorship that now applies to media, new wartime banking rules were established to fund the military, and that profiteering would be punished severely. In the newspaper Glas Javnosti today, there was a story about the arrest of the first "war profiteers" in the city of Nis, a man and his son who owned a gas station and were hoarding 3,171 liters of gasoline, 5,300 liters of diesel fuel and 1,000 liters of oil. Gasoline is nearly unavailable now except on the black market, where the price has now reached almost 10 German marks a liter, many times its price a week ago.
On the back page, however, there was a story about the opening of the yearly automobile show at the Belgrade Fair, featuring a photograph of the new Volkswagen Beetle.
Also today, Dragoslav Rancic, a senior contributing editor of the weekly magazine Nin, and his editor, Stevan Niksic, were released from police custody. They were arrested early on Saturday for offending censorship regulations with an article about Mr. Milosevic's negotiating style. Friends said they had not been beaten by the police.
No Belgrade newspaper published a word about their arrest, a sharp contrast to the solidarity local journalists displayed when Veran Matic, the chief editor of the banned radio station B92, was detained for eight hours last Wednesday. But on Wednesday night, the first NATO bombs fell on Belgrade, and, as one local journalist said bitterly, "media solidarity is evidently another casualty."

HEADLINE: Council Offers Budget Plan, With Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Asserting that the Giuliani administration has underestimated city revenues for the next 15 months by more than $1 billion, the Speaker of the City Council, Peter F. Vallone, proposed a broad package of tax cuts yesterday worth about $700 million. The contrasting revenue projection and the proposed tax cuts represent the Council's starting point in negotiating the next budget.
The unveiling of the City Council's revenue projections and Mr. Vallone's tax plan, which aides said was intended primarily to aid the working poor, first-time home buyers and some businesses, was offered as a prelude to the Council's full response, expected today, to the $35.4 billion spending plan for next year that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani presented in January. 
 In the full response, which includes specific spending proposals for individual agencies, the Council apparently has rejected a proposal by Mr. Giuliani to accelerate the start of a Police Academy class that would have increased the uniformed police force by more than 1,500 officers on Jan. 1, 2000, six months earlier than originally planned. The plan would cost $32 million.
Mr. Vallone raised concerns about the Mayor's proposal last month when he released a Council report showing that while the total number of uniformed police officers increased over the last two years, the number of officers assigned to neighborhood precincts declined as more officers were assigned to narcotics task forces and other special details.
With three months of budget negotiations still ahead, the plan could very well be restored in the final budget, but the Council's initial rejection of it is certain to raise the ire of Mr. Giuliani, who has made crime fighting the hallmark of his tenure.
Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota criticized the Council's position. "It would be unfortunate if Speaker Vallone wanted to decelerate the class at a time when shooting incidences are going up," he said. "It would seem like a complete reversal of the role he played in Safe Streets, Safe Cities, when police head count was increased to deal with public safety."
In releasing its revenue projections, the Council suggested that Mr. Giuliani and his budget team had underestimated city revenues by nearly $1.01 billion. Under the City Charter, only the Mayor has the authority to determine the city's revenue stream, and Mr. Giuliani has prided himself in making conservative estimates that in recent years have led to generous surpluses.
The early disagreement over revenue projections, with the Legislature criticizing the Mayor for underestimates, is a typical opening of the budget negotiations. Last year, the Council said the Mayor had underestimated by about $917 million, and the year before that by about $516 million. Such underestimates often allow for spending to be increased later, or for a surplus to be saved for balancing future budgets.
One major difference between the administration and Council projections is estimates of city revenue from Wall Street. While the Mayor has estimated about $5 billion in Wall Street revenues, the Council has suggested that a more realistic figure is between $10 million and $12 million. There were also differences in projections of personal income tax and other business taxes.
"You have to understand, that the executive has a problem," Mr. Vallone said before marching in the Greek Independence Day Parade yesterday. "They can't really put all of their revenue in because of labor negotiations. That's like the great dark, deep secret, but it exists. On the other hand the Legislature has an obligation to be accurate. And we are being accurate."
After marching in the same parade, Mr. Giuliani offered a passionate defense of his conservative approach to budget-making, saying that his caution offered the city protection against a downturn in the stock market or some other unexpected souring of the economy. In his spending plan, the Mayor identified more than $370 million in tax cuts, including some mirrored by the Council.
The Mayor has also formed a task force to consider an additional $100 million in as yet unidentified cuts. "I think our budget practices are sounder, much more solid, much more fiscally prudent than the city has had in the last 30 years," the Mayor said, pointing to increases in the city's bond ratings as evidence of fiscal success.
"I don't know, Peter Vallone doesn't know and none of us know when Wall Street will not be performing the way it is performing now," Mr. Giuliani said. "So, I estimate in out years, modest Wall Street performance. The good news is, if Wall Street does better, then we can retire more of our debt, we can reduce more of the gap and we can reduce taxes even more."
With the tax package proposed yesterday, Mr. Vallone and his aides said they believed that the city would be better served by taking more direct advantage of the nation's strong economy in recent years and passing lasting tax cuts. The proposed cuts include creating a city earned income tax credit, similar to those available to the poorest taxpayers at state and Federal levels.
According to Council estimates, a married couple earning $20,000 would save $844 a year in taxes, including a $600 tax credit for child care and an earned income tax credit of $181. A couple with two children earning $50,000 who buy a single-family home for the first time would save $4,382 including a $2,370 exemption from the mortgage recording tax and $1,421 from the real property transfer tax.
Other proposals include the phasing out of the commercial rent tax, which has already been curtailed and is now paid only by businesses south of 96th Street in Manhattan that pay more than $100,000 a year in rent. The Council has also proposed eliminating sales tax on clothing costing less than $110, a move supported by Mr. Giuliani and already approved by the State Legislature. The package also includes incentives for first-time home buyers, including a new tax-free savings plan.
At least nine of the proposals would also require the approval of the State Legislature. Mr. Vallone said the tax cuts, which would increase to $1.2 billion by fiscal year 2002, would have broad appeal. "We have a menu of tax reductions which affect everyone, which is really, I think, something that I have always wanted to do," he said.
Mr. Guiliani said he would consider all of the Council's proposed tax cuts, but said he might argue taking a different approach. "There is never a tax cut proposal that I am not willing to look at," he said. "It doesn't mean that I'll agree with it completely, and I might want to substitute one of my own." But he applauded the Council's efforts and said he expected smooth budget negotiations this year.

HEADLINE: Market Place: Technology;
For Silicon Alley, a Time to Rise and Shine

BYLINE: By LISA NAPOLI and SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Out of symbolic modesty -- or maybe impatience -- Candice Carpenter took the subway rather than a limousine back to her office from the Wall Street headquarters of Goldman, Sachs earlier this month.
She returned after watching the stock of iVillage, the Internet company she co-founded, open for trading the day after its initial public offering and quadruple its initial price of $24 before closing at $80.125. 
 "The thing that got me excited," Ms. Carpenter said of coming back to iVillage's offices at 170 Fifth Avenue, near the Flatiron Building, "was walking the halls and seeing the kids so delirious that their hard work had paid off."
During the next few months there are likely to be a lot of delirious executives and employees as more than a dozen of New York City's Internet companies try to go public. The stock of Miningco.com, for example, another prominent member of the group, more than doubled after shares began trading Wednesday.
The offerings, of course, will create a windfall payoff for the work put into these companies, with their young programmers and producers holding options worth -- on paper -- tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars.
But it is the company founders who really have the right to be delirious. Ms. Carpenter and Scott Kurnit, chief executive of Miningco.com, each now have paper wealth of more than $50 million.
Along with financial rewards, the successful public offerings come as more than a little vindication for Silicon Alley, the collection of entrepreneurs trying to make a go of Internet businesses in New York. They have had to fight harder for respect and for financing than their Silicon Valley rivals on the other side of the continent. The technology mainstream considered the New York companies too lavish in their spending, too focused on content by writers and designers -- and simply too far from Palo Alto, Calif.
Never mind all that. The success of iVillage's offering indicates that there are no hard feelings between Silicon Alley and the great wired masses of Internet stock buyers.
Not surprisingly, most New York Internet companies going public are on-line extensions of the city's traditional industries. There are media companies, like iVillage, which provides women's services; Miningco.com, an Internet directory that relies on human guides, not machines; and Star Media, an on-line service for Latin America. There are Wall Street offshoots, including Wit Capital, an on-line investment bank, and Multex, which distributes brokerage firm research. The advertising business is represented by Razorfish, an interactive agency, and Media Metrix, which measures the audience size of World Wide Web sites.
Companies in other New York industries, like publishing and fashion, are spinning out on-line divisions. These include Barnesandnoble.com from Barnes & Noble, the bookseller, and Iturf, an offshoot of Delia's, a maker of clothing for teen-age girls.
"New York has become the center of the Internet content business," said Fred Wilson, a principal with Flatiron Partners, a venture capital unit of Chase Manhattan. "People said that all the technology plays and all the infrastructure plays have been done. Now it's time for what you can build on top of the technology."
To be sure, some companies going public here would be just as natural in Silicon Valley, including Juno, an E-mail service financed in part by the News Corporation, and Mapquest, which makes electronic maps.
Choosing to base in New York was "a real gamble," said Kevin O'Connor, chief executive of Doubleclick, an on-line advertising network that went public in February 1998 and has a value of $3.2 billion, the most of any Silicon Alley company. After starting his business in Atlanta in 1996, he considered moving to California, but chose New York because "we're a tech company and a media company, but mostly a media company."
Six months ago, as technology stocks plummeted and investors shunned new offerings, many Silicon Alley companies feared they would never be able to go public. But the dark days lasted only a few weeks, and two small New York Internet companies, Earthweb and Theglobe.com, went public in the fall.
Rather than validation for Silicon Alley, the herd of public offerings could simply mean that investors are so addicted to Internet stocks they will buy anything, even something as improbable as a technology company based in New York.
Indeed, the iVillage offering went forward, at twice the projected price, mere days after the company's former chief financial officer accused Ms. Carpenter of overly aggressive accounting. iVillage says it stands by its financial reports, which were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
"iVillage is a lesson that the companies with the highest profile in the media earn the highest valuations, even in the face of accounting questions," said Alec L. Ellison, a managing director of Broadview, a New Jersey investment bank. "In the absence of any rational metric with which to value a company, investors are betting on the future, and that means image and brand."
Analysts are quick to caution that for any investor with a time horizon longer than the life of a fruit fly, nearly all of these companies are highly speculative. Even the biggest and most established, like iVillage, are swimming in red ink with no clear way to profits in sight. Some companies are so small and unproven that in earlier days they would have hardly qualified for a bank loan, never mind a stock offering.
Whether good for investors or not, the flow of money benefits the New York economy as some entrepreneurs apply profits from these offerings to start new companies.
"This wealth is the next-generation seed capital that will be reinvested in start-ups and will help strengthen the whole ecosystem of new media in New York," said Brian Horey, partner at Lawrence, Smith & Horey, a venture capital firm, and a founder of the New York New Media Association. "Over the last 30 years, this has turned Silicon Valley into an enormous economic flywheel."
For many of those at iVillage, though, the talk is less of pushing that flywheel than of pumping money into the local economy in different ways: buying an apartment, taking a vacation, paying for a nice wedding.
"I remember the first meeting where we talked about the options, and they told us they might be worth a thousand dollars some day if the company grew," said Kate Hanley, a producer at iVillage since 1996.
"We were like, 'yeah, but we want a raise.' A lot of us had no idea what an I.P.O. was. Now, I've learned what a limit order is."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 31, 1999, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Monday about companies in Silicon Alley that have issued stock or plan to issue stock misstated details about several of them.
For Multex, the underwriter was BancBoston Robertson Stephens, not Bear Stearns. For Razorfish, the estimated value of shares being offered to the public is $33 million, not $3 million; the company's cumulative loss since it was founded was $264,000, not $930,000. For iVillage, the cumulative loss was $76.3 million, not $24.2 million. Wit Capital's chief executive is Ronald Readmond, not Robert Readmond. Internet Financial Services' 1998 loss was $632,410, not $9.7 million; its cumulative loss was $1,903,761, not $24.2 million.
In addition, an incorrect logo was used for Internet Financial Services. The logo used was for one of the company's suppliers, Stockpoint, which is privately held and has not announced plans to go public.

HEADLINE: Computer Associates to Purchase a Rival

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ISLANDIA, N.Y., March 29

 BODY:
Computer Associates International Inc., the fourth-largest maker of software in the United States, agreed today to buy a rival, Platinum Technology International Inc., for about $3.5 billion in cash, bolstering its fledgling service business to help counter slower corporate sales.
Computer Associates said it would pay $29.25 for each share of Platinum, which makes software and helps companies run their information systems. That is about triple Friday's closing price of $9.875. Shares of Platinum, based in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., soared $14.1875 today, to $24.0625 on the Nasdaq. Computer Associates rose $3.0625, to $37 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Computer Associates, based in Islandia, has been buying companies that set up and run computer systems as demand ebbs for its software used to manage computer networks at big companies. It is also facing increased competition from rivals such as BMC Software Inc. This is the fifth and largest acquisition since the Computer Sciences Corporation, one of the top computer-services companies, rebuffed Computer Associates' $9.8 billion unsolicited offer a year ago.
"It gives them critical mass" needed to remain competitive with rivals, said Paul Rodriguez, an analyst with CE Unterberg Towbin.
Computer Associates plans to link its products with Platinum Technology's consulting services, especially in Europe. Computer Associates also wants Platinum's software for managing data and technology.
Computer Associates, which initiated talks about a week ago, will pay for the acquisition through a $4.5 billion credit line with Credit Suisse First Boston Group. It expects to pay the loan back in about four years.
The acquisition of Platinum is expected to add 25 cents a share to Computer Associates' earnings in the first 12 months, excluding charges. It should also increase cash from operations by about $450 million, the company said.
"There's a lot of room for profit improvement, and I think C.A. sees that," said Jean Orr, an analyst with Nutmeg Securities in Westport, Conn.
Computer Associates plans to complete the purchase "within a couple of months," officials said on a conference call.
Platinum Technology had $986.2 million in 1998 revenue, with services accounting for about 30 percent of that. Computer Associates had sales of $3.62 billion for the nine months ended Dec. 31.
"The services dimension is one of the reasons they are buying them," said Gary Abbott, an analyst with Punk, Ziegel & Company.
The large premium offered to Platinum's shareholders suggests that Computer Associates was competing with other suitors, possibly I.B.M. and the Compuware Corporation, said Jim Mendelson, an analyst with Soundview Technology Group.
Shares of both companies plunged over the last year amid concern about slowing sales as the economic slowdown in Asia crimped business and competition increased. Since they reached highs in July, Platinum Technology's shares are down about 71 percent and Computer Associates slumped about 50 percent.
Platinum Technology said in February that it would dismiss 1,000 workers, or about 15 percent of its work force. The chief executive, Andrew Filipowski, vowed then to lift profits or sell the company by 2000.
The companies said some workers would be laid off, and Computer Associates instituted a hiring freeze.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Declined in February

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
New-home sales unexpectedly fell in February for a third consecutive month, suggesting that higher mortgage rates might prevent the housing market this year from matching the record pace of 1998, the Commerce Department reported today.
Sales of new single-family homes declined 2 percent in February, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 881,000, the lowest in five months, the department said. That followed declines of 6.7 percent in January and 2.1 percent in December. 
 Even with the three-month drop, February's sales rate was close to last year's. The glass "is more than half full; it's 93 percent full" for housing, said Paul Taylor, senior economist at America's Community Bankers, an industry group. This year is likely to rank second in the records for new-home sales, he said.
For all of last year, new-home sales rose to a record 886,000 from 804,000 in 1997. Last year's sales beat the record of 819,000 set in 1977.
Higher mortgage rates may be one reason sales have tapered off since November. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 7.04 percent this month from 6.81 percent in February and 6.79 percent in January, according to figures from Freddie Mac, a big buyer of home mortgages.
Industry indexes that measure volume of prospective buyers at model homes and mortgage applications have also declined. Analysts had expected February new-home sales to rise seven-tenths of a percent, to an annual pace of 924,000 units.
The stock prices of home builders are lower this year because of expectations that sales have peaked. The Standard & Poor's Homebuilding Index -- a barometer for the industry consisting of Kaufman & Broad, the Pulte Corporation and the Centex Corporation -- rose 1.7 percent today. For the year, however, the index is down 23.5 percent. That compares with a 9 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average this year.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Relents on Aid to Russia, but U.S. Talks Tougher

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund said today that it had agreed on "a broad framework" to resume financial aid to Russia, but American officials immediately warned that they would permit only enough support to keep Moscow from defaulting on international loans.
The vague accord, the first since Russia's economic meltdown last summer, followed a hastily arranged meeting in Moscow between Michel Camdessus, managing director of the fund, and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia. But only hours after Mr. Primakov's aides suggested that the I.M.F. would lend Russia more than $8 billion this year, the fund denied that Mr. Camdessus had discussed specific amounts. 
 Other officials suggested that Russia would receive only a few billion dollars this year. That would barely cover what Russia owes the I.M.F. this year, meaning that the aid may amount to a paper transfer that allows Moscow a grace period on repaying its loans.
American opposition to new loans to Russia reflects how deeply diplomatic and economic relations between Moscow and Washington have deteriorated in the last nine months.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who helped engineer an I.M.F.-led, $17 billion emergency bailout for Russia last year, is now reluctant to provide more than token aid to the country. The July bailout failed in August, when Russia devalued its currency and then fired the team of economic reformers whom the United States was betting on to remake the Russian economy.
Since then, the I.M.F. and Mr. Primakov have been involved in an elaborate political and economic dance. Russia has refused to undertake many politically painful economic reforms, but still insists on a resumption of aid. An accord was expected last week, when Mr. Primakov was scheduled to arrive in Washington. But he ordered his plane to return home when he learned that NATO was planning to begin bombing Serbia.
Now, Russia's opposition to the NATO bombing and suggestions that Moscow might quietly resume military aid to President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia have greatly complicated the I.M.F. negotiations with Russia. That became clearer than ever today, when, only hours after Mr. Primakov declared that an I.M.F. deal was imminent, the Russian Defense Minister claimed that a Russian-made air defense system sold to the Yugoslav military was responsible for shooting down a United States F-117A stealth fighter on Saturday.
White House officials said today that they would open themselves up to Congressional attack if they approved a resumption of financial aid to Moscow at a moment when Russia was resuming aid to Mr. Milosevic. While the United States holds only 18 percent of the voting power on the board of the fund, as a practical matter it could veto an aid package. Today, White House officials went out of their way to make sure that Mr. Primakov understood that the two issues were closely linked.
"A U.S. judgment about an I.M.F. program," a senior Administration official said, "would depend on Russian economic policy actions and could also be influenced by broader political developments," a clear reference to tangible Russian support for Mr. Milosevic.
Even before the situation in Kosovo strained relations with Moscow, the United States had been trying to limit the I.M.F.'s re-engagement with Moscow. American officials have told the fund that they would oppose offering what the Treasury refers to as "new resources" to Russia, meaning that any loans could be used only for repaying the fund or the World Bank. Under one possible arrangement under discussion, Russia would repay the fund and receive a check for roughly the same amount the next day -- a move that, in other contexts, is often referred to as "check kiting."
American officials have gone further, saying that by the end of the year they want to make sure that Russia pays more to the I.M.F. in 1999 than the I.M.F. pays Russia. But officials of the World Bank and the fund say they oppose that approach.
Mr. Camdessus was clearly seeking to mend fences in Moscow over the weekend. He made a whirlwind tour of the Russian political elite, meeting with parliamentary leaders and with directors of Gazprom, the giant Russian natural gas company, and even dining with the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, Alexei II. He also talked on the telephone with President Boris N. Yeltsin.
Russia agreed to raise 60 billion rubles -- about $2.4 billion at current exchange rates -- in new revenues, partly by postponing a cut in its value-added tax. The fund protested when the Russian Duma approved the tax cut, noting that the value-added tax was one of the few taxes that Russia successfully collects.
The fund said Russia also agreed that its budget would run what is called a "primary surplus" of 2 percent of the country's gross domestic product, or roughly $3 billion. The term refers to a surplus before payments toward foreign debts. But how the Russians will achieve that surplus, one senior I.M.F. official said, "is still a considerable mystery."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
BP and ARCO Said to Edge Toward Deal

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS and LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
BP Amoco P.L.C. is close to an agreement to acquire the Atlantic Richfield Company in a stock swap worth about $28 billion, executives close to the talks said yesterday.
The executives also said that some of the top executive officers at ARCO including its chief executive, Michael R. Bowlin, were not likely to remain in their jobs if an agreement was reached. 
 The boards of both companies are expected to meet on Wednesday to consider the deal.
BP Amoco, which was formed last December in a merger of British Petroleum and the Amoco Corporation, forming the word's third-largest oil company, and ARCO confirmed the negotiations in a joint statement yesterday.
They cautioned, however, that an agreement had not been reached and that the discussions could still be called off.
Nevertheless, shares of ARCO surged yesterday, rising $8.6875, or 13.3 percent, to $74.0625, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The American depository shares of BP Amoco, each of which represents six ordinary shares, were also up sharply, climbing $4.5625, or 4.5 percent, to $105. In London, BP Amoco shares rose 40 pence, or 3.9 percent, to 1,077.
ARCO, based in Los Angeles, has most of its operations on the West Coast, where it is a large refiner and seller of gasoline. It has about 26 percent of the gasoline retail market in California.
Analysts said that ARCO would flesh out BP Amoco's national refining and marketing business, which is strong in the East and Midwest but not on the West Coast.
It also has major oil and natural gas fields and production in Alaska, gas fields in Indonesia and is making an effort to get a foothold in the Caspian Sea region.
"Buying ARCO would transform BP Amoco from a very powerful regional company to a truly global oil company," said J. Robinson West, the chairman of the Petroleum Finance Company, an industry consulting group based in Washington. "In the past, they have cut costs very well, but this gives them growth as well."
The main force in building up BP Amoco has been Sir John Browne, its chief executive, who took over a slow-moving and troubled company in 1991 and helped to transform it into an industry pacesetter by sharply cutting costs and forming alliances with other oil companies.
His takeover of Amoco last August helped lead to the purchase of the Mobil Corporation by the Exxon Corporation.
In the current talks, ARCO is being advised by Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup. BP Amoco is being advised by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company.
If Sir John were successful in buying ARCO, analysts said it would put great pressure on other large oil companies such as Texaco Inc. and the Chevron Corporation to also find merger partners. The stocks of most major oil companies rose yesterday, with shares of Texaco up $2.1875, to $57.75, and Chevron up $2.8125, to $89.625.
Executives close to the talks said yesterday that BP Amoco would offer about $28 billion in stock for ARCO.
"That's a good deal for ARCO shareholders," said Adam Sieminski, an analyst with BT Alex. Brown, because they would gain shares in a growing company.
ARCO has been severely hurt by the big fall in crude oil prices last year, which sharply lowered its earnings and led to loss in the fourth quarter. Analysts began to wonder whether it could keep paying its substantial yearly dividend of $2.85 a share.
Analysts said that one of the main reasons BP Amoco was interested in ARCO was that both companies have big holdings and production in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, where they made major finds in the late 1960's.
ARCO has largely lived off its production there, generating money to build its refining and chemical business.
For a time the company was an industry leader, being one of the first oil companies to add convenience stores to its gas stations. It has 1,700 in seven Western states, with 900 in California. It also built two large refineries, one in Cherry Point, Wash., and the other in Carson, Calif. Both can process more than 200,000 barrels of crude oil a day.
Rather than concentrating on exploration to find another Prudhoe Bay, however, the company went into the petrochemical business and bought tankers to transport crude oil.
As the production began to run down in Alaska, the company began an aggressive program to find more oil but had disappointing results. In the 1990's, it sold its chemical business to finance more exploration and bought an independent oil company, Union Texas Holdings Inc. of Houston, last year to strengthen its overseas exploration operations.
Its refining and gas station business has also been under pressure as new low-cost independent refiners have entered its markets, and other refiners have merged their operations and cut costs.
ARCO has not joined the industry in building stations where customers can use a wide variety of credit cards to fill up at the pumps. It still relies on cash and debit cards.
Some analysts think that employees of the former Amoco, who were considered savvy marketers of gasoline, will be of great help in revamping ARCO's gasoline business.
While ARCO has been more of a no-frills seller of gasoline, it nevertheless has been making good money at it, with profits from its stations surpassing many of its larger rivals.
"We're not talking Bloomingdale's, we're talking Sam's," Mr. Sieminski said, referring to the discount retail chain. "They're price conscious and they're doing very well."

HEADLINE: 10,000

 BODY:
It was only last fall that stock markets in the United States and most other countries were reeling in fear of a possible worldwide recession. That it failed to appear is readily apparent from the fact that the Dow Jones industrial average yesterday closed above 10,000 for the first time -- an increase of more than 30 percent in less than seven months.
The Asian crisis that sparked the worries is far from over, and the best thing that can be said about Russia, whose default on its debt precipitated the market plunge, is that the country has not descended into anarchy. Latin American economies remain troubled, with Brazil in a severe recession. 
 Nonetheless, the developed world is optimistic. The British stock market also hit a record high this month, and most European markets have moved up as well, although not to new highs. Even long-suffering Japan seems to be reviving. One reason is that central banks in all major economies lowered interest rates, spurring economic growth and providing liquidity for stock market speculation.
Contrary to the expectations of most economists -- and of this page -- the American economy did not even pause while much of the world was suffering. Instead, consumers benefited from lower prices for commodities and imported goods, and their willingness to spend rather than save more than offset weakness in the manufacturing sector.
There are ample signs of speculative excess in the stock market, most notably in Internet stocks. Corporate profits have not risen nearly as rapidly as stock prices, a fact that is likely to be important when economic growth starts to slow. But for now, America is in love with the market and happy to see rising stock prices as an endorsement of its supremacy in the world economy.

HEADLINE: U.S. Eases Stance on the Eviction of Landowners in Oneidas' Suit

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
The Federal Government moved yesterday to soften its support of the Oneida Indians' claim to 270,000 acres of land in central New York, saying it did not want to evict any private landowners from their homes.
A Department of Justice official said that the Government still supported the Oneidas' original claim that state and local governments had acquired Oneida lands in the late 1700's and early 1800's through illegal and coercive treaties. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, reiterated that the 20,000 or so landowners who lived within the land-claim area were still defendants in the lawsuit, and therefore liable for any future damages. 
 But in recent months, the specter of eviction -- or ejectment, in legal terms -- had so overshadowed the lawsuit, and distracted from the parallel effort to hammer out a compromise, that the Justice Department felt that it was imperative to assure landowners that eviction was not a viable part of the solution, the official said. So yesterday, the Department of Justice formally asked for permission to amend its complaint during opening arguments in Federal District Court in Syracuse.
It was not immediately clear when Judge Neal McCurn would rule on the Government's request. But if the request is granted -- which seems all but certain -- then it could help assuage the anxiety that has been percolating in recent months in Madison and Oneida Counties, where there have been boycotts of Oneida businesses, protest meetings and personal threats and uncivil language.
"They are listening. They are paying attention, and I think that's very significant," said Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican from Utica, summing up his discussions with Government officials. "I think this takes away the cloud of uncertainty that's hovering over all the private property owners in the region that someone is going to knock on their door and say, 'Get out!' "
Others, including Gov. George E. Pataki, want the Government to go even further.
"The Federal Government's decision to back down from its outrageous attempt to frighten and intimidate the people of central New York by seeking to eject them from their homes is a small first step, but not nearly enough," Mr. Pataki said in a statement. He added that the Government "must end its aggressive campaign against its own citizens by completely removing all homeowners from the land claim lawsuit."
Leon R. Koziol, a lawyer for Upstate Citizens for Equality, a landowners group that says it has 3,500 members, was even more blunt. While he said he believed that the Government's request took a little bit of the steam out of the Oneidas' claim, he also blamed the Government for stirring up fear and resentment in the first place.
"They used the people as pawns," Mr. Koziol said. "It was an unconscionable act, to use their own citizens as pawns in a scheme to raise the level of political discussion and legal argument in a lawsuit."
A spokeswoman for the Oneida Indian Nation, Carole Trimble, characterized the Government's request as inconsequential to the merits of the case. She restated the Oneidas' hope that they can reach a resolution that is fair to all sides.
The dispute between the Oneidas and the state officially dates from 1970, when the Oneidas filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court saying that their land had been seized illegally. In 1985, the Supreme Court upheld the Oneidas' claim. But talks between the Oneidas and the state stalled for years.
So in December, to prod the negotiations along, the Federal Government sided with the Oneidas, filing an amended complaint that named 20,000 landowners as defendants. And that, in turn, unleashed a latent sense of resentment over the Oneidas' recent good fortunes.
Like all federally recognized tribes, the Oneida Indian Nation does not pay taxes. And thanks in part to their new Turning Stone Casino, the Oneidas have seemingly risen from abject poverty to unbridled affluence in a very short time, while their neighbors have been grappling with a tough local economy.
To vent their frustration, more than 2,000 motorists participated in a rally in January in front of the casino. An even larger one is scheduled for May 1, when Mr. Koziol said he expected that 5,000 cars would travel from Buffalo to Albany to protest the Oneidas.
The next court hearing on the land-claim issue is scheduled for May 26. The court-appointed mediator, Ronald J. Riccio, who was brought in last month to try and broker a compromise, has arranged two mediation sessions and has visited the land-claim area, and said he planned more visits and more meetings. Mr. Riccio, the mediator who is also dean of Seton Hall University School of Law, described the progress as encouraging, even suggesting that there might be some kind of agreement in mid-May.
"It's possible; I'm not ruling it out," Mr. Riccio said. "At least what's possible is you can come up with the broad framework of a settlement. I think the actual implementation would take some time, but you want everyone to say, 'Yes, these are the components of a settlement,' and I think we're at the stage where I think everybody has a good idea of what the components are."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place -- Does the Dow Measure Up?;
Despite Growth of Rivals the Old Gauge Still Matters

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
It is a staple of the nightly news, of daily discussions at dry cleaners and doughnut shops, overheard in cell-phone conversations and in cocktail party chatter.
When Americans talk about the stock market, they talk about the Dow Jones industrial average. For roughly a century "How'd the market do today?" has inevitably been answered with a reference to the Dow. 
 Yet for all its longevity and accuracy as a barometer of the progress of the stock market, the 30 stocks of the Dow industrial average have, in recent years, failed to keep up with the gains of smaller, more sought after companies that are part of other indexes that track the overall market. Since the beginning of 1995, the Dow has lagged behind by a few percentage points each year the returns of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the broader index that most professional investors on Wall Street use as a benchmark for their own portfolios.
The Dow has fallen even further behind the Nasdaq composite index, rich with the technology stocks that lately have been the market's biggest gainers. Even the unwieldy Wilshire 5000, the universe of stocks which, despite its name, encompasses more than 7,000 companies based in the United States, has climbed at a rate more than 1 percent a year faster than has the Dow.
All of which raises the question: Does the Dow matter anymore?
The answer is still yes.
"The Dow has come in for a lot of criticism for a long time," said Steven Leuthold, a market analyst whose firm, Leuthold Group, is based in Minneapolis. "People complain that it has a limited number of stocks; they complain about the way the index is calculated," based on the numerical price of stocks rather than the total market value of the companies it tracks.
"But I think the rather amazing thing is how accurately, over time, it has tracked a broader index like the S.& P. 500," Mr. Leuthold added. "There are times when the two get out of sync. But we use it because it is still the first thing people refer to when they talk about how the market did today."
So far this year, the Dow, with a gain of nearly 9 percent -- and closing above 10,000 for the first time yesterday -- is more than a percentage point ahead of the S.& P. 500. But those gains mask a growing disparity in the overall market. While the major stock indexes are trading at or near record highs, three-quarters of the stocks in the S.& P. index, and 88 percent of the stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange, are more than 10 percent below their all-time highs.
The differences between the gauges can be traced to how they are calculated. The Dow industrial average is price-weighted, meaning that high-priced stocks, like I.B.M. at over $177 a share, have more of an effect on the Dow than do low-priced stocks like Disney, at about $33. That is true even though a company with a low share price but substantially more shares in circulation could be worth more.
In contrast, the S.& P. indexes are weighted by market capitalization, meaning that the indexes are most influenced by companies whose total stock market value -- derived by multiplying their share price by the number of shares in circulation -- is greatest.
A system like the Dow's price-based system was necessary in the late 19th century, when the Dow was first compiled and the calculations had to be done with pencil and paper. The first calculations, in 1896 with a group of 12 stocks, were very simple: add the stocks' prices and divide by 12.
Today, the average is calculated by dividing the sum of the prices by a fractional divisor, currently about 0.225. That means that each $1 change in the price of a Dow stock moves the average by about 4.44 points.
With the advent of superfast computers and instant reporting of changes in stock prices, any index can be calculated in a microsecond, adjusted for stock splits and dividends. More importantly for the companies that devise and market indexes for use with options, futures and other derivatives contracts, an index can be frequently tinkered with through the removal and replacement of companies without difficulty.
That has caused new indexes to sprout like mushrooms, with each seeming to slice the stock market into ever-smaller pieces. Bloomberg lists 417 indexes tracking United States equity markets alone.
From a statistical perspective, however, the Dow is among the most efficient gauges around. It uses only 30 stocks, which together account for close to a quarter of the stock market's total value. The S.& P. 500's components, which together account for about four-fifths of the market's total value, are, by comparison, much closer to a full census than to a sampling.
Recently, critics of the Dow have argued that the older gauge, having missed the upswing caused by the Internet investment mania, lags behind too far. From the beginning of 1995, when the latest leg of the stock market's upward march began, through the end of 1998, the Dow climbed 24.3 percent annually, compared with 27.8 percent for the S.& P. 500.
The difference stems primarily from the absence of the technology giants Intel and Microsoft from the Dow industrials. While the Dow has contained I.B.M. since 1981 and Hewlett-Packard since 1997, those stocks have not performed as well as Intel and Microsoft, the stars of the new economy built around personal computers and the Internet.
Over longer periods, however, the gauges track quite closely. Since the beginning of 1980 through the end of last year, the Dow gained 13.4 percent a year, compared with 13.6 percent for the S.& P. 500. Including reinvested dividends, a measure known as total return, an investment in the Dow and the S.& P. 500 would have come even closer -- an average annual gain of 17.72 percent for the Dow industrials versus 17.65 percent for the S.& P.
Even when measured since the beginning of 1990, the two benchmarks differ by an average of less than a half of 1 percent a year: 17.8 percent for the S.& P. 500 versus 17.4 percent for the Dow.
The proliferation of indexes in part comes from the desire to more closely track certain sectors of the market.
"It depends what you want a benchmark to be," said Leah Modigliani, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. "It serves to represent a universe of investments, to act as a benchmark" for investment managers to measure their own performance.
Increasingly, however, stock market gauges have also provided an alternative investment, one that frequently can be had at a lower cost than that charged by traditional portfolio managers. Today, index mutual funds and unit investment trusts track virtually every stock market gauge imaginable, from subsets of Internet stocks to the entire universe of publicly traded companies.
"Without a doubt, the Dow has a lot of problems that are well known," said Theodore R. Aronson, a money manager and market analyst at Aronson + Partners in Philadelphia. "I nonetheless marvel at how experts in the field allude to it. And it's still hands-down the most popular shorthand for how the market's done. I wake up each morning as National Public Radio is reporting the Dow, which they still do to two decimal places. Think about how meaningless that is."
Indeed, said Mr. Leuthold, people seem to be increasingly frightened by the Dow's amplitude. Hundred-point swings in the Dow often result in bigger headlines in the next day's paper, even though 100 points recently represented little more than a move of 1 percent in the average.
With the Dow crossing 10,000, perhaps the excitement that has come with each 1,000-point mark will die down. But the 10,000 level might also represent a level that has greater historic resonance to investors. For once it reaches the Promised Land, will the Dow be able to move on?
Consider that for six periods from 1963 to 1982, the Dow Jones industrial average approached or crossed the 1,000 level, only to retreat back into triple digits. The first of those concluded a fantastic run of three and a half years, during which the Dow gained more than 20 percent a year.
The Dow first finished a full day of trading above 1,000 in November 1972. But it was not until a full decade later, at the beginning of the bull market in late 1982, that the Dow average firmly climbed above the 1,000 mountain. Today, of course, it looks more like a molehill.

HEADLINE: Company's Plan to Privatize Angers Shareholders

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
Even in a raging bull market, some New York Stock Exchange companies wallow in neglect. A few, like dusty antiques in the attic, turn out to be gems.
The PEC Israel Economic Corporation, a holding company that has stakes in Israeli ventures, is one such company. Management takes a low profile. Analysts ignore the company. The stock price has gone mostly downhill since the early 1990's. So forgotten is PEC that it is slated for extinction, with its largest shareholder preparing to buy up the remaining shares and delist it as of today. 
 The delisting, however, comes as several PEC investments, including a stake in Cellcom, Israel's largest mobile telephone operator, are scheduled to go public and capture a market value that analysts believe will greatly exceed the amount that PEC says they are worth.
The Discount Investments Corporation, a company controlled by the Recanati family of Israel, is the majority PEC shareholder that wants to privatize PEC. By doing so, it would not have to share any future gains in the market value of PEC assets with other stockholders, disgruntled shareholders contend.
The offer to privatize PEC was made several months after Goldman, Sachs & Company, the investment bank, paid $78 million for a 9.5 percent stake in the Israeli holding company that controls Discount Investments. Goldman, jointly with Lehman Brothers, also happens to be a lead underwriter of Cellcom, which plans to list shares in the United States shortly.
Minority PEC shareholders have filed lawsuits to block the deal, contending that the offer substantially underestimates the value of the investments PEC has made over the years. Unless the suits prevail, the delisting is a done deal because Discount Investments already holds an 80 percent stake in PEC. Shareholders will formally vote on the proposal at a shareholder meeting today in New York.
The conflict involves a tangled story of American-Israeli economic connections that turned sour. Some shareholders see the demise of PEC as an ignominious end to a company founded in 1926 by Justice Louis Brandeis of the Supreme Court. He and other Zionists established the company to support Palestine at a time when Jews there had difficulty raising money for even the most basic necessities, like housing and utilities.
In fact, until the Israeli stock market boom of the 1990's made it easier for Israeli companies to raise capital, PEC was run as much as a charity as a corporation. Its stock is still widely held by Jews around the world who once regarded it as much as a donation as an investment.
"This company was never supposed to be about squeezing every last dime out of shareholders," said Murray S. Greenfield, a retired 72-year-old Israeli broker who sold PEC stock to Jewish visitors to Israel in the 1960's. "It was about building Israel. If Brandeis woke up today he would not be the happiest man in the world, I can tell you that."
For more recent shareholders, PEC's privatization is a fresh lesson about the risks of investing in undervalued companies. Some investors said they snapped up PEC stock in recent years because the price fell far below the level at which analysts estimated the value of its underlying investments. These investors were hoping PEC would eventually enjoy a run-up in the value of Israeli companies that went public after the 1993 peace accord with the Palestinians.
Like PEC, some investment holding companies trade at a discount to the book value of their underlying assets, especially when management is indifferent. But PEC's discount -- more than 46 percent, according to an estimate made by an analyst at Lehman Brothers late last year -- was large enough to make PEC a prime target for investors seeking the most undervalued companies on the United States stock market.
"The pity is that this is happening just as some of PEC's investments are just about to take off," said one large shareholder who declined to be identified because his company has legal action pending. Among the largest minority shareholders are mutual funds run by Credit Suisse Asset Management and the Vanguard Group.
PEC's management team, which includes two members of the Recanati family, declined to comment through a spokesman on the lawsuits or the buyout offer, citing Securities and Exchange Commission regulations that they say prohibit them from speaking publicly while the offer is pending. Goldman, which stands to benefit if the Recanatis have their way at PEC, also declined to comment.
But in documents, the company says that the $30-a-share purchase price for the shares of PEC that Discount Investments does not already own is fair, pointing out that the price is 32 percent higher than what the shares were fetching before Discount Investments made a bid.
Late last year, PEC management hired Merrill Lynch & Company to appraise its value. After Merrill's review, Discount Investment raised its bid to $30 a share from $25.50. Merrill called the $30 price fair, a fact that PEC officials said validates the latest offer.
But some shareholders fault Merrill for collecting as much as $625,000 from PEC in fees if the deal flies, but failing to extract from PEC management the sort of information Merrill normally seeks to judge the fairness of a deal. Merrill acknowledged in its fairness opinion, for example, that it did not have access to the management of Cellcom, the mobile phone operator and what many consider the portfolio's hidden jewel.
"We have not been afforded the opportunity to meet with the management of Cellcom Israel, the company's largest single holding, and thus have not been able to discuss with such management the business prospects of Cellcom," the Merrill review states.
Israeli newspapers have reported that Cellcom plans to go public in the United States this year. Both Merrill and Goldman competed for the right to underwrite that company's shares, which are expected to generate considerable investor interest because of Cellcom's rapid growth and its status as the No. 1 provider of mobile phone services in Israel, itself a leader in per-capita use of cellular telephones.
In its fairness opinion, dated Dec. 11, Merrill explored various ways to value Cellcom and settled on a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. More recently, Israeli news reports and Wall Street analysts close to the company have placed a value on Cellcom closer to $3.5 billion.
Merrill officials declined to comment in detail on the fairness opinion. But a spokesman said that the opinion explored the reasons that PEC shares traded at such a heavy discount to the value of its individual investments. It also weighs the possibility that Cellcom's plan to go public could be delayed by a downdraft in the American stock market, as it was late last year.
Shareholders opposed to Discount Investments' offer contend that the discrepancy between Merrill's valuation of Cellcom and the price underwriters now hope to achieve in the initial public offering amounts to $11 a share for PEC's current holders. Discount Investments, they say, should pay at least $41 a share instead of the $30 being proposed.
The dissenting shareholders also say that the understatement of PEC holdings goes beyond Cellcom and extends to PEC's stakes in several private companies and real estate holdings in Israel.
The offer to take PEC public, these shareholders say, does not account for a recent spike in the value of its stake in Gilat Satellite Networks, which just went public on the Nasdaq market last month. Another example: PEC has the right to convert a loan it made to United Pan-Europe Communications, a European cable television company, into shares in that prosperous concern. Shareholders say they consider that conversion right a lucrative opportunity that they will miss if PEC is privatized anytime soon.
Evidence that some long-dormant PEC investments are starting to ascend can be seen in the value of Discount Investment stock listed on the Tel Aviv stock exchange, the shareholders said. Discount Investments' assets mirror many of those held by PEC, as the two invest side by side in many ventures. The two, for example, each hold 12.5 percent stakes in Cellcom, and have identical positions in many other Israeli technology and industrial companies.
Discount Investment stock has been on a tear, with shares rising from less than 80 shekels, or about $19, at the time it offered to buy the shares of PEC it did not already control last fall to more than 140, or about $34.68, in recent days, an all-time high. PEC shares on the New York Stock Exchange, which closed yesterday at $29.6875, rose in December when Discount Investment made its $30-a-share offer, but are still well below 1993 highs.
For now, the issue seems destined to end up in court. But for some shareholders, it's an unfortunate paradox that American Jews who once bought PEC shares to support cash-short Jews in Palestine would wind up in court contending that Israeli financiers are profiting at their expense.
"It's a shame," said Mr. Greenfield, the former broker and PEC shareholder. "But if they are hellbent on profits, then at least we should have our share."

Dow Closes Above 10,000, Reflecting Strong Economy
After nearly two weeks of thrust and parry, stock traders pushed the Dow Jones industrial average above 10,000 and kept it there until the end of the day's trading. The Dow closed at 10,006.78, up 184.54 points, or 1.9 percent.
Although 10,000 on the Dow was little more than a psychological hurdle for investors, the market's move is significant in what it reflects: unparalleled strength of the economy and American corporations' dominance of the world stage. Page A1. 

Almost lost in the shuffle of the Dow's record-setting day was a solid performance by broader gauges. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 27.37 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,310.17, while the Nasdaq composite index jumped 73.67 points, or 3 percent, to 2,492.84. C11.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: IN BELGRADE;
Belgrade 'Targets' Find Unity 'From Heaven'

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, March 29

 BODY:
Along Belgrade's loveliest shopping street, Knez Mihajlova, groups of young men filled with anger and beer today completed the trashing of the American Center, the British Council, the Goethe Institute and the French Cultural Center, as scattered policemen watched and chatted among themselves.
The impact of the stones shattering the windows seemed in rhythm with the sounds of another patriotic concert in the city center, starring Ceca Raznjatovic, wife of the notorious Serbian paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznjatovic, known as Arkan. 
 "Ceca" was famous, a Serbian Cher, before she married Arkan, a proud pioneer of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. But she has taken to doing music videos with a live tiger cub, a reference to the name of Arkan's brigades, the Tigers.
As ordinary Belgrade residents walked by, or stood to watch the destruction, the young stone throwers also spray-painted obscene graffiti on the walls, comparing NATO to the Nazis and making snide references to President Clinton's sexual life.
Like many of the passers-by, they wore a "target" logo that has swept Belgrade -- a gesture of contempt toward NATO's bombs that is made more palatable by the fact that no NATO bombs have struck the populated center of the Yugoslav capital.
"I'm ashamed to see this," said a medical doctor dressed in a fashionable pale-beige suit who identified herself only as Zaklina. "But you know the bombs have made people crazy. They crack the veneer of civilization, as if war excuses anything."
She laughed then, saying, "Anyway, they are bored with being down in the shelters, with the grannies."
Belgrade is a city where people say "ciao" and drink espresso, judge the latest Hollywood movies with asperity and surf the Net. But the war is dragging it farther from Europe, into isolation, uniting the Serbs behind their soldiers, their Kosovo and even President Slobodan Milosevic. American movies have been withdrawn from the theaters, though the Original Levi's Store across from the American Center was left untrashed by the mobs.
"People used to say that only God could unify the Serbs," said Aleksa Djilas, the historian son of the late Milovan Djilas, the most famous dissident of the Tito period. "But now they've been unified from heaven -- but by the bombs, not by God."
No one really feels they deserve to be bombed, Mr. Djilas said, "even if they know that Milosevic's policies have played a big role."
At the same time, the Government has urged citizens to run to the air raid shelters for 12 or 15 hours a day, understanding that collective panic provides a sense of solidarity with the nation and its military.
"But if you refuse to go down, or say that there is no point in it, people get very angry," said Ilija, a former journalist in his 50's. "People think you're belittling their plight or somehow saying that it's all right that they're sitting in a shelter."
There is much more suspicion around, with rumors of Western spies and local dissidents planting radar guidance devices to insure that NATO's bombs find their targets. Some Serbs insist, conversely, that some devices have been planted in the hotels where journalists are staying, intended not to guide the bombs, but to deflect them.
And the city authorities, while deciding now that it is safer to keep Belgrade's street lights on, still insist that curtains be drawn after 6 P.M., as if NATO's modern weapons still depended on illuminated living rooms to find their targets.
Still, as Yugoslavia faces its sixth day of bombing without major civilian casualties, people are becoming inured to the sharp wail of the sirens. Fewer spend all night in the shelters, but there is little else to do, with nearly all the restaurants, clubs, cafes and movie theaters shutting down at dusk.
"There is a deepening sense of boredom -- the war is really very boring, especially with this monotonous war propaganda on the news," said a cosmopolitan Serb, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "My son is bored; he can't go out, except to visit friends in their shelters, where it's boring. My little one is bored, because all her favorite cartoons like Power Rangers have been replaced by these interminable news programs."
So people are renting armfuls of videos, especially comedies, like "You've Got Mail."
Yet the Serbs remain resourceful and ironic. A basement cafe downtown has renamed itself "The Shelter Cafe," offering satellite television along with coffee and drinks. A placard put up in a window along Knez Mihajlova read: "F-117A. Crashed. Low mileage. Foreign license plates. Cheap. Call after 4 P.M."
Instead of "Dobra den," or good day, people wish each other "Bombar den."
The target placards worn by so many here were printed various ways, but some come straight off the Internet (http://www.beograd.com/ nato/target/target72.gif).
And with cigarettes so scarce, people joke, the war is a superb opportunity to quit smoking.
Some of the mockery is cruder and angrier.
A funeral notice featured Mr. Clinton and said he would be buried alongside others "in charge of destroying civilization," like "Hitler, Napoleon, Mussolini and Ante Pavelic," the Croatian fascist leader during World War II. Mr. Clinton is survived, the notice said, "by wife Hillary, daughter Chelsea, mom, dad, dog, necktie, friend Monica and lots of Tomahawks and radar locators and a big family of NATO rats."
The Milosevic Government, through its censorship of the news media, has isolated Belgrade and the rest of Serbia proper from the real war going on to the south, in Kosovo.
While state television shows careful film of NATO damage, there is little effort to discuss the activities of the military and security forces in Kosovo. While Western politicians and human-rights officials are making harsh accusations of atrocities, killings and "ethnic cleansing" of the ethnic Albanian population, Serbs are informed that their forces are simply responding to the widespread terrorism of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and its sympathizers.
Mr. Djilas, the historian, said he considered that the coming visit by Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia to be a way for President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to deal with fierce domestic criticism of NATO and doubted that it would produce anything substantive.
But it would also add to what Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party here -- and an organizer of pro-democracy demonstrations against Mr. Milosevic two years ago -- called the "mental filters of censorship and self-censorship" that protect ordinary people from the reality of atrocity.
"The essence of Milosevic's system is that no one knows anything," Mr. Djindjic said. "We don't know how the economy is doing or what the Zastava factory is producing or how many are unemployed, let alone what is happening in Kosovo."
It is the same process that allowed the Germans under Nazism to discount evidence of the Holocaust, Mr. Djindjic said.
"People first need to hear information," he said. "Then, if they hear it, will they believe it? And if they believe it, how can they explain it?" As they try to explain it to themselves, he said, people will think "Maybe the victims are guilty, somehow, and deserve what they get.' "
Mr. Djindjic, Belgrade's reform Mayor for a few months in 1997, said it was important to understand how much Mr. Milosevic depends on a rural constituency that has always hated Belgrade, the sophisticated metropolis. Yugoslavia's civil wars, over the last decade, have brought more and more angry and impoverished Serbs here from Bosnia and Croatia.
"There's more of a rural fatalism now," he said. "There is more xenophobia, myth and superstition. All of this is only accelerated by the war."

HEADLINE: Oil vs. Wilderness

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In the name of protecting Alaska's landscape, you support the Congressional proposal to designate the last sliver of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness (editorial, March 24).
This designation, you argue, would also help prevent calamities like the Exxon Valdez oil spill. 
 We are 56 percent dependent on foreign oil. If we do not continue to seek domestic sources of oil, this dependence will grow. Moreover, oil arriving by foreign tankers increases our exposure to accidents like the Exxon Valdez.
Of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's 18.6 million acres, only 1.5 million acres have been set aside for oil exploration. Alaska is already home to 60 percent of the country's wilderness areas. Designating more of the state's land as wilderness would only cripple the area's economic well-being, including that of the Inupiat Eskimos.

HEADLINE: DOW FINISHES DAY OVER 10,000 MARK FOR THE FIRST TIME

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
The Dow achieved a perfect 10 yesterday. Thousand, that is.
After nearly two weeks of thrust and parry, traders pushed the Dow Jones industrial average above 10,000 and kept it there until trading ended. The Dow closed at 10,006.78, up 184.54 points, or 1.9 percent. 
 Although 10,000 is little more than a psychological hurdle for investors, the market's move is significant in what it reflects: the unparalleled strength of the economy and the dominance of the world economic stage by American corporations.
More and more of the world's profits are being claimed by the nation's corporations. "Back in 1990 the U.S. share was 36 percent; last year, it was 44 percent," said Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers in New York. "That goes a long way toward explaining why U.S. equities have had such exemplary performance."
The Dow has doubled in less than four years; it reached 5,000 in November 1995. It is up nearly tenfold since 1982.
"The market's ability to sustain itself through all sorts of climates and economic conditions -- inflation/ deflation, growth/lack of growth -- has been impressive," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi & Associates in Greenwich, Conn., and a global trading consultant for Deutsche Bank. "The ease and the consistency: that's what's so surprising about the market."
A lurking concern, however, is just how narrow the market's advance has been. A growing portion of Americans' investment money is devoted to the 30 well-known companies in the Dow and the components of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose near its record yesterday. But many portfolios have not matched the performance of the Dow and the S.& P. That is because a relatively small number of stocks have pulled the indexes higher. The winners have been the best-known stocks with household names, stocks like General Electric, American Express and Wal-Mart Stores.
The number of stocks that are down significantly in the broad market far outpaces the number that are up substantially.
Fully 76 percent of all stocks are trailing the S.& P.'s return by 15 percent or more. On the Nasdaq, 93 percent of stocks now fetch prices 10 percent or more below their highs of the last 52 weeks, while 88 percent of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange are in that category. Among the S.& P. stocks, three out of four are at least 10 percent off their highs.
According to statisticians at Salomon Smith Barney, the stocks in the S.& P. 500 were on average 22.6 percent off their highs as of Friday, while the New York Stock Exchange issues were on average 33.4 percent below their peaks. Showing just how concentrated this rally has been among big stocks, the Nasdaq stocks are on average 41.8 percent below their peaks. And this calculation factors in many of the hot technology and Internet stocks.
Neither has the road to Dow 10,000 been pothole free. The financial crisis that began in Asia with the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 and migrated to Russia last summer and then to Brazil gave stock market investors their first taste of significant losses in eight years. But three cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board turned stocks around last fall.
Economic problems still simmer overseas: fourth-quarter data from Japan, Germany and much of Latin America show declines in gross domestic products there. But difficulties abroad have only served to make the United States stock market more of a haven to investors worldwide. Because the United States is almost alone in experiencing solid growth now, stocks of big American companies are viewed as enticing. Even the increasingly grim situation in Kosovo did not hold back investors yesterday.
Ralph J. Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential Securities, was an early Wall Street believer in Dow 10,000. On March 16, when the average first topped 10,000 and then retreated, Mr. Acampora exulted: "It's exciting. It's America. We all should get up and sing 'God Bless America.' These are our big stocks that are leading. It's anything but irrational."
The stock market surely is America today. An estimated 45 percent of American households own equities, up from about 14 percent in 1980.
And Americans who have been in the market during the 1990's have been riding a superpowered engine of wealth creation. Over the last decade, according to the Federal Reserve System, the value of stocks held by households is up 381 percent, before inflation, handily beating real estate assets, which were up 55 percent. The value of stocks held by households rose to $10.77 trillion last year and represented 25 percent of total household assets, up from 8 percent 15 years ago.
The increasing enthusiasm for stocks has been well founded. For the last five years, the compounded annual return on the S.& P. 500, including dividends, has averaged 24 percent, more than double the 10.9 percent median annual increase in the index since 1926.
As for the period ahead, Mr. Acampora predicts that the Dow will hit 11,500 this year, a 15 percent gain from yesterday's close.
Behind the long bull market are several factors -- declining interest rates, low inflation, increasing productivity as a result of advancements in technology -- that have helped propel corporations to new levels of efficiency.
"The lower rate structure has clearly been the majority of strength in the market," said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment officer at BankBoston. He contends that lower rates account for 80 percent of the return in the stock market this decade. "Only 20 percent was the result of expanding earnings," he said.
But interest rates would never have fallen had inflation not dwindled. On an annualized basis, consumer prices are rising 1.6 percent, well below the average annual rate of 3.2 percent since 1926.
One reason inflation is virtually nonexistent even after years of economic strength is that labor costs remain in the cellar. So even as the economy expands, usually a precursor to higher inflation, there is little threat of overall price increases.
Other factors behind the push to Dow 10,000 include an increase in the money supply, falling commodity prices and a very recent and large decline in total shares outstanding. In the fourth quarter of last year, for example, the total shares outstanding shrank by $178 billion, meaning investors had fewer stocks from which to choose.
Still, the rising tides of both the Dow and the S.& P. index have not been enough to lift all investors' fortunes. With so many stocks underwater, the market's rally sits on thinner and thinner pilings.
It is in fact a worry to many strategists that the market has become even more bifurcated -- a few haves and many have-nots -- than it was last year.
While investors rhapsodize over big, famous-name stocks like Microsoft and McDonald's, smaller issues are scorned. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks is down 7.7 percent for the year.
But Timothy J. Morris, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust in New York, says that this market split makes sense. "You could make a very strong argument that investors have acted rationally, rewarding companies that have very strong earnings gains and penalizing ones that haven't," he said.
Nonetheless, some of the forces that have helped push the market higher have been losing steam in recent weeks. That leads some market analysts to wonder how much more investors can expect from stocks this year.
The growth in the nation's money supply has slowed substantially this year. That growth in money, as measured in the broadest sense to include money market funds, currency in circulation, checking and savings accounts, helped stabilize the stock market during the financial crises last fall. Much of the additional money found its way into equities. A decline in that growth could put a lid on stocks. Early this year, according to Christine Callies, equity strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, annualized growth in money supply fell to 8.4 percent from 16.4 percent.
Interest rates have also been nudged higher by bond traders, nervous that strong economic growth in the United States could ignite inflation. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond stands at 5.64 percent, well above the 5.10 percent level at the start of the year. The jump could be temporary, of course, but every increase in rates makes bonds slightly more attractive when compared with stocks.
Another worry is that violent price swings in stocks are increasing. According to the Leuthold Group, in the first two months of the year, the S.& P. closed each day with an up or down move of 1 percent or more 45 percent of the time. Between 1992 and 1998, such moves took place only 8 percent of the time.
Even as the Dow reached the milestone yesterday, Tom Telegades, who said he works for an Internet company, shrugged off its importance on his way through Grand Central Terminal. "I'm in the market, but it has no impact on me whatsoever," he said. "It doesn't make any difference in my investment strategy. I'm not doing anything extra because of it."
Such tepid enthusiasm has not been the norm in recent years. According to James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, during the last five years, declines in the stock market have occurred on about one out of four days. Only during the bull stampede beginning in 1926 and extending to 1929 was there less downward movement.
This outsized performance has also put stocks at valuations never seen before. The stocks in the S.& P. 500 are trading at 34 times their earnings, more than double the median historical valuation of around 15 times. And the value of the stock market now exceeds the gross domestic product by a sizable amount.
Regardless, United States stocks are for now very much the place to be. Eight years of rising share prices are a powerful draw.

"Lately, Stocks Have Been the Road to Riches"
In the years after the Dow Jones industrial average first neared 1,000 in the 1960's, stock prices failed to keep up with the growth of the overall economy, as shown by the gross domestic product; with inflation, as shown by the Consumer Price Index; with house prices or with gold. But in recent years stock prices have risen much more rapidly than the other measures, and have now exceeded 1960's peaks for all except the G.D.P. In the following charts, a rising line indicates the Dow did better than the other measure during the period.
 Graph tracks the Dow Jones industrial average, indexed to the following: the gross domestic product; single-family home prices; gold prices; the consumer price index. Data tracked since 1965. (pg. C12)
 
"By Any Measure The Dow Is on a Roll"
The Dow Jones industrial's performance has been extraordinary whether graphed on a conventional scale, right, or on a logarithmic scale, left, which gives the same visual weight to comparable percentage changes.
The bull market that began in 1990 is not as great in percentage terms as the bull market that began in 1921. And the bear market that began in 1929 was much deeper than the brief crash of 1987.
Graph compared a conventional scale of the Dow and a logarithmic scale of the Dow (which is based on percentage changes), plotted monthly, since 1896. It highlights bear and bull markets.

HEADLINE: Computer Associates to Purchase a Rival

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: ISLANDIA, N.Y., March 29

 BODY:
Computer Associates International Inc., the fourth-largest maker of software in the United States, agreed today to buy a rival, Platinum Technology International Inc., for about $3.5 billion in cash, bolstering its fledgling service business to help counter slower corporate sales.
Computer Associates said it would pay $29.25 for each share of Platinum, which makes software and helps companies run their information systems. That is about triple Friday's closing price of $9.875. Shares of Platinum, based in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., soared $14.1875 today, to $24.0625 on the Nasdaq. Computer Associates rose $3.0625, to $37 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Computer Associates, based in Islandia, has been buying companies that set up and run computer systems as demand ebbs for its software used to manage computer networks at big companies. It is also facing increased competition from rivals such as BMC Software Inc. This is the fifth and largest acquisition since the Computer Sciences Corporation, one of the top computer-services companies, rebuffed Computer Associates' $9.8 billion unsolicited offer a year ago.
"It gives them critical mass" needed to remain competitive with rivals, said Paul Rodriguez, an analyst with CE Unterberg Towbin.
Computer Associates plans to link its products with Platinum Technology's consulting services, especially in Europe. Computer Associates also wants Platinum's software for managing data and technology.
Computer Associates, which initiated talks about a week ago, will pay for the acquisition through a $4.5 billion credit line with Credit Suisse First Boston Group. It expects to pay the loan back in about four years.
The acquisition of Platinum is expected to add 25 cents a share to Computer Associates' earnings in the first 12 months, excluding charges. It should also increase cash from operations by about $450 million, the company said.
"There's a lot of room for profit improvement, and I think C.A. sees that," said Jean Orr, an analyst with Nutmeg Securities in Westport, Conn.
Computer Associates plans to complete the purchase "within a couple of months," officials said on a conference call.
Platinum Technology had $986.2 million in 1998 revenue, with services accounting for about 30 percent of that. Computer Associates had sales of $3.62 billion for the nine months ended Dec. 31.
"The services dimension is one of the reasons they are buying them," said Gary Abbott, an analyst with Punk, Ziegel & Company.
The large premium offered to Platinum's shareholders suggests that Computer Associates was competing with other suitors, possibly I.B.M. and the Compuware Corporation, said Jim Mendelson, an analyst with Soundview Technology Group.
Shares of both companies plunged over the last year amid concern about slowing sales as the economic slowdown in Asia crimped business and competition increased. Since they reached highs in July, Platinum Technology's shares are down about 71 percent and Computer Associates slumped about 50 percent.
Platinum Technology said in February that it would dismiss 1,000 workers, or about 15 percent of its work force. The chief executive, Andrew Filipowski, vowed then to lift profits or sell the company by 2000.
The companies said some workers would be laid off, and Computer Associates instituted a hiring freeze.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Declined in February

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
New-home sales unexpectedly fell in February for a third consecutive month, suggesting that higher mortgage rates might prevent the housing market this year from matching the record pace of 1998, the Commerce Department reported today.
Sales of new single-family homes declined 2 percent in February, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 881,000, the lowest in five months, the department said. That followed declines of 6.7 percent in January and 2.1 percent in December. 
 Even with the three-month drop, February's sales rate was close to last year's. The glass "is more than half full; it's 93 percent full" for housing, said Paul Taylor, senior economist at America's Community Bankers, an industry group. This year is likely to rank second in the records for new-home sales, he said.
For all of last year, new-home sales rose to a record 886,000 from 804,000 in 1997. Last year's sales beat the record of 819,000 set in 1977.
Higher mortgage rates may be one reason sales have tapered off since November. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 7.04 percent this month from 6.81 percent in February and 6.79 percent in January, according to figures from Freddie Mac, a big buyer of home mortgages.
Industry indexes that measure volume of prospective buyers at model homes and mortgage applications have also declined. Analysts had expected February new-home sales to rise seven-tenths of a percent, to an annual pace of 924,000 units.
The stock prices of home builders are lower this year because of expectations that sales have peaked. The Standard & Poor's Homebuilding Index -- a barometer for the industry consisting of Kaufman & Broad, the Pulte Corporation and the Centex Corporation -- rose 1.7 percent today. For the year, however, the index is down 23.5 percent. That compares with a 9 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average this year.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Relents on Aid to Russia, but U.S. Talks Tougher

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund said today that it had agreed on "a broad framework" to resume financial aid to Russia, but American officials immediately warned that they would permit only enough support to keep Moscow from defaulting on international loans.
The vague accord, the first since Russia's economic meltdown last summer, followed a hastily arranged meeting in Moscow between Michel Camdessus, managing director of the fund, and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia. But only hours after Mr. Primakov's aides suggested that the I.M.F. would lend Russia more than $8 billion this year, the fund denied that Mr. Camdessus had discussed specific amounts. 
 Other officials suggested that Russia would receive only a few billion dollars this year. That would barely cover what Russia owes the I.M.F. this year, meaning that the aid may amount to a paper transfer that allows Moscow a grace period on repaying its loans.
American opposition to new loans to Russia reflects how deeply diplomatic and economic relations between Moscow and Washington have deteriorated in the last nine months.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who helped engineer an I.M.F.-led, $17 billion emergency bailout for Russia last year, is now reluctant to provide more than token aid to the country. The July bailout failed in August, when Russia devalued its currency and then fired the team of economic reformers whom the United States was betting on to remake the Russian economy.
Since then, the I.M.F. and Mr. Primakov have been involved in an elaborate political and economic dance. Russia has refused to undertake many politically painful economic reforms, but still insists on a resumption of aid. An accord was expected last week, when Mr. Primakov was scheduled to arrive in Washington. But he ordered his plane to return home when he learned that NATO was planning to begin bombing Serbia.
Now, Russia's opposition to the NATO bombing and suggestions that Moscow might quietly resume military aid to President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia have greatly complicated the I.M.F. negotiations with Russia. That became clearer than ever today, when, only hours after Mr. Primakov declared that an I.M.F. deal was imminent, the Russian Defense Minister claimed that a Russian-made air defense system sold to the Yugoslav military was responsible for shooting down a United States F-117A stealth fighter on Saturday.
White House officials said today that they would open themselves up to Congressional attack if they approved a resumption of financial aid to Moscow at a moment when Russia was resuming aid to Mr. Milosevic. While the United States holds only 18 percent of the voting power on the board of the fund, as a practical matter it could veto an aid package. Today, White House officials went out of their way to make sure that Mr. Primakov understood that the two issues were closely linked.
"A U.S. judgment about an I.M.F. program," a senior Administration official said, "would depend on Russian economic policy actions and could also be influenced by broader political developments," a clear reference to tangible Russian support for Mr. Milosevic.
Even before the situation in Kosovo strained relations with Moscow, the United States had been trying to limit the I.M.F.'s re-engagement with Moscow. American officials have told the fund that they would oppose offering what the Treasury refers to as "new resources" to Russia, meaning that any loans could be used only for repaying the fund or the World Bank. Under one possible arrangement under discussion, Russia would repay the fund and receive a check for roughly the same amount the next day -- a move that, in other contexts, is often referred to as "check kiting."
American officials have gone further, saying that by the end of the year they want to make sure that Russia pays more to the I.M.F. in 1999 than the I.M.F. pays Russia. But officials of the World Bank and the fund say they oppose that approach.
Mr. Camdessus was clearly seeking to mend fences in Moscow over the weekend. He made a whirlwind tour of the Russian political elite, meeting with parliamentary leaders and with directors of Gazprom, the giant Russian natural gas company, and even dining with the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, Alexei II. He also talked on the telephone with President Boris N. Yeltsin.
Russia agreed to raise 60 billion rubles -- about $2.4 billion at current exchange rates -- in new revenues, partly by postponing a cut in its value-added tax. The fund protested when the Russian Duma approved the tax cut, noting that the value-added tax was one of the few taxes that Russia successfully collects.
The fund said Russia also agreed that its budget would run what is called a "primary surplus" of 2 percent of the country's gross domestic product, or roughly $3 billion. The term refers to a surplus before payments toward foreign debts. But how the Russians will achieve that surplus, one senior I.M.F. official said, "is still a considerable mystery."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
BP and ARCO Said to Edge Toward Deal

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS and LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
BP Amoco P.L.C. is close to an agreement to acquire the Atlantic Richfield Company in a stock swap worth about $28 billion, executives close to the talks said yesterday.
The executives also said that some of the top executive officers at ARCO including its chief executive, Michael R. Bowlin, were not likely to remain in their jobs if an agreement was reached. 
 The boards of both companies are expected to meet on Wednesday to consider the deal.
BP Amoco, which was formed last December in a merger of British Petroleum and the Amoco Corporation, forming the word's third-largest oil company, and ARCO confirmed the negotiations in a joint statement yesterday.
They cautioned, however, that an agreement had not been reached and that the discussions could still be called off.
Nevertheless, shares of ARCO surged yesterday, rising $8.6875, or 13.3 percent, to $74.0625, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The American depository shares of BP Amoco, each of which represents six ordinary shares, were also up sharply, climbing $4.5625, or 4.5 percent, to $105. In London, BP Amoco shares rose 40 pence, or 3.9 percent, to 1,077.
ARCO, based in Los Angeles, has most of its operations on the West Coast, where it is a large refiner and seller of gasoline. It has about 26 percent of the gasoline retail market in California.
Analysts said that ARCO would flesh out BP Amoco's national refining and marketing business, which is strong in the East and Midwest but not on the West Coast.
It also has major oil and natural gas fields and production in Alaska, gas fields in Indonesia and is making an effort to get a foothold in the Caspian Sea region.
"Buying ARCO would transform BP Amoco from a very powerful regional company to a truly global oil company," said J. Robinson West, the chairman of the Petroleum Finance Company, an industry consulting group based in Washington. "In the past, they have cut costs very well, but this gives them growth as well."
The main force in building up BP Amoco has been Sir John Browne, its chief executive, who took over a slow-moving and troubled company in 1991 and helped to transform it into an industry pacesetter by sharply cutting costs and forming alliances with other oil companies.
His takeover of Amoco last August helped lead to the purchase of the Mobil Corporation by the Exxon Corporation.
In the current talks, ARCO is being advised by Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup. BP Amoco is being advised by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company.
If Sir John were successful in buying ARCO, analysts said it would put great pressure on other large oil companies such as Texaco Inc. and the Chevron Corporation to also find merger partners. The stocks of most major oil companies rose yesterday, with shares of Texaco up $2.1875, to $57.75, and Chevron up $2.8125, to $89.625.
Executives close to the talks said yesterday that BP Amoco would offer about $28 billion in stock for ARCO.
"That's a good deal for ARCO shareholders," said Adam Sieminski, an analyst with BT Alex. Brown, because they would gain shares in a growing company.
ARCO has been severely hurt by the big fall in crude oil prices last year, which sharply lowered its earnings and led to loss in the fourth quarter. Analysts began to wonder whether it could keep paying its substantial yearly dividend of $2.85 a share.
Analysts said that one of the main reasons BP Amoco was interested in ARCO was that both companies have big holdings and production in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, where they made major finds in the late 1960's.
ARCO has largely lived off its production there, generating money to build its refining and chemical business.
For a time the company was an industry leader, being one of the first oil companies to add convenience stores to its gas stations. It has 1,700 in seven Western states, with 900 in California. It also built two large refineries, one in Cherry Point, Wash., and the other in Carson, Calif. Both can process more than 200,000 barrels of crude oil a day.
Rather than concentrating on exploration to find another Prudhoe Bay, however, the company went into the petrochemical business and bought tankers to transport crude oil.
As the production began to run down in Alaska, the company began an aggressive program to find more oil but had disappointing results. In the 1990's, it sold its chemical business to finance more exploration and bought an independent oil company, Union Texas Holdings Inc. of Houston, last year to strengthen its overseas exploration operations.
Its refining and gas station business has also been under pressure as new low-cost independent refiners have entered its markets, and other refiners have merged their operations and cut costs.
ARCO has not joined the industry in building stations where customers can use a wide variety of credit cards to fill up at the pumps. It still relies on cash and debit cards.
Some analysts think that employees of the former Amoco, who were considered savvy marketers of gasoline, will be of great help in revamping ARCO's gasoline business.
While ARCO has been more of a no-frills seller of gasoline, it nevertheless has been making good money at it, with profits from its stations surpassing many of its larger rivals.
"We're not talking Bloomingdale's, we're talking Sam's," Mr. Sieminski said, referring to the discount retail chain. "They're price conscious and they're doing very well."

 BODY:
It was only last fall that stock markets in the United States and most other countries were reeling in fear of a possible worldwide recession. That it failed to appear is readily apparent from the fact that the Dow Jones industrial average yesterday closed above 10,000 for the first time -- an increase of more than 30 percent in less than seven months.
The Asian crisis that sparked the worries is far from over, and the best thing that can be said about Russia, whose default on its debt precipitated the market plunge, is that the country has not descended into anarchy. Latin American economies remain troubled, with Brazil in a severe recession. 
 Nonetheless, the developed world is optimistic. The British stock market also hit a record high this month, and most European markets have moved up as well, although not to new highs. Even long-suffering Japan seems to be reviving. One reason is that central banks in all major economies lowered interest rates, spurring economic growth and providing liquidity for stock market speculation.
Contrary to the expectations of most economists -- and of this page -- the American economy did not even pause while much of the world was suffering. Instead, consumers benefited from lower prices for commodities and imported goods, and their willingness to spend rather than save more than offset weakness in the manufacturing sector.
There are ample signs of speculative excess in the stock market, most notably in Internet stocks. Corporate profits have not risen nearly as rapidly as stock prices, a fact that is likely to be important when economic growth starts to slow. But for now, America is in love with the market and happy to see rising stock prices as an endorsement of its supremacy in the world economy.

HEADLINE: U.S. Eases Stance on the Eviction of Landowners in Oneidas' Suit

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
The Federal Government moved yesterday to soften its support of the Oneida Indians' claim to 270,000 acres of land in central New York, saying it did not want to evict any private landowners from their homes.
A Department of Justice official said that the Government still supported the Oneidas' original claim that state and local governments had acquired Oneida lands in the late 1700's and early 1800's through illegal and coercive treaties. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, reiterated that the 20,000 or so landowners who lived within the land-claim area were still defendants in the lawsuit, and therefore liable for any future damages. 
 But in recent months, the specter of eviction -- or ejectment, in legal terms -- had so overshadowed the lawsuit, and distracted from the parallel effort to hammer out a compromise, that the Justice Department felt that it was imperative to assure landowners that eviction was not a viable part of the solution, the official said. So yesterday, the Department of Justice formally asked for permission to amend its complaint during opening arguments in Federal District Court in Syracuse.
It was not immediately clear when Judge Neal McCurn would rule on the Government's request. But if the request is granted -- which seems all but certain -- then it could help assuage the anxiety that has been percolating in recent months in Madison and Oneida Counties, where there have been boycotts of Oneida businesses, protest meetings and personal threats and uncivil language.
"They are listening. They are paying attention, and I think that's very significant," said Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican from Utica, summing up his discussions with Government officials. "I think this takes away the cloud of uncertainty that's hovering over all the private property owners in the region that someone is going to knock on their door and say, 'Get out!' "
Others, including Gov. George E. Pataki, want the Government to go even further.
"The Federal Government's decision to back down from its outrageous attempt to frighten and intimidate the people of central New York by seeking to eject them from their homes is a small first step, but not nearly enough," Mr. Pataki said in a statement. He added that the Government "must end its aggressive campaign against its own citizens by completely removing all homeowners from the land claim lawsuit."
Leon R. Koziol, a lawyer for Upstate Citizens for Equality, a landowners group that says it has 3,500 members, was even more blunt. While he said he believed that the Government's request took a little bit of the steam out of the Oneidas' claim, he also blamed the Government for stirring up fear and resentment in the first place.
"They used the people as pawns," Mr. Koziol said. "It was an unconscionable act, to use their own citizens as pawns in a scheme to raise the level of political discussion and legal argument in a lawsuit."
A spokeswoman for the Oneida Indian Nation, Carole Trimble, characterized the Government's request as inconsequential to the merits of the case. She restated the Oneidas' hope that they can reach a resolution that is fair to all sides.
The dispute between the Oneidas and the state officially dates from 1970, when the Oneidas filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court saying that their land had been seized illegally. In 1985, the Supreme Court upheld the Oneidas' claim. But talks between the Oneidas and the state stalled for years.
So in December, to prod the negotiations along, the Federal Government sided with the Oneidas, filing an amended complaint that named 20,000 landowners as defendants. And that, in turn, unleashed a latent sense of resentment over the Oneidas' recent good fortunes.
Like all federally recognized tribes, the Oneida Indian Nation does not pay taxes. And thanks in part to their new Turning Stone Casino, the Oneidas have seemingly risen from abject poverty to unbridled affluence in a very short time, while their neighbors have been grappling with a tough local economy.
To vent their frustration, more than 2,000 motorists participated in a rally in January in front of the casino. An even larger one is scheduled for May 1, when Mr. Koziol said he expected that 5,000 cars would travel from Buffalo to Albany to protest the Oneidas.
The next court hearing on the land-claim issue is scheduled for May 26. The court-appointed mediator, Ronald J. Riccio, who was brought in last month to try and broker a compromise, has arranged two mediation sessions and has visited the land-claim area, and said he planned more visits and more meetings. Mr. Riccio, the mediator who is also dean of Seton Hall University School of Law, described the progress as encouraging, even suggesting that there might be some kind of agreement in mid-May.
"It's possible; I'm not ruling it out," Mr. Riccio said. "At least what's possible is you can come up with the broad framework of a settlement. I think the actual implementation would take some time, but you want everyone to say, 'Yes, these are the components of a settlement,' and I think we're at the stage where I think everybody has a good idea of what the components are."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place -- Does the Dow Measure Up?;
Despite Growth of Rivals the Old Gauge Still Matters

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
It is a staple of the nightly news, of daily discussions at dry cleaners and doughnut shops, overheard in cell-phone conversations and in cocktail party chatter.
When Americans talk about the stock market, they talk about the Dow Jones industrial average. For roughly a century "How'd the market do today?" has inevitably been answered with a reference to the Dow. 
 Yet for all its longevity and accuracy as a barometer of the progress of the stock market, the 30 stocks of the Dow industrial average have, in recent years, failed to keep up with the gains of smaller, more sought after companies that are part of other indexes that track the overall market. Since the beginning of 1995, the Dow has lagged behind by a few percentage points each year the returns of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the broader index that most professional investors on Wall Street use as a benchmark for their own portfolios.
The Dow has fallen even further behind the Nasdaq composite index, rich with the technology stocks that lately have been the market's biggest gainers. Even the unwieldy Wilshire 5000, the universe of stocks which, despite its name, encompasses more than 7,000 companies based in the United States, has climbed at a rate more than 1 percent a year faster than has the Dow.
All of which raises the question: Does the Dow matter anymore?
The answer is still yes.
"The Dow has come in for a lot of criticism for a long time," said Steven Leuthold, a market analyst whose firm, Leuthold Group, is based in Minneapolis. "People complain that it has a limited number of stocks; they complain about the way the index is calculated," based on the numerical price of stocks rather than the total market value of the companies it tracks.
"But I think the rather amazing thing is how accurately, over time, it has tracked a broader index like the S.& P. 500," Mr. Leuthold added. "There are times when the two get out of sync. But we use it because it is still the first thing people refer to when they talk about how the market did today."
So far this year, the Dow, with a gain of nearly 9 percent -- and closing above 10,000 for the first time yesterday -- is more than a percentage point ahead of the S.& P. 500. But those gains mask a growing disparity in the overall market. While the major stock indexes are trading at or near record highs, three-quarters of the stocks in the S.& P. index, and 88 percent of the stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange, are more than 10 percent below their all-time highs.
The differences between the gauges can be traced to how they are calculated. The Dow industrial average is price-weighted, meaning that high-priced stocks, like I.B.M. at over $177 a share, have more of an effect on the Dow than do low-priced stocks like Disney, at about $33. That is true even though a company with a low share price but substantially more shares in circulation could be worth more.
In contrast, the S.& P. indexes are weighted by market capitalization, meaning that the indexes are most influenced by companies whose total stock market value -- derived by multiplying their share price by the number of shares in circulation -- is greatest.
A system like the Dow's price-based system was necessary in the late 19th century, when the Dow was first compiled and the calculations had to be done with pencil and paper. The first calculations, in 1896 with a group of 12 stocks, were very simple: add the stocks' prices and divide by 12.
Today, the average is calculated by dividing the sum of the prices by a fractional divisor, currently about 0.225. That means that each $1 change in the price of a Dow stock moves the average by about 4.44 points.
With the advent of superfast computers and instant reporting of changes in stock prices, any index can be calculated in a microsecond, adjusted for stock splits and dividends. More importantly for the companies that devise and market indexes for use with options, futures and other derivatives contracts, an index can be frequently tinkered with through the removal and replacement of companies without difficulty.
That has caused new indexes to sprout like mushrooms, with each seeming to slice the stock market into ever-smaller pieces. Bloomberg lists 417 indexes tracking United States equity markets alone.
From a statistical perspective, however, the Dow is among the most efficient gauges around. It uses only 30 stocks, which together account for close to a quarter of the stock market's total value. The S.& P. 500's components, which together account for about four-fifths of the market's total value, are, by comparison, much closer to a full census than to a sampling.
Recently, critics of the Dow have argued that the older gauge, having missed the upswing caused by the Internet investment mania, lags behind too far. From the beginning of 1995, when the latest leg of the stock market's upward march began, through the end of 1998, the Dow climbed 24.3 percent annually, compared with 27.8 percent for the S.& P. 500.
The difference stems primarily from the absence of the technology giants Intel and Microsoft from the Dow industrials. While the Dow has contained I.B.M. since 1981 and Hewlett-Packard since 1997, those stocks have not performed as well as Intel and Microsoft, the stars of the new economy built around personal computers and the Internet.
Over longer periods, however, the gauges track quite closely. Since the beginning of 1980 through the end of last year, the Dow gained 13.4 percent a year, compared with 13.6 percent for the S.& P. 500. Including reinvested dividends, a measure known as total return, an investment in the Dow and the S.& P. 500 would have come even closer -- an average annual gain of 17.72 percent for the Dow industrials versus 17.65 percent for the S.& P.
Even when measured since the beginning of 1990, the two benchmarks differ by an average of less than a half of 1 percent a year: 17.8 percent for the S.& P. 500 versus 17.4 percent for the Dow.
The proliferation of indexes in part comes from the desire to more closely track certain sectors of the market.
"It depends what you want a benchmark to be," said Leah Modigliani, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. "It serves to represent a universe of investments, to act as a benchmark" for investment managers to measure their own performance.
Increasingly, however, stock market gauges have also provided an alternative investment, one that frequently can be had at a lower cost than that charged by traditional portfolio managers. Today, index mutual funds and unit investment trusts track virtually every stock market gauge imaginable, from subsets of Internet stocks to the entire universe of publicly traded companies.
"Without a doubt, the Dow has a lot of problems that are well known," said Theodore R. Aronson, a money manager and market analyst at Aronson + Partners in Philadelphia. "I nonetheless marvel at how experts in the field allude to it. And it's still hands-down the most popular shorthand for how the market's done. I wake up each morning as National Public Radio is reporting the Dow, which they still do to two decimal places. Think about how meaningless that is."
Indeed, said Mr. Leuthold, people seem to be increasingly frightened by the Dow's amplitude. Hundred-point swings in the Dow often result in bigger headlines in the next day's paper, even though 100 points recently represented little more than a move of 1 percent in the average.
With the Dow crossing 10,000, perhaps the excitement that has come with each 1,000-point mark will die down. But the 10,000 level might also represent a level that has greater historic resonance to investors. For once it reaches the Promised Land, will the Dow be able to move on?
Consider that for six periods from 1963 to 1982, the Dow Jones industrial average approached or crossed the 1,000 level, only to retreat back into triple digits. The first of those concluded a fantastic run of three and a half years, during which the Dow gained more than 20 percent a year.
The Dow first finished a full day of trading above 1,000 in November 1972. But it was not until a full decade later, at the beginning of the bull market in late 1982, that the Dow average firmly climbed above the 1,000 mountain. Today, of course, it looks more like a molehill.

HEADLINE: Company's Plan to Privatize Angers Shareholders

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

 BODY:
Even in a raging bull market, some New York Stock Exchange companies wallow in neglect. A few, like dusty antiques in the attic, turn out to be gems.
The PEC Israel Economic Corporation, a holding company that has stakes in Israeli ventures, is one such company. Management takes a low profile. Analysts ignore the company. The stock price has gone mostly downhill since the early 1990's. So forgotten is PEC that it is slated for extinction, with its largest shareholder preparing to buy up the remaining shares and delist it as of today. 
 The delisting, however, comes as several PEC investments, including a stake in Cellcom, Israel's largest mobile telephone operator, are scheduled to go public and capture a market value that analysts believe will greatly exceed the amount that PEC says they are worth.
The Discount Investments Corporation, a company controlled by the Recanati family of Israel, is the majority PEC shareholder that wants to privatize PEC. By doing so, it would not have to share any future gains in the market value of PEC assets with other stockholders, disgruntled shareholders contend.
The offer to privatize PEC was made several months after Goldman, Sachs & Company, the investment bank, paid $78 million for a 9.5 percent stake in the Israeli holding company that controls Discount Investments. Goldman, jointly with Lehman Brothers, also happens to be a lead underwriter of Cellcom, which plans to list shares in the United States shortly.
Minority PEC shareholders have filed lawsuits to block the deal, contending that the offer substantially underestimates the value of the investments PEC has made over the years. Unless the suits prevail, the delisting is a done deal because Discount Investments already holds an 80 percent stake in PEC. Shareholders will formally vote on the proposal at a shareholder meeting today in New York.
The conflict involves a tangled story of American-Israeli economic connections that turned sour. Some shareholders see the demise of PEC as an ignominious end to a company founded in 1926 by Justice Louis Brandeis of the Supreme Court. He and other Zionists established the company to support Palestine at a time when Jews there had difficulty raising money for even the most basic necessities, like housing and utilities.
In fact, until the Israeli stock market boom of the 1990's made it easier for Israeli companies to raise capital, PEC was run as much as a charity as a corporation. Its stock is still widely held by Jews around the world who once regarded it as much as a donation as an investment.
"This company was never supposed to be about squeezing every last dime out of shareholders," said Murray S. Greenfield, a retired 72-year-old Israeli broker who sold PEC stock to Jewish visitors to Israel in the 1960's. "It was about building Israel. If Brandeis woke up today he would not be the happiest man in the world, I can tell you that."
For more recent shareholders, PEC's privatization is a fresh lesson about the risks of investing in undervalued companies. Some investors said they snapped up PEC stock in recent years because the price fell far below the level at which analysts estimated the value of its underlying investments. These investors were hoping PEC would eventually enjoy a run-up in the value of Israeli companies that went public after the 1993 peace accord with the Palestinians.
Like PEC, some investment holding companies trade at a discount to the book value of their underlying assets, especially when management is indifferent. But PEC's discount -- more than 46 percent, according to an estimate made by an analyst at Lehman Brothers late last year -- was large enough to make PEC a prime target for investors seeking the most undervalued companies on the United States stock market.
"The pity is that this is happening just as some of PEC's investments are just about to take off," said one large shareholder who declined to be identified because his company has legal action pending. Among the largest minority shareholders are mutual funds run by Credit Suisse Asset Management and the Vanguard Group.
PEC's management team, which includes two members of the Recanati family, declined to comment through a spokesman on the lawsuits or the buyout offer, citing Securities and Exchange Commission regulations that they say prohibit them from speaking publicly while the offer is pending. Goldman, which stands to benefit if the Recanatis have their way at PEC, also declined to comment.
But in documents, the company says that the $30-a-share purchase price for the shares of PEC that Discount Investments does not already own is fair, pointing out that the price is 32 percent higher than what the shares were fetching before Discount Investments made a bid.
Late last year, PEC management hired Merrill Lynch & Company to appraise its value. After Merrill's review, Discount Investment raised its bid to $30 a share from $25.50. Merrill called the $30 price fair, a fact that PEC officials said validates the latest offer.
But some shareholders fault Merrill for collecting as much as $625,000 from PEC in fees if the deal flies, but failing to extract from PEC management the sort of information Merrill normally seeks to judge the fairness of a deal. Merrill acknowledged in its fairness opinion, for example, that it did not have access to the management of Cellcom, the mobile phone operator and what many consider the portfolio's hidden jewel.
"We have not been afforded the opportunity to meet with the management of Cellcom Israel, the company's largest single holding, and thus have not been able to discuss with such management the business prospects of Cellcom," the Merrill review states.
Israeli newspapers have reported that Cellcom plans to go public in the United States this year. Both Merrill and Goldman competed for the right to underwrite that company's shares, which are expected to generate considerable investor interest because of Cellcom's rapid growth and its status as the No. 1 provider of mobile phone services in Israel, itself a leader in per-capita use of cellular telephones.
In its fairness opinion, dated Dec. 11, Merrill explored various ways to value Cellcom and settled on a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. More recently, Israeli news reports and Wall Street analysts close to the company have placed a value on Cellcom closer to $3.5 billion.
Merrill officials declined to comment in detail on the fairness opinion. But a spokesman said that the opinion explored the reasons that PEC shares traded at such a heavy discount to the value of its individual investments. It also weighs the possibility that Cellcom's plan to go public could be delayed by a downdraft in the American stock market, as it was late last year.
Shareholders opposed to Discount Investments' offer contend that the discrepancy between Merrill's valuation of Cellcom and the price underwriters now hope to achieve in the initial public offering amounts to $11 a share for PEC's current holders. Discount Investments, they say, should pay at least $41 a share instead of the $30 being proposed.
The dissenting shareholders also say that the understatement of PEC holdings goes beyond Cellcom and extends to PEC's stakes in several private companies and real estate holdings in Israel.
The offer to take PEC public, these shareholders say, does not account for a recent spike in the value of its stake in Gilat Satellite Networks, which just went public on the Nasdaq market last month. Another example: PEC has the right to convert a loan it made to United Pan-Europe Communications, a European cable television company, into shares in that prosperous concern. Shareholders say they consider that conversion right a lucrative opportunity that they will miss if PEC is privatized anytime soon.
Evidence that some long-dormant PEC investments are starting to ascend can be seen in the value of Discount Investment stock listed on the Tel Aviv stock exchange, the shareholders said. Discount Investments' assets mirror many of those held by PEC, as the two invest side by side in many ventures. The two, for example, each hold 12.5 percent stakes in Cellcom, and have identical positions in many other Israeli technology and industrial companies.
Discount Investment stock has been on a tear, with shares rising from less than 80 shekels, or about $19, at the time it offered to buy the shares of PEC it did not already control last fall to more than 140, or about $34.68, in recent days, an all-time high. PEC shares on the New York Stock Exchange, which closed yesterday at $29.6875, rose in December when Discount Investment made its $30-a-share offer, but are still well below 1993 highs.
For now, the issue seems destined to end up in court. But for some shareholders, it's an unfortunate paradox that American Jews who once bought PEC shares to support cash-short Jews in Palestine would wind up in court contending that Israeli financiers are profiting at their expense.
"It's a shame," said Mr. Greenfield, the former broker and PEC shareholder. "But if they are hellbent on profits, then at least we should have our share."

HEADLINE: Bank One Plans Job Cuts

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 29

 BODY:
The Bank One Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest bank, plans to cut as many as 2,200 jobs, or 2.4 percent of its work force, by the middle of next year as a result of its merger with the First Chicago NBD Corporation, a spokesman said.
Bank One, which is based in Chicago and employed 91,310 people at the end of 1998, said it would take a $526 million merger-related reorganization charge in 1999, in part to cover the cuts. 
 Bank One was formed by last year's merger of the Banc One Corporation and First Chicago NBD. The company last month said it would cut 200 people, or 20 percent of its staff outside the United States. Those cuts are included in the 2,200 figure.

Dow Closes Above 10,000, Reflecting Strong Economy
After nearly two weeks of thrust and parry, stock traders pushed the Dow Jones industrial average above 10,000 and kept it there until the end of the day's trading. The Dow closed at 10,006.78, up 184.54 points, or 1.9 percent.
Although 10,000 on the Dow was little more than a psychological hurdle for investors, the market's move is significant in what it reflects: unparalleled strength of the economy and American corporations' dominance of the world stage. Page A1. 

Almost lost in the shuffle of the Dow's record-setting day was a solid performance by broader gauges. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 27.37 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,310.17, while the Nasdaq composite index jumped 73.67 points, or 3 percent, to 2,492.84. C11.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: IN BELGRADE;
Belgrade 'Targets' Find Unity 'From Heaven'

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, March 29

 BODY:
Along Belgrade's loveliest shopping street, Knez Mihajlova, groups of young men filled with anger and beer today completed the trashing of the American Center, the British Council, the Goethe Institute and the French Cultural Center, as scattered policemen watched and chatted among themselves.
The impact of the stones shattering the windows seemed in rhythm with the sounds of another patriotic concert in the city center, starring Ceca Raznjatovic, wife of the notorious Serbian paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznjatovic, known as Arkan. 
 "Ceca" was famous, a Serbian Cher, before she married Arkan, a proud pioneer of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. But she has taken to doing music videos with a live tiger cub, a reference to the name of Arkan's brigades, the Tigers.
As ordinary Belgrade residents walked by, or stood to watch the destruction, the young stone throwers also spray-painted obscene graffiti on the walls, comparing NATO to the Nazis and making snide references to President Clinton's sexual life.
Like many of the passers-by, they wore a "target" logo that has swept Belgrade -- a gesture of contempt toward NATO's bombs that is made more palatable by the fact that no NATO bombs have struck the populated center of the Yugoslav capital.
"I'm ashamed to see this," said a medical doctor dressed in a fashionable pale-beige suit who identified herself only as Zaklina. "But you know the bombs have made people crazy. They crack the veneer of civilization, as if war excuses anything."
She laughed then, saying, "Anyway, they are bored with being down in the shelters, with the grannies."
Belgrade is a city where people say "ciao" and drink espresso, judge the latest Hollywood movies with asperity and surf the Net. But the war is dragging it farther from Europe, into isolation, uniting the Serbs behind their soldiers, their Kosovo and even President Slobodan Milosevic. American movies have been withdrawn from the theaters, though the Original Levi's Store across from the American Center was left untrashed by the mobs.
"People used to say that only God could unify the Serbs," said Aleksa Djilas, the historian son of the late Milovan Djilas, the most famous dissident of the Tito period. "But now they've been unified from heaven -- but by the bombs, not by God."
No one really feels they deserve to be bombed, Mr. Djilas said, "even if they know that Milosevic's policies have played a big role."
At the same time, the Government has urged citizens to run to the air raid shelters for 12 or 15 hours a day, understanding that collective panic provides a sense of solidarity with the nation and its military.
"But if you refuse to go down, or say that there is no point in it, people get very angry," said Ilija, a former journalist in his 50's. "People think you're belittling their plight or somehow saying that it's all right that they're sitting in a shelter."
There is much more suspicion around, with rumors of Western spies and local dissidents planting radar guidance devices to insure that NATO's bombs find their targets. Some Serbs insist, conversely, that some devices have been planted in the hotels where journalists are staying, intended not to guide the bombs, but to deflect them.
And the city authorities, while deciding now that it is safer to keep Belgrade's street lights on, still insist that curtains be drawn after 6 P.M., as if NATO's modern weapons still depended on illuminated living rooms to find their targets.
Still, as Yugoslavia faces its sixth day of bombing without major civilian casualties, people are becoming inured to the sharp wail of the sirens. Fewer spend all night in the shelters, but there is little else to do, with nearly all the restaurants, clubs, cafes and movie theaters shutting down at dusk.
"There is a deepening sense of boredom -- the war is really very boring, especially with this monotonous war propaganda on the news," said a cosmopolitan Serb, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "My son is bored; he can't go out, except to visit friends in their shelters, where it's boring. My little one is bored, because all her favorite cartoons like Power Rangers have been replaced by these interminable news programs."
So people are renting armfuls of videos, especially comedies, like "You've Got Mail."
Yet the Serbs remain resourceful and ironic. A basement cafe downtown has renamed itself "The Shelter Cafe," offering satellite television along with coffee and drinks. A placard put up in a window along Knez Mihajlova read: "F-117A. Crashed. Low mileage. Foreign license plates. Cheap. Call after 4 P.M."
Instead of "Dobra den," or good day, people wish each other "Bombar den."
The target placards worn by so many here were printed various ways, but some come straight off the Internet (http://www.beograd.com/ nato/target/target72.gif).
And with cigarettes so scarce, people joke, the war is a superb opportunity to quit smoking.
Some of the mockery is cruder and angrier.
A funeral notice featured Mr. Clinton and said he would be buried alongside others "in charge of destroying civilization," like "Hitler, Napoleon, Mussolini and Ante Pavelic," the Croatian fascist leader during World War II. Mr. Clinton is survived, the notice said, "by wife Hillary, daughter Chelsea, mom, dad, dog, necktie, friend Monica and lots of Tomahawks and radar locators and a big family of NATO rats."
The Milosevic Government, through its censorship of the news media, has isolated Belgrade and the rest of Serbia proper from the real war going on to the south, in Kosovo.
While state television shows careful film of NATO damage, there is little effort to discuss the activities of the military and security forces in Kosovo. While Western politicians and human-rights officials are making harsh accusations of atrocities, killings and "ethnic cleansing" of the ethnic Albanian population, Serbs are informed that their forces are simply responding to the widespread terrorism of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and its sympathizers.
Mr. Djilas, the historian, said he considered that the coming visit by Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia to be a way for President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to deal with fierce domestic criticism of NATO and doubted that it would produce anything substantive.
But it would also add to what Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party here -- and an organizer of pro-democracy demonstrations against Mr. Milosevic two years ago -- called the "mental filters of censorship and self-censorship" that protect ordinary people from the reality of atrocity.
"The essence of Milosevic's system is that no one knows anything," Mr. Djindjic said. "We don't know how the economy is doing or what the Zastava factory is producing or how many are unemployed, let alone what is happening in Kosovo."
It is the same process that allowed the Germans under Nazism to discount evidence of the Holocaust, Mr. Djindjic said.
"People first need to hear information," he said. "Then, if they hear it, will they believe it? And if they believe it, how can they explain it?" As they try to explain it to themselves, he said, people will think "Maybe the victims are guilty, somehow, and deserve what they get.' "
Mr. Djindjic, Belgrade's reform Mayor for a few months in 1997, said it was important to understand how much Mr. Milosevic depends on a rural constituency that has always hated Belgrade, the sophisticated metropolis. Yugoslavia's civil wars, over the last decade, have brought more and more angry and impoverished Serbs here from Bosnia and Croatia.
"There's more of a rural fatalism now," he said. "There is more xenophobia, myth and superstition. All of this is only accelerated by the war."

HEADLINE: Oil vs. Wilderness

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In the name of protecting Alaska's landscape, you support the Congressional proposal to designate the last sliver of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness (editorial, March 24).
This designation, you argue, would also help prevent calamities like the Exxon Valdez oil spill. 
 We are 56 percent dependent on foreign oil. If we do not continue to seek domestic sources of oil, this dependence will grow. Moreover, oil arriving by foreign tankers increases our exposure to accidents like the Exxon Valdez.
Of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's 18.6 million acres, only 1.5 million acres have been set aside for oil exploration. Alaska is already home to 60 percent of the country's wilderness areas. Designating more of the state's land as wilderness would only cripple the area's economic well-being, including that of the Inupiat Eskimos.

HEADLINE: DOW FINISHES DAY OVER 10,000 MARK FOR THE FIRST TIME

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
The Dow achieved a perfect 10 yesterday. Thousand, that is.
After nearly two weeks of thrust and parry, traders pushed the Dow Jones industrial average above 10,000 and kept it there until trading ended. The Dow closed at 10,006.78, up 184.54 points, or 1.9 percent. 
 Although 10,000 is little more than a psychological hurdle for investors, the market's move is significant in what it reflects: the unparalleled strength of the economy and the dominance of the world economic stage by American corporations.
More and more of the world's profits are being claimed by the nation's corporations. "Back in 1990 the U.S. share was 36 percent; last year, it was 44 percent," said Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers in New York. "That goes a long way toward explaining why U.S. equities have had such exemplary performance."
The Dow has doubled in less than four years; it reached 5,000 in November 1995. It is up nearly tenfold since 1982.
"The market's ability to sustain itself through all sorts of climates and economic conditions -- inflation/ deflation, growth/lack of growth -- has been impressive," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi & Associates in Greenwich, Conn., and a global trading consultant for Deutsche Bank. "The ease and the consistency: that's what's so surprising about the market."
A lurking concern, however, is just how narrow the market's advance has been. A growing portion of Americans' investment money is devoted to the 30 well-known companies in the Dow and the components of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose near its record yesterday. But many portfolios have not matched the performance of the Dow and the S.& P. That is because a relatively small number of stocks have pulled the indexes higher. The winners have been the best-known stocks with household names, stocks like General Electric, American Express and Wal-Mart Stores.
The number of stocks that are down significantly in the broad market far outpaces the number that are up substantially.
Fully 76 percent of all stocks are trailing the S.& P.'s return by 15 percent or more. On the Nasdaq, 93 percent of stocks now fetch prices 10 percent or more below their highs of the last 52 weeks, while 88 percent of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange are in that category. Among the S.& P. stocks, three out of four are at least 10 percent off their highs.
According to statisticians at Salomon Smith Barney, the stocks in the S.& P. 500 were on average 22.6 percent off their highs as of Friday, while the New York Stock Exchange issues were on average 33.4 percent below their peaks. Showing just how concentrated this rally has been among big stocks, the Nasdaq stocks are on average 41.8 percent below their peaks. And this calculation factors in many of the hot technology and Internet stocks.
Neither has the road to Dow 10,000 been pothole free. The financial crisis that began in Asia with the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 and migrated to Russia last summer and then to Brazil gave stock market investors their first taste of significant losses in eight years. But three cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board turned stocks around last fall.
Economic problems still simmer overseas: fourth-quarter data from Japan, Germany and much of Latin America show declines in gross domestic products there. But difficulties abroad have only served to make the United States stock market more of a haven to investors worldwide. Because the United States is almost alone in experiencing solid growth now, stocks of big American companies are viewed as enticing. Even the increasingly grim situation in Kosovo did not hold back investors yesterday.
Ralph J. Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential Securities, was an early Wall Street believer in Dow 10,000. On March 16, when the average first topped 10,000 and then retreated, Mr. Acampora exulted: "It's exciting. It's America. We all should get up and sing 'God Bless America.' These are our big stocks that are leading. It's anything but irrational."
The stock market surely is America today. An estimated 45 percent of American households own equities, up from about 14 percent in 1980.
And Americans who have been in the market during the 1990's have been riding a superpowered engine of wealth creation. Over the last decade, according to the Federal Reserve System, the value of stocks held by households is up 381 percent, before inflation, handily beating real estate assets, which were up 55 percent. The value of stocks held by households rose to $10.77 trillion last year and represented 25 percent of total household assets, up from 8 percent 15 years ago.
The increasing enthusiasm for stocks has been well founded. For the last five years, the compounded annual return on the S.& P. 500, including dividends, has averaged 24 percent, more than double the 10.9 percent median annual increase in the index since 1926.
As for the period ahead, Mr. Acampora predicts that the Dow will hit 11,500 this year, a 15 percent gain from yesterday's close.
Behind the long bull market are several factors -- declining interest rates, low inflation, increasing productivity as a result of advancements in technology -- that have helped propel corporations to new levels of efficiency.
"The lower rate structure has clearly been the majority of strength in the market," said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment officer at BankBoston. He contends that lower rates account for 80 percent of the return in the stock market this decade. "Only 20 percent was the result of expanding earnings," he said.
But interest rates would never have fallen had inflation not dwindled. On an annualized basis, consumer prices are rising 1.6 percent, well below the average annual rate of 3.2 percent since 1926.
One reason inflation is virtually nonexistent even after years of economic strength is that labor costs remain in the cellar. So even as the economy expands, usually a precursor to higher inflation, there is little threat of overall price increases.
Other factors behind the push to Dow 10,000 include an increase in the money supply, falling commodity prices and a very recent and large decline in total shares outstanding. In the fourth quarter of last year, for example, the total shares outstanding shrank by $178 billion, meaning investors had fewer stocks from which to choose.
Still, the rising tides of both the Dow and the S.& P. index have not been enough to lift all investors' fortunes. With so many stocks underwater, the market's rally sits on thinner and thinner pilings.
It is in fact a worry to many strategists that the market has become even more bifurcated -- a few haves and many have-nots -- than it was last year.
While investors rhapsodize over big, famous-name stocks like Microsoft and McDonald's, smaller issues are scorned. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks is down 7.7 percent for the year.
But Timothy J. Morris, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust in New York, says that this market split makes sense. "You could make a very strong argument that investors have acted rationally, rewarding companies that have very strong earnings gains and penalizing ones that haven't," he said.
Nonetheless, some of the forces that have helped push the market higher have been losing steam in recent weeks. That leads some market analysts to wonder how much more investors can expect from stocks this year.
The growth in the nation's money supply has slowed substantially this year. That growth in money, as measured in the broadest sense to include money market funds, currency in circulation, checking and savings accounts, helped stabilize the stock market during the financial crises last fall. Much of the additional money found its way into equities. A decline in that growth could put a lid on stocks. Early this year, according to Christine Callies, equity strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, annualized growth in money supply fell to 8.4 percent from 16.4 percent.
Interest rates have also been nudged higher by bond traders, nervous that strong economic growth in the United States could ignite inflation. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond stands at 5.64 percent, well above the 5.10 percent level at the start of the year. The jump could be temporary, of course, but every increase in rates makes bonds slightly more attractive when compared with stocks.
Another worry is that violent price swings in stocks are increasing. According to the Leuthold Group, in the first two months of the year, the S.& P. closed each day with an up or down move of 1 percent or more 45 percent of the time. Between 1992 and 1998, such moves took place only 8 percent of the time.
Even as the Dow reached the milestone yesterday, Tom Telegades, who said he works for an Internet company, shrugged off its importance on his way through Grand Central Terminal. "I'm in the market, but it has no impact on me whatsoever," he said. "It doesn't make any difference in my investment strategy. I'm not doing anything extra because of it."
Such tepid enthusiasm has not been the norm in recent years. According to James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, during the last five years, declines in the stock market have occurred on about one out of four days. Only during the bull stampede beginning in 1926 and extending to 1929 was there less downward movement.
This outsized performance has also put stocks at valuations never seen before. The stocks in the S.& P. 500 are trading at 34 times their earnings, more than double the median historical valuation of around 15 times. And the value of the stock market now exceeds the gross domestic product by a sizable amount.
Regardless, United States stocks are for now very much the place to be. Eight years of rising share prices are a powerful draw.

"Lately, Stocks Have Been the Road to Riches"
In the years after the Dow Jones industrial average first neared 1,000 in the 1960's, stock prices failed to keep up with the growth of the overall economy, as shown by the gross domestic product; with inflation, as shown by the Consumer Price Index; with house prices or with gold. But in recent years stock prices have risen much more rapidly than the other measures, and have now exceeded 1960's peaks for all except the G.D.P. In the following charts, a rising line indicates the Dow did better than the other measure during the period.
 Graph tracks the Dow Jones industrial average, indexed to the following: the gross domestic product; single-family home prices; gold prices; the consumer price index. Data tracked since 1965. (pg. C12)
 
"By Any Measure The Dow Is on a Roll"
The Dow Jones industrial's performance has been extraordinary whether graphed on a conventional scale, right, or on a logarithmic scale, left, which gives the same visual weight to comparable percentage changes.
The bull market that began in 1990 is not as great in percentage terms as the bull market that began in 1921. And the bear market that began in 1929 was much deeper than the brief crash of 1987.
Graph compared a conventional scale of the Dow and a logarithmic scale of the Dow (which is based on percentage changes), plotted monthly, since 1896. It highlights bear and bull markets.

HEADLINE: Monterrey Journal;
Beisbol, Si! But Can U.S. Players Drink the Water?

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico

 BODY:
Major League Baseball's first season opener to be played outside the United States or Canada is scheduled for Monterrey on April 4. The game has aroused so much excitement that tickets sold out in three hours when they went on sale here last month.
Mexican fans hope that the opening game, between the San Diego Padres and the Colorado Rockies, means that the major leagues could one day have an expansion team in Monterrey, Mexico's baseball capital. Major league executives say only that the game is part of their campaign to globalize baseball. 
"We're making an enormous statement by opening the season in Mexico," said a vice president of Major League Baseball, Timothy J. Brosnan. "It's part of our plan to grow the game worldwide. Mexico is our neighbor, and there's a great Latin baseball tradition. We want to bring the game to our fans."
For half a century, Mexico's baseball leagues have served as a farm system for American players and a training ground for Mexican greats like Fernando Valenzuela, even as they have delighted Mexican fans.
When major league executives decided this year to schedule the game in Mexico, it was little surprise that Monterrey was chosen for the game.
Monterrey Stadium is Mexico's largest and most comfortable baseball park, seating 25,000 spectators. The Monterrey Sultanes are recurring champions, and the city has 50 Little League networks, as well as the Mexican Baseball Hall of Fame.
The game will open the 1999 season for the major leagues. But the season for Mexico's summer league, which has 16 teams affiliated with the United States' minor leagues, started on March 17. The Sultanes met the Saraperos of Saltillo, an automobile-manufacturing city an hour's drive west through the desert.
Before the Mexican opener, fans were munching not hot dogs, but platefuls of peanuts smothered in chile sauce. Otherwise the baseball rituals were familiar.
Families wept during a scoreboard video tribute to fabled Mexican baseball stars. An army bugler played Mexico's national anthem as the sun dipped behind the Sierra Madre over the right field fence, and the Governor of the State of Nuevo Leon threw out the first pitch.
"Play ball!" the announcer beckoned in English.
The Sultans-Saraperos game drew 12,000 fans, partly because even in Monterrey, soccer overshadows baseball in Mexico. And many working-class fans poured savings into buying tickets for the major league opener and could not afford to buy tickets for the Mexican opener as well.
Tickets for regular Mexican League games, including the March 17 opener, range from 50 pesos, about $5, for seats behind home plate to 10 pesos, about $1, for the outfield bleachers. Tickets for the Padres-Rockies game ranged from $60 for the best seats to $10 for the bleachers, about twice the daily minimum wage earned by many laborers.
"I got mine," said Sigifredo Cantu, 32, the owner of a trucking company who was seated in a box along the third base line for the Mexican League opener. "I watch fun baseball in this stadium twice a week. But what's lacking here is really great baseball."
Mexico has had outstanding baseball in times past.
In the spring of 1946, Jorge Pasquel, a Mexican businessman, and his four brothers offered lucrative salaries to lure American major leaguers to the Mexican League.
When more than a dozen players -- among them pitchers Sal Maglie of the New York Giants and Max Lanier of the St. Louis Cardinals, and Mickey Owen, a Brooklyn Dodgers catcher -- went to Mexico, the major leagues imposed a five-year ban on those who defected. Most of these players soon became disillusioned as reports circulated of broken contract promises and poor playing conditions in Mexico, and they sought to rejoin their old teams. Happy Chandler, the baseball commissioner, refused to reinstate them, and it wasn't until 1949 that the ban was lifted.
In this decade, exchanges between Mexican and United States baseball have accelerated. In 1990, the Dodgers, with Valenzuela pitching, played an exhibition series here with the Brewers, led by a Mexican pitcher, Teodoro Higuera. Four years later, a consortium of Monterrey executives applied to Major League Baseball for an expansion team, but withdrew the application when a peso devaluation damaged the Mexican economy.
In 1996, the Padres and the Mets played a series of regular season games here, the first time that had happened outside the United States and Canada.
Now, the major league opener has revived talk about a Mexican expansion team.
"Having the major leagues open their season in Monterrey is a point of pride for us," Gov. Fernando Canales Clariond of Nuevo Leon said after throwing out the first pitch on March 17. "We have great fans and we feel very close to baseball. But the cost of sustaining a major league team -- well, it's high. So it's a question of working out the arithmetic."
Pat Courtney, a spokesman, said Major League Baseball, which has two teams in Canada, said the company had "no concrete plans for the foreseeable future" to expand into Mexico.
"But is it an area that's talked about?" he asked. "Yes, it is."
The Sultanes owner, Jose Maiz Garcia, who filed the application in 1994, said it was too early for Monterrey to think about refiling. "Not yet," Mr. Maiz said, rising to cheer a hit by a Sultanes batter from a box seat behind the plate. "Our economy still hasn't gotten back to 1994 levels."
Moments later, Ty Gainey, a former Houston Astros centerfielder from South Carolina who plays for the Sultanes, smacked a homer with two runners on. What did Gainey think of the chances for an expansion club in Monterrey, he was asked later.
"Some major league players probably wouldn't be able to adapt to living in Mexico," Gainey said. "The food. The water. If you can play here, you can play anywhere. But an expansion team is still possible, because Mexican fans really love baseball."

HEADLINE: U.N. Panel Seeks to Ease Suffering of Iraq's People

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 30

 BODY:
Concluding that Iraq has gone from "relative affluence to massive poverty" since economic sanctions were imposed against it after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, a new report to the Security Council recommends several steps aimed at alleviating its people's suffering.
The report was prepared by one of three special panels convened in January to overcome the political divisions over Iraq on the Security Council and to help devise a common policy. It did not recommend that sanctions be lifted, but it did suggest easing them with specific modifications, some of which the United States said today it might oppose. 
 The four-member panel of senior United Nations officials recommended, for instance, that oil companies be allowed to invest directly in Iraqi oil fields to increase Iraq's production, which is currently at 2.5 million barrels of oil per day. This would enable Iraq to free up funds for food that it now spends buying new oil equipment and repairing and replacing spare parts in its oil fields.
While Iraq is now permitted under an oil-for-food program to sell $5.256 billion worth of oil every six months and to use some of the proceeds to alleviate suffering caused by the sanctions, it has been unable to produce that much, given depressed oil prices and the state of its fields.
In addition, the report suggests that the Security Council authorize foreign companies to invest in Iraqi export industries, like fertilizer, sulfur, and dates, that are unrelated to military production. In both cases, the report states, the added funds would be monitored by the United Nations to insure that they are only used for buying essential goods.
The report also recommends that the Council consider reducing temporarily the amount of money that Iraq pays into a fund that compensates victims of its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which also comes from the oil proceeds.
"It is the panel's view that under current conditions the humanitarian outlook will remain bleak and become more serious with time," the report states.
"Infant mortality rates in Iraq today are among the highest in the world," it says. "Low infant birth weight affects at least 23 percent of all births, chronic malnutrition affects every fourth child under 5 years of age; only 41 percent of the population have regular access to clean water; 83 percent of all schools need substantial repairs."
The report added that it would take $7 billion just to bring the country's power to generate electricity to where it was before the gulf war.
"The gravity of the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people is indisputable and cannot be overstated," the report concludes.
But it was disputed, only hours after Celso L. N. Amorim, Brazil's representative, who heads all three panels, gave it to the Council.
Western diplomats noted, for instance, that many of the report's statistics about the situation of the Iraqi people -- like infant mortality rates -- relied heavily on data provided by Iraq, much of which had not been independently confirmed.
While Washington is concerned about alleviating the suffering, said A. Peter Burleigh, the American representative, "the basic responsibility for their plight lies with Saddam Hussein," Iraq's leader.
Sanctions were still in place "because Iraq has not disarmed itself of weapons of mass destruction" or honored other commitments to the United Nations. Several United Nations agencies contend that Iraq has not spent the money it has on food and medicine, he said.
The United States wants to insure that any additional funds for Iraq would help Iraqis, not their Government, he said.
While Mr. Burleigh was not willing to single out the proposals that troubled him, other American officials cited, for example, the report's recommendation that contributions to the Iraqi victims' compensation fund be temporarily reduced, or borrowed to enable Iraq to buy more goods for its people.
Though the proposal was sponsored by Britain, America's closest ally on the Council, one official said that the United States might hesitate to help one group of victims, the Iraqi people, at the expense of another -- people from many different countries who were working in Iraq when it invaded Kuwait.

HEADLINE: About New York;
Trying to Save Spring's Soul From Auction

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
HARRY BUBBINS smiled at the season's first daffodils -- a burst of bright yellow blossoms perched atop rich green stems -- thriving in a community garden on East 138th Street and the Bruckner Expressway in Mott Haven. The Bronx garden's location -- a triangular lot that ages ago was a wreck -- was a testament to life's tenacity amid housing projects and a tangle of roads and highway ramps. Mr. Bubbins calls this plot, the southernmost garden in the South Bronx, the Liberated Zone.
"I don't know why T.S. Eliot said April was the cruelest month," he said. "That's when things all come out in the sunshine." 
 Elsewhere in the garden, which has been tended since the mid-1980's by the volunteers of the Cherry Tree Association, skeletal trees awaited the warmth and seedlings broke through the soil. A wooden cross decorated with tin snakeheads was chained to a stone where a computer had been placed before it. It was a sculpture in honor of Geeza Daniels, a founder of the garden.
"The piece is actually called 'Prometheus Bound,' " Mr. Bubbins said. "Today's hottest technology will be tomorrow's refuse. Or art. And the land will always be here."
Considering that he was standing on soil owned by the City of New York, he may have spoken too soon, at least when it comes to what will be on that land. The Cherry Tree Association's garden and more than 100 other community plots are scheduled to be auctioned in May by the city to spur economic development and housing in blighted communities. Local officials and garden advocates have tried to prevent the auction. They contend that good urban planning, especially in poor neighborhoods like Mott Haven, must provide open spaces that temper man-made progress with natural tradition.
Mr. Bubbins's reference to Eliot came from "The Waste Land," which is what Mott Haven had become after years of abandonment, crime and an exodus of people. Some said it got that way through poor planning that left it with too many housing projects, homeless shelters and other facilities for the poor. Nor did it help being hemmed in by an elevated expressway.
The gardens, made possible through the city's Green Thumb program, turned ratty lots into oases that were leased to community groups for pennies a year. It was a temporary arrangement, made with the understanding that the parcels could one day be sold. But a lot has changed since the gardeners took up their rakes. Advocates said the city land-use review that allowed the sale of the lots is outdated and does not reflect the current needs of a community.
Lisa Westberg came to the Cherry Tree garden five years ago to work the soil and share in artistic and cultural events organized by a group of artists who work next door. It sparked in her a sense of freedom.
"There was a kind of uncompromising readiness to take control of certain things in life," she said. "Most of the city is a symbol of flair and fun, where so many people come to it but never look here to commit themselves to something. Coming up here for me is very much on the other end of that spectrum."
It is, to her, planning for a future that is not cookie-cutter, conformist or commercial. "Other places in the city are about creating a culture of conformity, to set standards everyone is supposed to adhere to and uphold as a common vision," she said. "Instead of standardizing and searching for uniformity, we should have a more profound search for freedom that means we have to be more sure about what our desires are. It's kind of abstract."
TO make it real, a group of Bronx gardeners dressed like sunflowers and tomatoes for a bit of street theater outside the midtown office of Gov. George E. Pataki. They went there Monday afternoon to preserve their endangered gardens by seeking financing from the state's Environmental Bond Act. The gardeners hope they could use the money to buy the plot at auction, or to convince city officials that the plot shouldn't be sold because they have the resources to make better use of it. Policy analysts familiar with the act said it was not a cure-all, since groups that receive the state money had to match the amount received.
A woman with patchwork silk butterfly wings floated through the crowd of pedestrians. Another woman whose face peeked through a sunflower headdress tiptoed along the sidewalk. Sandy Walsh, a systems analyst, watched in approval before heading to an appointment.
"Part of living in the city consists of dirt, crime and corruption," she said. "Where is life? We need sanctuaries."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Rising Concern Over Profits Sends Dow Below 10,000

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average retreated from its one-day perch above 10,000 yesterday on renewed concerns about corporate earnings, as other major market measures also slipped.
The worries about first-quarter earnings were set off when Coca-Cola told securities analysts after the closing bell on Monday that it expected worldwide sales to show a slight decline in the first quarter. It cited weakness in each of its international divisions. 
 Later, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs lowered her first-quarter sales estimates for Gillette, citing weak demand in foreign markets. And investors were not pleased to read in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that at a meeting with securities analysts General Motors' president, G. Richard Wagoner, said the auto maker was not likely to meet its most optimistic target for net income for its European operations.
Additional weakness developed in the afternoon, when an Oregon jury ordered Philip Morris to pay a record $81 million to the family of a man who died of lung cancer after smoking Marlboros for four decades.
Those developments outweighed the Federal Reserve Board's announcement that its policy-making committee had voted to leave short-term interest rates unchanged. The decision had been widely expected.
"Stocks are coming under pressure," said Anthony Conroy, head of stock trading at Bankers Trust. "Traders and portfolio managers are looking for earnings to support these prices."
"The fundamentals are fairly strong," he added. "Inflation is low, and so are interest rates. But I would not be surprised to see a 2 percent to 3 percent correction before the market moves higher."
At the close, the Dow had fallen 93.52, or 0.93 percent, to 9,913.26. Meanwhile, the Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 9.42, or 0.72 percent, to 1,300.75, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 12.55, or 0.50 percent, to 2,480.29. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks declined 0.98, or 0.2 percent, to 398.79.
Trading volume was quite light, with about 729.03 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange. With equity markets scheduled to be closed on Good Friday, the pace of activity is likely to slow further as the week, which includes Passover, progresses.
On Monday, when the Dow closed above 10,000 for the first time, "it was almost as if investors decided for one day to ignore all the problems we face," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. "Coke's announcement means the global economic crisis was still around in the first quarter, and was a reminder we are entering the earnings season, which can be a very treacherous time."
Coke, down 1 9/16 at 63 1/4, and Philip Morris, off 3 7/16 , to 37 3/4, were the biggest contributors to the Dow's drop yesterday.
Meanwhile, Gillette, a component of the S.& P. 500 index, shed 3 3/8, to 60 1/4.
Shares of America Online, the most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange, soared 12 points to close at 144 1/2, after the company announced an Internet commerce alliance with Sun Microsystems. Sun Microsystems gained 1 7/16 , to 125 15/16 .
Other Internet stocks also gained.
Amazon.com jumped 15 1/16 , to 164 11/16 , on optimism about its fledgling on-line auction business.
And Priceline.com, which runs an Internet site where consumers bid for airline tickets and hotel rooms, catapulted 53, to 69 a share, in its first day of trading.
"There is tremendous activity and strong demand in the Internet stocks," said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which was the lead manager on the Priceline offering. "But with prices quite high in certain sectors of the market, it is quite reasonable to seem some consolidation," he added.

Treasury Prices Advance
 (By The Associated Press) -- Bond prices rose yesterday, after the latest strategy meeting by Federal Reserve officials produced no change in lending rates.
Recent reports have shown surprising economic strength, fueling concerns about inflationary pressures. However, Fed officials did not raise interest rates to slow the economy.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 25/32 point, or $7.81 per $1,000 in face value, to 95 6/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.58 percent, from 5.64 percent late Monday.
The price increase was less for shorter-term Treasuries. The actively traded two-year note rose 3/32 , to 99 28/32 , for a yield of 4.94 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year notes and 19-day cash-management bills:

HEADLINE: Fed Maintains Steady Stance In Rate Policy

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's top officials left interest rates unchanged today, and passed up an opportunity to signal any concern about inflation.
The meeting of the Fed's governors and regional bank presidents, all members of the policy-setting Open Market Committee, came at a time when inflation has been remarkably tame despite the robust economy. And there is unlikely to be much upward pressure on prices as long as labor costs do not accelerate significantly and Europe and Asia remain in the economic doldrums. 
 "I am sure most members of the committee think everything is going rather beautifully," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist and a former Fed vice chairman. "They have not allowed themselves to be provoked into some sort of pre-emptive action against inflation and, in hindsight, their patience has proven to be correct."
In the past, the Fed sometimes raised interest rates before any rise in the inflation rate, contending that an increase was necessary to discourage borrowing and thus slow a strong economy before companies raised prices in response to shortages and rising wage pressures.
But the economy has boomed for more than three years and forecasts of higher inflation have proved wrong time after time. So Fed officials switched tactics.
"Before they take any action, they are going to wait for the inflation rate to actually pick up," said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a Wall Street firm.
The Fed has another tool at its disposal that it chose not to use today. At times, even at sessions when it did not change rates, the central bank has signaled its future intentions through a directive stating that it was shifting its "bias" in one direction or another. Traditionally, such preferences were kept secret until the minutes of each meeting were published six weeks later. But recently the Fed said it would usually announce such directives when they were adopted, rather than make the financial markets guess. There was no announcement today.
The Fed affects a whole range of interest rates by changing its target for the Federal funds rate, the overnight borrowing cost that banks and other financial institutions charge each other. Rates on car loans, mortgages and home equity loans, for example, tend to move up and down with the Federal funds rate. The central bank left its target at 4.75 percent, the level it has been since the Fed last cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point in November.
The stock market may also have been a factor in the Fed's decision not to take any action today. While a small rise in the Federal funds rate might slow the rise in stock prices, it might also provoke a sharp, damaging decline, said Albert M. Wojnilower, a Wall Street economist.
"It worries Fed officials when the stock market runs away," he said. Still, "they don't see it going up in a runaway fashion, but even if it were," Mr. Wojnilower added, "they prefer the market running away than taking a dive, which they would have to do something about."
The stock market, in the view of many economists, has been a major driver behind the economic boom, encouraging people to borrow and spend and fostering a high level of consumer confidence. The Conference Board reported today that its index of consumer confidence rose in March by eight-tenths of a point, to 133.9 from a revised 133.1 in February.
For all the strong growth, low unemployment and labor shortages, the inflation rate has fallen over the last two years, defying traditional relationships. Many economists explain the conundrum by pointing to a weak global economy and a relatively strong American currency, which has resulted in a flood of inexpensive imports that helps to hold down the inflation rate.
"Things may be beginning to turn around overseas," said Kenneth Matheny, a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers Inc., a forecasting service in St. Louis. "But the Fed has time before there is any real improvement and Fed officials will wait until they get much stronger signals before they consider tightening."
A competing explanation for the unusual combination of strong growth and shrinking inflation has been offered by Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman. He has suggested that the nation's productivity growth rate -- which measures the ability of workers to turn out a greater quantity of goods and services in a given period of time -- has finally started to improve after a quarter-century of stagnation.
Productivity statistics issued by the Government do show recent improvements, thus allowing workers, in effect, to pay for their own wage increases rather than force employers to raise prices or squeeze their profit margins.
But while many economists say the improvement is probably temporary, Mr. Greenspan has argued that it reflects the growing effectiveness of computers and other new technologies in the workplace. And lately some other Fed governors have expressed the same view.

HEADLINE: Requiem for the Middleweights;
Ho-Hum Taurus Marks End of Midsize Sedan as Style's Pace Car

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
Remember the first Ford Taurus? When the car was introduced in late 1985, its smooth, aerodynamic curves shook up the design of midsize sedans. And despite fears that its radical look would turn off car buyers, sales took off almost immediately. Moreover, its success was one of the early signs of the resurgence of the Ford Motor Company, which today is at the brink of surpassing the General Motors Corporation as the largest auto maker in the world.
Well, Ford just unveiled the new Taurus yesterday at the New York International Auto Show. But do not look for any surprises. While it may sell well if it is priced cheaply enough, it is unlikely to win any contests for style. Indeed, the most distinctive thing about the new Taurus is probably how indistinguishable it is from all the other lookalike midsize sedans. 
 Ford executives, while acknowledging that the design of the Taurus is cautious and conservative, say it will offer the comfort, competitive price and numerous safety features that consumers want in midsize cars these days. "More than the styling, it's the total package: quality, value, safety," said James G. O'Connor, Ford's president for Ford brand cars and light trucks. "I think the consumer in general doesn't make styling the No. 1 preference in that segment, as opposed to, say, the Mustang segment."
Automotive design experts say that the 2000 model year Taurus represents something of a milestone. It is the last of the once-stylish, high-volume midsize sedans to take on a new, more generic look as Ford and other auto makers put most of their automotive styling efforts elsewhere. After reigning for decades as the main focus of automotive design in the United States, midsize sedans are losing their primacy to sport utility vehicles and to an ever-growing array of so-called crossover vehicles that combine features of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, station wagons and cars.
Gone from the 2000 Taurus are many of the quirky external features that made earlier models, including a 1996 redesign, so distinctive. The oval rear window, oval dashboard and many of the other features that distinguished the Taurus sedan for the last three years have been replaced with plain, rectangular designs for windows and dashboard alike.
Underneath the sheet metal, remarkably little has been changed, allowing Ford to avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses for engineering work and new factory tooling. The whole underbody of the vehicle has been left virtually untouched, while the engine is the same other than a few tweaks to improve its horsepower. Ford did not even bother with the time and cost of designing a new rear window for the wagon version of the new Taurus, leaving an oval rear window on it even while the rest of the vehicle has assumed a more rectangular look.
There are several reasons, experts say, why midsize cars have become so indistinguishable.
For one, Americans who value distinctive automotive styling are increasingly choosing sport utility vehicles and crossover vehicles, like the Toyota Motor Corporation's Lexus RX-300, rather than buying midsize sedans. A growing proportion of new cars are also being purchased by households with three or more vehicles, and these households tend to choose plainly designed sedans to go with more fashionable vehicles in their fleets.
Finally, midsize car prices are slowly falling because of an excess of factory capacity and a glut of late-model sedans coming off leases or being sold by rental companies. This encourages auto makers to cut engineering costs and limits their ability to add fancy styling touches.
"There aren't as many people in sedans who are willing to pay for styling," said Susan G. Jacobs, the president of Jacobs & Associates, an auto consulting firm in Rutherford, N.J. "It's wise for the styling dollars to go into the fun vehicles."
In marketing focus groups, buyers of midsize cars also tend to disagree with each other about what they want, unlike buyers of sport utility vehicles, so car designers must make many compromises between conflicting demands, said Jerry Hirshberg, president for North American design at the Nissan Motor Company. "We've gotten a bit risk averse," he said.
Many Americans, of course, say they are not especially interested in automotive styling and would be perfectly happy with vehicles that simply provide comfortable, reliable transportation. But auto executives and market analysts say that Americans' buying decisions do not back up such statements.
Sport utility vehicles sell briskly even though most buyers do not use them for off-road driving, while vehicles that evoke the image of sport utilities, like the Pontiac Montana minivan, are increasingly popular. A few imaginatively styled midsize sedans, like the Volkswagen Passat and Pontiac Grand Prix, have been successful, garnering praise from the automotive media and consumer evaluators alike. But they occupy relatively low-sales niches in the overall market for midsize sedans.
John M. Waraniak, a managing director of Benchmarking Partners, an automotive consulting firm in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said he had spread out photographs in his kitchen of four new, high-sales sedans going on sale this year and early next year: Ford Taurus, Oldsmobile Aurora, Chevrolet Impala and Nissan Maxima. His wife, Terri, was unimpressed.
"She said, 'They all look the same to me,' and she's the kind of person, about 40 years old, who might switch from a sport utility if there were something exciting to switch to," Mr. Waraniak said.
A fifth sedan, Saturn's first midsize car, will also go on sale soon, but G.M. has not released photographs of it. The midsize Saturn LS, which is being introduced today at the New York auto show, has styling that does not depart significantly from other similarly sized sedans on the market, according to John Middlebrook, G.M..'s vice president for vehicle brand marketing.
Midsize cars are important. Close to $100 billion worth are sold each year in the United States, making it the biggest single segment of the American auto market. It is almost as big a business as the world's passenger airline industry.
Yet the midsize sedan market has been eroded by the success of sport utility vehicles and minivans, falling to 27 percent of the family vehicle market last year from 33 percent in 1985.
Auto engineers object to suggestions that their midsize cars are boring, but they seldom suggest that their offerings are on the cutting edge, either. David T. Marinaro, the chief program engineer for the 2000 Taurus, said that the car "was designed around functionality; the whole car was designed around that."
The new Taurus is also designed so that Ford can build it and sell it for no more money than a current Taurus and possibly for less. Although Ford has not yet decided on the actual price, everything is geared to keeping down costs. By keeping the underbody and the door openings the same as for the previous Taurus, for instance, Ford can continue to use a lot of the same factory equipment to build it.
"My objective is to be actually equal to or lower in cost" for manufacturing the new model, Mr. Marinaro said.
The more modest design of the new Taurus partly reflects the difficulties Ford had in selling the model that is about to be phased out. Ford spared no expense in redesigning the Taurus for the 1996 model year, hoping to repeat the success of the original 1986 Taurus. The 1986-style Taurus produced enormous profits for Ford, becoming the nation's best-selling car from 1992 through 1996.
But the 1996 redesign bombed. Many people complained that the new vehicle looked too unusual. Perhaps more seriously, Ford also had to raise the price by $1,000 to cover the extensive engineering expenses and the cost of features like waves in the sheet metal on the side. Ford was not prepared to compete on price a year later when the Honda Motor Company and Toyota, respectively, introduced less expensive models of the Accord and the Camry.
The combination of radical styling and an increased sticker price soon cost Taurus its leadership of the American car market. The last two years. it has trailed the Accord and the Camry -- two sedans renowned for reliability and functionality over distinctive design -- by a large and widening margin.
While the new midsize cars may be dull, that does not mean that auto makers are producing bland vehicles over all. Ford, G.M., Nissan and other auto makers are all making separate plans, for example, to start selling sport utility vehicles with open pickup-truck beds at the back. Indeed, soaring sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans, pickups and crossover vehicles have produced a wave of innovation in these market segments.
All of these vehicles, including the crossovers, are regulated as light trucks, which means they are partly or entirely exempt from the regulatory straitjacket -- rules on fuel economy, air pollution, bumper heights and the like -- that tends to produce car designs that fit the same mold.
Some auto designers think that midsize cars can be made exciting again. DaimlerChrysler A.G. already makes the striking Dodge Intrepid and Chrysler 300M, which are actually full-size cars, and is putting a lot of effort into redesigning midsize cars, like the Plymouth Breeze, to make them more interesting. Subtle changes such as changing the curve of the windshield or the width between a car's wheels could make a styling difference without necessarily hurting affordability, said Thomas C. Gale, the executive vice president for North American design at DaimlerChrysler. "You have to find ways which make things exciting," Mr. Gale said, "and still do it in ways which are perceived as adding value."
Mr. Hirshberg of Nissan said that it would take a completely new yet practical midsize sedan design to revive one of the oldest segments in the auto industry.
"I don't think it's dead," he said. "It's just going to take someone who comes in and nails something fresh, as Ford did with the first Taurus."

When Ford introduced the Taurus in 1985, sales soared, countering fears that its aerodynamic design would repel buyers. Today, the market for midsize sedans has slowed, and the latest Taurus is much more conservative, closely resembling its competitors.

HEADLINE: Longer Solvency for Medicare and Social Security

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
Relieving some of the political pressure for reform, the Government released new actuarial studies today extending the date at which Medicare can be expected to run out of money by seven years and Social Security insolvency by two years.
The improved financial position of the Medicare and Social Security trust funds is largely the result of the strong economy over the last year, the trustees of the funds said in their annual report. 
 Based on the latest long-range estimates of factors like national economic growth, worker productivity, inflation, unemployment, immigration and birth rates and retirement patterns, the actuaries still expect the Government's two largest programs to require more tax money or a reduction in benefits as the number of baby boomers in retirement mushrooms.
But without any changes in law, the trustees found, the Medicare system should have enough money to pay full benefits until 2015 and the Social Security system should be in the black until 2034. Last year at this time, they projected the insolvency dates to be 2008 for Medicare and 2032 for Social Security.
At a ceremony in the Rose Garden, President Clinton insisted that despite the good news, legislation strengthening the programs should still be enacted this year.
"Now is the time to make those changes," the President said. "Now when our economy is strong, now when our people have renewed confidence and now when we have time on our side so that modest changes today can have major impacts in the years ahead."
Leading Republicans in Congress issued similar statements. "We cannot let this good news make us complacent," said Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Social Security and Medicare.
Furthermore, economists of all political persuasions generally agree that the sooner the necessary changes are made to shore up Social Security and Medicare, the less abrupt and painful those changes will seem to taxpayers and retirees.
But the President and the Republicans who control Congress are so far apart on how the two programs should be fixed and the politics of the matter are so delicate that the odds are already against enactment of comprehensive legislation this year. The effect of today's announcement postponing a crisis was to make a search for compromise less urgent.
"These are actuaries from heaven," said James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University here. "It takes pressure off all the players on the Hill and the President," Mr. Thurber said, and makes it safe for them to leave the problem for the next President and the next Congress.
John Rother, the politically savvy lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, which favors enactment of Social Security legislation this year, said, "I'm not going to throw in the towel." After a pause, Mr. Rother added, "Publicly."
The six trustees of the trust funds include three Cabinet members: Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman and Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services. The others are Kenneth S. Apfel, the Social Security Commissioner, and two experts who were appointed by President Clinton: Stephen G. Kellison, an actuary, and Marilyn Moon, an economist who specializes in health policy.
 Although they are political appointees, their annual report is, by and large, the work of career Government actuaries and economists. The reports were also reviewed by outside actuaries who signed statements saying the methodology and assumptions were sound.
The projections that the Medicare fund would be insolvent in 2015 and the Social Security fund in 2034 were based on what the trustees called an intermediate set of estimates about the economic and demographic factors.
The economic assumptions were quite conservative. The trustees estimated, for instance, that economic growth between 2010 and 2050 would average less than 1.5 percent a year. That is approximately half the average growth rate of the last 75 years, but the trustees were taking into account the fact that the country's labor force is not expected to grow as fast in the 21st century as it has in the 20th.
The report offered for comparison's sake two other projections. One based on less favorable assumptions showed Medicare running out of money in 2007 and Social Security in 2028. Another based on more favorable conditions showed that neither program would become insolvent in the next 75 years.
As recently as two years ago, projections indicated that the Medicare fund would run out of money in 2001. Ms. Shalala said today that the improved situation was the result of a stronger economy and of changes the President and Congress made in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. That law shifted some of the cost of home health care out of the hospital insurance trust fund and reduced Medicare payments to doctors, hospitals and other health-care providers.
The 1997 report forecast that Social Security would become insolvent in 2029. Last year's report said the reserves would be exhausted in 2032. The brighter picture is almost entirely the result of the flourishing economy over the last two years.
Even with reduced pressure to act, the President and Congress are sure to continue to debate what to do with Social Security and Medicare -- right through the 2000 elections.
In the case of Social Security, the President and the Republicans favor setting aside much of the budget surplus over the next 15 years to strengthen the retirement system.
But Republicans want to use the money to allow workers to establish private retirement accounts that they would invest in stocks and bonds. The President wants to allow some Social Security money to be invested in the markets, but he would have the Government control the investments.
On Medicare, Republicans are generally supporting a marketplace system under which retirees would be given a fixed amount of money that they could use to buy private health insurance or the Government's program.
The President and most Democrats oppose this idea and favor setting aside money from the budget surplus to strengthen Medicare and provide new funds to cover prescription drugs.

No Quick Chinese Entry Seen Into Trade Group

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 30

 BODY:
Dampening hopes for a quick agreement on China's entry into the World Trade Organization, American officials said today that "difficult and complex issues remain across all areas of trade" after a hurried visit here by the White House trade representative.
Chinese and American officials have negotiated intensively for the last week here over the scale of market-opening concessions that China must make to qualify for membership in the global trade forum, which sets rules and arbitrates disputes. 
 China has long sought entry, and after years of impasse, officials from both countries now seem eager for the Chinese to join. They are trying to put the outlines of a deal together by the time Prime Minister Zhu Rongji arrives in Washington for an official visit next week.
More than just a trade deal is at stake. The American and Chinese Governments both see a potential accord as a rare political breakthrough in a relationship increasingly strained by disputes over such issues as human rights, nuclear espionage and the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia, which China condemns.
Hopes that agreement might be near on entry into the trade group were raised over the weekend when President Clinton's trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, left Washington for a quick trip to Beijing, in hopes of pushing Mr. Zhu to make last-minute concessions on market access for foreign companies in agriculture, financial services and other areas that the Chinese have long been protected.
While Ms. Barshefsky said she did not plan to go home with a deal, she hoped for breakthroughs.
It is unclear whether she got any, American officials said.
Today, she spent five and a half hours talking with a senior trade official, Wu Yi, and with Prime Minister Zhu. But tonight, as Ms. Barshefsky headed home, she issued a written statement saying that although there had been "important progress today in narrowing the issues," there remained "substantial gaps in critical areas."
"The United States will set no artificial deadlines in these negotiations," the statement said.
Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley, who is also here on a trade mission, said he believed that a deal would be reached sometime before the fall. But by then, many in Washington believe, it will be too close to next year's election campaigning for the Administration to submit China's offerings to Congress.
According to American officials, China has offered some major concessions. Mr. Daley said Mr. Zhu told him that his Government would permit the sale of cellular telephones that operate on technology used by Motorola and other American phone makers. Until now, the Chinese system favored European producers. China has also indicated that American companies could buy minority stakes in telecommunications businesses, but so far it has refused to allow them to take majority stakes.
China has also not agreed on a resolution of disputes that have blocked the importing of most types of American wheat. "Based on what we have right now," an American official said, "we couldn't send this thing to the Hill."
The chief China negotiator on Ms. Barshefsky's staff, Robert Cassidy, will stay on for "a couple of days," an official said, and then talks are expected to move to Washington.
The Americans seem uncertain whether China plans last-minute offers -- something not uncommon in trade negotiations -- or whether its leaders doubt that President Clinton has the will or the political strength now to get a deal through Congress.
Along with membership in the trade organization, the Chinese want the protection for their own exports that it would bring. But with rising unemployment and farmers' protests at home, and inefficient domestic industries already reeling, they have been reluctant to cut tariffs and other protective measures as quickly as Western nations demand.
While China's accession to the trade organization requires the consent of many countries, satisfying the United States is the most crucial step. Washington is concerned about a growing deficit with the Chinese, estimated at $57 billion last year, and officials believe that lower tariffs here would increase American exports. At the same time, many American companies have been frustrated by rules that severely limit their ability to invest or operate.
As anti-China sentiment rises in Congress, officials say, no agreement can survive without enthusiastic corporate support and lobbying. And while Congressional approval of a China accord is not required, under the trade body's rules, Congress would have to rescind a law that requires annual renewal of China's most-favored-nation trading status.

HEADLINE: Owner of Bronx Tenements Misused Funds, Audit Finds

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A real estate developer who has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for President Clinton and the Democratic Party has been accused by Federal officials of misappropriating $1.4 million from a troubled housing complex in the South Bronx even as the tenements fell apart.
At the same time, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, which holds the mortgages for the Jose DeDiego Beekman Houses, is moving to seize the complex of 38 buildings and 1,238 apartments in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx. 
 For the last 25 years, the complex has been owned by Gerald Schuster, general partner of the Continental Wingate Company, a real estate company in Needham, Mass., that has rehabilitated dilapidated buildings in New York and Massachusetts with Federal subsidies, tax breaks and low-interest loans.
According to an audit by the Inspector General's Office at HUD, Mr. Schuster and his companies siphoned $1.4 million in funds from the complex to pay company employees and to repay loans to his own companies. Some of the funds were also diverted to other investments.
The findings of the audit were referred to the United States Attorney's Office, which notified Mr. Schuster in a March 25 letter that it was considering civil action in connection with the allegations. The United States Attorney has not filed a lawsuit.
Last night, HUD officials, who had taken control of the Beekman Houses more than two years ago, also told the tenants that the agency "would formalize ownership of the properties."
"The department has taken these actions in the best interests of the tenants and taxpayers," said Peter Ragone, a spokesman for HUD. "HUD is committed to insuring that all New Yorkers in federally supported housing have access to a decent, clean and safe home."
Alan Eisner, a spokesman for Mr. Schuster and Continental Wingate, said that the allegations of misappropriation of funds were "without merit." He said the company had not even seen the audit of Beekman Houses.
"To the best of our knowledge and ability," Mr. Eisner said, "we are in full and complete compliance."
He said the company was working with HUD to "return the housing complex to the South Bronx community."
Mr. Schuster and his wife, Elaine, have contributed to, and raised enormous sums for, the Democrats in Massachusetts and nationally. Last year, President Clinton attended a $5,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner at the home of the Schusters in Boston.
Starting in the early 1970's, Continental Wingate and its limited partners renovated the 38 buildings that Beekman Houses comprises with federally subsidized mortgages and later rent subsidies.
"I think you'll find that we have a stellar reputation with HUD throughout the country," said Robert G. Najarian, president of Wingate Management, a subsidiary of Continental Wingate. "We pride ourselves on working in the inner cities and on our reputation."
But the company has also been dogged by complaints and investigations. In the late 1970's, then-Assemblyman Charles E. Schumer led a legislative panel that investigated the financing of Beekman Houses and conditions in the buildings.
"How was it possible for the Federal Government to spend $20 million on these houses and still have them remain such horrible slums?" Mr. Schumer asked at the time.
No action was taken against the company, however.
In December 1996, Continental defaulted on six of the eight mortgages for Beekman Houses. HUD then paid off $27.4 million in loans and took control of the complex. Since then, HUD has spent more than $15 million replacing windows and stoves, rehabilitating 500 kitchens and 450 bathrooms and making the buildings more secure.
"It's a testament to their faith in the system that they persevered," Mr. Schumer, now a United States Senator, said last night of the tenants. "I salute HUD's current leadership, but justice shouldn't take this long."
Norma Allen, president of Tenants United for Better Living, said that conditions had improved at the buildings recently. "HUD has been a treat," she said. "We didn't know we were entitled to all the services we're now getting."
But Ms. Allen and another resident of the complex said the problems at Beekman Houses were more complex than simply a bad management company.
Their neighborhood was plagued by drug gangs in the 1980's and suffered from the Federal Government's declining support for housing for poor people. One woman blamed HUD's negligence for allowing conditions to deteriorate.

Some On-Line Donations Don't Make It to Charities
In a new twist on Internet commerce, at least a half-dozen Web sites are offering to sell goods to on-line shoppers and send a portion of the purchase price to charity. Although the sums have been modest thus far, many charities see it as an important fund-raising development.
But it is impossible to know in every case what happens to the few dollars that customers thought were going to a good cause. Though many charities are getting checks directly from the sites, money may not end up in the charity's hands as fast as shoppers might imagine -- if at all. Page A1.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE WHITE HOUSE;
Clinton Says Milosevic Hurts Claim To Kosovo

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
President Clinton warned President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia today that he was increasingly jeopardizing his claim to keep Kosovo as a province of Yugoslavia with his assault on the ethnic Albanian population there.
Mr. Clinton vowed to pursue air attacks against Serbian targets in Yugoslavia until Mr. Milosevic ceases the killing. 
 "If there was ever any doubt about what is at stake in Kosovo, Mr. Milosevic is certainly erasing it by his actions," Mr. Clinton said at a State Department ceremony to unveil a portrait of Warren M. Christopher, the Secretary of State in Mr. Clinton's first term in office.
"They are the culmination of more than a decade of using ethnic and religious hatred as a justification for uprooting and murdering completely innocent peaceful civilians to pave Mr. Milosevic's path to absolute power," Mr. Clinton said.
In a later statement, the President firmly rejected a proposal from Mr. Milosevic to withdraw some of his forces from Kosovo in exchange for a halt in allied bombing. Mr. Clinton called the offer "unacceptable" and said peace would come only when Mr. Milosevic ended what the United States says is a campaign of terror in Kosovo.
In his remarks at the State Department, Mr. Clinton said, "We will see that his military will be seriously diminished, key military infrastructure destroyed, the prospect for international support for Serbia's claim to Kosovo increasingly jeopardized."
Under terms of a peace agreement signed this month at Rambouillet, France, by Kosovar Albanians but not by Mr. Milosevic, Kosovo would gain autonomy for three years from the central Yugoslav Government in Belgrade. NATO forces would guarantee the agreement. After that, the two sides would negotiate Kosovo's long-term status.
The United States and European nations who oversaw the peace talks have consistently opposed immediate for Kosovo, whose population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. Western leaders have said they do not want to see the further dismemberment of the remnants of Yugoslavia into a collection of small ethnic states with limited economic prospects and no history of self-government.
Administration officials said previously that the only way to guarantee that Kosovo remained part of Yugoslavia was for Mr. Milosevic to accept the autonomy arrangement that was being negotiated at Rambouillet. The alternative, officials have said, is continuing insurgency by Albanian separatists and intervention by NATO forces.
But Mr. Clinton suggested publicly for the first time since the allied bombing began last week that the Western position was shifting toward independence for Kosovo under some sort of international protection.
Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said that Mr. Clinton did not intend to announce a new policy today. Rather, Mr. Lockhart said, the President was describing a change in world opinion as Serbian fighting spreads through Kosovo.
"It is not our policy that Kosovo should be independent," Mr. Lockhart said. "But Milosevic's continuing on a campaign of atrocities had radicalized the people to such an extent that he forfeits any claim to it and loses international support for Kosovo remaining part of Yugoslavia."
Ivo Daalder, a Balkan specialist at the Brookings Institution who formerly served on the National Security Council, said that Mr. Clinton was making an implicit promise to protect the ethnic Albanian populationof Kosovo from Serbian atrocities. The only realistic way to accomplish that, Mr. Daalder said, is by creating an enclave in Kosovo protected by NATO and American forces.
"It's not a widening of the war aims, but bringing the war aims to their logical conclusion," Mr. Daalder said. "The only way we can fulfill our political objectives is by giving the Kosovars a territory of their own. My only regret is that we should have made this an explicit claim from the beginning."
The President also said today that the air attacks would continue until Mr. Milosevic's ability to carry out his campaign of repression was "seriously diminished" and critical parts of his military machinery were destroyed.
"The allies are united in our outrage over President Milosevic's atrocities against innocent people," Mr. Clinton said. "We are determined to stay with our policy."
Mr. Clinton said that the Serbian offensive was planned before the NATO air strikes began a week ago. He accused Mr. Milosevic of pretending to negotiate with Kosovar Albanians and European leaders this winter even as he moved "from village to village and atrocity to atrocity."
"Now it is clear that as the Kosovar leaders were saying yes to peace," Mr. Clinton said, "Mr. Milosevic was planning a new campaign of expulsions and executions in Kosovo. He started carrying out that plan as the talks ended, increasing our sense of urgency that the air strikes NATO had threatened for some time must begin."

NATO Agrees to Bomb Sites in Belgrade
The United States and NATO agreed to an escalated air campaign that would include government buildings in downtown Belgrade as targets, two senior American officials said. Western officials admitted that air strikes had failed to halt the Serbs' assault in Kosovo or to damage their military sufficiently. A1
 
NATO warplanes bombarded Serbian ground forces, airfields and supply depots around the clock, but did not knock out the Serbs' air defenses or blunt their offensive. A11 

The growing exodus of refugees from Kosovo has left Clinton Administration officials and NATO officials wondering whether they will ever be able to achieve the goal of a province in which Serbs and ethnic Albanians can live in peace. A1

HEADLINE: Video Lottery Game Dies In Stalemate Over Budget

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 30

 BODY:
As bickering over the state's budget stalemate grew more heated, state lawmakers today insured that Quick Draw, the video lottery game introduced less than four years ago, would come to an abrupt end Wednesday night.
The Senate and Assembly approved a set of emergency bills to keep the state running for two weeks after the April 1 start of the fiscal year, but not before Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders had flirted with a partial government shutdown over the issue of building a luge run and two ski lifts in the Adirondacks for winter Goodwill Games next year. The dispute -- and the brinkmanship involved -- may have said less about the condition of the state's ski resorts than about the relationship between the Republican Governor and the Democrat Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver. 
 In the end, Mr. Pataki blinked, taking the money for the resorts out of the emergency bills, but he tore into Mr. Silver in unusually harsh terms, accusing him of jeopardizing the Goodwill Games. "You are telling all of upstate New York you don't care about their economic status," he said. "You are essentially telling them to drop dead."
Mr. Silver and other Democrats countered that the Governor had been manufacturing a crisis to make them look bad, and to win legislation that otherwise would not pass through the threat of a government shutdown.
The first victim of the confrontation was Quick Draw. In 1995, at Mr. Pataki's insistence, the keno-style video game was introduced in New York over the vehement protests of anti-gambling groups and the reservations of the Assembly Democrats. But the law that created it expires Wednesday at midnight.
This year, Mr. Pataki proposed not only extending the game, but making it available in more places, which would increase the $120 million a year in profit it generates for the state. As recently as last week, he said that the emergency spending bills he would send to the Legislature would include a provision keeping the game alive.
But today, the Governor, seeing that neither house of the Legislature had any enthusiasm for the game, sent emergency bills that did not include it, guaranteeing that it would expire Wednesday. It could be resurrected in an eventual budget deal, but lawmakers in both parties called that unlikely. Mr. Pataki insisted today that he did not care whether the game died, despite his earlier support for it.
Scott Wexler, executive director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Owners Association, said the demise of Quick Draw could hurt bars, restaurants, bowling alleys and other establishments where the game is played.
"We're obviously disappointed," Mr. Wexler told The Associated Press. "It will be a loss of revenue to small-business owners, not just in terms of the commission they lose, but also the 10 to 15 percent increase in food and beverage business they have when the game is being run."
In past years, when the budget has been late, Mr. Pataki has routinely attempted to attach items he wanted to the emergency bills, a move that the Legislature has seen as a power grab and has usually beaten back. Mr. Silver accused the Governor today of trying to win his budget battle that way, piece by piece, by calling things like Quick Draw and the ski resort money emergencies.
"The Governor said this is an emergency," the Speaker said, "and I said, 'So is money for the pre-K classes, so is money for reducing class size,' " referring to education programs Mr. Pataki has proposed cutting.
In January, Lake Placid was awarded the first-ever winter Goodwill Games, to be held next February. Mr. Pataki said today that contracts for a new luge run at Lake Placid, and for new gondola lifts at Whiteface Mountain and Gore Mountain had to be awarded by the first week of April to insure that they would be completed in time for the games.
The games, Mr. Pataki said, would be an economic boon to the region, and he said Mr. Silver was putting it at risk. The Governor had planned to add the $10 million cost of the projects to the emergency spending bills he sent to the Legislature today, but at Mr. Silver's insistence, he sent it as a separate bill, rather than risking a government shutdown over the issue.
Mr. Silver and other Democrats emphasized that they have no objection to the projects. But they assert that if the emergency is real, the Governor has ample power to pay for the work from funds he controls, and some members of the Senate's Republican majority agree. And, along with environmental groups, the Democrats also object to Mr. Pataki's proposal to pay for the construction out of the state's Environmental Protection Fund.

Honoring a Museum's Very Loyal Member

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
IN 1924, back in the days when the Metropolitan Museum of Art was a sleepy behemoth with grandees like Payne Whitney and Elihu Root on the board, a young woman studying for a masters' degree at Columbia University eagerly gave $10 to join the museum as a member. Today, 75 years later, Luise K. Addiss is still a member -- the only person, the Met says, who has been on the roster that long.
"Unusual, to say the least," said Mrs. Addiss, who will be 100 years old on June 21. 
 Philippe de Montebello, the Met's director, has sent Mrs. Addiss flowers, a handwritten note and an open invitation to tour the museum in her wheelchair and have lunch when the Met is closed on Mondays.
"That sounds very exciting," Mrs. Addiss said.
Her opinion on being old?
"I think it's dull," she said.
The Met, of course, thought that record-breaking loyalty was worth making a fuss over, and it seemed that Mrs. Addiss, nearing 100, might have good stories to tell, or at least amusing opinions on whether museums are good for your health.
Still, while loyalty might endure, one's energy is bound to flag a bit over 99 years. Mrs. Addiss was sound asleep on a recent Monday for a scheduled 9 A.M. interview at her Gramercy Park apartment. "She was so excited about the interview that she didn't sleep last night," said Gail Addiss, Mrs. Addiss's daughter-in-law.
So while Mrs. Addiss napped in the living room in her wheelchair, Gail and her husband, James, the second of Mrs. Addiss's four children, sat by her side and told stories about her. Penelope Yungblut, her youngest child, was there for a time, too.
In her younger days, she wore clothes designed by Hattie Carnegie, gave lots of parties and ran a well-ordered household.
Over the living room fireplace was an oil painting of Mrs. Addiss from another time, in a yellow evening dress, with her dark hair pulled off her face, as if she were on her way to the opera. "She always felt that was glamorized," Ms. Yungblut said.
The portrait was painted when Mrs. Addiss was in her early 30's -- a time when she was working full-time as a home economist at what is now the Community Service Society of New York. Back then The Brooklyn Eagle called Mrs. Addiss a pioneer for going into the Depression-era homes of the poor and teaching them about nutrition.
She had arrived in New York in 1922 from Akron, Ohio, where her father, an Austrian immigrant, ran a plumbing business. Luise Addiss was the first girl in her family to go to college.
IN New York, Mrs. Addiss married (at 29 to Edward F. Addiss, an executive with Burlington Industries), stayed at the Community Service Society for 40 years, retired at the age of 65, studied painting, then worked for another 10 years as a consultant to the Head Start program, which was just beginning. In 1963, she wrote an article for the professional journal Children, saying there was an urgent need for day care for America's working women.
"I wonder if she thought she was ahead of her time?" Mr. Addiss said.
At the age of 70, Mrs. Addiss started making modern silver jewelry -- "It wasn't this quaint, little old lady stuff," her daughter-in-law said. At 75 she went to the United Nations and became chairwoman of a committee that worked to improve the lives of African women. She finally retired at 85. At 89, a leg was amputated because of arteriosclerosis, but she lived on her own until four years ago.
Her secrets? Exercise and mental stimulation. "She walked, and she did exercises, even in the elevator at the old Lord & Taylor," Ms. Yungblut said. "There would be bars around, and she would lift herself up with her arms."
On Monday, a reporter returned for another interview with Mrs. Addiss, this time over lunch.
"We've been having long conversations the last couple of days," said Stephen Addiss, who is child No. 3. "They meander here and there, but they're interesting."
Mrs. Addiss sometimes speaks now in a short, clipped kind of code. But asked what her strongest memories were -- her work, her late husband or her children, Mrs. Addiss was very clear. "Memories of the children," she said. "Never forgetting."
Mrs. Addiss's children say she faced her first big crisis when she lost her leg. "So much of what makes us happy is self-defining," Stephen Addiss said. "She thought of herself as an active person, and when she couldn't do that anymore, it destroyed a lot of the person she thought she was."
Mrs. Addiss had another setback in 1992, when her eldest son, Edward, 62, died of cancer. But three or four years ago, her children say she came to a quiet acceptance of her life.
"Because she's tough," James said. "She didn't give it up."
"It was anger almost," Stephen said. "But she fought. She's ornery."
So now her children, who of course Mrs. Addiss always took to the Met and other museums, do much of her talking, in more ways than one. James is an architectural historian, Stephen is a professor of Japanese art and music at the University of Richmond and Penelope is a psychotherapist and Jungian analyst.
"So maybe being carted away to museums as little tykes had some effect on us," Stephen said. "What do you think, Jim?"

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE FUTURE;
After Kosovo's 'Cleansing': Can Two Sides Ever Coexist?

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
The growing refugee crisis in Kosovo has left Clinton Administration and NATO officials wondering whether they will be able to achieve their goal of a peaceful settlement between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
Nearly a third of the 1.8 million ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have been forced from their homes by Serbian troops, and many of those refugees have left Kosovo for neighboring Macedonia, Albania or Montenegro. 
 James P. Rubin, State Department spokesman, said today that the strategy of routing ethnic Albanians, under the direction of the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, has crystallized the animosity between the two groups. This "radicalization," he said, was making it "all the more difficult to imagine a circumstance where the peoples can begin to live together again."
Mr. Rubin insisted today that the Administration stood by the framework of the Rambouillet accord, which called for Kosovo to stay in Serbia as an autonomous entity.
But NATO officials have already started talking about other outcomes, including talk today that Kosovo could wind up as a separate entity under international protection -- if the allies actually succeed in subduing the Serbian military.
Sketching the outlines of a protectorate, a NATO planner said that NATO troops would oversee the return of ethnic Albanian refugees to Kosovo and guarantee their safety under an arrangement in which the Serbs would have virtually no power.
In London, British officials said the refugees should be allowed to return home. The Defense Minister, George Robertson, said Mr. Milosevic, should not be rewarded for ejecting ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
"The refugees must be allowed to go home, their homes must be rebuilt," Mr. Robertson said. He and others were not specific about who would pay for rebuilding.
The outflow of refugees, many of them traumatized by the executions they said they had witnessed, could easily destabilize the fragile countries of Macedonia and Albania, as well as the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
Given the speed at which the Serbian forces have pushed ethnic Albanians out of their homes, a Balkans specialist in the Administration predicted today that by the end of the week, half the Albanian population could be outside the province and the remainder crouching in the woods.
In his televised speech last Wednesday, outlining the reasons for NATO's intervention in Kosovo, President Clinton said the conflict between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians had "no natural national boundaries." It was necessary, he said, to intervene to contain its spread.
Displaying a map with bold arrows showing the movement of refugees, Mr. Clinton said, "Already this movement is threatening the young democracy in Macedonia, which has its own Albanian minority and a Turkish minority. Already Serbian forces have made forays into Albania, from which Kosovars have drawn support. Albania has a Greek minority. Let a fire burn here in this area, and the flames will spread."
But since the bombing started, Mr. Milosevic had purposely pushed refugees to Macedonia and Albania in an effort to throw into turmoil the very countries that the bombing was supposed to help protect, a Clinton Administration official said.
About a third of the two million inhabitants of Macedonia are Albanian and a large inflow of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo could tip the balance into a majority Albanian population, the official said. Macedonia has about 40 percent unemployment and a new democracy. Government officials there were appealing today to the European Union to take some of the ethnic Albanian refugees, and foreign ministers from Germany, Austria and Finland said they would meet Thursday near Bonn to discuss the issue.
Albania is the poorest country in Europe, barely able to look after its own people, and certainly not able to care for the tens of thousands of new refugees, the Administration official said.
It was possible, the official said, that NATO troops would have to be sent to Albania as well as Macedonia -- where a 10,000-strong NATO force has been poised as peacekeepers for Kosovo -- to help the two countries control increasing tensions.
"I think we're going to end up with troops in Albania and Macedonia," the official said. "For Macedonia these refugees make big trouble."
Since the bombing began last week, NATO officials said they believed almost 150,000 ethnic Albanian refugees had left the province and gone to Albania. Another 22,500 had fled to Macedonia and 42,500 were now in Montenegro, they said.
Combined with the more than 400,000 that had fled their homes beginning in January of last year when the conflict began, the number of refugees forced either into neighboring lands or left to seek shelter in the countryside had reached about 570,000, Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman said today. Kosovo has about 2 million people, of which 90 percent are ethnic Albanian, and the remainder Serbian.
Reports from the border at Macedonia today, said that a line of cars and people on foot stretched for six miles inside Kosovo, as people tried to leave.
From inside Kosovo, there were reports of a large gathering of refugees huddled for safety in a valley being shelled by Serbian artillery and of a forced mass exodus along the eastern road out of Pristina, the capital.
The city of Pec, a graceful town of 100,000 was virtually empty and the houses, mosques and stores destroyed, NATO said. With Pristina now a target of ethnic cleansing, there was only one town of any size -- Gnjilane, south east of the capital -- that had not been attacked by the Serbs, officials said.
The stories of the continuing purge of the population were eked out by satellite phone and in some cases landline phone. But most were impossible to verify.
An ethnic Albanian living in Washington, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisals against his family, said he spoke to his parents, and two brothers in Pristina today by telephone.
"They said there's lots of panic because people have fled to Macedonia and those who are left don't know what to do," he said. The villages of Sosali and Matican to the east of the city had been shelled, leaving a line several miles long of people in cars and on foot heading for the border of Macedonia, he said. "My mother is very concerned about my brothers and their kids. How are they going to leave and how are they going to leave together?"

HEADLINE: Would You Like the Wine List? No, Just a Corkscrew

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV 

 BODY:
I WAS nervous as I approached Patroon, the clubby restaurant known for its fine American food and excellent but expensive wine list. In my bag I had a special bottle of my own, a cabernet sauvignon from Dunn Vineyards that had been aging for a decade. On this night, I hoped, I would drink it with dinner.
That's what made me nervous. Would the sommelier roll his eyes at the rube with his own bottle? Would the hostess sneer at my audacity? Would they tell me to get lost? 
 Nothing of the sort. As the hostess showed us to our table, I showed her my bottle and whispered my request. "Of course," she murmured. A minute later a waiter appeared. "May I take your bottle?" he asked. A sommelier returned with the bottle and decanted it, as was appropriate for this wine. "Where did you ever find this?" he asked appreciatively. Success -- and I didn't have to be embarrassed, or even whisper.
The right, even the necessity, to tote your own wine to dinner is a time-honored practice among many smaller restaurants that are not licensed to sell wine and beer. But the practice also occurs at fancier, more ambitious restaurants that have invested considerable amounts of money in building their wine lists. Restaurants do not encourage the practice, but most allow it, especially, as I found out by experimenting at several restaurants, if you adhere to a certain protocol. This essentially consists of asking permission to bring wine when you make the reservation. And if you encounter resistance, it helps if you can offer a good reason.
The restaurants go along with it mostly to accommodate regular customers and special occasions. They don't advertise the fact because they aren't particularly happy about it under any circumstance. Alcohol, after all, provides them with some of their best profits -- the price is generally twice what you would expect to pay at a retail store, sometimes more. And in many instances, a restaurant's wine service allows it to show off an expertise beyond the expected culinary wizardry.
"It's not thrilling when somebody brings in a bottle of wine because it's one less bottle you're going to sell," said Danny Meyer, whose restaurants include Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Eleven Madison Park and Tabla. "We've got a huge amount of money tied up in our wine cellar."
To compensate, most restaurants charge a fee to uncork a bottle of wine brought in by a customer. Depending on the wine you've chosen to bring, the corkage fee may still permit a considerable savings or obliterate any advantage at all. These fees can vary tremendously. At Patroon, the fee was $30. Orinoco, a Venezuelan restaurant on the Upper East Side, charges $10. At Mr. Meyer's restaurants, the charge is $15. At La Caravelle and Windows on the World, it's $20. At Montrachet, it's $35. At the Post House, it's free.
Bringing your own wine is desirable, especially in New York, where so many people do all their entertaining in restaurants. Some people want to drink a special wine on a birthday or anniversary. Others, who have amassed a stock of old and rare bottles, want to bring in wines from their collections that are hard to find in restaurants. And some restaurants have small or limited wine lists to begin with -- Thai and Indian restaurants, for example, rarely offer rieslings or cabernet francs, the kinds of wine that go so well with the food. The bottom line, though, is economic.
Even when a wine list is not inflated beyond reason, the costs can be staggering. Those who think nothing of paying a restaurant $30 for a wine they can buy on the corner for $15 may pause at paying $200 for a wine they can buy for $100 less.
"If you have collected wine over the years, to pay the prices in restaurants is amazing," said Bill Plotch, a bond trader and wine enthusiast, who has brought his own bottles to restaurants for special occasions.
Erika Moore, a communications consultant, and her husband, Terence, belong to a wine-tasting society that occasionally scouts around for restaurants with modest wine lists that charge minimal corkage fees. "It's always been very pleasant," she said. "A lot of our members have incredible cellars. They've bought stuff at auction or 10 or 15 years ago where they spent $80 a case and now it costs much, much more."
Restaurant attitudes toward those bringing in wine vary, ranging from a polite acceptance to outright hostility. As a practical matter, restaurants are free to set their own corkage policies. "No laws regulate or prohibit corkage fees," said Alan Gardner, whose law firm, Verini & Gardner, represents a number of restaurants that do business with the New York State Liquor Authority. "It's strictly up to the individual restaurateur whether to permit you to bring alcohol or what to charge."
Yet even restaurants that strongly discourage the practice find themselves accommodating it occasionally.
"The policy is fairly firm against people bringing their own wine," Daniel Johnnes, the wine director for Montrachet, said. "However, like all things in life, there's room for maneuver. If somebody's celebrating a 50th anniversary, and they bring in a bottle they've been saving, you can be sure we're not going to charge corkage, and we'll serve it with pleasure. However, that's very different from somebody bringing in a case of wine for a tasting and trying to get away from paying for wine."
Mr. Johnnes recalled six businessmen who walked in once with a case of expensive wine, expecting to be accommodated. "They handed us the box, told us which order to serve them in and said, 'We'd like Riedel glasses,' " he said. "Of course we refused. You have to have some courtesy."
Etiquette is crucial when bringing your own wine. It begins with a phone call, simply to smooth the way.
"If you walk into a restaurant cold with a bottle of wine in your hand and say, 'Pour this,' somebody's going to get a little uptight," said Alan Stillman, the chief executive of the New York Restaurant Group, which includes the Post House, Smith & Wollensky, Cite and Park Avenue Cafe. He does not charge a corkage fee at his restaurants, he says, because the only people who bring their own wines are regular customers who do so only on special occasions. "When it happens, we say there must be a reason for it," he said. "I wouldn't be happy if somebody came in with wine once every three weeks."
Most consumers understand that politeness counts. Mr. Plotch, the bond trader, says that he rarely brings wines to restaurants, and only to those where he's developed a relationship with the owner. "I wouldn't feel comfortable unless over the years I'd spent a lot of money in a restaurant," he said. "I think it's rude otherwise." He also recognizes the value of sharing the wealth. "If I do bring in a really great bottle, I'll always offer the owner or the one who's taking care of me a glass," he said.
A quick phone call might have saved embarrassment one recent evening when I tried to bring in a bottle of Jean-Louis Chave Hermitage 1994 to Peter Luger Steak House, where the hamburger-class wine list does not do justice to the restaurant's legendary steaks. I was politely but firmly rebuffed by the maitre d'hotel, and no amount of diplomacy could change his mind.
"We don't do that," the maitre d'hotel said. "I've even turned down Henry Kissinger."
Peter Luger's treasurer, Amy Rubenstein, said the policy makes things simpler for the restaurant. "It's just easier for us," she said. "We don't charge excessively, we don't have large markups, but we're in business to sell wine, and that's what we do."
Even if you've received permission from a restaurant to bring that special wine, the hand that pours the bottle for you will still be outstretched. "The waiter's salary has to do with what we make on wine," Mr. Meyer said, "so generally people are more generous with the gratuity." As a rule, Mr. Johnnes of Montrachet recommends tipping as if you had bought the wine at the restaurant.
While restaurateurs dread the B.Y.O. Bordeaux crowd, the actual number of people bringing in their wines is small. "Our restaurant has been open about six months, and I can count on my fingers the number of people who have brought bottles," Steven Eckler, the general manager at Eleven Madison Park, said.
Mr. Eckler, the former general manager of Postrio in San Francisco, says this small number is in direct contrast to his experience there. "On the West Coast, I would see two to three times as many people," he said. "It's a different restaurant culture. People don't feel the same hesitancy. They weren't embarrassed about bringing it in. As a restaurant, you got used to it."
Larry Stone, the wine director and a co-owner of Rubicon in San Francisco, says the different attitude stems from the area's proximity to wine country. "Winery owners entertain a lot and have to bring their own wines, and that became the basis for it," he said. "Seattle, too, is fairly tolerant, but Southern California is different."
Mr. Stone says that the practice was so common that many area restaurants have not only abandoned hope of resistance but have completely capitulated, instead accepting the profits they make on corkage fees, which Mr. Stone said range from $8 to $20.
"A lot of restaurants don't want to stock wines because people bring their own anyway," Mr. Stone said. "They've just given up on creating a wine list. You just don't see anything older. You don't find the kind of collections that you might on the East Coast."
He estimated that when Rubicon opened in 1994, 20 to 25 percent of the customers on some nights paid corkage fees. The restaurant managed to reduce the figure to 3 percent by emphasizing rare wines at reasonable prices, he said. But that victory comes at a cost of smaller profits on wine, a greater dedication to training the staff about wine and an effort at ferreting out unusual bottles. And still, the restaurant lives in fear of customers bearing bottles.
"Four people bringing in 10 different bottles of wine," Mr. Stone envisioned, practically shuddering. "That's the nightmare part of this. That's 40 glasses. It takes up a lot of time for the server, they have to be washed and scrubbed, and they don't tip!"

Swapping Cha-Chas and Rap in Cuba

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS 

DATELINE: HAVANA, March 29

 BODY:
It was in the air: the thrill of the illicit and the new, the excitement of discovery and the charge of an encounter with idols. And it didn't take place on a baseball field.
Just after the Baltimore Orioles broke ground by playing a Cuban team here, musicians by the score and fans by the thousands poured into the Karl Marx Theater on Sunday night in this city's elegant Playa district for the Music Bridges concert, the biggest convergence of foreign and Cuban musicians since the revolution. Before that came a week of impromptu collaborations outdoors and in makeshift studios. 
 From the United States came singers like Bonnie Raitt, Jimmy Buffett, Beth Nielsen Chapman, Joan Osborne, Lisa Loeb, Burt Bacharach and more. The Cubans brought together musicians from the folk, rock and popular dance music scenes. In the end the all-star concert at the Karl Marx flickered and droned, the lead-up concerts had people dancing and cheering, and the future of this enterprise, musical or otherwise, seemed as hazy and unpredictable as anything else involving Cuban-American relations.
Music Bridges, an organization that specializes in concerts in politically sensitive countries, had spent a year and a half pulling together the legal and practical permission from the United States and Cuba.
Music Bridges, with its 40-some participating American musicians, had come to Havana and taken more than 120 rooms in the Hotel Nacional, overlooking the ocean. The organization filled the sixth-floor executive offices and the presidential suite, along with three rooms that had been converted into recording studios. For a week Cuban and American musicians were to collaborate on songs and to present the works on the final night in a long concert at the Karl Marx Theater.
At events around the city American musicians were getting a feel for the power of Cuban music and its bacchanalian spirit. In the wee hours of Thursday night at La Cecilia nightclub, Michael Franti, a rapper and band leader from San Francisco, mounted the stage with Cuba's version of the Rolling Stones, Los Van Van, a 30-year-old institution playing hard-rocking dance music. Mr. Franti started rapping and repeating a phrase, and Pedrito, one of the group's singers, entered the fray; the two swapped nonsense syllables, but with rhythm. It would have brought down the roof, but La Cecilia is outdoors. Members of the audience -- made up of faranduleros, the habitues of Havana's night life scene, Music Bridges staff members and performers, and journalists -- were impressed and they danced.
On Saturday at the Charlie Chaplin Theater in the Vedado district, Americans and what remains of members of Cuba's intellectual culture had the chance to hear the Buena Vista Social Club play cha-cha-chas, mambos and boleros that have mostly fallen into disregard. The performance, which was not part of Music Bridges, offered an opportunity to hear music with extreme grace and humor, one of the great musical syntheses of the New World, where classical, jazz and African music merged into something special. Played by old, weary and worn musicians, the music reflected the prerevolution grandeur of Cuban society, as does the best architecture of the city, also worn, weary and prerevolutionary.
The American producer of the Buena Vista band, Ry Cooder, who was in Cuba for a screening of a new documentary about the group directed by Wim Wenders, said of the music: "I've never seen any scene explode as quickly as this. That's good, and that's bad."
Regardless, it was one of the greatest windfalls of positive publicity the Cuban Government has had in its post-Batista history. Though the economic embargo of Cuba, the Helms-Burton Act, leaves a loophole for cultural exchange, nothing of this size had been attempted before. The Cuban side, which has everything to gain from such exchanges, regularly proclaimed its happiness with events like this one; the American side was not so sure.
Though many of the American musicians had barely a clue about either Cuban music or Cuban-American relations, the predominant view seemed to be that antagonistic relationships between the two countries did little for Cubans or Americans. Ms. Raitt, who came fully informed and loaded for bear, brought 37 guitars to give away, and a pile of medicine.
"Everybody knows that the embargo the American Government has placed on Cuba just hurts the Cuban people," Ms. Raitt said. "So I went to my guitar company and bought a bunch of guitars at cost, and I'm going to give lots away to the music school here, and the rest to people I know."
In the last year Cuba has cracked down on the casual prostitution prevalent on the streets and in the dance clubs. Where clubs with live music were once almost too numerous to count, now nearly all have been closed by the Government. One result is that the best bands no longer play regularly, and one of the world's great music scenes is moribund.
Instead Havana seems to be undergoing renovation for tourists, and Old Havana is flooded with new hotels and stores that suggest that the economy is doing well. Unfortunately the average Cuban is not allowed to enter the hotels and has little or no access to the dollar economy that has sprung up alongside the peso. In a seeming effort to insure that the city is safe for tourism and to reduce crime, the police, on nearly every corner, were stopping Cubans and checking identification. Some residents associated with the music exchange said that many Cubans from outside Havana were being shipped to jail or back home.
While generally unaware of the politics, American visitors were stunned by the skills of their Cuban counterparts. Some musicians stayed at the Nacional and worked with their Cuban partners. Others, like N'Dea Davenport, the former lead singer from the British group the Brand New Heavies, stayed and worked in Old Havana with her writing partners.
"I love it here regardless of the hardships," said Ms. Davenport, who now lives in New Orleans. "The reason I love New Orleans is that there's music everywhere, and it's the same here. Everybody sings or dances or plays an instrument. It's changing my life."
The average Cuban musician, taught from age 7 in Government-run conservatories, is among the best trained and musically literate in the world, schooled in classical music, pop and jazz. While the American musicians were discovering the riches of Cuban music, the Cubans were learning plenty from the Americans.
Like most of their countrymen, Cuban musicians receive only bits and pieces of information from the outside world. They look to the United States for musical cues but get music from the most powerful stations in Miami or New Orleans, which guarantees a view of a music world heavy on Kenny G and the worst pop. Other information comes from furtive conversations or secondhand accounts of people who have seen bands in Europe. And maybe they will get the occasional recording.
"The most amazing thing about this encounter is the ability to hang out with our idols, to learn what's behind the music that we've heard all our lives," said Luis de la Cruz, guitarist, composer and leader of the band Bolsa Negra (Black Market). "It's one thing to hear a bit of music on the radio, but to actually sit down with somebody we admire and ask questions and collaborate on something intimate like the writing process is really incredible."
Carlos Varela, one of Cuba's most important singer-songwriters, collaborated with the Indigo Girls. He has played in the United States a few times and has flirted with major record labels. But Cuba's isolation, apart from the infatuation with the island internationally, almost guarantees the failure of an international career. For him the weeklong stay was important for another reason.
"When I go to the United States the next time, I have a hundred telephone numbers of musicians to call, new friends I've made," he said. "People want me to come to collaborate, to write and record with them. For that reason alone this is invaluable."
Chucho Valdes, the dean of Cuban musicians, pianist and leader of the group Irakere, thought the encounter was going to leave a permanent impression on the Cuban music scene.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Mr. Valdes, who is also the director of the nearly annual Havana Jazz Festival, which usually attracts a handful of American musicians. "The things that we lack, a formal sophistication in pop music and harmonic sense, we're learning right now. And the way to produce sound, to get a good sound."
Still, the final Music Bridges concert was pretty much an artistic disaster, unlike the weeklong exchange. Generally American pop musicianship is, to be kind, basic. The Cubans were often reduced to being the professional hired hands backing the illiterate boss. Most songs were in English, with Americans leading the bands. The Americans were mostly white, mostly folk-oriented and mostly second rate. It is an old history. The recordings of the concert, and the music made at the Hotel National may be released, depending on legal restrictions imposed by the United States.
There were a few good moments. Ms. Davenport tore the place apart with a song she and the Cuban singer Rene Banos sang called "Que Importa," in which they listed the differences between them, including their beer-brand preferences. Ms. Osborne, backed by Manolito y Su Trabuco, sang a deep and funny blues that had the audience on its feet. There were some mildly political songs -- Ms. Raitt sang "Cuba Is Way Too Cool" -- but most performers stuck to "We Are the Worldisms." (One tune was called "One World.")
But most people, though the musicians had worked hard on the songs, weren't really looking for an end. The means, in this case, was sufficient.

HEADLINE: U.S. Data May Understate Productivity Gains

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
After years of maintaining that its statistics on the labor productivity growth rate were generally reliable, the Government agency that produces the numbers now says they may be somewhat understated.
In research to be published on Wednesday, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that the current economic prosperity, and rising profits "do not seem fully consistent with slow productivity growth." The new studies focused on four industries -- banking, insurance, construction and health services -- that seem robust but have registered no improvement in official productivity statistics in recent years. 
 Edwin R. Dean, chief of the bureau's productivity division, wrote in one of three articles that will appear in the Labor Department's Monthly Labor Review that the published data do not appear to understate productivity gains "by a large order of magnitude." But he said there appeared to have been at least some underestimate, mostly because of measurement problems in the vast service sector.
The unexpected expression of doubt from the Bureau of Labor Statistics gives a fresh twist to perhaps the most important economic debate in the United States today: whether corporate America has become sufficiently efficient to keep the current economic boom going without having to raise prices or sacrifice profits.
National well-being depends on productivity, which measures how much a worker produces in a given hour. Corporate revenue rises when workers produce more in that hour than they did before. A factory worker makes more bottle caps, for example, or a telephone operator handles more calls, or an air traffic controller more flights. The additional revenue can then be divided up as extra profit or higher wages or both. That feeds into spending and investment, and more jobs, and the economy flourishes.
The productivity growth rate rose smartly until 1973 and then the statistics registered a sharp decline that has persisted since, except for temporary upticks during boom periods, including the current boom, which started in late 1995. While some economists contend that the official productivity numbers are accurate, others insist that they have failed to capture the improvements made possible by computers and other technologies.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has repeatedly argued that the national economy once again enjoys a productivity growth rate reminiscent of the quarter-century after World War II. And now the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the first time, has publicly expressed doubt about its own figures.
"We have had careful discussions with prominent economists in recent years," Mr. Dean said in a telephone interview, "and we have felt under an obligation to conduct probing studies of this issue and these studies have now been completed."
The bureau's studies fail to address an issue considered crucial by some economists -- whether the findings in three or four industries can be generalized to the economy as a whole. Underestimating productivity in some industries may be offset by overestimating productivity in others, said Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
"We don't know if we are dealing with an allocation problem," he said, "or a change in total national productivity."
The bureau's new studies examined not only labor productivity but also a broader measure, known as multifactor productivity, which measures the output or dollar value of the production that results not only from a worker's efforts but also from other inputs, such as the computers and machinery that workers use. In both cases, the bureau found that the biggest problem lay in accurately measuring output. Often it has to be roughly estimated.
The bureau's studies also cited difficulties in adjusting output for inflation, and in defining in the service sector what constitutes input and output in the first place.
"In the production of services," Mr. Dean wrote in an article that summarized the other findings, "the consumer often supplies an essential input. For example, it may not be possible to define medical output adequately without considering whether the patient follows the doctor's advice, or ignores it. Similar issues arise in the fields of education and entertainment. For example, the output of a jazz band may not be well defined without considering whether the audience was 1,000 people, 10 people, or no one at all."
Finally, the bureau's studies covered the last 20 years, too short a time to determine whether the productivity growth rate was similarly underestimated in its heyday before 1973. If so, then the sharp decline in productivity growth after that year would be roughly unchanged.

HEADLINE: Graduate Teaching Assistants, Increasingly Burdened, Are Unionizing

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
When Elizabeth K. Shermer started the five-year process of earning a doctoral degree in medieval English from the University of California at Berkeley, her teaching responsibilities began almost immediately. Without any tutoring on how to teach, she was asked to lead a discussion group on Chaucer the next day.
"It's like an entry-level position, but you're thrown in up to your neck," said Ms. Sherman, 28, who makes $1,300 a month for 20 hours a week teaching freshman composition; at the same time, she is finishing her thesis. "It was scary. At least I knew the material, but I felt like I needed a lot more help." 
 Students like Ms. Shermer take on more than half the teaching load for undergraduates at the University of California and at the nation's other major public research institutions, a shift that in the last 20 years has doubled the percentage of teachers not on the full-time faculty. A study by the graduate student teachers' union at Yale University, released on Monday, concluded that part-time instructors and graduate students taught 70 percent of Yale's classes.
Graduate teaching assistants give lectures, hold discussion groups, conduct labs and grade papers. Such reliance on part-time instructors is a much-debated topic in academe and is fostering a climate of labor militancy on campuses nationwide.
Dissatisfaction among teaching assistants has led to union organizing at 18 public-school campuses, including the City University of New York and the University of Michigan. In a decision expected to help organizing efforts elsewhere, last week the Public Employment Relations Board in California ordered the University of California to allow union elections to take place at seven campuses by the school year's end. Earlier in the week, teaching assistants at the University of California at Los Angeles had overwhelmingly voted to join a United Auto Workers affiliate. University officials had previously refused to recognize a union.
"This is the prize they're after," said Judith S. Craig, an associate dean at the University of Wisconsin, where the first union of teaching assistants was formed in 1969.
For 16 years, California's premier public university has fought unionization by its 9,000 graduate students, two-thirds of whom have joined, union officials say. Support is strongest among students in humanities and social science. During the paper and exam crunch at the end of the semester in December, graduate students walked off the job in the first systemwide strike. The action brought pressure on university officials from state legislative leaders, who urged a settlement and union recognition. The new Governor, Gray Davis, was already on record supporting the union.
In late December, the employment relations board determined that teaching assistants should be considered employees and not students, and had the right to unionize. The board rejected an appeal last month.
Members of the newly created U.C.L.A. union, the Student Association of Graduate Employees, are most concerned about declining health benefits, the lack of an effective grievance procedure, workload distribution and enrollment fees that are not fully forgiven, said Constance M. Razza, a union spokeswoman.
Albert Carnesale, U.C.L.A.'s chancellor, who helped the United States negotiate a missile treaty with the Soviet Union, said negotiations over graduate students' concerns were likely to be delicate.
"The difficulty will come in being able to separate academic from workplace issues," Mr. Carnesale said. "It's not a trivial undertaking because the line is not a bright one."
Ms. Craig, a member of the Wisconsin bargaining team, who wrote a dissertation on graduate student unions, said a union benefited the university by forcing faculty members to improve their supervision and evaluation of teaching assistants. It also meant that fair treatment did not rest on the good will of the faculty.
Among the drawbacks, she said, is an adversarial environment. Another is that a student-run collective-bargaining group is transient. A result is a constant redefinition of the union's aims over economic and academic issues. A collective-bargaining contract also takes away a department's ability to make hiring or workload exceptions when necessary, Ms. Craig said.
Unions have failed to raise most graduate-student salaries, said Cary Nelson, an English professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Pay that amounts to less than the minimum wage is not unusual. "I find those salaries all the time," Professor Nelson said, citing the $1,125 the University of Nebraska at Kearney pays a graduate student to teach a three-month class meeting three times a week. He figures that amounts to $3.75 an hour.
Professor Nelson is drafting a bill of rights for graduate students. Its provisions include pay equal to 30 percent of median family income for a full year. He will urge its adoption in a June meeting of the American Association of University Professors, which has 44,000 members.
The Modern Language Association, the first academic group to help graduate students and part-time instructors establish their claim statistically, plans to survey working conditions in English and language departments at all of the country's 3,500 colleges this fall.
"We hope historians and economists will take similar actions to reform their own workplaces," Professor Nelson said.
