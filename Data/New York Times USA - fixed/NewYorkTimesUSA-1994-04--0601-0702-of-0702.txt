HEADLINE: Needed: A Recycling Compromise

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration says it wants to recycle more of New York City's garbage, but cannot afford the cost. The City Council leader and litigants in a lawsuit say sorry, the city pledged to recycle more energetically than it does now and is legally bound to keep its promise. The courts agree and have ordered City Hall to afford what it says it cannot.
That sounds like an impasse, but there is a sensible way out. The City Council approved the recycling plan and it has the legal authority to change the deadlines and rate of compliance. Slower compliance, less cost. The administration will have to make a good case to the Council for amending the law; if its arguments are credible, and they appear to be, the Council will have a clear obligation to revise its law. 
 Unfortunately, Speaker Peter Vallone says he will demand that the city comply with the court order, and is sounding unusually rigid. New Yorkers will have to hope that Mr. Vallone is flexing his political muscle in anticipation of spring budget negotiations with the Mayor's office, and will ultimately show the responsible leadership he's demonstrated many times before.
Absent a compromise extending the deadlines, the city will have to sacrifice other services to underwrite expanded recycling. Recycling is important, but so are programs already suffering from the budgetary knife.
The litigants in the lawsuit, including the National Resources Defense Council, are frustrated because the city has failed to comply with its original 1989 commitment to recycle about 4,250 tons of materials a day by this month -- about 25 percent of its residential garbage. The city now recycles 2,526 tons a day, about 15 percent, at a cost of $111 million a year -- one-sixth of the Sanitation Department's budget.
Today's tonnage is three times what it was in 1992; after a weak start, the city has made important strides. The question is how much further it can go, and at what pace.
Judge Irma Santaella of State Supreme Court has given the city until July 1996 to comply with the law. In a more perfect world it would, and it is clear New York can improve on the 15 percent figure and make recycling a stronger element in the city's garbage disposal system. That system has to include recycling, incineration and reduction in the amount and kinds of refuse that New Yorkers throw out in the first place.
It is equally clear that the city cannot meet the judge's 25 percent target in so short a period without causing great budgetary pain. The Sanitation Department estimates that would cost as much as $139 million more a year -- more than double the present annual cost of recycling. Ambitious plans do not always survive when the economy fails to cooperate. It is the job of wise city officials to be flexible enough to change in response to reality, however unwelcome that reality is.

HEADLINE: New Tenants Around Times Square;
Vacancies Drop as Businesses Find Space to Fit Their Needs

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
When Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn packed up its Park Avenue headquarters for a move to Times Square nearly four years ago, some of the law firm's employees faced the move with trepidation befitting a covered wagon trip across the Great Plains.
"We thought of Times Square as the wild, wild west, all right," said Robert J. Kafin, chief operating partner in the firm. "We were something of pioneers back then, and there was some resistance at the time." 
 But while still colorful -- and intimidating -- with the ever-present street hustlers, sex shops and pulsating neon signs, Times Square is becoming much less of a frontier as other blue-chip companies and firms move into the neighborhood.
In recent years companies like Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, RCA Records, the accounting firm Ernst & Young, the law firm Cravath, Swain Moore, and Viacom International have set up shop in the neighborhood.
In a year or so Morgan Stanley, the financial services company, will move into a building it bought on the west side of Broadway between 47th and 48th Streets. Some have bought or leased space in bankrupt office towers that were completed just as the city's economy plunged into recession.
The magnet for most new companies has been bargains on space: rents are at least $10 a square foot less expensive than the $40 per square foot for buildings on the East Side. Many companies have also found that by moving to the Times Square area, they can house all their employees in one location. And most compelling of all, the office buildings built near Times Square over the last decade offer telecommunications capabilities they could only dream of in their old locations; many companies have relocated from buildings built in the 1950's or 1960's where the possibilities for installing advanced computer and telephone systems were limited.
"The financial services industry today has technological requirements that demand certain kinds of space," said William M. Lewis Jr., managing director of Morgan Stanley, whose company will be moving from two locations on the Avenue of the Americas. "One requirement is for large, column-free floors. If you need that, there just are not that many buildings that satisfy the requirement."
 
10,000 New Office Workers
 The company expects to occupy about 900,000 square feet in the building, and it is close to a deal to buy another nearly empty Times Square building, at 750 Seventh Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets.
With Morgan Stanley's move, the neighborhood will gain nearly 10,000 new office workers.
Although retailing in the area is still dominated by souvenir shops, electronics equipment stores and other businesses geared to tourists, in recent years dozens of new table-cloth restaurants and stylish coffee bars have opened in the neighborhood, smoothing some of the district's honky-tonk edges.
Some newcomers say they have found the neighborhood cleaner and safer than they expected. Because the Times Square area straddles two precincts, the Police Department does not keep crime statistics for the neighborhood as a whole. But the Times Square Business Improvement District, a coalition of companies and merchants that provides security and street cleaning services, says its analysis of statistics provided by the Police Department shows a 19 percent decline in street crime. Purse-snatching and pickpocketing dropped by 38 percent, the Business Improvement District's analysis showed.
 
Reviving Times Square
 A district rich with the razzle-dazzle of its theatrical heritage, it is hard to imagine a more unlikely neighborhood for these sleek new office towers than Times Square. But their development was no accident. As part of an effort to revive the area, a joint city and state redevelopment plan for 42d Street was announced in 1981. That plan -- which involves the properties at the intersection of 42d Street and Broadway and Seventh Avenue -- is still on the drawing board.
A companion planning initiative, however, did produce results. In the mid-1980's, in an effort to shift commercial development in midtown from the congested East Side to the West Side, the city offered a temporary incentive that allowed developers to build bigger buildings in the Times Square area.
Many of the developers who rushed to exploit the incentive built as real-estate values and development costs peaked. Some paid top dollar for their sites, construction costs and architectural designs. By the time some new buildings were finished, the faltering economy had substantially weakened the demand for office space. Over all, rents for prime space on the west side of midtown fell from $37 a square foot in 1990 to $31 last year.
 
Bankruptcy Prices
 Three of the most prominent projects in the Times Square area, the office buildings at 1540 and 1585 Broadway and 750 Seventh Avenue, stood empty or nearly so for months while bankers and builders sorted out their finances. The uncertain status of these buildings further hampered efforts to sign leases on the space.
Some companies that were looking for new office space in Manhattan took advantage of bankruptcy prices for these buildings. Bertelsmann A.G., the German media and entertainment company that owns RCA and Arista Records and the Bantam Doubleday Dell publishing companies, for example, paid $119 million for the building at 1540 Broadway between 45th and 46th Streets -- a property on which the builders, industry observers say, lost about $200 million.
Once Bertelsmann bought the 46-story tower, which has about one million square feet of space, it made no sense to continue paying rent at 666 Fifth Avenue, where its Bantam Doubleday Dell publishing divisions were situated. Bertelsmann is still looking for subtenants for part of the space it vacated in the Fifth Avenue building.
 
A Gradual Move by Viacom
 Rather than take space in one gulp as Bertelsmann and Morgan Stanley have done, Viacom has expanded its presence in Times Square in small bites. It signed its first lease in 1990 in the building at 1515 Broadway, a 12-year-old office tower refurbished a few years ago to compete with new buildings. Today Viacom, whose cable television channels include Nickelodeon and MTV, has 25 floors in the building at 45th Street.
"Some of the companies that have gone to Times Square have been able to take advantage of disasters," said Jamie V. Covello, a vice president at Cushman & Wakefield, a leading real-estate brokerage. "Today's market is much stronger. Now tenants going into that area are dealing with higher rents."
Even for those who thrive on the high-voltage atmosphere of Times Square, the move to the district has been an adjustment.
When the steel drum bands in Duffy Square tune up for the Wednesday matinee crowds in line for discounted theater tickets, Joe Galante, president of RCA Records, feels as if his desk is on the square rather than in an office 36 floors above it.
 
'Always Something Going On'
 "I love it here," said Mr. Galante, speaking from his office with the color-splashed neon supersigns just outside his window. "But there is always something going on in Times Square; parades, demonstrations, promotions. It's great, but sometimes I wish that I could turn it off."
Marsha Pront, director of library services for Proskauer Rose, said many of the people in the firm who were at first reluctant to leave Park Avenue have discovered unexpected advantages in Times Square's nearly nonstop bustle.
"I know some of us miss certain things about being on Park Avenue," Mrs. Pront said. "People who take trains from Grand Central have a longer commute. I miss being close enough to my beauty shop to get my hair cut on my lunch hour. But nobody misses our old buildings."
Mrs. Pront said Park Avenue was quiet, but its wide sidewalks were nearly deserted after business hours.
"People here work late," Mrs. Pront said, referring to her fellow employees. "There are people on the street until late at night, and you can almost always get a cab as soon as you leave the building."
Despite the changes, the area still has its troubled corridors; most noticeable is the western section of 42d Street near Eighth Avenue. According to the Business Improvement District, a steady decline in the number of pornography shops there was reversed with the opening of four new sex-oriented businesses in the last 18 months.
But Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, said that improvements should be apparent soon.
"We have the money from the city to finish the condemnation process," she said. "Our next targets are the theaters and other properties on the western half of 42d Street."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
With Regular Season Done, Knicks Think Championship

BYLINE: By CLIFTON BROWN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 24

 BODY:
In their final tune-up before the playoffs, the Knicks had an impressive road test.
 New York closed the regular season by handling the Chicago Bulls, 92-76, this afternoon at Chicago Stadium. The Knicks finished the regular season with a 57-25 record, but the most important season comes later this week, when the National Basketball Association playoffs begin. And the Knicks' first-round opponent will be the Nets. 
Anything less than a championship will be considered a disappointment by the Knicks. So while today's game had no bearing on the playoffs, the Knicks came ready to play. Patrick Ewing, the Knicks' co-captain and emotional leader, made a pre-game address to the team in the locker room. As far as Ewing was concerned, the Knicks' playoff preparation began today. And they played like it, beating the team that has won the last three N.B.A. titles and looms as a possible second-round opponent for New York.
 The Knicks and Nets will square off in a three-of-five-game series that will begin Friday at 7 P.M. at Madison Square Garden. It will be a major test for the Knicks, who were beaten four out of five times by the Nets during the regular season. But the Knicks feel they can beat anyone. And soon, they will get a chance to prove it.
 "I don't care who we play," said Ewing, who led the Knicks with 25 points. "It's a new season. We'll do all our talking on the court.
 "It's time to get in a playoff state of mind, starting today, and take it for two months. It's money time now. The regular season is all a warmup, a warmup for this. I'm very confident. I think this is definitely our chance. We had a chance last year and let it slip away. But I think we have a very good chance this year."
 The Knicks have some major decisions to make, because all playoff rosters must be submitted to the league on Monday.
 The first decision involves Anthony Mason, New York's versatile sixth-man forward, who has been serving an indefinite suspension for "conduct detrimental to the team" since Tuesday. An announcement regarding Mason's status will be made Monday, and while he is expected to be reinstated, neither Pat Riley nor Dave Checketts, the Knicks' president, have guaranteed that Mason will be back for the playoff opener.
 
Knicks Need Mason
 However, Mason has at least two things in his favor. The Knicks need him. And his teammates want him.
 "We're going to need everybody -- Mase, everybody," said Ewing.
 "We need all the people we can get," said Derek Harper, the Knick point guard. "Mase does a great job against small forwards. He can play the game."
 The Knicks will have John Starks back for the playoffs. Starks will return to practice Monday, but how effective he will be remains to be seen. Starks underwent arthroscopic knee surgery to repair torn cartilage on March 14, forcing Starks to miss the final 23 games of the season.
 
Starks Is Rushing Back
 Starks admitted that he was rushing himself back.
 "I won't know until I get down to Charleston and see how it feels," Starks said. "You always want to rest an injury like that, but the playoffs aren't next week. They're this week. So, I just have to go for it."
 Riley said he was not counting on Starks, an All-Star, to perform like himself during the first round.
 "We want to see him against live competition this week," Riley said of Starks. "His conditioning and fatigue right now are really bad. I think this week will be a good measuring stick as to how much he can help us early, if he can at all."
 A decision must also be made Monday whether or not to activate Doc Rivers for the playoffs. The point guard has been out since December after undergoing reconstructive knee surgery. Even if Rivers is activated, he would be be ready to play until late May at the earliest. Since only 12 players can be placed on the playoff roster, the Knicks may not be able to afford the luxury of activating him.
 
'Major Decisions'
 "We've got to make three or four major decisions tomorrow," Riley said. "We've got some guys that are hurt. Doc, I don't think, could be ready until the finals."
 The Knicks should also be concerned about the prospect of facing the Nets, a dangerous team. With no dominant team in the league this season, the possibility of first-round upsets exists. And Riley does not want the Knicks to be one of the early playoff casualties.
 "The first round of the playoffs is a tough series for anybody," Riley said. "You can play great and lose a tough game and your back's against the wall. We have to be right our first two home games, regardless of who it is.
 "I think we're going in on a high note. I think it's going to be one of the great playoff series ever. I don't think there's a team in the Eastern Conference that doesn't think they can't beat somebody else."
 The Knicks said their 1-4 record against the Nets this season would be irrelevant during the playoffs.
 
Playoff Series Is 0-0
 "They can say anything they want," said guard Greg Anthony. "Talk doesn't win anything for you. As far as we're concerned, it's 0-0. We'll see when the series is over who's talking"
 Said Starks, "There's no doubt in my mind that we're going to play real strong and move on to the second round."
 But there is no doubt that more pressure will be on the Knicks than the Nets. But the Knicks believe they can handle it.
 "What's pressure?" Ewing said. "Pressure is being unemployed and trying to feed five kids. This is ain't pressure. This is fun."
 
REBOUNDS
The Knicks and Nets have met once before in the playoffs, in 1983. The Knicks won a first-round, two-out-of-three series in two games. . . . CHARLES GRANTHAM, director of the Players Association, said that he would speak to DAVE CHEKETTS, the Knicks' president, about ANTHONY MASON's suspension. "How can you suspend someone indefinitely?" Grantham said.

HEADLINE: After a Ruling, Hawaii Weighs Gay Marriages

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, April 23

 BODY:
This island state, where multiculturalism is a way of life and not just a slogan, could become the first to legalize marriage between people of the same sex -- or at least offer marital benefits for gay couples who register as domestic partners.
Whether by sanctioning gay marriage, which no other nation has done, or by passing America's first statewide domestic partnership act, Hawaii would lead the way in this fundamental redefinition of family, which some see as a sweeping expansion of civil rights and others see as an erosion of traditional values. 
 To stand on the far shore of change is a fitting role for this state, which is known for a progressive public policy, a liberal state constitution, a tolerance for diversity, an acceptance of intermarriage and a culture of flourishing same-sex relationships.
"Because the culture here is so intermixed, we are used to living together and letting people be whatever they want to be," said Hoku Akiu, a security guard, who hopes to marry his partner, Dwight Ovitt, and has already celebrated their union in a church full of sympathetic relatives and friends.
The stage was set for this far-reaching social change when the State Supreme Court ruled last May that refusing to license the marriage of three gay couples, thus depriving them of financial and legal benefits, violated the due process clause of the Hawaii Constitution. The State Constitution is more elaborate than its Federal counterpart and explicitly prohibits sex discrimination.
The Supreme Court sent the case back to the trial court to determine whether preserving the marriage ban was "a compelling state interest," the highest level of judicial scrutiny and one that legal experts say is rarely met unless public safety is at stake. The trial court is to hear the case next year.
 
Lawmakers Get Busy
 Stunned by the court's landmark ruling and pressured by conservative constituents, lawmakers here aimed in their current session to clarify the state's marriage statute, either as a way of persuading the courts to defer to the Legislature or as a way of giving extra ammunition to the Attorney General, who must defend the ban.
Hawaii's legislators considered, on the one hand, a constitutional amendment that would limit marriage to heterosexuals and, on the other, a broad domestic partnership act. Instead, loath to offend anyone in a year when they are up for re-election, the lawmakers have agreed on a bill reiterating that marriage is meant for "one man and one woman" and creating a commission to propose remedies for the inequities faced by same-sex couples, who are ineligible for tax breaks, Social Security benefits, rights of inheritance and cheaper hunting licenses, to name but a few of the privileges that fall to married couples.
The Attorney General, Robert A. Marks, had been clutching at straws as he sought ways to prove compelling state interest. But the clarifying language from the Legislature might persuade the court that limiting marriage to heterosexual couples is merely a benign form of discrimination. And the creation of the commission, the Attorney General said, might persuade the court that the state is truly committed to wider rights for gay couples.
 
'How Much, How Soon'
 A result of this judicial and legislative jockeying, virtually everyone agrees, will be either legalization of gay marriage by the court or a broad domestic partnership act after the commission completes its work, and perhaps both. "That was something people thought was unattainable before May 5," said Daniel R. Foley, the lawyer for the three gay couples, citing the date of the Supreme Court's 3-to-2 decision. "And now the only question is how much, how soon."
Joseph Mellio, a 46-year-old chef, and Patrick Lagon, a 36-year-old graphic artist, hope to be the first to the altar if they win the case that they began more than three years ago, along with two lesbian couples here.
Both men were raised in Roman Catholic families, Mr. Mellio in Summit, N.J., and Mr. Lagon in a Filipino enclave here, and they speak proudly of their "simple" life together: a yard full of dogs, a tropical flower garden, quiet nights in front of the TV, weekend drives and family gatherings.
"Why does anybody want to get married?" Mr. Mellio asked. "You answer for me. Our reasons aren't different. Our agendas aren't different. You meet someone. You fall in love. You get married and live happily ever after. That's all we want."
 
Raising Concerns
 Legal experts say that the court here is likely to lift the ban on same-sex marriage, given the bold rationale of its preliminary ruling and the changes in its composition since then.
And that likelihood has raised concern among local officials about the impact on tourism, among fundamentalists about the radical redefinition of family and among gay rights advocates about whether marriage is an unalienable right or an inequitable institution. Constitutional scholars are unsure whether other states will recognize gay marriages in Hawaii.
The reciprocity issue, they say, is sure to land in the United States Supreme Court, which heard an analogous case in 1967 in Loving v. Virginia and upheld the marriage of an interracial couple wed in the District of Columbia and jailed upon their return to a state that still had a miscegenation law.
In general, states recognize one another's legal acts, including marriage, under the full faith and credit provision of the United States Constitution. The only exception is when one state claims a violation of local public policy, which is expected to be the explanation for not recognizing gay marriage in the 23 states where sodomy remains a criminal act.
 
Tourism and Hand-Wringing
 The tourism question has led to much hand-wringing. Tourism, is the state's No. 1 industry, generating $9 billion a year and accounting for one-third of Hawaii's gross state product and 4 of 10 of its civilian jobs. Amid recession in California and Japan, where most of the visitors originate, tourism has declined in recent years, fueling concern that a flood of gay couples might scare off family-minded tourists and traditional honeymooners.
A few economists predict that an influx of gay tourists would more than make up for any lost business, but they concede that their calculations will be affected by the success of conservative groups that plan boycotts if gay marriage goes forward.
"This is part of the pan-sexual movement's attempt to deconstruct traditional morality in the culture and we take it very seriously," said Robert H. Knight, director of cultural studies at the Family Research Council in Washington.
While legalizing same-sex marriage is seen by groups like the Family Research Council and the Roman Catholic Church as a radical move, gay rights advocates consider it the most conservative item on their agenda and disagree about whether it is a worthy goal. On one side are the assimilationists, who consider marriage a way of gaining benefits and respect. On the other side are the separatists, who say state-sanctioned monogamous unions are an affront to their movement and a means of taming an alternative life style.
That debate was given full voice for the first time in 1989, the year that Denmark recognized gay partnerships, conferring on them all the economic rights of marriage but not the right to adopt children. That was also the year San Francisco and West Hollywood (and later about 150 municipalities, New York among them) passed far more limited laws giving medical and other benefits to the gay partners of city employees.
 
Kentucky and Minnesota
 The debate, framed by two gay rights lawyers, Thomas B. Stoddard and Paula L. Ettelbrick, did not envision the legalization of gay marriage anytime soon. In fact, the last significant challenges to the ban on same-sex marriage came 15 years before, when courts in Kentucky, Minnesota and Washington State upheld the status quo by asserting that marriage was by definition the collaboration of a man and a woman, which Hawaii last year labeled as "circular and unpersuasive" reasoning.
As Mr. Stoddard sees it, just months after his own ceremony with Walter Rieman, the issue remains "equal access to an institution of great practical and emotional importance to most Americans."
For Ms. Ettelbrick, by contrast, "the true access question is whether marriage is the appropriate vehicle" for determining economic rights and privileges. "I'd rather spend our resources developing a broader view of family and not replicating heterosexist institutions," she said.
 
Staking Out Differences
 But on these fragrant islands, so far from the mainland in both distance and attitude, the crossfire between Mr. Stoddard and Mr. Ettelbrick seems an unnecessary argument, a way of staking out differences. And that is not the way things are done here, where the local style is live and let live, interracial marriage is ho-hum and homosexuality is barely remarked upon.
"The host culture has no problem with mahu's or moe-aikane, because almost every family has them," said Annelle C. Amarel, a state representative, using the Hawaiian words for men who dress as women and men who have sex with other men.
That was certainly Mr. Akiu's experience growing up gay in a family that has been here for generations, mingling its Hawaiian, Chinese, Filipino and Portuguese ancestry and practicing myriad Eastern and Western religions. His "wedding" party included his mother, uncle, cousins, brothers and his partner's children from a former heterosexual marriage. But nobody stood around congratulating themselves for their diversity.
"It's a Western view that if you're different you have to talk about it," Mr. Akiu said. "People here just quietly learn and adapt and adjust."

HEADLINE: AS PREMIER TAKES OFFICE IN JAPAN, COALITION CRACKS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, April 26

 BODY:
Tsutomu Hata took office on Monday as Japan's 51st Prime Minister, but his fractious governing coalition disintegrated this morning as the largest party in the group bolted and left Mr. Hata heading Japan's first minority Government in four decades.
The decision by the Socialist Party to back out of the coalition stripped Mr. Hata of his narrow majority in Parliament and cast into grave doubt his ability to enact a series of steps sought by the United States. 
 These measures include an economic stimulus program, deregulation of the economy, steps to open Japanese markets to imports and a solid stand in the effort to force North Korea to accept nuclear inspections.
The Socialist Party's move came after its members discovered what they called a plot by the rest of the coalition to freeze them out of the new Government.
Only last Friday, the Socialists joined with other members of the coalition, which has governed since last summer, to designate Mr. Hata as the successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned over a financial scandal.
Their action plunges Mr. Hata's Government into a crisis before he has had time to choose his Cabinet or even move into the Prime Minister's residence. Without the Socialists, he commands only 182 votes in the lower house of Parliament, well short of the 256 he needs to pass legislation.
For his Government to survive, he essentially faces three choices. He can try to set off another political earthquake that would allow him to pull in 70 or more defectors from the defeated Liberal Democratic Party, which has 206 members. He can call new elections. Or he can try to lure the Socialists back.
The first option seems the most likely. The Liberal Democrats ran the country for 38 years until they were ousted last summer in a revolt Mr. Hata helped lead, and have been disintegrating ever since.
The eruption on Monday night, just hours after Parliament officially declared the 58-year-old Mr. Hata the Prime Minister, was prompted by an effort among five ideologically like-minded parties to form a parliamentary bloc of 180 or so members that would give the coalition a greater semblance of unity.
The Socialists, who have been battling for months with the conservative architect of Japan's coalition strategy, Ichiro Ozawa, were excluded from the bloc. They saw the move -- correctly, most analysts say -- as a major step toward ousting them as Mr. Ozawa and Mr. Hata try to form a second conservative party to rival the Liberal Democrats.
 
'We Are Pulling Out'
 "It is a betrayal," Tomiichi Mura yama, the chief of the Socialist Party, declared at a news conference at 1:30 this morning. "There is no room for further talk. We are pulling out of all forums of the ruling coalition."
Mr. Hata, appearing in front of television cameras in a hallway of the Prime Minister's office a little after 3 A.M., said, "I did not know that the parliamentary bloc would be formed yesterday." This was seen as a remarkable statement, because the party he heads with Mr. Ozawa, the Japan Renewal Party, is at the core of the new group.
He said the Socialists' decision "was quite regrettable" and had resulted from "a misunderstanding." He said he hoped to talk to the Socialists later today.
But the damage was clearly done. In the last several months, the Socialists have been at odds with the rest of the coalition on matters as petty as old grudges and as grand as major policy differences -- chiefly on the question of raising sales taxes and taking a hard line on North Korea.
Historically, the Socialists have opposed any increase in taxes aimed at ordinary Japanese shoppers, and they have long had ties with the North Korean Government.
Several times since a coalition Government was formed last summer under former Prime Minister Hosokawa, who formally stepped down on Monday, the Socialists have threatened to walk out and bring the coalition to the brink of collapse. But at the last minute a deal was always worked to keep them in.
 
Socialists Feel Betrayed
 This time, though, the Socialists felt double-crossed. They had just spent two weeks drawing up a policy accord with the other members of the coalition, and then agreed to back Mr. Hata in an effort to end the infighting that crippled Mr. Hosokawa's Government.
To many members of the Socialist Party, a split like this was inevitable.
The political revolution under way in Japan has been tearing down the cold war structure that ran the country since 1955. Under this arrangement, the conservative Liberal Democratic Party ruled and the Socialists formed a perpetual opposition.
Now that structure is being smashed apart. The Liberal Democrats have already lost more than a third of their members as prominent members -- including Mr. Hata and Mr. Ozawa -- defected to form the coalition.
More Liberal Democrats have fallen away since, and Mr. Ozawa's clear aim is to smash apart the remainder, drawing in younger members and leaving the party's elders at sea, with little choice but retirement.
He is likely to step up that effort now, in an attempt to secure a new majority for Mr. Hata.

HEADLINE: THE SOUTH AFRICAN VOTE: ZULUS;
A Greatly Feared Zulu Watches Over the Political Machine

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LINDELANI, South Africa, April 23

 BODY:
A week ago, Thomas Mandla Shabalala proudly counted himself among the two or three most feared men in South Africa. He may still be, but he has also become something else: the Inkatha Freedom Party's most formidable vote getter.
The self-proclaimed mayor of this sprawling squatter township on the hilly outskirts of Durban, Mr. Shabalala is perhaps the most visible of Inkatha's urban bosses. He is regularly reviled (misrepresented, he says) by the South African press for controlling his fief with what critics say is a mix of terror and patronage. 
 He is also one of party's most magnetic leaders, capable of mobilizing thousands of club-wielding, spear-carrying Amabutho, or Zulu warriors, into street battle with political rivals, mainly young African National Congress loyalists. And if Inkatha had gone to war, as many South Africans speculated it was preparing to do, Mr. Shabalala would almost certainly have taken a prime spot on the front lines.
All that changed after Inkatha abruptly ended its boycott of the elections, leaving the party scant time to embrace the razzmatazz of an American-style campaign. For Mr. Shabalala, Inkatha's change of mind transformed him virtually overnight from warlord to ward boss.
 
'One of Our Best Assets'
 Not only here in Lindelani, but also in much of the Natal midlands, Mr. Shabalala's success in pursuing votes for Inkatha is highly regarded, especially among the poor, often unemployed and mostly illiterate Zulus who form the bedrock of the party's support. Chief Mangosuthu G. Buthelezi is, of course, the better known politician, but at the grass roots, by some accounts, Mr. Shabalala has a greater following.
"Thomas Shabalala has been demonized, but most of what is said about him is simply not true," said Ziba Jiyane, the organization's chief spokesman. "He is absolutely one of our best assets."
In other words, said a political analyst, "while Buthelezi takes all the limelight, Shabalala is the guy who will make sure that Inkatha's supporters actually get to the polls.'
"And you can be sure," he said, "that he'll know who does and doesn't vote, and those that don't will have to face the consequences."
For his part, Mr. Shabalala appears bemused by his reputation as a roughneck. "Because I'm Inkatha, I'm called a warlord," he said. "But if I were A.N.C., I'd be called a hero."
In the coming days, Mr. Shabalala's various talents will be sorely tested. Opinion polls and conversations with politicians here suggest that Inkatha should consider itself fortunate if it wins a majority of the votes even in nationalistic Zulu strongholds like Lindelani. The party's prospects will almost certainly be even worse nationwide, where by nearly all accounts, they will be routed by the African National Congress and the National Party.
 
'A Lot of Work To Do'
 "Many of our people don't even know where to put the 'X' on their ballot sheets," Mr. Shabalala said outside his modest compound. "They don't know anything about voting. We've got a lot of work to do, and not nearly enough time."
He himself was, among other things, an amateur heavyweight boxing champion and a bus driver, two occupations that served him well in later life. Boxing helped cement his already fearsome reputation as a street fighter, while driving a bus, and later as the owner of a fleet of taxis, gave him an intimate knowledge of the territory as well as a firm grounding in the peculiar economics of running a business under the apartheid system.
It was his fleet ownership, in particular, that propelled his future career. "Shabalala was simply the most ruthless man in town," said a lawyer who has long experience in working in the townships. "He thought nothing of knocking a chap in the head if he felt like it, and he often felt like it."
Those days are far behind, Mr. Shabalala insists. And in a display of his new role as campaigner for peace and fraternity, Mr. Shabalala was dressed in a brand-new T-shirt with two doves, one white the other blue, which have become a symbol of what most South Africans hope will be a relatively tranquil transition, despite recent pre-election violence.
So far, amid much vague oratory, Inkatha's single unmistakable thesis is that the African National Congress is run by Communists who are bent on turning South Africa into a centralized, totalitarian state.
The rest of the party line appears to depend on the audience: it can include anti-ethnic innuendo against the Xhosa tribe, especially Nelson Mandela. The Xhosas were defeated by Zulu regiments in 19th-century battles and they are still scorned by some Zulu traditionalists. To wealthy white businessmen who have bankrolled Inkatha in the past, party officials spout the gospel of the free-enterprise system.
Mr. Shabalala's politics are a bit more complicated. For one thing, despite his reputation as a wrangler, he strongly defends what he calls traditional Zulu values, like discipline and obedience to one's elders. One reason he says he cannot abide the A.N.C. is that he "can't support a party run by children."
Until now, Mr. Shabalala was best known in Natal for his reputation for violence. He has been formally charged with two murders and implicated in numerous other assaults, but never convicted.
But Mr. Shabalala's stature depends on more than just being a street fighter. He is also in many ways the quintessential ward boss. In Lindelani, he controls the allocation of nearly all community services -- from setting up health clinics and schools, to distributing pensions, to police and fire protection. He also owns and operates the biggest taxi service here, giving him a crucial role in transporting voters to and from polling booths on election day.
 
'I Have No Fears'
 Even if, as nearly everyone assumes, the African National Congress wins the election, it will hardly be the end of Mr. Shabalala's political career. For one thing, it is unclear what will happen to his political machine, particularly his exclusive channels of patronage.
In theory, the A.N.C. will be able to replace Mr. Shabalala in Lindelani with an official of its own choosing, or perhaps call elections to allow the people of KwaZulu, the Zula homeland, to decide freely for the first time who their leaders will be.
But political analysts say it is far from certain whether the congress will have the political clout to remove Mr. Shabalala, and, for his part, he is certain that he will not be leaving anytime soon.
"I have no fears," he said. "I believe that the KwaZulu government will be here forever."

HEADLINE: U.S. Accepts Jordan Plea On Iraq Trade

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 25

 BODY:
The United States removed a major stumbling block today to Jordan's full participation in Middle East peace talks by agreeing to adopt new procedures for enforcing the trade embargo against Iraq that are far less onerous to Jordan.
After meeting with King Hussein in a London suburb, Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced that the United States had accepted Jordan's request for land-based inspections of cargo, rather than sea-based inspections, which Jordan said were hurting its economy. 
 In recent weeks, King Hussein has vaguely threatened not to rejoin the talks with Israel unless the inspection procedures were changed. He asserted that under the inspections, about 460 vessels had been turned back before reaching Jordan's major port of Aqaba, mainly because the ships' paperwork did not detail their cargo's ultimate destination.
Jordanian officials, whose country was once a major trading partner with Iraq, complained that those inspections have done $300 million in damage to their economy.
 
King Is Satisfied
 "The enforcement of the sanctions against Iraq is highly important," Mr. Christopher said at a news conference with King Hussein. "But this was having a very adverse effect on Jordan's economy."
King Hussein said he was satisfied with the new inspection procedures, under which professional trade experts from Lloyd's Register will look for prohibited cargo in warehouses at Aqaba. The embargo bars all trade with Iraq except food and medicine.
The King sounded eager to return to the peace talks, but said he was awaiting the end of Mr. Christopher's one-week swing through the Middle East to see exactly when Syria, Lebanon and his country would resume talks with Israel in Washington.
Mr. Christopher said the new inspection procedures would not undermine the embargo's effectiveness.
"We believe in some respects land-based inspection will be an improvement in our ability to enforce sanctions against Iraq," Mr. Christopher said, after lunch at King Hussein's heavily guarded 73-acre country estate west of London. The King is in London for medical treatment.
A senior American official traveling with Mr. Christopher said inspecting cargo in warehouses would be easier and more comprehensive than stopping ships and rummaging around their holds on the high seas.
Administration officials said the land-based inspections would cost about $2 million to $3 million a year and would be paid by Jordan.

HEADLINE: Giuliani and Whitman Stress Mutual Understanding in Broadcast

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
There were promises of mutual support and understanding during a television appearance last night shared by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman as the two Republican newcomers to office set out to ease the tensions over crime and business competition between New York City and New Jersey.
Conscious of the often fractious past relations between the cross-Hudson neighbors, Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Giuliani took pains to support each other's views. 
 They agreed on a need to improve coordination of cross-border crime fighting, particularly in identifying and arresting drug buyers who shuttle between the states. They said they would focus their business-building efforts on attracting investment to the region from other states and countries, not from each other's tax rolls. The Governor and the Mayor also took a hard line against the Nation of Islam and its minister, Louis Farrakhan, while calling for more programs to educate children in the ways of tolerance.
 
A Regional Economy
 "I think we both understand that this is a region, and that this is a regional economy that we're trying to establish here," Mayor Giuliani said. "If New York City continues to lose jobs, it will hurt New Jersey, and if New Jersey were to lose jobs, it would hurt New York. We're in this together."
Mayor Giuliani and Governor Whitman made their appearance at a town meeting televised live on WNET Channel 13. A studio audience posed questions on crime, the regional economy, taxes and race relations.
Both officials supported the belief that lower taxes will promote a stronger economy and favored laws against bias crime and called for nationwide handgun registration.
But on race relations the two drew sharp lines against any meetings with Mr. Farrakhan. When a member of the Nation of Islam asked the two elected officials if they favored giving school children a grounding in black history, and suggested that they meet Mr. Farrakhan, the Mayor recalled the still unsolved beatings of eight New York City police officers at a Harlem mosque during his first weeks in office.
"I would certainly be willing to make certain that every child in New York City got a balanced view, but I wouldn't sit down with someone representing Louis Farrakhan, and certainly not with someone who ran a mosque that has yet to turn in the people who beat up eight police officers."
Mrs. Whitman said, "I would be very interested in sitting down with responsible representatives of the Muslim faith, but I would have no interest in sitting down with him."

HEADLINE: A Russian Reformer Is Down but Not Out

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 25

 BODY:
Boris G. Fyodorov, who warned when he resigned as Russia's Finance Minister in January that anti-reform politicians and industrial leaders were plotting an "economic coup," may be biding his time, but he's not biting his tongue.
If anything, Mr. Fyodorov has become more vociferous since retiring -- temporarily, as he sees it -- to a position in the Soviet Parliament. Appearing here on Friday at a conference sponsored by the University of Chicago on the role of central banks in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, Mr. Fyodorov assailed the International Monetary Fund for its recent approval of a $1.5 billion loan to the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. 
 Mr. Fyodorov said the loan sent a destructive message -- that the West approved of the Government's abandonment of the push for changes that he and other economic reformers had championed. He accused Russia's central bank of acting like "a licensed industrial and agricultural lobbyist," concerned primarily with propping up enterprises that were remnants of the centralized economy. And he criticized a recent proposal to link the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus as a "dangerous experiment" rather than a useful step toward economic integration.
 "If we don't change our policies, external help won't make any difference," Mr. Fyodorov said in an interview after his presentation.
He said that the I.M.F. loan reflected misguided political pressure on the I.M.F. from the United States and other members of the Group of Seven major industrial nations. Supporters of the loan say that it will help Russia avoid social unrest that could sink any reforms. But Mr. Fyodorov said the loan was too small to have a real impact and it would never have been approved had the I.M.F. followed the views of its own technical staff as to whether Russia was living up to its promises of economic change.
 
Economic Experience
 Such strong assertions would not surprise anyone who has followed Mr. Fyodorov career. A former Communist whose early assignments included posts at the central bank of the old Soviet Union and in the banking supervision department of the Communist Party Central Committee, Mr. Fyodorov, who is now 36, emerged as an outspoken monetarist and one of the most radical of the economic reformers under Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He has never been known for self-doubt, understatement or a charitable view of opponents.
 "I was arrogant and rude," he said unflinchingly about his tenure as Finance Minister. "I took power from other people because I wasn't afraid to lose my job," he added, citing instances of refusing to spend money the Government had pledged to various programs because he felt that the promises violated the integrity of the budget and contributed to inflation.
Eventually, though, Mr. Fyodorov felt stymied by the power of Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha, an old-line collective-farm boss, and Viktor Gerashchenko, head of Russia's central bank. He turned down an offer to continue as Finance Minister in the new Cabinet formed after the December election when Mr. Chernomyrdin refused his demand to dismiss the hard-liners.
"We must have the healthiest economy in the world because we only had eight bankruptcies in the whole country last year," he said, sarcastically describing his inability to force the Government to pull the plug on failed former Soviet enterprises.
Mr. Fyodorov's main platform these days is as chairman of the Russian Parliament's subcommittee on monetary and central bank affairs. One of his biggest mistakes as Finance Minister, he said, was not working harder on tax reform. Russia has an enormous range of taxes without apparent regard to what behavior they are supposed to encourage, he said, citing such anti-development examples as a sales tax on loans. He now believes that the monetary reforms he advocates cannot achieve as much as he once hoped without more coherent industrial and agricultural policies.
Mr. Fyodorov said he did not expect vigorous reformers to stay on the sidelines. He dismissed Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the extreme nationalist who gained international attention after his party's strong performance in December's elections, as "a marginal figure for Western consumption who is already losing support." The much better organized Communists, he said, remained the true threat to progress.
"We will return to the Government," he said confidently. "If not me, then someone with my views."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against Mark As Rate-Cut Pressure Ebbs

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell to a three-week low against the mark yesterday after forecasts that Germany's economy was recovering, easing pressure on the Bundesbank to cut interest rates.
"The market's focus this week is going to be German monetary policy," said Lisa Finstrom, currency analyst at Smith Barney Shearson. "People think the Bundesbank isn't going to cut rates very quickly." 
 The dollar was quoted late yesterday at 1.6799 marks, down from 1.6892 marks in New York on Friday. It fell to 1.6782 marks earlier in the day, its lowest level since April 1.
Traders bought marks after Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, and other central bank officers said a faster pace of rate cuts was not warranted. Lower German interest rates would make investments denominated in marks less attractive.
The Bundesbank holds a meeting on monetary policy on Thursday. The central bank cut rates at its last meeting, lowering the discount rate a quarter-point, to 5 percent, and the Lombard rate to 6.5 from 6.75 percent. The discount rate is the lowest rate banks pay to borrow from the Bundesbank, while the Lombard is an emergency borrowing rate.
The dollar was little changed against the yen, meanwhile, after the Socialist Party of Japan quit the Government's fragile coalition.
Unlike other currencies, the yen typically is not hurt by a political crisis. Indeed, turmoil often strengthens the yen as it increases speculation that progress toward trade negotiations between the United States and Japan will be delayed as a result.
The dollar was quoted at 103.09 yen late yesterday, down from 103.30 yen on Friday.
Many currency traders expect the United States to endorse a stronger yen to press Japan on trade. A strong yen makes Japanese exports more expensive. The yen has risen 20 percent since February 1993.
"The pressure is still on the yen" after the latest round of political wrangling, said Steve Flanagan, a trader at Paine Webber.
In other trading in New York, the British pound rose to $1.4920, from $1.4886 on Friday. The dollar fell to 5.7650 French francs from 5.7941 francs. It was steady at 1.4345 Swiss francs. The dollar fell to 1,609 Italian lire from 1,619 lire. The Canadian dollar rose to 72.57 United States cents, from 72.56 cents on Friday.

HEADLINE: Transit Revolution Coming. Bring a Fare Card.;
Electronic Turnstiles Promise Vast Changes in Pricing, Planners Say

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
For 40 years, the most complicated decision about transit fares has been how much to charge for a token. This week, as Herald Square becomes the last of New York's 69 busiest subway stations to receive electronic turnstiles, the transit system is on the threshold of a brave new world of pricing possibilities that some say could transform the role of mass transit in the city's economy.
But nobody is sure just how, and the Metrocard electronic-fare system is for now a shiny $700 million tool that no one has decided how to use. 
 This summer the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to begin choosing among a variety of options, from monthly passes to off-peak discounts, that it hopes will increase mass-transit ridership by tens of millions of people a year.
"This is not merely an electronic token," said Tito Davila, an M.T.A. spokesman. "This is a product that will help us to offer the discounts that will attract additional riders and make the system more convenient."
But transit planners say discounts will not produce enough new riders to make up for the revenue lost in reduced token sales, an amount that could reach $250 million a year. They say a multidimensional political fight in Albany is likely over the subsidies needed to make up for that revenue.
Suburban and rural interests will almost certainly oppose higher taxes to subsidize the discounts. Occasional users will oppose paying more for tokens to subsidize the monthly passes of daily commuters. If the M.T.A. offers free or almost-free transfers between the buses and the subways, people who buy monthly tickets on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro North will want the same. The fight could make past battles over a 10-cent increase in the price of a token seem like a high-school debate.
At least there will be no battle over charging by the mile; the new system controls only entry, not exit, so it cannot price the ride by distance, as Washington and other cities do.
But with the computerized fare card system, the Transit Authority could, for instance, offer monthly passes, at a price equal to 90 trips, or 50, or maybe just 38. Transfers from bus to subway could be discounted 25 percent, or even be free. Fares could be adjusted for the time of day.
To justify the sacrifices that taxpayers or less-frequent riders would have to make, planners are venturing into the uncharted territory of trying to determine the how the city would benefit financially from increased use of mass transit.
Rudimentary research has been done on the benefits of getting drivers out of their cars and into public transportation, reducing congestion and air pollution. But there is hardly any research on another development that could be more important: getting people who might otherwise have stayed home to make trips around the city, trips on which they are sure to spend money that will stimulate the economy.
Proving that may be essential to convincing the public and lawmakers that increased subsidies are justified.
"They're going to give away revenue, which is going to have to be made up somehow," said Bernard Cohen, the chief financial officer of the M.T.A., the parent body of the New York City Transit Authority and of the suburban railroads.
Experts agree that the options could have a big impact on traffic in the streets and on the economic life of the city. William M. Wheeler, director of planning at the M.T.A., is now trying to figure out how. But he is finding no studies of other cities to guide him. Other cities, he said, do not need such analyses because they are usually making only minor changes, having instituted pass systems years ago.
The system is entering a new age at a time when New York is under severe pressure to reduce auto use. Under the Clean Air Act, the State Department of Transportation imposed rules on April 6 under which big employers must take steps to lure their workers out of single-passenger automobiles.
And even without air-pollution problems, dense traffic causes congestion that raises the cost of doing business in the city and, though it is hard to quantify, lowers the quality of life.
Counting those costs and others, like accidents, law enforcement and land use for highways, the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a coalition of environmental groups and the Regional Plan Association, recently calculated that vehicle use costs the public 25 cents a mile.
But there are other ways of looking at the economic benefits. If, say, free transfers and monthly passes lured 10,000 cars off the Gowanus Expressway every day, that would be good not only for the drivers of those cars, but also for the drivers who still use the Gowanus. And, by reducing road congestion and thus speeding up the delivery of goods and services, such a move would benefit the economy as a whole.
 
A Battle Over Subsidies
 If a monthly pass or free transfers created a benefit by getting people out of their cars, it would not flow to the M.T.A., but to the public as a whole, leaving the M.T.A. to argue in Albany that tax revenues should finance the investment.
That makes the lack of a way to estimate benefits a problem, said Gene Russianoff of the Straphangers Campaign, a transit riders' advocacy group, "because they're going to need extra subsidies to do what they want, and they're going to have to make a case, and they're going to need to say something."
Mr. Russianoff is hoping that the idea of providing free transfers for people who must take both a subway and a bus between home and work will prove so politically attractive that it will sweep Albany. One such part of the city, he noted, is the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which is represented by the Speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver.
On the other side will be all the forces that usually oppose bigger subsidies for mass transit, people who don't want higher taxes, especially taxes that would be paid by suburbanites and others who make little use of the transit system.
Norman J. Levy, the chairman of the State Senate's transportation committee, said that the system had "exciting potential," but he added that his top priority was to avoid increasing the fare for anyone. That limits the resources available to offer new options like monthly passes.
Those options could eventually make a big difference for individuals, especially after conversion of the fare boxes in the buses, which starts next year. If it is followed by free transfers from subway to bus and back, using the Metrocard could cut in half the cost of traveling between Midtown or Wall Street and neighborhoods where the subway is beyond walking distance, like College Point in Queens or Riverdale in the Bronx.
Monthly passes would make many trips free, with customers buying a monthly pass to get to and from work, and then realizing that an extra trip to a store, a restaurant or a museum would cost nothing extra.
For years, experts say, transit use in places like New York has suffered because the economics of buying tokens is different from the economics of driving a car. The car has a high up-front cost -- car payments, insurance and registration. The cost of subsequent trips is cheap because gasoline, oil, tires and maintenance are relatively inexpensive.
 
Affecting Suburbanites
 But a rider on the subways or buses pays the same each time. With a monthly pass, then mass transit, too, would have a high up-front cost, but the price difference between a round-trip to work each day for a month versus a round-trip to work plus two or three other trips a day would be nil.
New pricing options could even affect suburban dwellers and the way they use their cars. One option under consideration is a combination monthly pass on suburban rail lines and the subways, which could make a weekend shopping trip in the city a cheaper choice for suburban commuters than a drive to a suburban mall.
At the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, James P. Gifford, an executive vice president, who is a member of an advisory committee to the M.T.A. on fares, said that a monthly pass would stimulate many extra trips, on which people would surely spend money that would stimulate the economy.
"There's a little bit of larceny in most of our hearts," he said, referring to a desire to get something for nothing. "I think of my own behavior. I can well imagine there will be those extra stops you wouldn't have made."
Some options could be in effect by the end of this year, although next year is more likely, officials say.
The agency has already done extensive advance work, surveying 24,000 people by telephone and asking them what price they would be willing to pay for different fare packages. The answers were used to calculate the ridership growth -- and the revenue loss -- with various combinations of fare options.
The Authority has run about 1,000 combinations through its computer, Mr. Cohen said. He provided two hypothetical fare plans to show the kind of combinations the agency has analyzed.
If, for example, the M.T.A. sold a monthly pass for $62.50 -- the price of 50 trips -- and made transfers between subways and buses free, ridership could be expected to grow by 71.3 million, from a base of about 1.2 billion, meaning growth of about 6 percent. Counting revenue from new riders but also revenue given up from people who would formerly have paid the transfers or bought more than 50 tokens in a month, the revenue loss would be $236.8 million, or about 15 percent of anticipated revenues.
If the monthly pass cost $68.75, the price of 55 trips, and a passenger transferring from subway to bus, or vice versa, was given a 75 percent discount on the second fare, and riders could get a 10 percent discount for buying $25 fare cards, then ridership would grow by 69 million, and the revenue loss would be $232 million, the model predicts.
The M.T.A. has been thinking about discounts and potential revenue losses for years, but on a much smaller scale. In the budget for this year it set aside $17 million for discounts, and for 1995 it plans to set aside $70 million. Since it is unlikely this year's allocation will be used, the agency could roll the two together. But it would not go far toward covering the cost of a monthly pass.

HEADLINE: Constantine Simonides, 59, an Official at M.I.T.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Constantine Simonides, who was both vice president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and secretary of the M.I.T. board, died on Sunday while playing tennis at Wellesley College. He was 59 and lived in Wellesley, Mass.
The apparent cause was heart failure, said his son, Philip. 
 Mr. Simonides was the chief strategist for M.I.T. during more than two years of legal battles in Federal courts in which the Department of Justice contended that the institute and the eight Ivy League colleges and universities had violated Federal price-fixing laws by trading information about how much financial aid they were offering to students accepted at more than one institution.
A settlement of the case, which many educators considered a victory for M.I.T. and the Ivy League schools, was announced last December.
As vice president for the last 24 years, Mr. Simonides served four M.I.T. presidents. His responsibilities included personnel, the medical department, public relations, admissions, athletics, career services and the M.I.T. Press.
As secretary of the board for the last decade, Mr. Simonides was one of four chief administrators of the institute serving on the 73-member board of trustees.
Born in Athens, Mr. Simonides came to the United States as an exchange student at St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Del. He attended M.I.T., later received a degree in economics from Boston University and earned an M.B.A. at Harvard in 1960.
That year he joined M.I.T., rising from assistant to the director of the summer session to assistant dean of the Sloan School of Management in 1964. He was named a vice president of the institute in 1970.
Mr. Simonides is survived by his wife, Betty; a daughter, Cynthia, of Boston; two sons, Ted, of Palo Alto, Calif., and Philip, of Wellesley, Mass., and a sister, Julia Cotsarides of Athens.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
After the food poisoning, Foodmaker is still struggling.

BYLINE: By Calvin Sims 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
DESPITE a promising marketing campaign that lured many leery customers back to its Jack-in-the-Box restaurants, Foodmaker Inc. is still struggling to recover from an outbreak of food poisoning last year at its fast-food outlets in the Pacific Northwest.
The food contamination, which left two children dead and 400 people ill, sent Foodmaker's sales into a tailspin, as customers avoided Jack-in-the-Box restaurants in large numbers. 
 While Foodmaker's revenues appeared to be making a comeback late last year, aided by an aggressive advertising and pricing effort, securities analysts now say that it may take more than a year to return to the sales volumes before the food poisoning in January 1993.
Shares of Foodmaker closed yesterday at a 52-week low of $7.50, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. From its recent high of $12.625 last May, the stock is down 41 percent.
Foodmaker, based in San Diego, reported a net loss of $4.4 million, or 11 cents a share, in the first fiscal quarter ending Jan 23, compared with net income of $11.5 million, or 29 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year. Revenues were $381.6 million, down from $403.3 million.
Average sales at company-owned restaurants were 9.2 percent below the level achieved in the corresponding period last year, prompting several analysts to lower their earnings estimates.
The restaurant chain finished its second fiscal quarter on April 17 and plans to announce those results in mid-May. Foodmaker officials said preliminary results indicated that sales were down about 9 percent for the second fiscal quarter.
"They have not made the recovery that people thought they would have by now," said Laurie Lively Smith, an analyst for the Seidler Companies here. "It's a reflection of the really competitive nature of the fast-food restaurant business and the poor economy here in Southern California. People still remember the food poisoning and it gives them a reason not to go to Jack in the Box."
Ms. Smith has reduced her earnings estimate to 10 cents a share from 30 cents a share for the 1994 fiscal year, which ends on Oct. 2. She now projects that Foodmaker will earn 35 cents a share for the 1995 fiscal year.
John W. Weiss, a San Francisco-based analyst for Montgomery Securities, has lowered his earnings estimate for Foodmaker to 20 cents from 60 cents a share for the 1994 fiscal year. Mr. Weiss said in a recent report that while it was still possible for Foodmaker to earn the $1 a share he had projected for the 1995 fiscal year, he is now forecasting earnings of 60 cents a share.
Even less optimistic is Eric Wasserman, who follows Foodmaker for Lehman Brothers. He now predicts that the fast-food chain will lose 5 cents a share this fiscal year, compared with his previous estimate of earnings of 30 cents a share.
Jack in the Box ranks fifth among the nation's fast-food hamburger establishments, behind McDonald's, Burger King, Hardees and Wendy's, according to the Nation's Restaurant News, an industry publication. About 60 percent of the 1,174 Jack-in-the-box restaurants are company owned.
Charles Duddles, Foodmaker's chief financial officer, acknowledged in an interview that the company's sales were below where management had expected them to be. "We thought by this time our sales would be even or above what they were before the food poisoning," Mr. Duddles said. "It's hard to distinguish if this is due to the poisoning or to California's weak economy."
Mr. Duddles said the company's market research showed that most customers who patronize Jack in the Box did so before the poisonings and that fewer than 5 percent of its customers had some lingering concerns about food safety.
For now, Foodmaker plans to continue its strategy of introducing three to four new products a year and offering at least one entree item for 99 cents, Mr. Duddles said. The company is also continuing to open new restaurants and remodel older establishments.

HEADLINE: Memberships Vote to Merge 2 New York Futures Markets

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The leading exchanges for trading oil and gold futures consummated their on-again, off-again courtship last night as their members voted to merge.
The New York Mercantile Exchange will pay more than $60 million to members of the Commodity Exchange of New York. The merger will enable the two exchanges to cut expenses by reducing duplication in computer systems and in the work force that handles marketing, accounting and product development. 
 The merger calls for the Commodity Exchange, the world's largest precious metals futures exchange, to operate as a separate exchange owned by the New York Mercantile Exchange, which is the world's leading futures market for oil.
The merger required approval by two-thirds members of the Commodity Exchange, or Comex, and a simple majority by members of the New York Mercantile Exchange, or Nymex. Comex members approved the deal by a vote of 477 to 181, while Nymex members voted 468 to 94 in favor of the merger.
Approval of the merger agreement was not entirely expected. The Comex has seen its fortunes flag in recent years as investors have increasingly turned to financial instruments rather than gold and other precious metals as a hedge against inflation. As a result, Comex's trading volume has fallen, with net income dropping to $674,000 in 1992 from $3.29 million in 1991. But in recent months, the Comex has recovered sharply, leading many members to question whether a merger was necessary.
Many Comex members lobbied their counterparts in recent months with letters arguing that considering the exchange's renewed vigor, the Nymex's proposed payment was inadequate, especially in light of the control that Comex members would lose in the combined exchange.
"The merger will transform Comex into an essentially colonial backwater of Nymex," wrote Andrew F. Brimmer, a public governor of the Comex board, in an April 1 letter to Comex members.
Under the terms of the deal, Comex will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nymex, in return for its members receiving $42 million at closing and $20 million over the following four years. Members of each exchange will also gain some rights to trade futures on both exchanges.
 
Other Mergers Discussed
 The merger, which requires the approval of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, also raises the stakes for the home of the exchange. Nymex has long said it will move from its quarters at 4 World Trade Center, and sites in both Manhattan and New Jersey have been wooing the businesses. Possible locations include Battery Park City, TriBeCa, 55 Water Street and a site owned by Colgate-Palmolive in Jersey City.
For years, Comex has discussed a possible merger with other exchanges, including the Chicago Board of Trade, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
But many experts believe the long-term decline in value of a seat on the Comex has prompted members to set aside their historical reluctance to merge. About 20 years ago, a seat on the Comex sold for about $325,000; today, it sells for about $100,000.
Daniel Rappaport, chairman of Nymex, has predicted that a merger of the two exchanges could cut expenses by as much as $6 million, or roughly 8 percent of their combined budgets.
Talks in 1991 between Comex and Nymex broke down over disagreements about sharing access to one another's contracts. Some Comex governors have said the new agreement is more favorable than other offers last year from other exchanges besides Nymex.

HEADLINE: Dow Jumps As Bonds Post Gains

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In a surprising show of vigor, traders bid up stocks yesterday in response to a sharp drop in interest rates and better-than-expected earnings for companies whose stocks are in the Dow Jones industrial average.
Stocks also got a broad lift from recommendations by a respected investor, Peter Lynch, who spoke favorably about dozens of what he called undervalued stocks, ranging from giants like General Motors to obscure concerns like the Quixote Corporation, a maker of specialized equipment ranging from compact disks to highway-safety products. The stocks of nearly all of the companies he mentioned rose yesterday.
 
Anticipating Statistics
 Moreover, looking to this week's economic reports -- wage statistics due out today, durable-goods figures tomorrow and gross domestic product data on Thursday -- some analysts were saying that if the numbers encouraged a continuation of a rally in bond prices, then stocks might also show further gains. 
 The stock rally yesterday was closely tied to strength in the bond market. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 7.15 percent, from 7.22 percent on Friday. [Page D16.]
Still, analysts were quick to point out that trading volumes in both the stock and bond markets were below normal, and price swings thus tended to be exaggerated. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 263.6 million shares, or more than 13 percent below this year's daily average of 305 million shares.
Many stock and bond traders did stay on the sidelines yesterday, made even more cautious by the closing of financial markets tomorrow to observe a day of mourning for former President Richard M. Nixon. That means the markets will be unable to react immediately to the report on durable-goods orders for March, which will be released tomorrow.
 
Looking for Signs
 The data will be closely watched for any signs that higher interest rates are curbing demand for durable goods, which are relatively expensive items like furniture and appliances that are often bought on credit. While the recent rally in the bond market has brought long-term interest rates down about a quarter of a percentage point, rates are still well above where they were when the Federal Reserve began raising short-term interest rates in February in an effort to head off a jump in inflation in the future.
Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 57.10 points, to 3,705.78, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.08 points, to 452.71. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 8.24 points, to 730.80.
Yesterday's gain was one of the largest for the Dow this year and the third sizable surge this month. There was an 82-point climb on April 5, in response to a bond rally and hopes that quarterly earnings reports would be strong, and there was a jump of 54 points last Thursday, following gains in the bond market and higher-than-expected profits from I.B.M.
As for the bond market, some analysts said that if the economic reports this week were encouraging, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond could fall to 7 percent.
But why the bond market rose yesterday remained a mystery to some traders. Christopher J. Madell, head of government bond trading at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc., said, "Part of the problem I have with this market is that people always gather around at the end of the day and say, 'Now why did we do what we just did?' "
Kathleen M. Camilli, chief bond economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, an economic consulting firm, said managers of bond funds had probably sold off too many of their assets in anticipation of a rush of mutual fund redemptions. Since that has not happened to a great extent, they now have a sizable amount of cash, which they can use to buy bonds.
Industry estimates are that the cash portion of fixed-income fund assets is now 12 percent, up from 5 percent in January, she said.
Ms. Camilli listed what she regarded as negative factors -- trade relations between the United States and Japan remain troubled, the Clinton health care plan could hurt business, the economy might slow and the Federal Reserve Board continues to raise interest rates. "This is still just a rally within an overall bear market for bonds," and therefore for stocks, she said.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.52 points yesterday, to 250.47. Advancing stocks outnumbered those declining by 1,552 to 667. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.66 points, to 435.97.
 
Aided by Earnings
 The market was given an early lift by relatively strong earnings for such Dow component stocks as Du Pont, Goodyear Tire, Boeing and Texaco.
But investors appeared to respond more to the stock advice of Mr. Lynch, the former manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund, the nation's largest and one of its most successful mutual funds.
Of 47 stocks (including one Canadian company) recommended by Mr. Lynch in an interview published in Barron's magazine over the weekend, some were up strongly, only two declined and one closed unchanged yesterday. The three that did not post gains were Philip Morris, the tobacco and food company, which fell 3/4, to 52 1/4; Designs Inc., an operator of Levi Strauss clothing stores, which was down 1 1/4, to 14 1/4, and Mirage Resorts, a gambling company, which closed unchanged at 19 1/2.
Under the headline "A Legendary Investor Finds the Street Paved With Bargains," the Barron's article quoted Mr. Lynch as saying that "in the last three or four months, a lot more stocks have fallen into a buy range."

HEADLINE: Confession Used to Portray Rifkin as Methodical Killer

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., April 25

 BODY:
As jurors heard the details of Joel Rifkin's confession to killing 17 women, the prosecution today sought to portray him as a methodical killer who knew that he had done wrong and who was remorseful.
Mr. Rifkin does not deny killing the women, but says he was mentally ill and acted out of a perverse sexual passion that he could not control. 
 The prosecution's line of questioning today was intended to undercut that argument.
"I'm in a lot of trouble," Mr. Rifkin told Trooper C. Thomas Capers, when he confessed on June 28 to killing Tiffany Bresciani and 16 other women he said were prostitutes. He told Trooper Capers he was concerned that his mother would be upset by what he had done.
Trooper Capers, appearing as a witness for the prosecution, recalled the six hours in which Mr. Rifkin detailed the 17 murders in a hand-written confession. He told Trooper Capers that he would often pick up prostitutes in New York City and on Long Island.
 
Suspect's Remorse Described
 Trooper Capers said Mr. Rifkin said he was sorry that he had killed Miss Bresciani and that he appeared "calm, matter-of-fact and responsive" during the interrogation.
On one occasion, Mr. Rifkin said, he took a prostitute to his home in East Meadow when his mother and sister were away. The prostitute not only left with her life, but took some jewelry that belonged to Mr. Rifkin's mother, Trooper Capers said.
"Mr. Rifkin said he did not report the theft to the police and that his mother was very upset by the incident," Trooper Capers said under questioning by the prosecutor, Fred Klein. "So he said he behaved himself for a while."
Trooper Capers also said Mr. Rifkin, who was receiving unemployment at the time of his arrest, expressed concern about his income, the cost of prostitutes and giving money to his mother.
"He said he felt guilty collecting money from unemployment and not contributing to household expenses, while spending money on prostitutes," Trooper Capers said.
 
Defense Claims Mental Illness
 Mr. Rifkin's lawyer, John Lawrence, has described Mr. Rifkin's actions as those of a mentally ill person who was not responsible for his behavior.
During his interrogation, Trooper Capers said, Mr. Rifkin asked for a pen, paper, a calendar and a map and proceeded to list all his victims, when and where he had met them, how and where he disposed of their bodies and what items of clothing and jewelry he kept for himself.
Although Mr. Rifkin, a 34-year-old unemployed landscaper, faces only one murder charge in Nassau County Court, for the slaying of Miss Bresciani, 22, all his victims have become a part of the testimony because of his insanity defense. He also faces murder charges in Suffolk County, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx.
Mr. Rifkin told Trooper Capers that he had picked up Miss Bresciani on Allen Street in lower Manhattan on June 24 and had paid her $20 for sex in the back seat of his mother's car, where he strangled her.
He later wrapped the body in a blue tarp, put the body in the trunk of the car and then drove his mother to the Nassau County Medical Center, where she worked one day a week.
 
Body Stored in Garage
 While his mother was at work, he took the body home, placed it in a wheelbarrow and stored it in the garage for two days. After 2 A.M. on June 28, he placed the body in the back of his pickup truck, let the truck roll down the driveway so he wouldn't wake up his mother, then headed off toward Republic Airport in Farmingdale where he planned to dispose of the body, he told Trooper Capers.
But as soon as he drove onto Sunrise Highway, two state troopers saw his truck, noticed that the rear license plate was missing and tried to get him to stop. He was arrested after a 20-mile chase that lasted about 25 minutes and ended when he crashed into a utility pole in Mineola.

Long Bond's Yield Falls To Lowest This Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Interest rates fell yesterday to their lowest levels since March 31 as Treasury prices rose on expectations that the worst of the bond market's three-month rout might be over.
The postponement of a sale of Treasury notes to Thursday from tomorrow also encouraged some traders to buy back securities they sold earlier on a bet that prices would fall before the sale. 
 Yields on the 30-year Treasury bond had risen so much recently that a rally was likely, said Frank Riccardi, who oversees $2.5 billion in fixed-income investments at Society Asset Management Inc.
 
Buying Again
 As a result, Mr. Riccardi has cut his cash position in half in recent days, buying 5-year notes and 30-year bonds. "It felt comfortable to put a little money to work," he said.
In trading yesterday, the Treasury's 30-year bond rose 26/32 of a point, while its yield fell to 7.15 percent, its lowest point since March 31, and down from 7.22 percent on Friday.
After hitting a record low of 5.78 percent in mid-October, the yield on the 30-year bond has surged since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates on Feb. 4 in an effort to curb future inflation. Last Tuesday, the 30-year bond's yield rose as high as 7.46 percent in intraday trading, its highest point since January 1993.
In when-issued trading yesterday ahead of this week's Treasury auctions, the two-year Treasury note that goes on sale today was quoted at a price to yield 5.63 percent. The new five-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.49 percent; the five-year note will now be auctioned on Thursday rather than tomorrow, which has been declared a day of mourning for former President Richard M. Nixon.
By late in the day, the discount rate on a one-year bill, also being auctioned on Thursday, was quoted at 4.64 percent.
 
Reassessing the Outlook
 Many traders and investors now say that 30-year Treasury bond yields above 7.4 percent are not warranted with inflation so benign.
Alan McClymonds, head of CS First Boston's bond trading for its own accounts, said customers and other departments at the firm were buying 5-year and 10-year Treasury notes.
"I still think the market can go up a lot higher," Mr. McClymonds said. "The inflation rate that we've seen doesn't support" bond yields as high as they are now, he added.
So far, the evidence indicates that inflation is subdued. Consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month and for the 12 months that ended in March the rate was 2.5 percent, below the 2.7 percent recorded for 1993.
Last week's drop in yields caused investors to become interested in buying again, said Ken Sullivan, a trader at First Chicago Capital Markets. "People we have not seen in months are now dipping their toes in," he said.
 
Altering Schedules
 Most American financial markets will be closed tomorrow, the day of Mr. Nixon's funeral, and the Public Securities Association recommended that the Treasury market close.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen announced that the $11 billion auction of five-year notes would be postponted until Thursday.
That means the five-year sale will occur after Thursday morning's release of the Commerce Department's estimate of first-quarter economic growth. The report's potential to move the market probably had traders buying when-issued five-year notes yesterday, Mr. McClymonds said.
Anyone betting that the yield on the when-issued five-year note would rise before the auction now has to reconsider since the auction will be held after the Commerce Department release, Mr. McClymonds said.
Following are the results of the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Cheap Moon Mission May Offer Glimpse Of Future for NASA

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

DATELINE: ALEXANDRIA , Va.

 BODY:
OUTSIDE the nondescript brick building on a street like many others, life was elementally terrestrial. People hurried in and out of a post office around the corner. A yellow school bus brought children home. Two little boys played in a yard, where laundry dried on the line.
Inside, in a small, darkened room, a few men and women sat at computer consoles and watched scenes from another world. One after another in rapid succession, pictures of the Moon, gray vistas of lifeless plains and yawning craters, appeared on the wall screen. The spacecraft Clementine was reporting home last week, as it has since it went into lunar orbit in February, sending the first close-up pictures of the Moon in more than two decades. 
 It is entirely in character for this modest mission of space exploration to be conducted in such ordinary circumstances, only a few red bricks away from the mundane. It is reminiscent, too, of the scrambling, makeshift early days of space flight before elaborate control rooms surrounded by acres of office buildings and design laboratories came into being to run billion-dollar missions sometimes taking a decade to get off the ground.
In many ways, in concept and execution, in its swaggering assault on business as usual, the $80 million Clementine mission, a joint military-civilian venture, is a glimpse of the past and, perhaps, into the future. Its success is forcing space officials and scientists to temper their ardor for the big and expensive and think seriously about how to maintain a vigorous program of exploration with smaller, simpler and less expensive spacecraft.
From a glass booth off the control room, Lieut. Col. Pedro Rustan of the Air Force, the program manager, looked at the latest lunar pictures with satisfaction. "It's working like a charm, and we were on time, on schedule and on budget," he said.
The 500-pound spacecraft, less than four feet wide and slightly more than six feet long, was launched without fanfare on Jan. 25 and went into lunar orbit on Feb. 19. The last time an American craft orbited the Moon was in December 1972, when the Apollo 17 astronauts walked on the lunar surface. The last Russian mission was in August 1976, when the unmanned Luna 24 landed on the Moon, scooped up rock samples and returned them to Earth.
On Friday, Clementine's miniaturized cameras finished taking mapping pictures of the entire Moon. Traveling around the Moon at its poles, coming as close as 250 miles to the surface, the spacecraft was able to photograph many regions seldom surveyed, and never in such detail. The spacecraft took, recorded and then transmitted more than 5,000 pictures on each five-hour orbit.
In one of the more esthetically appealing pictures, the planets Mercury, Venus and Saturn can be seen as tiny globes in a line across the darkness of space, with the brooding Moon in the foreground.
Upstairs from the control room, Dr. Eugene M. Shoemaker, Clementine's chief scientist and a planetary geologist assigned to the project by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, pored over the mosaics of pictures of such striking lunar craters as Tycho and Orientale Basin. The cameras, operating in different wavelengths and with an assortment of filters, were revealing sedimentary layers in the crater walls, he said, showing that the crust is not nearly as vertically homogenous as had been thought.
"It's beautiful stuff," said Dr. Shoemaker, who had spent much of his career analyzing earlier photography from the Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter flights, unmanned scouting expeditions that preceded the Apollo landings. "We will be able to identify rock types. Basically, we will re-do the geology of the Moon."
Because one of the mission's scientific objectives is to prospect the mineral content of the Moon, the spacecraft was given the name Clementine, after the miner's darling daughter in the old Gold Rush ballad.
Details of dark, deep craters at the polar regions were photographed for the first time. Several times the spacecraft transmitted special radio signals into the polar crater depths. The signals were deflected and received by antennas on Earth. Analysis of the modified signals is under way to see if they reveal the presence of any ice at the lunar poles, presumably deposited there by comet impacts and sheltered from sunlight.
Dr. Paul Spudis, deputy leader of the science team who is from the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, said that ground-based observations had provided some tantalizing clues of possible polar ice. "If we do confirm the presence of ice," he said earlier in the mission, "it will be a very interesting -- if not major -- discovery."
Next Tuesday may 3, Clementine's rocket is to be fired to depart lunar orbit and head for a rendezvous at the end of August with a small asteroid, 1620 Geographos. On the way, the craft should be able to observe Jupiter as it is being struck by a cluster of cometary fragments in July. If fuel reserves remain high, said Dr. Donald M. Horan, a scientist for the Naval Research Laboratory, which built the craft, Clementine could continue to another asteroid rendezvous in October 1995.
After that, Clementine would be "lost and gone forever," another reason for its name.
But Clementine's influence on future space operations could be more enduring. The mission, Colonel Rustan said, "is demonstrating every day that the cheaper, faster, better approach can pay off when it is applied to a small, well-managed project."
He chose his words to make a point. "Cheaper, faster, better" has become the favorite phrase of Daniel S. Goldin, the NASA Administrator, in admonishing scientists and engineers to come up with missions that cost less and could be flown in less time, or else face a long drought in space science. The embarrassment of having another group go out and set the example, some Government space officials say, is one reason NASA has been cool to Clementine, even while taking a small part in it.
Similarly, the Clinton Administration has been ambivalent toward the program, said Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. While some science advisers in the White House praise the mission as the way things should be done, he said, others are uncomfortable with the project's roots in the "Star Wars" project begun by President Ronald Reagan.
Clementine does have an unusual pedigree. It was the idea of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, the scaled-down successor to the Star Wars organization in the Pentagon. Military engineers wanted to launch a spacecraft for testing new lightweight materials and electronics designed for "brilliant pebbles," the fleet of small space-deployed craft once proposed for intercepting and destroying missiles in flight.
In late 1991, with the end of the cold war and diminished support for such anti-missile research, military officials were happy to declassify the project and have the civilian space agency join in, providing a team of planetary scientists and its deep-space tracking network. The military officials modified the mission to use the Moon and an asteroid, instead of man-made objects, as targets for the sensor tests. "Trying to intersect a tiny asteroid is like trying to hit a missile in midcourse," Colonel Rustan said.
 
Operating on a Shoestring
 Construction was begun early the next year with a shoestring budget of $55 million for the spacecraft, $20 million for the launching rocket, a refurbished Titan 2 missile, and $5 million for mission operations. A comparable mission developed specifically for lunar and asteroid exploration might have cost at least $400 million, space experts estimated.
Costs were kept low by limiting the number of people working on the project to about 55; they designed, built, tested and controlled Clementine. Management was streamlined, officials said, and many time-consuming design reviews were eliminated. A contractor, Allied-Signal Inc., further reduced overhead costs by setting up the low-budget control room here in downtown Alexandria.
Another cost-saving measure was to use the latest miniaturized components, based on the most advanced technologies but acquired off the shelf, often from commercial vendors. The set of cameras -- two star-tracking instruments, a ultraviolet-visible camera, a high-resolution visible camera and two infrared cameras -- weighed no more than 18 pounds. Some of these instruments were less than one-fiftieth the size of those flown as recently as the 1980's.
"We have reduced the size of state-of-the-art technology across the board," Colonel Rustan said.
Whether the Clementine model would work for other projects is debatable. Dr. Logsdon said, "They did it in a way that would be very difficult to duplicate in toto in a large organization like NASA."
But with its dwindling budgets, NASA is being forced to think small and borrow ideas from Clementine. The initial result is a planned series of Discovery spacecraft for projects that cannot exceed three years of development and $150 million in costs -- not Clementine economics but more restrained than recent planetary missions costing $1 billion or much more.
The first Discovery mission, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous, will be conducted by the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University, with launching scheduled in early 1996. The second mission, Mars Pathfinder, is being developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., for launching in late 1996.
Eskercq K. Davis, who manages Discovery mission planning at the laboratory, said scientists had been invited to submit proposals this summer for future Discovery-class projects to explore the inner planets, asteroids and comets, interplanetary dust and the Sun. The spirit of innovation, he said, referring to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, "is kind of like being back where we were at J.P.L. in the old days of Surveyor."
 
Need to Scale Down
 At an international conference on low-cost planetary missions, held two weeks ago in Laurel, Md., scientists seemed to accept the need to scale down their aspirations, agreeing that the $1 billion Cassini mission to Saturn, now being developed, may be the last large program of planetary exploration for a long time.
Even the Clementine managers have some more ideas of their own. Dr. Stewart Nozette, deputy mission manager, is trying to sell Congress on the idea of a second Clementine mission, perhaps to put small roving vehicles the size of shoeboxes on the lunar surface. With characteristic whimsy, Clementine planners are thinking of calling the next mission Alice, for Ralph Kramden's wife in "The Honeymooners" who is always being threatened with a swift departure to the Moon.
Congress has expressed an interest, but so far there is nothing in the budget for Alice.

Diagrams: "Mapping the Moon"
 The $80 million Clementine mission, a low-budget military-civilian venture, was designed to test lightweight components and, as a scientific bonus, map the Moon and visit a tiny asteroid, Geographos. In the first American lunar flight since 1972, the spacecraft orbited the Moon, transmitting a million stunning pictures, showing its entire surface in greater detail than before.
 
On to Geographos
 After the success at the Moon, Clementine is set to head for its asteroid rendezvous. The 500-pound craft is to swing back by Earth, using terrestrial gravity to st its four-month course toward Geographos. Scientists expect to get their close-up views of one of the dozens of asteroids that cross Earth's orbit.
 
Mosaic of the Moon
 Clementine took more than 5,000 photographs on each of its five-hour orbits, which were then assembled to give panoramic views, in this case of the Moon's south pole.
 
Science on a Shoestring
 Proving that a space mission could be mounted in only two years and on a modest budget, designers used relatively enexpensive off-the-shelf technologies. The set of miniaturized cameras weighs only 18 pounds. The images were stored in advanced solid-state data recorders for playback to Earth.

HEADLINE: Managing the Whiz Kids

 BODY:
The story was perversely entertaining. A 36-year-old techie is accused of outsmarting his eminent Wall Street employer, racking up a $9 million bonus by faking bond trades. Joseph Jett, head of Kidder, Peabody's government bond trades, victimized no customers. He did allegedly burn Kidder's shareholders, although few of them will lose much sleep over their modest losses.
But the accusations followed scary plunges on financial markets and splashy losses by aggressive investment funds, corporations and banks that traded derivatives -- fancy financial instruments whose value "derives" from underlying stocks, bonds or other assets. The series of events raises the troubling question of whether financial whiz kids have gotten eerily out in front of their managers, let alone Federal regulators. 
 Mr. Jett's alleged larceny involved selling "stripped" bonds -- bonds that pay no interest but rise in price as they mature -- for delivery in the future. But before the sale date would arrive, he would roll the contract further into the future. Because of a flaw in Kidder's accounting system, the firm would record a profit even though the perpetual series of trades put no money into Kidder's coffers. But the appearance of profits qualified Mr. Jett for stupendous bonuses. Kidder's managers were not savvy enough to keep up with his shenanigans.
A similar issue arose with corporations that bought derivatives designed to protect their profits from ups and downs in bond and stock markets. But several clients of Bankers Trust bought derivatives that, instead of protecting them, triggered huge losses when interest rates went up. Two of these companies plead ignorance of the risk they undertook.
Derivatives are also used by speculators. That becomes troublesome if banks are the ones speculating because derivatives can quickly generate huge losses of government-insured deposits that might have to be picked up by taxpayers.
Investors who trade derivatives to manage risk or speculate do so at their own peril. There is nonetheless good reason for Congress and Federal regulators to scrutinize their use by banks so that the Mr. Jetts of this world will not threaten unwitting taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Rare Butterfly Consigned to Extinction

BYLINE: By CAROL KAESUK YOON 

 BODY:
SCIENTISTS say the country's most recently discovered species of butterfly is about to become extinct. But rather than taking what they call "heroic measures" to save it, they are advocating a more hands-off policy that they predict will soon have biologists counting one less species among North America's butterflies.
Like concerned family members gathered around a loved one's death bed, the biologists who studied this small alpine insect, the Uncompahgre fritillary butterfly, have begun the mourning process, already sadly shaking their heads. They say there is no clear way to save the butterfly, so rather than spending precious conservation dollars to try to resuscitate the species, they suggest letting it go. 
 "This is probably a fairly heretical stance to some people," said Dr. Hugh Britten, a conservation biologist at the Nevada Biodiversity Research Center in Reno who is an author of a paper about the species. "It's not very easy for me to say I am presiding over the extinction of this species. But in the world of science, so what? Your personal feelings are not relevant and they shouldn't be."
While Dr. Britten and his co-authors, Dr. Peter Brussard, president of the Society for Conservation Biology, and Dr. Dennis Murphy, a conservation biologist at Stanford University, recommend continued monitoring and guarding of the survivors, their ominously titled study, "The Pending Extinction of the Uncompahgre Fritillary Butterfly," makes clear their vision of the future.
"Remember that the whole funding for endangered species is one pie," Dr. Britten said. "We're saying there's not much we can do that's sure to work and we ought to leave those funds in there to be applied somewhere else where they can work."
Among conservationists, the recommendation on this butterfly, which measures barely an inch across its wings, has already elicited everything from hearty approval to anger. Some say the researchers are making exactly the kind of hard decision they need to make and have been promising to make, forgoing expensive last-ditch efforts to conserve doomed single species.
"I think they're right on target with no heroic measures," said Dr. Paul R. Ehrlich, the Bing Professor of Population Studies and president of the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford. "I can't get excited about captive breeding of an alpine arctic ecosystem species that may go extinct on its own. It'd be much better to work much harder to save the species of the Northwest -- to save whole huge habitats."
But others warn that the recommendation may be typical of many examples to come in which biologists subscribe to a triage mentality, too quickly writing off one species in favor of others in the name of economic prudence.
"Personally, I find the triage idea ethically repugnant," said Dr. Reed Noss, editor of Conservation Biology, the journal in which the butterfly report was published. "We too readily assign species to the category of hopeless. It's too easy for political reasons to say we can't do anything about that species, that it would put too much of a burden on our economy. I probably wouldn't have concluded the same thing."
Dr. Jeffrey Glassberg, president of the North American Butterfly Association, which has its headquarters in Morristown, N.J., suggested that the constraints of the triage mentality may in some ways be self-imposed. "I think these are self-fulfilling prophecies: 'I have limited resources and we're not going to do anything.' I don't know that I'd want to give up so easily."
 
Always a Rare Sight
 Named after the site in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado where the species was discovered in 1978, the Uncompahgre (pronounced un-kum-PAH-gray) fritillary -- an unremarkable-looking black and brown mottled butterfly -- has always been rare, often numbering in the hundreds at each of its two known locations. But more recently, the species, seemed in precipitous decline, virtually disappearing from Uncompahgre Peak and declining at its other known site, Red Cloud Peak.
While acknowledging that the exact reasons for the populations' year-to-year ups and downs remain mysterious, the researchers blame the general decline of the species on grazing that once was allowed in the butterfly's alpine meadows, on overzealous collecting by those anxious to have this newest and very rare species, and -- most important -- on a warming climate.
Thought to be a relictual arctic species left behind on Colorado's mountaintops when the last glaciers retreated some 10,000 years ago, the species, Boloria acrocnema, has been trapped in what these scientists say has been more than a decade of uncomfortably warming weather.
"As far as management implications go, there's essentially nothing we can do about it," said Dr. Britten, who is a member of a team appointed by the Government to write a recovery plan for this endangered species. "When you turn the heat up, it causes problems and the butterfly has to move upslope, and there is no more upslope. It's being ecologically squeezed off the top."
All the experts seem to agree that if the species is naturally doomed, then the only responsible action is to let it go and allocate limited resources elsewhere. The problem comes in deciding when to say when.
Many expressed concern that the researchers may have been a bit too hasty in tolling the death knell for this species. Knowing the butterfly is indeed doomed, they say, is not as simple as it might appear to be. Researchers point out that just last month in Southern California, the Palos Verdes blue butterfly, long presumed extinct, turned up very much alive.
Amy Seidl, a graduate student at Colorado State University who is the only researcher now studying the Uncompahgre fritillary, said her recent work indicated that the situation was not as dismal as the researchers suggested. Since the downward trend observed until 1991, Ms. Seidl said she had witnessed a stabilization and even an increase in the butterfly's numbers.
The butterfly's population numbered nearly 2,000 last year at Uncompahgre Peak, according to Ms. Seidl's study, up from estimates of roughly zero in 1990 and 1991. She also estimated a population of 1,300 at Red Cloud Peak, up from 400 in 1990 and 400 to 1,000 in 1991. These are considerable increases for a butterfly thought to be on its way out.
Given the butterfly's apparent comeback, some researchers suggested that attempts at the heroic measures of captive breeding and introduction to additional mountain meadows were in order.
"Nobody can see into the future that far," Dr. Larry Gall, a curatorial affiliate at the Peabody Museum at Yale University, said of the predictions of pending extinction. "I think it would be useful for them to attempt an introduction."
Dr. Gall and Dr. Felix Sperling of the University of Ottawa discovered the Uncompahgre fritillary, the only new butterfly species found in the United States in the last three decades.
Dr. Britten and his colleagues, however, said they were not hopeful about captive breeding or introductions of wild butterflies to new areas, citing poor success rates in the past.
Dr. Gall responded: "Sometimes it's awful but sometimes it's good. It's not unreasonable to try."
 
Annual Cost Put at $5,000
 Despite arguments against the costliness of such ventures, Terry Ireland, a Fish and Wildlife Department biologist who is a member of the butterfly recovery team, said that for this species, even the most heroic of measures -- captive breeding -- is estimated to cost no more than $5,000 a year. According to a Fish and Wildlife Survey, in 1991 Federal and state agencies spent an estimated $177 million on the recovery of federally listed endangered species alone.
But so far, the recovery plan closely follows the hands-off recommendations of the researchers, a proposal of simple monitoring of the population, modest attempts to search for new populations and studies to learn more about the biology of the insect.
Even if funds were available and researchers willing, heroic measures can have their risks. Dr. Britten, well aware of Ms. Seidl's findings of increased numbers, remains wary of disrupting the butterflies with removals for breeding or introduction elsewhere. He cautioned that insect populations often fluctuate greatly, with apparently healthy populations quickly dropping back to low numbers for no apparent reason. The problem is that when butterfly numbers drop down now and again, bad weather or other harsh conditions can keep the vulnerable populations from bouncing back.
While the more pessimistic researchers argue that such fluctuations make it easy for the Uncompahgre fritillary to be permanently knocked out, others counter that it also makes it more difficult to predict extinction.
Adding more uncertainty to the status of the butterfly is the specter of yet undiscovered colonies. Ms. Seidl is optimistic that there are still unknown populations of the butterfly. As part of her continuing study, she plans to scale the wet, northeast slopes of the San Juans, the sort the butterfly would most likely favor.
 
Limited Sighting Period
 Even Dr. Britten, who has made numerous searches, admits it is impossible to be sure whether or not there are hidden colonies in the wilderness of the San Juans. It is particularly difficult because the butterflies are visible and in flight for only about three weeks a year, in July.
"All this means we can't be very confident that we've looked everywhere at the right times," he said. "There have been reports of additional colonies by one other lepidopterist, who is refusing to reveal where they are. You get reports like that and you think, maybe this person's right."
Amid the difficulty of assessing the health status of an endangered species, conservationists continue to struggle with making what may be life-or-death decisions for the animals and plants they study.
Ann Swengel, international co-editor for the annual July 4 butterfly count run by the Xerces Society and the North American Butterfly Association, said: "When is it O.K. not to try to save a species? I think conservationists are groping with this now.
"In the end, it's an opinion, a judgment call just like everything in conservation. You never know what would have happened if you'd done something else."

Spinoff and a Sale Loom in Tractor Business

BYLINE: By KATHRYN JONES 

 BODY:
J. I. Case and Massey Ferguson -- two well-known names in the farm and construction equipment business -- may soon be split from their parent companies.
Tenneco Inc. is expected to end months and even years of speculation about a possible spinoff of its Case unit at a meeting today with securities analysts in New York. Some analysts said that at least a partial spinoff would make sense since Case was strong enough financially to stand alone. 
 Meanwhile, the Varity Corporation of Buffalo said yesterday that it was in the "latter stages" of negotiations for the sale of its Massey Ferguson business to the Agco Corporation. A person close to the negotiations said that an agreement to buy Massey Ferguson could come as early as tomorrow.
The farm and construction equipment industry is emerging from several years of a global recession, heavy losses and deep work force cuts. Companies like Case and Massey Ferguson, which incurred heavy losses and went through several revampings, have returned to profitability.
"The market is very, very strong right now," said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. "We are clearly looking at cyclical improvement."
 
Shares in Rise
 Shares of Tenneco surged $1.875 yesterday, to $52.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. Varity shares rose $1.25 to close at $39.50, while Agco shares jumped $2.125 to close at $35.25 on the Big Board.
Tenneco executives declined to comment yesterday on the speculation that Case would be spun off.
Dana Mead, the recently elected chief executive of Tenneco, is expected to brief analysts today on the company's plans for Case and to release first-quarter earnings that will show big improvements at Tenneco's largest subsidiary.
If Tenneco does plan a divestiture, analysts said that the company would likely retain a stake or even a controlling interest in Case, which is based in Racine, Wis., and is the nation's second-largest farm machinery manufacturer after Deere & Company.
Analysts said they expected Tenneco to report significantly higher net income in the quarter, with most of the increase as a result of improving results at Case.
Tenneco, based in Houston, earned $74 million, or 46 cents a share, in the first quarter last year. Most analysts have estimated that first quarter earnings will range from 60 cents to 65 cents a share.
"Case is the reason for the real strong comparison," said David Fleisher, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Case's 1993 revenues of $3.75 billion accounted for more than one-fourth of Tenneco's total revenues last year. Tenneco's other businesses are natural gas, shipbuilding, chemicals, packaging and auto parts manufacturing.
Massey Ferguson would be the latest deal for Agco, which is based in Atlanta and has been expanding in the farm equipment business in recent years through acquisitions. In November 1992, it paid $110 million to buy the North American rights to distribute Massey Ferguson equipment and acquire 50 percent of its Agricredit financing business.

In Surprise, Sales Chief Quits Digital After Loss

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MAYNARD, Mass., April 25

 BODY:
Edward E. Lucente resigned today as senior vice president of worldwide sales and marketing at the Digital Equipment Corporation. The move, which surprised industry analysts, came a year after Mr. Lucente, 54, joined the beleaguered company.
Mr. Lucente's resignation came within days of Digital's announcement of a $183 million loss for the third fiscal quarter, a drop that surprised both Digital executives and financial analysts in its severity and caused the company's stock to plunge. Analysts said today that they believed the loss had led to Mr. Lucente's departure. 
 Enrico Pesatori, 53, vice president and general manager of Digital's personal computer business unit, was named to take over Mr. Lucente's responsibilities,
"Somebody had to take the fall and it's probably better that it was Lucente than" Robert B. Palmer, Digital's president and chief executive, said George Colony, a consultant at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
Shares of Digital fell 12.5 cents today, to $19.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. Palmer sent shareholders a letter today saying that Digital would would now enter the second phase of its turnaround, a period that he expected to last 24 months.
In an interview last week, Mr. Palmer acknowledged that Digital was experiencing severe problems in getting accurate reports from its sales organization on quarterly results. He said he believed Digital had been on track to meet analysts' expectations for the third quarter as late as the Easter weekend.
Digital's board met on Thursday and apparently expressed confidence in the plans of Mr. Palmer to continue his strategy for turning around the computer maker.
David Wu, an analyst with S. G. Warburg & Company, said he was concerned about the two more years needed for Digital's turnaround. "That is way too long for investors," Mr. Wu said. "I'm amazed the board would allow him to say such a thing after he's been on the job 18 months. If he was brand new, two years is reasonable. But after 18 months, he is asking too much."
Although Digital has seen fast growth in personal computers, most of its business remains in larger systems.
Mr. Lucente will become executive-in-residence at the Carnegie-Mellon Graduate School of Industrial Administration in Pittsburgh, the company said in a statement.
Mr. Palmer declined today to comment on the executive changes. Mr. Lucente is on vacation, a Digital spokesman said.
Mr. Lucente had joined Digital after a 31-year career in sales and marketing at I.B.M. He joined Digital from Northern Telecom, after a short stint there as executive vice president.
His arrival at Digital was heralded by analysts as what Digital needed to bolster its marketing efforts. He moved quickly to revamp the company's field operations, including changing Digital's compensation plan from a salaried to an incentive-based one. But analysts and Digital executives said Mr. Lucente's aggressive manner often clashed with the company's culture.

U.S. to Aid Industry In Computer Battle With the Japanese

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
In the biggest Government help for private industry since an effort to assist computer chip makers began seven years ago, the White House has approved a proposal to spend up to $1 billion on American companies competing with Japan in making advanced flat-panel computer display screens.
The Defense Department has scheduled a news conference for Thursday to discuss flat-panel displays, and the initiative is expected to be announced then. Administration officials began notifying Congressional aides today about their intentions. 
 The thin computer screens, which are mainly found in laptop computers and other portable devices, are increasingly used in military equipment acquired by the Pentagon. A handful of tiny American companies currently hold less than 3 percent of the world market in such screens, while several big Japanese corporations, led by the Sharp Corporation, control the rest and have been reluctant to sell to the Pentagon. The Administration's plan calls for heavy Defense Department spending to build up domestic suppliers instead.
The strategy to help develop the American industry goes far beyond the Government-industry consortium known as Sematech, which was set up in 1987 to bolster the computer chip industry. Sematech limits itself to developing and sharing production techniques but does not sell chips. For flat-panel displays, the White House wants not only to help with research and development, but with the construction of commercial factories and even marketing.
The proposal would provide matching Federal grants to companies that invest in flat-panel display research and production. The plan builds on current research efforts paid for by the Departments of Defense and Energy, for which Congress has already authorized $100 million. Further spending will be included in future Administration budgets that are subject to Congressional approval.
The plan, which is summarized in an interagency report and described today by officials who reviewed it, represents an effort to back an industry that seems to be particularly promising, and to short-circuit market forces by subsidizing it. This is an approach that Japan has followed, often -- though not always -- with considerable success in developing important industries. Whether the United States should do more of this has been a matter of much debate.
The Administration justifies pursuing such an approach -- which some call industrial policy -- as necessary for the nation's economic security. If the program to help the flat-panel display industry is a success, similar Defense Department spending programs may be undertaken to increase the nation's self-reliance in other industries, the report said, according to Government officials who insisted on anonymity.
Computer display screens were chosen for the experiment because they are critical to many high-technology weapon systems and because the lack of a display screen industry could weaken the nation's telecommunications and computer industries, for which the Defense Department feels protective.
 
Help to Build Factories
 The feature of the plan most likely to prompt debate is its call for the Government to pay part of the cost for companies to build four giant factories that would supply a sixth of the $4 billion world market for flat-panel displays. Some Congressional Republicans have objected to commercial research subsidies as unjustifiable interference in the marketplace.
The plan calls for the Defense Department to contribute $50 million in already authorized general research money for the immediate construction of a high-capacity pilot plant. The Defense and Energy Departments would also jointly spend $450 million to subsidize research and development over the next five years. The Pentagon is already subsidizing the construction of a low-capacity pilot plant in Troy, Mich. Up to $500 million more would be spent as Federal matching funds for corporate construction of up to four giant factories.
The strategy is at odds with efforts by a succession of Administrations to seek tighter international limits on such commercial subsidies, particularly European subsidies for commercial aircraft production. Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, signed a new global trade pact less than two weeks ago that put some new restrictions on subsidies, although he agreed to many fewer restrictions than the Bush Administration had sought.
 
Planned as Research Grants
 But the new restrictions do not cover matching government grants to companies for research and development. The assistance to the giant new factories is planned as research grants for the development of the equipment within -- an interpretation of global trade rules that could be challenged by foreign trading partners before an international arbitration panel in Geneva.
The Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council, which developed the idea, have endorsed it, as has the Defense Department.
Big American corporations like the AT&T Corporation, Motorola and Xerox have all publicly expressed interest in the last year in entering the flat-panel display market, but not one has yet taken the risk of building a full-size production factory, which would cost about $400 million.
The White House also envisions an interagency program, including the Justice and Defense Departments, to keep track of foreign computer display companies that may try to squeeze out the small American computer companies like OIS Optical Imaging Systems Inc., which is building the pilot plant in Michigan.
Another part of the plan calls for the Office of the United States Trade Representative to crack open the computer display screen market in Japan, which imports virtually no screens, and for the Commerce Department to help American companies market their screens overseas.
The report also calls for the National Economic Council to name an official to coordinate all Government computer display screen purchases.

HEADLINE: THE SOUTH AFRICAN VOTE: EXPATRIATES;
In New York, It's a Dream Come True

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

 BODY:
Far from the squalor of her native Soweto, history caught up with Moli Ntuli yesterday as she nervously inched toward a tent pitched on the north lawn of the United Nations Plaza in Manhattan. Once inside, the 49-year-old Ms. Ntuli did something she had only been permited to do in her waking dreams.
She voted. 
 "I was shaking so much I didn't believe this was me," said Ms. Ntuli, a high school math teacher, seconds after casting her absentee ballot. "I hope they can read my X."
As she spoke, one of her students from the Sarah J. Hale High School, in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, swept into her arms, overcome with emotion that "Miss Ntuli finally got to vote."
After years of activism, weeks of detention and then self-imposed exile in New York for the last 20 years, Ms. Ntuli joined thousands of other South Africans living, working or traveling in the United States who wanted to exercise their franchise.
A white South African yacht team made its way to the polls at the United Nations, as well as a group of South African Airways flight attendants. There were also white South Africans who popped out from luxury sedans to vote while their drivers waited.
For many others, like Ms. Ntuli, their participation afforded them for the first time an equal voice in their country's affairs.
Some got up as early as 4 A.M. to drive or take trains from southern New Jersey and Connecticut to vote in New York, one of some two dozen polling places in the United States.
 
'Bring Peace to Africa!'
 In Chicago, where as many as 1,000 voters were expected to cast ballots, crowds chanted "Vive democracy!" and "Bring peace to Africa!" Others danced the traditional black toitoi, often seen at protest marches, and sang "Nkosi Sikelele iAfrika," or "God Save Africa," their homeland's equivalent to "We Shall Overcome."
Maanda Mulaudzi, aged 35, of Makuya, in northern Transvaal, traveled to Chicago from Minneapolis, where he is studying history at the University of Minnesota. A supporter of the African National Congress, he said he had voted for the future. "For me to vote here is the first major step toward the democratization of our country," he said.
Five thousand absentee ballots were printed for New York, said V. R. W. Steward, the chief South African representative at the United Nations, who briefly visited the polling place, which opened at 7:40 A.M., about 40 minutes late. Voters could also cast ballots at the South African Consul General's office, on East 38th Street.
 
Voting in Surges
 Throughout the day voters came in surges, sometimes creating up to an hour's wait at the consul's office, said the Consul General, Joe Stauch.
"There is an excitement," said Sthembisco Kume, a black South African and an Independent Election Commission observer at the United Nations polling place. "I had to keep pinching myself to remind me that this is actually happening."
Mr. Kume, 31, said he had never been certain that he would live to see non-white South Africans vote. "Now," he said with a broad smile, "I feel like I'm 18."
Diana Scott, a white South African who had worked for the African National Congress, said taking part in the vote was "one of the best days in my life."
"It is such a fulfillment of so much work for a long time to get rid of apartheid," she said, adding that when she left South Africa nine years ago, she believed it was "wishful thinking" that such an election could take place at this time.
Despite the festival bustle that permeated the polling places, a sense of reverence and awe stirred many of the voters, black and white.
But for many South Africans -- even from afar -- the elections have not calmed all fears.
A visitor to New York from suburban Johannesburg, Amanda Ind, said she began stocking up on canned goods as election day neared. "It was just something people started doing," said Ms. Ind, 56, who is visiting her daughter, Frances Balachandran.
While cautiously optimistic about the future, Ms. Ind said she was concerned about the expectations of apartheid's most wounded victims, the potentially volatile "lost generation" of young blacks who left their schools to press for changes in their country.
She said that if they pressed for a radical redistribution of South Africa's wealth, "white South Africans can't possibly finance what's needed."
"The only hope is for the economy to grow," she said.
 
Daughter More Hopful
 Her daughter was more hopeful, pinning South Africa's hopes clearly on democracy. She noted that at the polling place, dozens of South Africans, black and white and of mixed race, gathered easily in the shadow of the huge statue of St. George slaying a dragon that is made of pieces of a ballistic missile. Many chatted and socializing without incident.
There was little talk about party politics. And bowing to election rules, there were few images and flags representing the factions that have been tearing at South Africa's soul in recent months.
"This is history, fantastic history," Ms. Balachandran said as she looked at groups of blacks and whites waiting to vote. "It has to work. It has to work."
Hugh Masekela, the South African musician, milled through the crowd at the United Nations after he voted. Looking around, he said, "We're facing undoing 350 years of impoverishment and 50 years of concentrated impoverishment, separation and manipulated conflict.
"It's going to take a miracle to undo all that."

HEADLINE: At Least 4 Die In Tornadoes Near Dallas

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LANCASTER, Tex., April 26

 BODY:
A storm system that lashed through the central United States late Monday and early today left its most severe trail of destruction here, with three people dead and the brick buildings and majestic live oaks of the Reconstruction-era town square blown to ruins. A fourth person in a nearby town died of a heart attack as he sat out the tornado in his storm cellar.
The system caused tornadoes in two other states, Nebraska and Oklahoma, and brought blizzard conditions and more than a foot of snow to much of the northern Plains, the National Weather Service reported. 
 Tornadoes that touched down in this Dallas suburb and in the neighboring town of DeSoto destroyed at least 525 homes and caused serious damage to hundreds of others, local officials said.
Parts of both towns were transformed today into twisted piles of collapsed homes, broken glass, fallen trees and dangling telephone wires. Swing sets were impaled on fences and in the Lancaster town square, a bank that was robbed in the 1930's by Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, the legendary bank robbers, collapsed into a heap of brick and mortar dust.
 
Sirens' Crucial Warning
 But the police said that siren warnings had given townspeople at least a dozen crucial minutes Monday night to dive for cover, and helped to avert a greater death toll.
"We had five kids, four adults and a very pregnant cat in the bathroom tub," said Gail Peacock, a DeSoto resident who had been entertaining her daughter's family before the tornado struck.
Mrs. Peacock's roof collapsed, but all the people inside survived after recalling that emergency-preparation officials say an interior bathroom -- and even better, the tub inside it -- often proves to be the safest place to wait out a tornado in a house that does not have a basement or underground shelter.
Early this evening, rescue workers were still searching through piles of rubble in the downtown area of Lancaster, about 12 miles south of Dallas, and in a neighborhood just to the west that also suffered severe damage. But even as some of the workers said that there were reports of people still unaccounted for, Lancaster's Police Chief, Mac McGuire, indicated that he believed the death toll would probably hold. The names of the dead, including the fourth victim, in Mesquite, 15 miles from here, were not immediately released.
"We've searched as well as we believe it's humanly possible," Chief McGuire said. "We don't think there are any more bodies in there. But it's possible -- in some places, the piles, the damage, it's just so deep."
In Lancaster, 18 people were treated and released from a local hospital, with two airlifted to Dallas with serious injuries, said Chief McGuire. In DeSoto, a community already economically hard hit when Congress cut off funds last year for the superconducting supercollider, a major physics project, 75 homes were left uninhabitable and seven people were injured, said Police Officer Gene Yates.
Another line of thunderstorms descended on north Texas late this afternoon, dumping baseball-size hailstones in some places. A tornado briefly touched down in Gainesville, near the Oklahoma border, destroying at least seven mobile homes, but there were no reports of serious injuries.
Yet another tore through Talihina, Okla., near the Arkansas state line, destroying about 25 homes and injuring six people. And one in Central City, Neb., ripped the roofs off several buildings.
Tornadoes are most common in the spring months and are most likely to occur in a broad swath of the country's midsection, commonly known as "Tornado Alley," running from Texas to the upper Midwest. But they can happen anywhere -- and the most deadly this year occurred late last month in Alabama and Georgia, killing 40 people.
 
1994 Death Toll
 To date, there have been 203 tornadoes in 1994, leaving 54 people dead, said Tim Henderson, deputy director of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo. "About 5 percent of the tornadoes do about 95 percent of the death and destruction," Mr. Henderson said.
Here in Lancaster, as is often the case with tornadoes, the trail of damage left behind seemed random, with parts of the town demolished and other parts unscathed. The damage occurred in an arc roughly a half-mile wide and about five miles long.
"It was just like a freight train roaring through," said Charlie Hathaway, a supervisor at a local food-processing plant.
In the town square, much of which had been restored as part of a plan to attract tourists, signs for quaint shops like "The Lovin' Oven" (a bakery) and "Quilter's Corner" lay still on the ground. A huge, old-fashioned clock was stopped at 9:39 P.M., the time that the twister knocked out electricity.
In the aftermath, there were indications of both the despair and the determination that natural catastrophes can engender.
"I just have no idea where to go from here," said Janet McCasland, the owner of the Coach House, a local restaurant, as she picked pieces of silverware from the litter that had been her place of business. "I don't know whether we can ever restore this place," she added, breaking into tears.
But just then the tenant upstairs, Rick Eilers, who ran a photography studio, came in and put his arms around her. They embraced in silence for several seconds, then Mr. Eilers said: "We're going to pull together and build it all over again."
Elizabeth Simpson the director of the city's Main Street Program, which oversaw the restoration, corrected herself in midsentence when she referred to the effort in the past tense. "We're still active, very much so," she said. "

HEADLINE: Wage Increases Are Small but Confidence Jumps

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
American workers are obtaining less in pay and benefit increases from employers these days, but they seem ever more optimistic, two surveys indicated today.
Moderating inflation in medical and other benefit costs helped hold the rise in overall worker compensation to seven-tenths of 1 percent in the first three months of the year, the smallest quarterly advance since 1986, the Labor Department reported today in its employment cost index. 
 And the Conference Board, a New York research group, said its index of consumer confidence jumped in April to the highest level in nearly four years, based mainly on an upbeat assessment of current economic and business conditions.
 
Smallest on Record
 The surprisingly mild increase in the employment cost index left this broad gauge of inflation 3.2 percent higher than its level a year earlier, the smallest rise since the Government began compiling the index in 1982.
Bond prices rallied on the news, then lost their gains when the Conference Board announced the jump in consumer confidence. But bonds recovered, pushing interest rates lower for the day. [Page D14.]
Although wages are generally considered to lag behind inflation, rather than to precede it, analysts said the results confirmed a belief that price pressures remained subdued.
"Businesses have got their costs under control and won't be under a great deal of pressure to push through price increases," said Richard S. Peterson, chief economist for Continental Bank of Chicago. Those that try, he noted, might not be able to overcome strong foreign competition.
Yet the relatively benign reading on wages and benefits is not expected to dissuade the Federal Reserve from further increases in short-term interest rates. The central bank is thought likely to lift rates again in mid-May in a drive against any possible quickening of inflation.
Wages and salaries, today's report showed, rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in the quarter and 2.9 percent for the latest year, barely above the 2.5 percent rise in consumer prices for the 12 months through March.
But consumers seemed to ignore pinched incomes, with the Conference Board's survey showing that overall confidence surged 5 points in April, to 91.7, the highest level since July 1990 and far above the 67.6 that prevailed in April 1993. The index is based on 100, the 1985 average.
Seven of the nine geographical regions posted gains, the exceptions being New England -- down sharply to 46.4, from 62.8 in March -- and the Pacific states, where the decline was negligible.
"Consumer confidence readings continue to be optimistic, running at levels which have historically signaled a strong economy," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Consumer Research Center at the Conference Board, a corporate-sponsored group. The survey, carried out by National Family Opinion Inc., polls 5,000 households monthly.
Most of the April increase reflected improvement in consumers' estimates of the current situation, which rose to 85.8 from 77.9. The expectations component moved up to 95.6 from 92.6.
The employment cost index, up seven-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter, has shown a steady easing in its rate of increase since the final three months of 1992, when the index rose 1 percent.
Most of the slackening has involved benefit costs, up nine-tenths of 1 percent in the first three months of the year and 4.1 percent during the latest 12 months, the lowest 12-month advance since a rise of 3.7 percent in the year that ended in December 1987. A year ago, benefit costs showed a year-over-year increase of 5.4 percent.
 
Wages and Salaries Up 0.7%
 Wages and salaries, which account for 72 percent of compensation, rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter and 2.9 percent over the last year, the Labor Department report also showed.
Counting only workers in private industry, wages and salaries rose five-tenths of 1 percent in the latest quarter compared with an eight-tenths of 1 percent rise in the final months of 1993. Benefit costs rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, compared with 1.1 percent.
Over the latest 12 months, compensation cost increases were a bit higher in service industries than goods-producing industries and higher for white-collar occupations than for blue-collar and service occupations.
Gains among white-collar workers ranged from 3.3 percent for executive, administrative and managerial workers to 3.8 percent for sales personnel. Among blue-collar people, the gains ranged from 2.9 percent for handlers, equipment cleaners, helpers and laborers to 4 percent for those in transportation and material-moving occupations.
Union workers did better over the year than nonunion workers, 3.5 percent to 3.3 percent, but this pattern did not hold for goods-producing industries, where both categories showed the same 3.2 percent rise.

HEADLINE: Petitions Seek California Vote on Canada-Style Health Plan

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 26

 BODY:
Leading a nationwide push for state-run health insurance systems, a coalition of consumer, labor and doctors' groups submitted petitions today that would allow California citizens to vote this fall for a Canadian-style "single payer" plan.
Cardboard boxes containing more than a million signatures collected by 10,000 volunteers were being filed with the voter registrar in each county today, organizers said, well over the 677,000 needed to put the issue on the Nov. 8 ballot. County voter registrars are required to verify the signatures before the measure may be put on the ballot. 
 The plan, which would remove private insurance companies from health coverage, would be financed mostly by taxes and would guarantee care to the state's 31 million residents. Similar plans, in which the government alone pays health care costs, are being considered in about 30 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, though no state has adopted one. California, home to one in eight Americans, would become the first state to have placed a proposal on the ballot through a petition drive.
 
Opposition From Insurers
 "Today was all about insuring a chance at voting for and winning single-payer health care reform in this state and pushing single-payer more into the center of the national debate as an option," said Martha Kowalski, organizing director for Californians for Health Security, the group that organized the petition drive.
Insurance companies are leading the opposition to California's plan, arguing that it would be expensive and would place the issue of personal health in the hands of a government bureaucracy, with all its intrusiveness and inefficiencies.
In addition, there are doubts about the effectiveness of a law put together through the voter-initiative process rather than the rigors of legislative debate. For example, an overhaul of the auto insurance system, approved by voters in 1988, has been seriously undercut by court challenges and industry opposition.
Proposing instead to revamp the current public-private system, Richard Coorsh, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group, said: "The notion of throwing up the hands and saying, 'Let the government do it' is fairly easy to understand. But the ramifications of turning over a significant portion of the United States economy is likely to subject consumers to higher costs and lower quality health care."
In San Francisco on Monday, Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized a Canadian-style system, saying: "We believe there must be a private insurance market, a mixed system between public and private financing and delivery. We like that competition."
President Clinton's health care plan would give employers primary responsibility for paying for health insurance, with workers' paying a smaller portion and special subsidies for small businesses with low wages. But his plan also offers states the option of adopting their own plans, including single-payer systems.
 
$105 Billion Annual Cost
 The California plan, estimated to cost $105 billion a year when fully in place in 1996, would create an elected health care commissioner who would negotiate fees for a broad range of services, including long-term care, mental health services and prescription drugs. It would allow consumers to choose their doctors, hospitals or health management organizations and would replace Medi-Cal and Medicare as well as private insurance systems.
The plan would be financed by a business payroll tax, an income tax surcharge of 2.5 percent to 5 percent, a $1-a-pack cigarette tax and existing government spending, sponsors said. They maintain that the plan would generally cost individuals and businesses the same amount that they now pay for health insurance.
"This sets up a system that is better than Canada's and has 40 percent more funding," said Glen Schneider, campaign chairman for Californians for Health Security.
But Mr. Coorsh countered, "It makes little sense to borrow upon the world's second most expensive health care system to improve our own." He said Canada's problems included steadily rising costs, a reduction in services and long waiting times for urgent care and surgery.
Mr. Schneider said the California plan would free an estimated $10 billion a year for health services by cutting out "the enormous bureaucracy and waste of the California insurance industry." It would extend health coverage to six million legal state residents who do not now have health insurance, but would not cover undocumented aliens, he said. These illegal immigrants would continue to be entitled to emergency care, as they are now, he said.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Thriving in What Was the Soviet Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: YEREVAN, Armenia

 BODY:
Even for those who believe in fairy tales, the story of a computer software company in this Caucasus republic can leave one laughing in disbelief.
In the waning years of the old Soviet Union, when it first allowed some experimentation with private enterprise, four Armenian brothers decided to start a computer company here. They had no money and, worse, no computers. 
 Some seven years later, their company, Aragast B, has 100 employees whose accomplishments include writing software for banks in Siberia and selling computerized dictionaries to schools as far away as California. The brothers also staved off local gangsters who demanded a piece of the business.
 
Trying to Be Competitive

 
 Aragast B is hardly a challenge to Microsoft, though the Armenian company contends that its dictionary, which translates English into Armenian, Russian and Arabic, is superior to those offered by American software manufacturers.
But Aragast has grown in a newly independent country where to say the economy is in shambles would be to exalt it. Along any street in the Armenian capital, more stores are closed than functioning and those that are open offer an anemic selection of goods. Industry is operating at 30 percent of capacity, thanks to a fuel shortage that results in electricity being available only two hours a day. By unofficial counts more than half a million Armenians have fled in the last three years, reducing the population of this New Jersey-size country to three million.
"Yes, the country is near the bottom, but still there is a lot of energy," said Gourgen Martirossian, president of Aragast B, and the youngest of the brothers. "Historically, we have seen worse times, times when not only the economy was destroyed but we lost our people -- the genocide."
He was referring to the slaughter nearly 80 years ago of hundreds of thousands of Armenians by Turkish forces. "We know how to recover," Mr. Martirossian said.
It is understandable why the brothers would choose to start a computer company. Armenia was once the Silicon Valley of the former Soviet Union. Forty percent of the mainframe computers for the Soviet military were designed here. At one time 5,000 people worked at the Yerevan Computer Research Institute, a downtown complex of stone buildings so secret that ordinary Armenians did not know what went on inside. The decaying buildings are largely empty now, except for Aragast's offices on the third floor.
But how could a computer software company begin without computers? "That's an interesting question," Mr. Martirossian said with a laugh. "We went to the customers and used their computers."
The brothers were used to having nothing. Their parents were schoolteachers and as children, Gourgen and his next older brother, Babken, had to share a pair of pants for school. If the boy who attended the morning sessions tarried, the boy waiting at home would miss his afternoon classes. While recalling those days, Gourgen Martirossian sat in his office wearing a pin-striped suit, broad-collared white shirt and tie.
His oldest brother, Armen, is the general manager of Aragast, a holding company that includes banking, insurance, agriculture and retailing units. Babken and Karen, the fourth brother, also work for the company.
From the beginning, Aragast B focused on banks as potential software customers. "Even when the economy is bad, banks are the last to die," Gourgen Martirossian explained.
Using the old Soviet-made computers at Armenian banks, the brothers developed software to computerize the daily operations of the banks. When they demonstrated their software at a bank trade fair in Moscow recently, two Russian banks also bought copies.
"The amazing thing was they paid cash right away," Mr. Martirossian recalled with a mixture of awe and pleasure.
Such fledgling capitalists throughout the former Soviet Union have found one of the greatest challenges is getting work out of workers grown accustomed in the Soviet era to being paid for just showing up.
Aragast B pays its employees relatively well by current Armenian standards. But Mr. Martirossian said wages mattered less than a climate of caring about employees' needs.
"In these horrible conditions, money is not the most important thing," Mr. Martirossian said. "We understand this and this is the key to our success. We've created a climate in this company and this climate is more important than wages."
As an example, he spoke of what the company had done for some employees who were among the thousands of Armenian refugees escaping the fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Aragast B hired several skilled refugees, but the apartments they could find were far from the center of Yerevan. With public transportation sporadic these days, the newcomers had trouble getting to work. So the company bought them a car.
Along the way, Aragast faced down organized criminals who are nicknamed "the mafia" and who traffic in everything from stolen cars to weapons. Such criminals come knocking on the doors of legitimate businesses, demanding protection money or in the case of Aragast B, a share of the business.
Aragast B refused and soon found its employees attacked and the company robbed by drug addicts hired by the gangsters. Mr. Martirossian and executives started carrying pistols. The war of nerves lasted more than a year, but Aragast prevailed.
"I think when they saw that we were willing to put our lives on the line, when we were ready to die for our business, they backed off," said Gaegin Chookaszian, Aragast's vice president for strategic planning and marketing.

HEADLINE: Industrial Lands Invite Russian Cooperation on Political Issues

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GENEVA, April 26

 BODY:
The Group of Seven industrial countries will invite Russia to work formally with them as they develop positions on a range of political issues, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today.
Mr. Christopher told Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, at a meeting here that Russia, which is far poorer than the Group of Seven, could take part in the group's meetings on political issues, but not on economic ones. 
 American officials said the move was designed in part to extend a friendly hand after President Boris N. Yeltsin complained that the United States and its NATO allies had failed to notify Russia before bombing Bosnian Serb positions three weeks ago.
 
Aim Is to Reassure Russians
 The new overture to Moscow came a day after Mr. Christopher and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain announced that Russia would be a member of a new coordinating group to help push for a cease-fire and a peace plan for Bosnia. The group also includes the United States, the European Union and the United Nations.
The moves are aimed at reassuring Russians and their increasingly restive nationalist politicians that the wealthy countries do not see Russia as a junior partner in world affairs.
At a news conference in Geneva, Mr. Christopher said, "It's safe to say Russia will have a significant role in the political discussions" at the summit meeting of Group of Seven leaders in Naples in July.
Mr. Christopher said that at today's meeting, he and Mr. Kozyrev had discussed more than a half-dozen issues, including how to promote peace in Bosnia and the Middle East and the importance of pressing North Korea to allow full inspections of its nuclear sites.
American and Russian officials said that if the Bosnian Serbs adhered to the NATO ultimatum calling on them to withdraw from Gorazde, then the United States, Russia and the European Union were ready to send envoys to Sarajevo on Thursday to meet with the Bosnian Government to discuss a peace plan. They would then meet with Bosnian Serb officials on Friday.
Talking about Russian diplomatic efforts with the Serbs, Mr. Christopher said today in London, before leaving for Geneva, "They have been helpful, I think, up to this point, and we want to make sure we are working in close harmony on this."
 
Fear of Offending Moscow
 Mr. Yeltsin's criticism of the NATO bombing, which was enthusiastically supported by many members of Russia's Parliament, caused Washington to move more gingerly on Bosnia for fear of offending Moscow.
The Russians largely lined up with the NATO view after Mr. Kozyrev went to Belgrade two weeks ago and thought he had won the Serbs' reassurances they they would end their offensive against Gorazde. When the Serbs continued advancing on the city, the Russians felt betrayed.
Since then, Mr. Kozyrev has taken a far harder line toward the Serbs, saying their behavior was "criminally defiant" of international norms. Mr. Kozyrev indicated his support for the ultimatum from NATO, which threatens to bomb Serbian positions and assets if they do not withdraw from Gorazde.

U.S.-Russia Military Exercise
 MOSCOW, April 26 (Special to The New York Times) -- In another gesture to try to placate his political opposition, President Boris N. Yeltsin ordered the Defense Ministry today to reconsider the first joint military exercises with the United States, scheduled for July.
American officials have regularly pointed to the exercises as an important symbol of growing Russian-American trust and partnership after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
But ultranationalist and Communist members of the lower house of Parliament have expressed doubts over the "expediency" of holding the exercises, which are supposed to concentrate on peacekeeping operations, on Russian soil.
This evening the American Defense Secretary, William Perry, called his Russian counterpart, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, and after a discussion about Bosnia urged him not to cancel the joint exercises.

B.A.T. Is Buying U.S. Rival

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In a move that would strengthen its position as the nation's third-biggest tobacco company, B.A.T. Industries P.L.C. said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the American Tobacco Company from American Brands for $1 billion in cash.
The transaction, subject to regulatory approval, won applause from Wall Street analysts, who said it made sense not only for the two companies, but also for the besieged tobacco industry. 
 "For B.A.T., it's an immediate positive impact on earnings," said Roy D. Burry, an analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company. "For American Brands, it's $1 billion for a business that has a declining share of the market, with no chance of turning around. And the industry's competitive environment will change. With fewer participants, there is likely to be less aggressive price competition."
 
Shares Up $2.875
 Investors seemed to agree. Shares of American Brands surged $2.875, to $34.625, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. B.A.T. shares rose $0.5625, to $13.75. Prices of big competitors like Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco also rose in heavy trading.
In addition to the positive economics of the deal, the acquisition completes an association that began in 1902. That year, the American Tobacco Trust, put together by James Buchanan Duke, controlled about 90 percent of the American market. But Mr. Duke, seeking even bigger profits, visited Britain, where American Tobacco and a newly formed British company, Imperial Tobacco, formed B.A.T. as a joint venture; American Tobacco owned 60 percent and Imperial the remainder.
The arrangement stood until 1911, when American Tobacco was found in violation of the Sherman Act and was broken up. As a result, American Tobacco's ownership of B.A.T. was severed.
Since then, B.A.T. has expanded into the United States. It owns the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, which Mr. Goldman estimates has about 12 percent of the American cigarette market, with brands like Kool, Capri and Viceroy. Last year the company had total domestic sales of $2.4 billion.
B.A.T. does not break out operating profit information for its United States operations. Worldwide, Brown & Williamson had a total trading profit of $385 million last year.
By comparison, American Tobacco, whose brands include Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Carlton and Tareyton, has about 7 percent of the market. Last year the subsidiary of American Brands had operating income of $169 million, on revenues of $1.51 billion.
Even with the addition of American Tobacco, B.A.T. will still be behind Philip Morris, which has 43 percent of the United States cigarette market, and RJR Nabisco, which has 28 percent. But analysts said the company that emerged from the takeover would be a far more effective competitor than its predecessors.
"In a mature industry, where there is little if any volume growth, it is nice to have some size," said Emmanuel Goldman, a beverage and tobacco analyst at Paine Webber Group.
Indeed, with cigarette use falling about 2.5 percent a year and profits from domestic sales under pressure, there were probably few companies not already in the tobacco business that would have been interested in buying American Tobacco.
"This is not the sort of market that people who are not already in the business would choose to get into," Martin F. Broughton, the group chief executive for B.A.T., said in a telephone interview from London. "But if you are in it, it is a buyer's market."
It is also not a business that American Brands is leaving behind. Although it has interests in distilled spirits, life insurance, hardware and home improvement products, tobacco will still be its most important business even after the sale. It is hanging on to its British subsidiary, Gallaher Tobacco, which has more than 40 percent of Britain's cigarette market.
In a release announcing both the sale of American Tobacco and its first-quarter earnings, American Brands said yesterday that when American Tobacco's contribution was excluded, Gallaher represented 37 percent of the company's operating income. Distilled spirits was next, with about 20 percent.
American Brands said it would use the proceeds of the sale for share purchases, debt reduction, strategic acquisitions and other corporate purposes.

HEADLINE: Rifkin Linked to an 18th Killing As Prosecution Rests in His Trial

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., April 26

 BODY:
The prosecution rested its case today in the murder trial of Joel Rifkin, with the final witness offering testimony suggesting that Mr. Rifkin might have killed more women than the 17 he says he strangled.
The witness, an expert on blood analysis, said the blood found in a wheelbarrow used by Mr. Rifkin to move the body of his final victim, Tiffany Bresciani, belonged to someone else. 
 The expert, Dr. Arlene Colon, chief of the serology section in the Nassau County Medical Examiner's office, said the blood in the wheelbarrow had been there for about two weeks before the discovery of Ms. Bresciani's body in the back of Mr. Rifkin's pickup truck last June 28.
In his 12-page confession, Mr. Rifkin admitted killing Ms. Bresciani and 16 other women he said were prostitutes. He said that he killed his 16th victim on April 2, more than two and a half months before he killed Ms. Bresciani.
Investigators say the blood in the wheelbarrow suggests that another victim, not mentioned in Mr. Rifkin's confession, was killed a few weeks before Ms. Bresciani.
The prosecutor, Fred Klein, did not discuss the possibility of additional victims in his opening statement but strongly suggested that there was at least one more victim when he questioned Dr. Colon today.
"I came to the inescapable conclusion that the sample from the wheelbarrow did not come from Tiffany Bresciani," Dr. Colon testified. She said the blood could have been there a few days or as long as a month.
Testimony in the case is to resume Thursday morning. At that time, Mr. Rifkin's lawyer, John Lawrence, plans to call his first and possibly only witness, Barbara Kirwin, a psychologist from Huntington, L.I.
She is expected to testify that Mr. Rifkin, a 34-year-old unemployed landscaper, is a paranoid schizophrenic who has trouble distinguishing fantasy from reality and meets the legal standards for insanity.
The burden of proof in an insanity defense rests with the defense.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lumber Prices in Rebound, But Most Trading Is Quiet

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Lumber prices rebounded sharply yesterday from recent declines, but trading on most commodities exchanges was subdued ahead of a one-day market closing to remember former President Richard M. Nixon.
Oil prices declined in what was widely viewed as profit taking before the market closing. 
 The lumber market, which has stumbled in the last month because of well-stocked inventories of timber and rising interest rates that curtail house building, recovered on signs of a springtime pickup in demand.
"The cash market may have a spark of life," Bud Merrill, a forest products industry analyst at Smith Barney Shearson, said.
Cash lumber prices have crashed the last couple of weeks and prices were down sharply at the start of this week. But business was improving at the lower price levels, which bottomed out at around $270 for 1,000 board feet.
At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, May lumber jumped the daily limit of $10, to $307.50 for 1,000 board feet.
Purchases of spruce two-by-fours would likely grow as more wood is moved to job sites with the spring building season beginning in earnest, said Curt Cunningham of Pacific Futures Trading.
 
 
Cattle and Hog Prices Fall
 At the same exchange, cattle and hog prices fell sharply, continuing a monthlong downtrend.
Traders said the heavy pace of the hog slaughter has not abated this spring, making many analysts skeptical of recent Government estimates that the size of the herd had declined. That expectation also led to stocking of pork inventories held in frozen storage.
Cattle prices were affected by the oversupply of pork and the large numbers of animals being fattened for slaughter, with several contracts posting lows.
June live cattle dropped 0.95 cent, to 71.075 cents a pound, and May feeder cattle lost 1.325 cents, to 78.025 cents. June live hogs fell 1.425 cents, to 51.025 cents a pound, and May pork bellies declined 1.875 cents, to 50.25 cents a pound.
In oil trading, June crude eased 33 cents, to $16.91 a barrel. It hit a five-month high of $17.28 earlier in the session but failed to sustain it. Over the last four weeks, the market has risen more than $3 a barrel.
May unleaded gasoline closed down 0.68 cent, at 50.71 cents, and May heating oil fell 0.86 cent, to 47.37 cents. Both nearby contracts expire Friday.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Details Compromise Proposed in Budget Talks

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 26

 BODY:
In an unusual bargaining tactic, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo released details today about a compromise plan intended to revive the stalled negotiations over the $33 billion state budget, which is now 26 days late.
The plan would largely split the differences separating the Democratic-controlled Assembly and Republican-controlled Senate on two major issues: how to make $410 million in tax cuts this year and how to allocate $400 million in additional aid to local schools. 
 But more notable than the actual details of Mr. Cuomo's proposal was his willingness to reveal the inside workings of the stalled budget talks, which have been cloaked in secrecy and obscured by the public posturing of the negotiators. In disclosing his proposal, Mr. Cuomo and his aides said he wanted to show the triviality of the issues blocking an agreement.
"When you look at this, you can see we're not that far apart; you can see the end from here," said Andrew J. Zambelli, Mr. Cuomo's secretary.
 
A Higher Political Price
 Mr. Cuomo, who has been criticized by some lawmakers for not helping close a deal, also seemed intent on deflecting criticism for the late budget onto the Legislature while painting himself as a conciliator. Mr. Cuomo has said, and pollsters agree, that the Governor pays a higher political price for late budgets than does the Legislature.
"Budget woes are always placed at the step of chief executives because they are the most visible political figures," said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute of Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie.
Privately, lawmakers and their aides said Mr. Cuomo could resolve the impasse by agreeing to find additional money for new spending and tax cuts. "The Governor's got to come in to close this up," said one legislative aide. "If one side says we need more money for something, he ought to find a way to take care of it."
But Mr. Cuomo seemed unwilling to put more money on the table, despite improving economic forecasts. "I cannot allow the Legislature to turn our progress into a pitfall by overspending and excessive tax cuts," he said in a statement.
Though the late budget has had little tangible impact on government services to date, scores of nonprofit agencies with state contracts are expected to face cash-flow problems by next week because their state checks have been delayed. The impasse has also created havoc for villages, school districts and cities, including New York, that are preparing new budgets without knowing how much state assistance they will receive.
In his compromise plan, Mr. Cuomo seeks to steer a middle course between competing Senate and Assembly tax reduction plans, incorporating aspects of both while proposing to phase in many of the cuts to reduce the impact on future budgets.
The plan includes several tax cuts sought by the Senate Republicans, including eliminating by September the state's 5 percent tax on hotel rooms costing more than $100 a night and phasing out a 15 percent surcharge on corporate taxes. But while the Senate proposed eliminating the surcharge by 1996, Mr. Cuomo calls for gradually reducing it to zero by 1999.
"The Republicans' proposed phase-in would leave a large hole in the budget," Mr. Cuomo said.
The Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican, called Mr. Cuomo's proposal a "token" cut. "The Governor is sending the wrong message to struggling businesses," Mr. Marino said.
The compromise plan also includes two tax reduction proposals advanced by the Assembly Democrats: one to provide tax credits to companies that hire new employees from neighborhoods with high unemployment and another to reduce taxes on small companies. And it expands on Mr. Cuomo's own proposal to give tax credits to working poor families, though the credits would be smaller than the Assembly Democrats had sought.
The cost of the tax cuts would be $410 million during the current fiscal year, which began April 1, and would increase to $1.53 billion when fully carried out after 1999.
 
Dispute Over School Aid
 To resolve a dispute over aid to local schools, which has pitted suburban and upstate Republicans against New York City Democrats, Mr. Cuomo proposed increasing every school district's aid by at least 3.54 percent. But the proposal would give even more assistance to districts with growing student populations. That would help New York City and many upstate districts, but would do less for Long Island, where few school districts are growing.
Mr. Cuomo's proposal, much of which was presented to legislative leaders late last week, also calls for a three-year plan under which the state would begin assuming a greater share of Medicaid costs from county governments. Mr. Cuomo had advocated a full state takeover of local Medicaid costs, but his proposal was strongly opposed by Senate Republicans who said it was too costly.
"It was clear we weren't going to get the full takeover in this budget," Mr. Zambelli said. "This is a compromise that would at least begin the process."

HEADLINE: Public Unions Challenge Whitman on Pension Security

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 26

 BODY:
Admitting they're trying to play catch up to the new administration's changing fiscal policies, leaders of unions representing teachers and state employees today attacked Governor Christine Todd Whitman's plan to reduce state payments for pensions by more than $1 billion in order to balance the budget and help pay for tax cuts.
Bob Purcell, area director for the Communications Workers of America, which repesents 50,000 state workers, said Mrs. Whitman "got out of the gate early" and "scared the Legislature with her popularity." He said reports just completed by actuaries hired by the unions showed that the Governor's changes threatened the stability of the pension system and shifted costs onto future generations of taxpayers. 
 Dennis Testa, president of the New Jersey Education Association, said, "Governor Whitman's successor will have to decide whether to raise taxes sky high -- or renege on commitments to retired employees. The Governor herself will have moved on."
At the heart of the problem, he said, are decisions by Mrs. Whitman and Brian W. Clymer, the State Treasurer, to reduce to $176 million from $528 million the state's contributions to the pension system in the current budget. Mrs. Whitman has also decided to put $57 million into pensions in the coming fiscal year instead of the $783 million called for under changes negotiated between the unions and the Republican-controlled Legislature and former Gov. Jim Florio in 1992.
 
'Scare Tactics' Alleged
 Mr. Clymer called the charges by the union leaders irresponsible. "They're using scare tactics," he said, and denied that the pensions were in danger of being underfinanced. "They are currently funded at more than 100 percent and continue to grow," the Treasurer said.
The union leaders said they would remind the lawmakers of their two-year-old agreement, inform their members of the threat to their pension and medical benefits, mount a public relations campaign and stand ready with a "legal component" if they decide they need to go to court.
Today's salvo by the unions represents the first major assault on the Governor's comparatively smooth assumption of power.
Until now, there have been only skirmishes like demonstrations by college students against potential tuition increases and criticism of the budget by some maverick Republicans, including Senator Richard J. LaRossa of Trenton, who has introduced a bill that would roll back the governor's initial 5 percent income tax rate cut.
 
Using Different Assumptions
 Claude Poulin, a pension actuary who has been a trustee of the Connecticut State Employees' Retirement Commission since 1982, examined the Whitman administration proposals at the request of the state employees union. He concluded: "If this set of proposals is adopted, New Jersey will have gone, in just a few short years, from one of the more enlighted pension funding policies to one of the worst, and more importantly, to one of the most irresponsible."
Mr. Clymer said the Governor's proposed policy was sound, given the amount of assets in the pension system. The state is putting enough money into the system to meet current benefit costs, he insisted.
But Mr. Poulin said the state was using outdated mortality tables and an unrealistic estimate of interest rates, 8.75 percent, to make the system appear sound.
Mr. Clymer defended the state's estimates, saying that pension systems were given constant reviews and that, if any problem should arise, it could be addressed in time to avoid any sharp decline in pension and medical system assets.
He said the New Jersey pension assets were higher than the national average. "We shouldn't ask taxpayers to fund any increase in assets right now," he said.
Still, when asked by reporters whether he could guarantee the continuation of pension, medical and cost-of-living benefits for retirees in the future, Mr. Clymer replied, "There are no guarantees on anything."

HEADLINE: Stock Market Is Listless in Slow Trading

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market closed essentially unchanged yesterday despite factors that ought to have prompted a rally, notably a drop in long-term interest rates and fresh employment data that indicated inflation was still under control.
Ahead of today, when most financial markets in the United States will be closed in memory of former President Richard M. Nixon, both the stock and bond markets had below-normal trading volume, probably signaling that many traders were declining to buy or sell. 
 The number of shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 288.1 million, or 6 percent below this year's average of 305 million shares.
The exception was tobacco stocks, where the news that Britain's B.A.T Industries planned to buy American Brands' domestic tobacco business for $1 billion lifted the prices of the leading tobacco stocks, American Brands, Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco, which was the most-active stock yesterday, at 11 million shares. The food and cigarette company rose 3/8 to 6 7/8.
The benchmark 30-year bond continued its rise in price, as its yield fell to 7.10 percent, down 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from Monday. In less than a week and a half, the long bond's yield has fallen more than 30 basis points, but traders doubted that the market rally would be long-lived.
The value of United States Government bonds rose early after a Labor Department report that wages and benefits were rising at a slower rate than economists expected. The employment cost index rose 3.2 percent, the smallest gain since 1982, when the department began publicizing the report.
The slight rise meant that workers were having a tough time getting raises and therefore that businesses' operating costs were stable, helping to damp inflationary pressures.
But the value of bonds dropped only an hour later when the Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index unexpectedly rose. Apparently choosing to interpret the index as a signal of an overheating economy and therefore of inflation, bond traders bid down the price of bonds.
The seesaw action of bonds contributed to seesaw action in stocks, but equities traded within a fairly narrow range. The lowest the Dow Jones industrial average fell, for example, was only 12 points, and the highest it rose was 5 points.
The Dow ended 6.24 points lower at 3,699.54, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 0.84 point to 451.87. The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.41 points to 734.21.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.06 point to 250.41. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining issues by 1,268 to 913. The American Stock Exchange market value index was up 2.23 points to 438.20.
Of the 30 Dow component stocks, 17 fell, led by Chevron and Texaco. Chevron fell 1 3/4 to 90 7/8 following its report that operating earnings fell 16 percent to $424 million, or $1.30 a share, at the low end of analysts' expectations. Texaco fell 1 1/4 to 64 3/8. On Monday, Texaco reported a 27 percent drop in earnings to $202 million, or 69 cents a share.
Of the 500 stocks in the S.& P. 500, 236 fell in price, led by Merck and Exxon. Merck, the drug company, fell 5/8 to 30 1/4 following news that Martin Wygod, chairman of the mail-order drug business recently bought by Merck, would not be a candidate to become Merck's chairman.
Of 304 companies reporting earnings yesterday, 165, or some 54 percent, reported higher earnings, according to Zacks Investment Research. Of these, 79 companies reported earnings that were at least 10 percent higher than analysts' expectations.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls on Broad Front Despite Encouraging News

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday despite good news about the American economy.
Gold prices rose 40 cents on the New York Commodity Exchange, where the June contract, the most active, settled at $375.30 an ounce. A late quote from Republic National Bank put spot gold at $374.15 an ounce. 
 News that the Conference Board's monthly index of consumer confidence jumped to a higher-than-expected 91.7 in April, from 86.7 in March, touched off a short-lived rally for the dollar.
Traders jumped on the positive economic news, interpreting the data as evidence of a possible threat of inflation, which in their minds would lead the Federal Reserve Bank to increase short-term interest rates.
Higher interest rates attract international investment, and the added demand for United States investments in turn pushes up the value of the dollar.
But the rally was undone by news indicating that European interest rates would probably remain comparatively high in the near future.
A British survey showed that country's manufacturing sector grew faster in March than at any time in the last five years, prompting speculation that further cuts in British rates to spur growth might not be needed.
 
Pound Rises Against Dollar
 The news sent the pound soaring more than a cent against the dollar, to $1.5055 in late New York trading, from $1.4905 Monday. In London, it closed at $1.5030, up from $1.4915.
Later, comments by Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's Bundesbank, left traders uncertain about the direction of German interest rates. Mr. Tietmeyer, speaking at the American Council on Germany in New York, said inflation was still too high in his country, an indication that the German central bank might slow the pace of rate cuts.
But Mr. Tietmeyer also said the Bundesbank "would continue to explore the scope for reducing interest rates." Dealers said his remarks left a mixed impression.

HEADLINE: Computers in School: Equal Access Sought

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
As the nation moves beyond today's computers and communications toward the so-called information highway, the Clinton Administration and growing numbers of educators and lawmakers contend that the Government must insure equal access to technology for rich and poor.
Unless Washington steps in, they warn, the increasing power of technology could become a force that divides schools -- and American society -- even further into the haves and have-nots. 
 The gap is already present -- the difference, say, between a school like the Lodge Grass High School on a Crow Indian reservation in Montana, where high-tech gadgetry is scarce, and the Glenbrook North High School in the affluent Chicago suburb of Northbrook, Ill., which is equipped with hundreds of computers, and where students routinely tap into the Internet, the worldwide network linked to millions of people and to resources like the Library of Congress.
 
Fears of a Widening Gap
 It is this gap that some fear will widen unless steps are taken to make the new digital services available inexpensively to poorer schools and rural schools. At stake, policy analysts say, is whether the United States will be an information aristocracy or a digital democracy.
"Education is where we as a society can do the most good with this technology," said Reed Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
No one contends that technology is an educational cure-all, but educators and policy experts, who predict that high-capacity computer networks will eventually become as basic to classrooms as textbooks and blackboards, argue that Government must insure that access to these networks does not go first and mainly to the affluent.
Legislation proposed in both the House and Senate and backed by the Clinton Administration would require communications companies to provide the nation's 110,000 primary and secondary schools and 20,000 public and university libraries with inexpensive links to the interactive networks.
The legislation, expected to come to a vote in Congress later this year, calls for telephone companies and cable-television suppliers to give schools cheap hookups.
The information highway might be imagined as today's electronic networks on steroids, far faster and more powerful than the state-of-the-art digital pipeline into the Glenbrook North school. It promises to give users ready access to everything from the London Library to Hollywood movies to two-way video links to experts in any field.
The suburban Chicago school clearly has a head start toward that technological future. Glenbrook North has more than 300 personal computers, many of them laptops that students can use at school or at home. In addition to being wired to the Internet, the students have a computer-equipped television studio. The school even has its own technology consultant, Alan November. "This school is a real model of technological affluence," he said.
Much farther back is the Lodge Grass school, whose students come from a region accustomed to unemployment and poverty. Three years ago, Vicki Gale, an enterprising librarian, applied for and won a small private grant, which finally gave her library a telephone and a personal computer able to send and receive electronic messages over the phone line. Since then, the school has added several more personal computers.
Ms. Gale's modest computer-network link was a big step forward, even though only about a half-dozen of the school's 200 students use it. "It's a starting point for us," she said.
The crucial ground rules for building the new high-speed electronic thoroughfare will probably be drawn up in Washington over the next few months. And supplying service to schools is shaping up as the first big social equity issue.
"Schools are the real test case of whether this privately built digital network will be accessible and affordable to the public as a whole," said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a technology policy group.
Opposition has been muted so far to the proposed legislation. Skeptics are less concerned about the mandated wiring of schools than about the proposal's potential for a broader precedent: Washington meddling in high-technology markets in the name of social equity.
"The push for Government intervention to supposedly help the information have-nots is an area ripe for abuse," said Mark Stahlman, president of New Media Associates Inc., a research firm. "With entitlements come bureaucracy and the Government's agenda."
Despite some resistance from industry, several big phone and cable companies, notably the Bell Atlantic Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc., support the concept of paying to link schools to their planned high-capacity digital networks.
The really thorny matter will probably be pricing the services. The proposed legislation calls for "reasonable" or "preferential" rates for schools, largely leaving it to the F.C.C. to determine what qualifies.
To some lawmakers and educators, reasonable means inexpensive indeed. Representative Edward J. Markey, chairman of the House telecommunications subcommittee and author of a bill that calls for wiring schools, says information services to classrooms should cost as little as a penny a minute.
Some advocates say even a penny is too much. For example, the George Lucas Educational Foundation, a nonprofit group set up by the film maker, recommends mandating that companies provide free services to schools.
Even without Federal mandates, schoolchildren are slowly being introduced to computer networks.
 
A Broad Range of Equipment
 But the range of today's network technology varies enormously. And computer networks are still used only sporadically in most American schools, where only one in every eight classrooms has a phone line and only one in 25 has a computer with a modem to send and receive data.
Even at the low end of the high-tech world, however, teachers often feel encouraged by the effect on students. At the Lodge Grass school in Montana, for example, Ms. Gale says the school's rudimentary electronic-network connection has opened new vistas for some students.
As part of its private grant, the school received free access to the AT&T Learning Network, which links classrooms in small groups. From the library computer, the Lodge Grass students can exchange messages and work on projects with students in Singapore, Canada, Germany and Italy.
Jonathan Deputee, a 17-year-old junior at Lodge Grass, has been impressed by how much students from different countries are alike, from shared anxieties about teenage relationships to common tastes in rock music from Metallica to Meat Loaf. "I thought they'd be more different than they are," he said.
Her students, Ms. Gale says, need more of that kind of technology-aided experience.
"A lot of our kids are have-not kids," Ms. Gale said. "And while the computer link we have may be small and basic, it's made a world of difference for some of my kids in terms of self-esteem and interest in school work."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Interest Rates Continue to Decline

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rates dropped yesterday for second time this week and the sixth time in seven sessions on continuing evidence that the economy is not expanding so rapidly as some may have thought.
Treasury securities made impressive gains in mostly technical trading ahead of tomorrow's report on the gross domestic product for the first quarter, which will provide the first full picture of the period's economic growth, and March durable goods orders. The market is closed today for the funeral of former President Richard M. Nixon. 
 Analysts and economists will have their hands full assimilating all the data released tomorrow. But many traders are hoping that they will finally get an idea of how fast the economy is growing and whether they can worry less about inflation.
 
Fed Action Expected
 But some dealers and traders expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates again soon, even if the new data indicate that the economy is growing at a moderate pace that would not reignite inflation.
By late in the day the price of the 30-year bond was trading up 16/32 , to 8918/32 , as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 7.10 percent, from 7.15 percent on Monday. It was the lowest since March 31, when the yield was 7.08 percent. Despite the rally of the last two weeks, the yield on the 30-year bond is still in the trading range of the last 30 days.
An unexpected surge in April consumer confidence data reported by the Conference Board in the morning caused bond prices to drop sharply before rebounding later.
Yesterday's confidence index, based on a survey of 5,000 households, rose to 91.7, exceeding market expectations, which were for a slight decline to 86.2, from last month's 86.7. Analysts said the jump in confidence initially sparked fears among bond traders and investors that the economy would stay strong in the months ahead, leading some investors to sell. A stronger economy generally pressures credit markets, because it is feared that it will spark inflation and erode fix-income investments.
"Consumer confidence as measured by the Conference Board, is currently just a shade above its historical average," said Donald Fine, the chief market strategist at Chase Securities. "The recent improvement is clearly a sign of an expanding economy, but certainly not a signal of any overheating." The index's low point of the last seven or eight years was set in February 1992, when it hit 47.3; the high point was set three years before at 120.7.
Before the consumer confidence report, the market rose after the report of a smaller-than-expected rise of the Labor Department's first-quarter employment cost index. The index rose 0.7 percent in the first quarter and 3.2 percent in the 12 months ended March 31. The report, which covers wages and benefits for both the public and private sectors, is an important measure of the costs that can drive up inflation.
Mr. Fine said the data showed that "if there is any pressure on inflation, it would not be from the cost side." He added: "Right now the economy is growing steadily and solidly, and at a noninflationary pace. And it's the Fed's job to keep it that way."
Looking toward tomorrow, Mr. Fine said he expected the G.D.P. report to come in at about 3.4 percent, after adjustment for inflation, a little more than the market consensus of 3.2 percent. He expects durable goods will be up 1.5 percent.
 
Treasury Auction
 The bond market cleared its last hurdle for the day when the Treasury auctioned $17 billion of new two-year notes at a high yield of 5.59 percent. Traders said the auction went fairly well, with the yield lower than expected.
Tomorrow the Treasury will be back in business and auction $11 billion of five-year notes and $16.5 billion of one-year bills. In when-issued trading the five-year was offered at a price to yield 6.45 percent, improving from 6.49 percent on Monday. The rate for a one-year bill was unchanged at 4.64 percent.
Elsewhere, municipal bond prices were steady as investors focused on yesterday's $1.7 billion in new bonds. Many investors were reluctant to buy existing issues with most market closed today and a batch of economic reports scheduled for release tomorrow. Most of the week's new issues were sold yesterday.
In negotiated sales yesterday, the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority tentatively priced $356.2 million of economic development revenue bonds to yield a maximum 6.15 percent for a bond due in 2014.
Underwriters led by Lehman Brothers also priced shorter-maturity serial bonds to yield from 3.30 percent in 1995 to 5.875 percent in 2009, with another long issue due in 2012 priced to yield 6.125 percent. All the bonds are rated triple-A because of insurance from the Ambac Indemnity Corporation.
The largest competitive municipal deal was done by Washington, which sold $300 million of general obligation bonds through Lehman Brothers, which reoffered the bonds at prices to yield from 3.40 percent in 1995 to 6.10 percent in 2019. The issue is rated AA by S.& P.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Wall Street is closed to honor a bear market President.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
WHEN Richard M. Nixon was elected President in 1968, there was general pleasure on Wall Street. According to the prevailing wisdom of the time, his election marked a return to traditional economic policies and good news for the stock market.
It was, as it happens, another case of Wall Street crystal balls showing only what the seers were wishing for. Mr. Nixon, whose funeral is today, wound up being the first President since Herbert Hoover, and only the third President of the 20th century, to have the Dow Jones industrial average decline over his term of office. 
While many of the remembrances of Mr. Nixon have focused on the surprise of an anti-Communist warrior opening relations with China, there has been less emphasis on his most surprising economic initiative, perhaps because it proved much less successful. But it is equally true that only Mr. Nixon could have imposed wage and price controls, as he did in 1971, when the inflation rate was above 4 percent a year -- then deemed unconscionably high.
That decision was immensely popular on Wall Street, and the Dow leaped 3.8 percent the first trading day after the announcement -- the equivalent of a 140-point move at today's Dow level. But it was a serious mistake on a longer-term basis, especially when combined with an accommodating Federal Reserve monetary policy as the 1972 election approached.
Instead of dealing with monetary causes of inflation, or with the profligate use of energy that was making the country vulnerable to an oil price shock, the Government set up a bureaucracy that ended up ruling on such vital issues as whether a New Hampshire county fair violated the law when it raised admission prices by 25 cents. (The ruling was that it did.)
Mr. Nixon himself noted this in his memoirs. "The Aug. 15, 1971, decision to impose them," Mr. Nixon wrote of the price controls, "was politically necessary and immensely popular in the short run. But in the long run I believe it was wrong. The piper must be paid, and there was an unquestionably high price for tampering with the orthodox economic mechanisms."
But none of that was clear at first. It was a week after Mr. Nixon was re-elected in 1972 that the Dow first closed over 1,000, and in early 1973 the Dow hit a peak of 1,051.70, a high mark that was destined to last for a decade.
It was the upward spiraling of oil prices, which followed the Arab oil boycott prompted by the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, that caused the recession and the worst bear market of the last half century. It was during that bear market that Mr. Nixon resigned. The Dow, at 935.54 when he was inaugurated for his first term, had fallen to 784.89 by the time he quit. A few months later, it was to bottom at 577.60, a decline of 45 percent from the peak reached less than two years earlier.
Presidents like to take credit for bull markets during their administrations, while distancing themselves from bear markets, but, as was noted by Robert Farrell, the chief market analyst for Merrill Lynch during and after the Nixon Administration, "in truth they often have very little to do with what happens to the markets in their administrations."
Mr. Nixon was elected near the end of a 20-year bull market, which had taken stock prices from undervalued to greatly overvalued and brought on "great speculative excesses," Mr. Farrell noted. The bear market that followed might have been less severe had Mr. Nixon done a better job on inflation, or had investors been less depressed by the specter of a collapsing Presidency, but it would have occurred in any case.
There is a tradition of closing the stock market for Presidential funerals, but this one is different in one way. Every President who died after 1930, save one, prompted the New York Stock Exchange to take a full day off. But Herbert Hoover's death in 1964, like that of William Howard Taft in 1930, led only to the exchange closing early rather than taking a full day of mourning.
The Taft, Hoover and Nixon Administrations were the only ones since the Dow Jones industrial average was invented in 1897 that resulted in a Dow drop. Thus Mr. Nixon becomes the first bear market President to be honored by a full exchange holiday.

HEADLINE: Visions of Weaning Americans From Nicotine

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ANTISMOKING forces in Washington, gaining momentum in Congress in recent weeks, have begun to imagine America with strict regulation of cigarettes.
But what would that mean? Cigarettes by prescription only? Nicotine-free cigarettes? Most agree that simply banning cigarettes is not an option. But one idea often mentioned by advocates is that the Government could gradually reduce the amount of nicotine permitted in cigarettes over, say, two decades. 
 That idea may never fly, but that people are even raising it is a measure of how far the antismoking tide has swept since a year ago.
 
Feasibility of Idea
 It would be national nicotine withdrawal stretched out over an entire generation. But could it work?
"It could be done, and it could be done gradually so that there is not much distress caused by the reductions, especially in the beginning," said Dr. Neal L. Benowitz, a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco who is an expert on smokers and their behavior. "After all, 80 percent of smokers say they want to quit. This would make it easier for them to do that, because over a long time they would just find the cigarettes less and less satisfying."
Dr. Jack E. Henningfield, chief of clinical pharmacology at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, agreed. "Yes, it is possible to wean the public off nicotine and cigarettes," he said.
The idea is one that has been around for some time. But recently, as antismoking advocates began to question what outcome they were really hoping for, it resurfaced. After Dr. David A. Kessler, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, said he was willing to regulate cigarettes, Dr. Benowitz mentioned this idea to him. Dr. Kessler has since included it when he discusses the options the F.D.A. may consider.
A big advantage would be that cigarettes with lower nicotine levels would make it easier for children who experiment with smoking to avoid becoming addicted. It is only over a year or more of use that nicotine addiction takes effect. Experts say that at least three-quarters of new smokers are children, and that they start smoking for social reasons.
The greatest concern that experts have in contemplating such a national weaning project is that when nicotine is reduced, some smokers may smoke more cigarettes to get the same level of nicotine, taking in larger and larger amounts of tar and other carcinogens in the process.
Dr. Benowitz said, however, that he believed this might not be a major problem in the long run. Studies of people weaned to lower-nicotine cigarettes show that they overcompensate for a few weeks, but most then seem to adjust to a lower level of nicotine intake. He added that "this subject really needs more research."
Many advocacy groups support the idea of a weaning program, including Action on Smoking and Health, a Washington group that uses litigation to press the antismoking cause, and the Coalition on Smoking or Health, a group representing the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association and the American Cancer Society.
 
Little Change in Nicotine Levels
 Dr. Kessler, in supporting the idea, has said it would be important to take into account the way people smoke and why they smoke to make such a plan work.
Over the past century, cigarettes have gained filters, become less harsh tasting and lower in tar. But the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, as a percentage of the weight, has remained very stable since at least 1952, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The percentage of nicotine was about 1.5 to 1.8 in 1952, and now the range is 1.5 to 2.5 percent. On average, smokers take in about 25 milligrams of nicotine a day. Dr. Benowitz says his best estimate is that when nicotine intake drops below about 5 milligrams a day, smokers begin to suffer withdrawal.
Each puff a smoker takes delivers a hit of nicotine that sends the level in the blood shooting upward within 10 to 15 seconds, and then falls back to a more constant level.
It takes 8 to 10 hours for nicotine to flush out of the body, which means that each morning smokers start with a low level of nicotine still in their blood. The first puffs of the day are more satisfying, and drug tolerance builds up on a daily cycle, so the last smokes of the day are less adequate and smokers may take more cigarettes to compensate for the milder hit late in the day.
Nicotine does give a mild high that tends to increase alertness slightly, and gives a small improvement in performance on memory and attention tests.
The absolute amount of nicotine in a cigarette averages 8 to 9 milligrams, in both "light" and regular cigarettes, 5 to 6 times the amount needed to remain addicted. But smokers can vary the dose they get, depending on how deeply and often they puff. The average dose given by a cigarette is one milligram, but smokers can get as much as three milligrams from a so-called "low nicotine" cigarette, or as little as half a milligram from "full flavored" cigarette.
Because of this variation in intake, even if the Government cut nicotine by 5 or 10 percent a year, it would not force smokers into withdrawal for several years, and then only gradually.
Greg Connolly, director of the Massachusetts Health Department's antismoking program, suggested that other tactics would be very helpful in encouraging people to quit and children not to start. "Treat the product like a drug, and do not allow any direct advertising or marketing, for example," he said. "You could use generic packaging, and put cigarettes in the drugstore next to aspirin as an over-the-counter drug, and make sure they are not sold in vending machines or elsewhere."
 
Possibility of Illegal Trafficking
 Restricting the sale of cigarettes in any form raises fears of an increase in black market sales, especially because there is already illegal traffic across the Canadian border to avoid taxes. Experts say that there might be some illegal trafficking if sales were restricted, but that it was unlikely to be a problem if, for example, cigarettes could be bought at pharmacies with a prescription, perhaps multiyear prescriptions like those for birth control.
John Banzhaf, director of Action on Smoking and Health, said this solution would also help keep cigarettes out of the hands of children, and would get smokers to see a doctor once in a while about their habit, while remaining available at every corner pharmacy.
Dr. Kenneth E. Warner, chairman of the department of health economics at the University of Michigan, said there would always be a few people who wanted to smoke, no matter what, and for those people "we should make it possible for them to smoke in the privacy of their homes if they want to."
Dr. Henningfield added that there were already some good treatments to help people quit smoking -- behavioral therapy combined with nicotine patches, for example -- and more were being studied, like nicotine inhalers or lozenges.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
BECAUSE of my position on wine prices over the years, this column is regularly cited by consumers who believe that for too long, wine has cost too much in far too many restaurants.
Invariably, restaurant owners have responded that the public doesn't understand how high their costs are and that a healthy return on wine sales is a must if they are to show a profit. 
 The debate heated up recently when two critics took on the restaurants in a wine magazine only to be challenged in a six-page, point-by-point letter from an articulate -- and successful -- young restaurant owner.
Writing in the March issue of Wine Enthusiast, Nathan Chroman suggested, at least half seriously, that restaurants allow guests to bring their own wine and charge them a corkage fee for opening their bottles. For every bottle brought in, the restaurant could collect $10 and have no further problems with storage, inventory or trained personnel.
Citing instances where wines that cost the restaurant $5 are sold for $20 or more and those that cost $10 are priced at $30 and up, Mr. Chroman asked, "Where else in the world of dining is there such a markup?"
Paul Gillette, a writer and consultant to the wine trade, also argued in the same issue for sensible pricing. If a restaurant gave its wine away free and thereby increased food profits fivefold from new business, he said, it would be foolish to keep charging for the wine.
He cited a client who, on his advice, slashed prices and in six months was selling 40 times as much wine in volume and 20 times as much in dollar value. "There is," he said, "a veritable army" of wine lovers eager to "bring new business to restaurants that offer an attractive wine-pricing policy."
Craig C. Shelton, who wrote the response, is the owner and chef at the Ryland Inn at Whitehouse, N.J., a highly praised country restaurant about 50 miles west of New York City. Markups, Mr. Shelton argued, differ from one type of restaurant to another.
"Diners get two or three dollars for three scrambled eggs that cost 22 cents," he wrote in his letter. Moreover, a $9 or $10 pizza may cost less than $1.60 in materials, while the french fries and sodas at a fast-food outlet "may be marked up 1,000 percent or more."
Some middle-level restaurants make 10 to 15 percent profit on food alone because their cooking is not labor-intensive and their other costs are lower.
These restaurants, Mr. Shelton said, usually mark up food four times the original cost. But luxury restaurants, he continued, lose money on food alone because of huge overhead and labor costs.
On a typical luxury menu for four people, costing $200, he said the restaurant would lose $90 if the guests did not order wine or liquor.
If the guests ordered $100 worth of wine and liquor with the same meal, he said, the restaurant would make $18.73, or a 6.24 percent profit.
Mr. Shelton argued that Americans are spoiled.
For years, he said, they have paid proportionally less for their food than any other industrialized nation in the world. Now, with a global economy in place, top-quality ingredients cost much the same anywhere, he said, but famous European restaurants often charge almost double what American restaurants ask for the same dish.
The true reason for resistance to wine markups, Mr. Shelton insisted, is a price threshold set by consumers who are not aware of the realities of luxury restaurant costs.
For example, he said, many would consider $1,800 an outrageous price on a wine list for a bottle of 1947 Chateau Cheval-Blanc, a famous Bordeaux property, but in fact, that price is cheaper than the replacement cost.
Similarly, he said, many American diners would find it unthinkable to pay $75 for a risotto with an ounce of white truffles, but that price may well be less than the cost of the truffles alone.
Mr. Shelton is young and earnest and may be forgiven for missing the touch of mischief in both Mr. Chroman's and Mr. Gillette's arguments. Certainly, he leaves himself open to criticism, or let's say good-humored ribbing, when he includes in the price of his $200 meal for four "china breakage (Limoges) -- $4.90; lawn care, snow removal -- $4.24, and music -- 45 cents."
Perhaps wine writers have been remiss in explaining, or at least airing the restaurateurs' side. Even so, how often is Mr. Shelton called on to replace this 1947 Cheval-Blanc?
Running a luxury restaurant means more than stocking impossibly expensive wines. Those days are over. Even connoisseurs want bargains.
At the same time, Mr. Gillette's free-wine fantasy has come to life. Cite, in the Time & Life Building, pours unlimited good wine free for guests who turn up after 8 P.M. on weeknights.
As for Mr. Chroman's "corkage" idea, it's provocative, but one can only hope that someday he's invited to a great restaurant and that his host brings along several bottles of some undistinguished stuff.

TASTINGS
Fetzer Petite Sirah Reserve, Mendocino, 1990; about $12.
 
Hollywood film promoters regularly send kits to critics that include reviews of varying lengths, complete with headlines designed to fit almost any newspaper. Favorable reviews, of course. Now, we have Fetzer Vineyards extending its hand to the harried critic with canned reviews of its own wines. Along with a bottle of its 1990 Petite Sirah Reserve comes a release with two flattering descriptions. One, the winery thoughtfully notes, is 10 words long, the other 30. What follows is neither. The wine is excellent, and like just about everything Fetzer makes, definitely worth sampling. Petite sirah is a big rich wine that is often clumsily handled by wine makers. Not here. It's tannic but smooth, concentrated but never heavy in the mouth or hard on the head. Alcohol is 12.5 percent, which is normal even for Beaujolais these days. The pundits say petite sirah is passe. This one could give the variety a new lease on life. It's just right to accompany pungent offerings from the barbecue.

HEADLINE: A Different Take on the 'Myth' of Inflation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, makes a case for low inflation ("Inflation: Myth and Reality," Op-Ed, April 15). She does not mention the Federal Reserve, but the article is clearly meant to send a message to the Fed. "The economy has turned in its best inflation performance in decades. . . . Favorable trends are continuing this year." But reasonable people, even supporters of low interest rates like myself, can put a different slant on the data. 
 Most economists will agree that price increases at the level of the consumer have been tamed, for now. But it is important to remember that:
* Consumer prices tend to be a lagging indicator. Industrial commodity prices tend to lead the cycle, and they have been showing strength.
* Monetary policy takes time to have an effect. It will be nine months to a year before interest rate increases have noticeable effects on real economic activity. Policymakers must look ahead to next year. Where will the economy be then?
Fortunately, there are many indications that the economy is improving rapidly. Jobs are being created. If the economy continues to add 200,000 jobs per month, this time next year the unemployment rate may be down to less than 6 percent, at the lower edge of Ms. Tyson's 5.9 to 6.3 percent danger zone. Capacity utilization is also improving and may be approaching 85 percent, causing bottlenecks and price rises in some industries. Evidence of increasing prices in industrial materials is appearing.
The pattern of interest rates is a striking confirmation of what business executives and financial economists are anticipating. From the low point last year long-term rates have gone up 150 basis points, though the Fed has raised short-term rates only 50 basis points. The difference reflects inflationary expectations.
Under the circumstances, gradual adjusting of monetary policy is indeed necessary if Ms. Tyson's projection of "a decade-long phase of steady growth and modest inflation" is to materialize.

HEADLINE: A Different Take on the 'Myth' of Inflation;
Raise Taxes, Not Rates

 BODY:
To the Editor:
If the U.S. economy is growing too fast, why, when your Government is running a $200 billion annual deficit, would Americans choose to take the heat out by raising interest rates? 
 As we Canadians have learned to our sorrow, higher interest rates don't actually slow down the economy until they get so high that they bring it crashing down into a recession. In the meantime their main effect is to shift money around from borrowers (including the government) to lenders (including foreigners). If anything, higher rates contribute to inflation in the short term as business people try to maintain their profit margins in comparison with just putting their money in the bank.
Why not have your Government cool things down by raising taxes to reduce its deficit? A 0.5 percent or 1 percent surtax on all new loans would have the same dampening effect on new loan demand as raising interest rates by the same amount.
The fairest way to take out the heat would be to raise income tax rates. But that might mean that the people who control the Fed would have to pay their share of fighting inflation!

HEADLINE: THE 37TH PRESIDENT: DIGNITARIES;
List of Overseas Guests for Nixon's Funeral Is Short

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: YORBA LINDA, Calif., April 26

 BODY:
Although international relations dominated Richard M. Nixon's long career, no foreign heads of state or government are expected for his funeral Wednesday at the library his friends built on the site of the failed citrus orchard where he grew up.
Mr. Nixon counted as his greatest accomplishments the normalization of relations with China and detente with the Soviet Union. But no high-powered delegation is coming from Beijing, which will be represented by a Deputy Prime Minister, Zou Jiahua. Russia, too, is sending only a Deputy Prime Minister, Aleksandr N. Shokhin. 
 President Clinton will be here, flying from Washington to California and back in 15 hours, and he will be joined by all four living former Presidents -- Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
Five planeloads of senators and representatives, members of Mr. Clinton's Cabinet and onetime members of Mr. Nixon's, and some of the major figures in the Watergate scandal are also among those invited to the ceremony, for which 2,600 seats have been installed.
 
Agnew Is Expected
 Spiro T. Agnew, Mr. Nixon's first Vice President, who was forced to resign in a financial scandal in October 1973, refused after the former President's death last Friday to make any comment.
But a friend of the Nixon family said Mr. Agnew had asked the Nixon daughters, Julie Nixon Eisenhower and Tricia Nixon Cox, whether he would be welcome at the funeral and was told he would. He is therefore expected, although he has long felt that Mr. Nixon and his Justice Department made inadequate efforts to save his career.
Former Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, the man whom Mr. Nixon defeated in a landslide by carrying 49 states in 1972, is coming to Yorba Linda on Mr. Clinton's plane. Elliot L. Richardson, the patrician politician from Massachusetts who resigned as Attorney General on Oct. 20, 1973, as part of the "Saturday Night Massacre," will also be aboard.
Other veterans of the Nixon Cabinet and White House staff on Air Force One will be James R. Schlesinger, who served as Mr. Nixon's third Defense Secretary; William P. Rogers, Mr. Nixon's first Secretary of State; James T. Lynn, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Alexander M. Haig Jr., the Nixon White House chief of staff; Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Mr. Nixon's innovative adviser on domestic affairs.
 
Watergate Cast to Come
 The chief organizer of the ceremonies here today and on Wednesday has been Ron Walker, Mr. Nixon's star advance man, who planned the former President's ground-breaking trip to Communist China in 1972.
Some of those cast as villains in the Watergate scandal are planning to come, old Nixon hands said, including Charles W. Colson, the master of political dirty tricks who once said he would run over his grandmother for Mr. Nixon. He now heads a ministry for prison inmates.
But some big Watergate names will be absent. Gerald Warren, the editor of The San Diego Union-Tribune, who was the deputy White House press secretary in the Nixon years, said he did not expect to see John D. Ehrlichman, who, with the late H. R. Haldeman, formed what was known as the "Berlin wall" around Mr. Nixon's office. He now lives in Santa Fe and writes books.
"There was bad blood between him and the Old Man," Mr. Warren said. "Some things he said, things he wrote, didn't sit well."
At a Nixon conference at Hofstra University on Long Island a few years ago, Jeb Stuart Magruder, another major Watergate figure, was shunned by other former Nixon staff members. His appearance here was also said to be unlikely.
 
What Might Have Been
 And John W. Dean 3d, the former counsel to the President whose testimony to the Senate Watergate Committee heavily incriminated Mr. Nixon?
Jack Brennan, Mr. Nixon's chief of staff in the first years after his resignation, rolled his eyes and said, "Ask another question." He added, "It would have to be a magnanimous gesture."
Mr. Nixon's two closest friends outside the Government as his Presidency crashed in flames, Robert Abplanalp and Bebe Rebozo, are both expected for the funeral. The former President attended a party given by Mr. Abplanalp in New York two days before he suffered the stroke that killed him.
American politicians of every ideological stripe have promised to attend -- from George W. Romney, the former Michigan Governor who challenged Mr. Nixon for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1968 after having asserted that he had been brainwashed by American briefers in Saigon, to Willie L. Brown Jr., the Speaker of the California Assembly who is one of the nation's leading liberals.
 
85 Nations to Be Represented
 The senior foreign officials who are planning to attend the funeral, the White House said, are Edward Heath, the former British Prime Minister; Toshiki Kaifu, the former Japanese Prime Minister, and former President Chaim Herzog of Israel. A total of 85 countries are to be represented at the funeral.
A number of foreign ministers in Europe and the Middle East who might have come to Yorba Linda were tied up in meetings with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is traveling abroad this week, a State Department official said. But he conceded that that did not fully explain why so few high-ranking officials had decided to honor a man with whom they shared the world stage for many years.
Mr. Clinton, who is to deliver one of the eulogies on Wednesday, plans no substantive conversations with any of the visiting foreign officials, a White House aide said. He might have done so, the aide explained, had high-level officials of present governments attended the funeral.
For John F. Kennedy's funeral in 1963, a total of 19 kings, queens, presidents and princes made the journey to Washington, including Charles de Gaulle of France and Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, along with many prime ministers and foreign ministers. President Lyndon B. Johnson held extended conferences with many of the visitors.
Ten years later, at Johnson's own funeral, also in Washington, foreign ministers dominated the overseas guest list. Again, there were talks involving them and State Department and other officials.

HEADLINE: Fund Is Set Up to Stabilize Mexican Peso

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
The United States, Mexico and Canada announced the formation today of an unusual multibillion-dollar fund to stabilize Mexico's currency and protect it from further onslaughts by global speculators.
The centerpiece of the new fund is the creation of a permanent $6.7 billion line of credit for the central bank of Mexico, with the money being put up by Mexico's partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States and Canada. 
 The creation of such a fund underscores the degree to which the United States, Canada and Mexico now see their economies -- and their economic futures -- as intimately intertwined. Increasingly, when countries enter into free trade pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement they have to become involved in one another's economies. Steady growth in trade and investment among the three North American partners is impossible without a degree of currency stability.
Since Jan. 1, the Mexican peso has fallen 8 percent in value against the Canadian dollar and 6 percent against the United States dollar. That hurts trade, because the cost of everything Mexico or Canada wants to buy from the United States has increased, dampening their demand for American products.
The political turmoil in Mexico in recent months, coupled with the recent global turmoil in the bond markets, has played havoc with the Mexican peso. A peasant revolt in southern Mexico, the murder of a presidential candidate and the abductions of prominent businessmen combined to spur many investors to pull money out of Mexican stocks, bonds and banks, driving down the peso's value.
This, in turn, forced the Mexican Government to raise short-term interest rates to induce people to keep their money in pesos. The rising rates began to choke off the kind of economic growth that Canada and the United States expect from Mexico to make the North American trade agreement a lucrative three-way proposition.
The resulting decision to take some long-term steps to stabilize the Mexican currency was announced at a news conference in Washington this morning, involving the finance ministers and central bank chairmen of the three countries. The creation of a new consultative group, called the North American Financial Group, was also announced. It will oversee economic and financial issues affecting the North American partners.
"We'll establish regular consultations between our countries on economic and financial policy arrangements," said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who went on to announce the new arrangement to shore up the peso.
"It's a multibillion-dollar reciprocal credit facility in the form of a swap," Mr. Bentsen said. "Its purpose is to promote orderly exchange markets."
The swap facility will merge, expand and make permanent three lines of credit already in existence between the three countries. A credit line is a given amount of lending provided by a bank that a borrower can draw on in an emergency.
 
 
Colosio Assassination
 This fund will make permanent a temporary $6 billion credit line that the United States extended to Mexico on March 24 to calm jittery currency markets after the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's presidential candidate. It will also expand a pre-existing credit line between Canada and Mexico to $730 million, from $145 million. And it will merge both of these with another established $2 billion credit line between the United States and Canada. Each country has the right to draw on the others' currency.
"This arrangement is a logical progression from trade and investment cooperation between the three countries to greater monetary and fiscal cooperation," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
The mere existence of such credit lines is supposed to reassure markets enough that the money will never actually have to be drawn by either Mexico or Canada. Such funds are psychological tools more than anything else, and they work best when they work least.
"I don't expect it to be drawn on more, but I think it's something that you put in place to have in the event that you get very volatile markets," said Paul Martin, the Finance Minister of Canada.

HEADLINE: THE 37th PRESIDENT: THE OVERVIEW;
Nixon Buried on Note of Praise and Reconciliation

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: YORBA LINDA, Calif., April 27

 BODY:
To the heroic strains of "Victory at Sea," the theme that comforted Richard Milhous Nixon through his darkest moments, the nation paid final tribute today to the former President who fascinated, confounded, infuriated and enthralled Americans for half a century.
Gov. Pete Wilson, who was an advance man for Mr. Nixon's 1962 California campaign for governor, said in his eulogy, "It's hard to imagine a world without Richard Nixon." Indeed, it was hard to imagine that there would be no more comebacks or reincarnations, no more new Nixons, same old Nixons or mellower Nixons. 
 President Clinton, a Democratic President who came of political age amid the scalding years of Watergate and Vietnam, urged Americans to let Mr. Nixon's Sisyphean penance earn him final forgiveness: "May the day of judging President Nixon on anything less than his entire life and career come to a close."
The four living former Presidents, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, and their wives looked on from the first row of seats at the first funeral for an American President since Lyndon B. Johnson's in 1973. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who early in her career worked as a lawyer for the House committee that investigated Watergate, was seated next to the President.
Mr. Nixon's coffin, covered with an American flag, rested on a catafalque during the funeral at the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace. The skies were lowering and gray.
Choking back tears during his eulogy, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said that despite the "gruff pose" of Mr. Nixon, he would have been delighted by the outpouring of concern and praise from friends and adversaries this last week, in what he termed "the culmination of an astonishing life."
President Clinton smiled and nodded in agreement.
Mr. Kissinger described Mr. Nixon as "one of the seminal Presidents" in his conduct of foreign policy. "He stood on pinnacles that dissolved in the precipice," he said. "He achieved greatly and he suffered deeply. But he never gave up. In his solitude he envisaged a new international order that would reduce lingering enmities, strengthen historic friendships and give new hope to mankind. A visionary dream and possibilities conjoined."
The Rev. Billy Graham said in his sermon to the 3,000 guests that Mr. Nixon had given his final wave and thumbs-up sign to his doctor in New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center after he was felled by a stroke as he was reading the galley proofs of his last book on foreign affairs.
"It was an example of fighting on and never giving up," Mr. Graham said of the man whose darker and better angels cast such a compelling shadow on the American character and consciousness.
The funeral was an oddly animated sort of "class reunion," as one former Nixon White House worker called it.
Peter Flanigan, an economic adviser to President Nixon, said to Clifford M. Hardin, who had been the Secretary of Agriculture, "It was a hell of a ride."
"The old man must be looking down and taking a delicious revenge," said Gen. Vernon A. Walters, a military aide in the Nixon White House, guessing that Mr. Nixon would have delighted in the adulation and lionizing of the last few days.
There, on the lawn in front of the bungalow where Mr. Nixon was born, people who had not seen one another for 20 years gathered to pay their respects before the burial following the service: aides who suffered with Mr. Nixon through the Watergate scandal and others who went to jail for their parts in it. There were secretaries from the Nixon White House press office, advance men for the 1960 campaign and old Hollywood cronies like Buddy Ebsen, Bob Hope and Red Skelton.
 
20 Years of Resentment
 Former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, who resigned in 1973 after pleading no contest to a charge of tax evasion, was swept up in the vivid mood of what some called reconciliation and others revisionism.
"I decided after 20 years of resentment to put it all aside," Mr. Agnew said before the ceremony began.
Through the eulogies, benedictions and homilies, the word "Watergate" was never mentioned. Even President Clinton only alluded to Mr. Nixon's "mistakes." Names that had faded into the scandalous past of Watergate were back: Herbert W. Kalmbach and Gordon C. Strachan and Charles W. Colson, the Nixon loyalists; and Elliot L. Richardson, the Attorney General who resigned in the Saturday Night Massacre.
Before the funeral began, the guests mingled happily, creating a living tableau of history. Adm. James B. Stockdale, the former prisoner of war in Vietnam who ran for Vice President on the Ross Perot ticket in 1992, rubbed shoulders with Farah Diba, the glamorous one-time empress of Iran. Former Vice President Dan Quayle walked past George McGovern, whom Mr. Nixon defeated in one of the great political landslides, in 1972. Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi Arabian financier, and G. Gordon Liddy, one of the overseers of the Watergate burglary, his head now shaved, were also there.
In his eulogy, Mr. Clinton quoted from Mr. Nixon's 1968 speech accepting the Republican nomination. He spoke of "the force of a driving dream" that had carried the former President from his humble beginnings here onto the world stage and added: "He made mistakes and they, like his accomplishments, are part of his life and record. But the enduring lesson of Richard Nixon is that he never gave up being part of the action and passion of the times."
He said that judging by their last phone conversation and the letter he had received from Mr. Nixon last month, he was sure that Mr. Nixon's "spirit was very much alive to the very end."
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, in beginning his eulogy, said he believed that "the second half of the 20th century will be known as the age of Nixon." The American people, he said, "love a fighter, and in Dick Nixon they found a gallant one."
He recalled that Mr. Nixon once told his daughter Julie, "I just get up every morning to confound my enemies." At that Julie, a few feet away, broke into a wide, delighted grin.
Senator Dole's voice cracked as he quoted Mr. Nixon as saying, "In the end what matters is that you have always lived life to the hilt." Right at the end, Senator Dole lost control and sobbed as he walked away from the lectern.
 
'Never Left California'
 Governor Wilson said, "Dick Nixon's heart, shaped by the grit and mores of this small town, never left California."
In the front row on one side sat the Nixon family, including daughters, Julie Nixon Eisenhower and Tricia Nixon Cox, their husbands and Mr. Nixon's grandchildren: Jennie Eisenhower, 15; Alex Richard Eisenhower, 13; Melanie Eisenhower, 9, and Christopher Nixon Cox, 15. His only surviving brother, Edward Calvert Nixon, 63, was there, too.
On the other side of the front row were the four former Presidents: Mr. Ford, who spoke of "our long national nightmare" as he succeeded the disgraced Mr. Nixon; Mr. Carter, whose candidacy to oust Mr. Ford was buoyed by American anger at Mr. Ford's pardon of Mr. Nixon; Mr. Reagan, whose national conventions viewed Mr. Nixon as a political albatross, and Mr. Bush, who as national chairman worked to put the Watergate legacy behind the Republican Party in the 1970's.
A total of 47 senators, 64 representatives and 11 former members of Congress made the journey from Washington today aboard Air Force One and five other Air Force planes.
On Air Force One, Mr. McGovern captured the ambiance, telling reporters: "My own career has been so intertwined with his that I really had the feeling that an old friend has left the scene. That may seem hard to believe in view of the bitterness of that 1972 campaign, but I made my peace with him years ago."
Mr. Nixon's black stone headstone in the garden, placed next to that of his wife, Pat, who died of lung cancer last year, used a quote from his first inaugural address: "The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker."
 
Sensing Love in the Heart
 Mrs. Nixon's headstone reads: "Even when people can't speak your language, they can tell when you have love in your heart."
A band from the Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro, Calif., and the United States Navy band Sea Chanters from Washington provided the music, including the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" and "America the Beautiful."
Joining Mr. Graham in officiating was Capt. William L. Perry, the Navy's chief of chaplains. Mr. Nixon served in the Navy in the Pacific during World War II.
At the end of the service, planes from the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill Air Force Base in Utah flew low over Yorba Linda in the missing-man formation. A 50-gun salute was fired by Marine howitzers from Camp Pendleton, near San Diego. Taps was sounded by a lone bugler, Paul Johnson, musician first-class of the Navy.
Two American flags that had covered the wooden coffin, folded into triangles so that the blue field and the white stars were on the outside, were presented by an Army officer to Tricia Cox and Julie Eisenhower. Mrs. Eisenhower wiped away tears with a tissue, and Edward Nixon broke down as the family left the service.
After the funeral, a reception was held in the rotunda of the Nixon library. The crowd quickly dispersed, many for dinner in the Los Angeles or Newport Beach area.

HEADLINE: Hata Named Prime Minister of a Shaky Japanese Government

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, April 28

 BODY:
After a two-day delay because of intense infighting, Tsutomu Hata was appointed Japan's 51st Prime Minister this morning by Emperor Akihito in a brief ceremony at the Imperial Palace, but he appears likely to head a weak and perhaps short-lived coalition Government.
Mr. Hata has tried but failed so far to mend his conservative party's rift with the Socialists, who quit the governing coalition in anger early Tuesday morning, depriving it of its majority in Parliament. The Socialists were furious after the conservative parties in the coalition, including Mr. Hata's, hastily joined together to resist any leftward turn in the Government's economic or security policies. 
 Thus, Japan appeared to be moving toward what many here have long dreaded, growing ideological strife and a minority government unable to deal firmly with the country's deep economic problems. Mr. Hata is Japan's sixth Prime Minister in a rocky five years of corruption scandals and a far-reaching political realignment.
Mr. Hata met this morning with Tomiichi Murayama, the head of the Socialists, but they were not able to achieve a reconciliation.
Later in the day Mr. Hata named his cabinet, putting a close ally, Hiroshi Kumagai, the outgoing Minister for International Trade and Industry, into the important job of cabinet secretary, which will make him the Government's spokesman.
Another critical post, Foreign Minister, was given to Koji Kakizawa, a conservative like Mr. Hata who recently defected from the Liberal Democratic Party. Mr. Kakizawa supports an idea the Socialists fiercely resist, Japan's participation in collective security arrangments, including use of its military in overseas peacekeeping operations.
In practical terms, the new Government, which controls just 181 seats in the 511-seat lower house of Parliament, is unlikely to be able to push through any bold legislation on the critical issues, like ending the recession, responding to American demands that Japan open its markets and reduce its trade surplus, and trying to halt North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program.
Japan begins a week of holidays Friday, after which the Parliament is expected to pass the overdue budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1. The Socialists helped draw it up and so are expected to support it.
After that, many experts have said, the prospect is for growing ideological strife and a quick election -- just before an important meeting of the Group of Seven industrial countries in July and a self-imposed deadline for producing a market-opening package for the Clinton Administration.
The parties underwent a day of bizarre maneuverings today, underscoring the state of flux after 38 years of one-party, conservative rule ended last summer.
The Socialists were wooed ardently by Mr. Hata, who reportedly told his allies: "It is indispensable for us to maintain unity with the Socialists. I will do my utmost to bring the party back into the fold."
The Socialists, however, insisted that the right-wing policies and authoritarian methods of Mr. Hata's key strategist, Ichiro Ozawa, made such a reunion impossible.
No sooner had the Socialists set out their stand than they met and agreed to work closely with the conservative party that was ousted last summer, the Liberal Democrats. It was an unconvincing alliance, but it underscored the bitterness of the rift.
"This is a case of, 'My enemy's enemy is my friend,' " said Asahiko Mihara, whose conservative faction is estranged from Mr. Ozawa.
Even if Mr. Hata, who is known as a conciliator, manages to lure the Socialists back with plum Cabinet assignments, few expect the marriage of convenience to last. If anything, the ideological divide in the Parliament is growing more pronounced. Both those on the far left and the far right are finding themselves increasingly isolated from the realignment of the parties toward the political center.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Proposes Opening Oil Industry to Private Investment

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, April 27

 BODY:
Breaking a 20-year taboo, Venezuela's new Government today proposed opening its oil industry, Latin America's largest, to private investment.
Oil "will no longer be an exclusive affair of the state," a new economic blueprint stated, reversing a nationalization policy adopted in the early 1970's. "We propose, therefore, that the oil sector be opened without limitations to private enterprise, national and foreign." 
 Turning to the state's second-largest area of economic activity, the Corporacion Venezuela de Guayana, the Government said that this steel and aluminum complex "should be opened without limits to private investment."
The proposals indicate a clear free-market direction for the new Government of President Rafael Caldera Rodriguez, a 78-year-old politician who was inaugurated in February and who campaigned on a vaguely populist platform.
"We aspire to a free and competitive economy," Mr. Caldera said, hours before the 17-page economic blueprint was released. "We will continue to privatize what is necessary."
Opening the oil sector to private investment would require congressional approval of changes in a 1975 law that created Venezuela's oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., as a state monopoly.
Business confidence was shaken by the resignation on Tuesday night of Ruth de Krivoy, an economist who had battled for two years to keep the Central Bank independent.
The resignation followed four months of bad economic news from Venezuela, the largest source of imported oil for the United States after Saudi Arabia. In quick succession, the nation's second largest bank, Banco Latino, failed in January, and then the price of Venezuela's oil slumped to $11 a barrel -- well below the forecast level of $15 a barrel.
With the Caldera Government sending conflicting signals about its economic policy direction, the first quarter saw new foreign investment drop by 30 percent and the nation's foreign reserves drop by 17 percent, to $10.5 billion.
"The country is going through its most severe financial crisis in history," said Pedro Palma, general manager of the office here of Booz, Allen & Hamilton, a management consulting firm. "The Banco Latino failure dragged along a lot of other banks. Today 40 percent of the financial system is in the hands of the state."
Today, in a concerted counterattack, economic officials outlined an orthodox free-market recovery plan.
In addition to cutting the budget by 10 percent, the fiscal deficit is to be eased through an aggressive privatization program. During the next year, the state is to sell an airline, hotels, thermo-electric power plants and racetracks.
Attacking a long sacrosanct state fiefdom, most of the Corporacion Venezuela de Guayana is to be converted into joint ventures controlled by private capital.
"Everything at Guayana, except for the mines, will go to mixed companies with private majority control," Julio Sosa Rodriguez, Venezuela's Finance Minister, said in an interview here today. Next Monday, Mr. Sosa, widely considered to be Venezuela's most powerful Cabinet member, is to explain the plan to foreign investors in Washington.
Today, in an address to international business executives here, Mr. Sosa pledged that the new Government "will open new spaces for private foreign and national capital investment, including mining, energy, petrochemicals, tourism, agriculture and financial services."
Although Mr. Caldera only controls about one quarter of the seats in Congress, he is expected to be able to implement much of the program. He has enjoyed public approval ratings of about 75 percent since his inauguration on Feb. 2. Last week, Congress passed a law that gives the President special powers for 30 days to push through tax and economic bills by decree.

HEADLINE: Doctor Convicted of Refusing to Give Aid

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

 BODY:
A doctor was convicted yesterday of refusing to admit a woman in labor to Harlem Hospital, forcing ambulance attendants to deliver her baby in the hospital's waiting room. A jury in State Supreme Court in Manhattan also found that the doctor later falsified hospital records to cover up his actions.
The doctor, Peter Anyakora, became the first physician to be prosecuted under a 1983 New York State law that bars hospitals from turning away a patient in an emergency, a practice commonly called dumping. 
 Edward J. Kuriansky, the New York State special prosecutor for medical fraud control, said that while civil lawsuits against hospitals are common in the 26 states that have laws against dumping, criminal prosecutions against an individual doctor are rare. Harlem Hospital was not named in the case.
The jury convicted Dr. Anyakora of turning away Charlesetta Brown early one morning in September 1991 when she was in an advanced stage of labor. Dr. Anyakora said the hospital was too crowded to take her. Emergency Medical Service workers were forced to deliver her son, Jeffrey, on a stretcher outside the hospital emergency room and to wrap him in a paper examination gown because no blankets were provided.
On a more serious charge, the jury convicted Dr. Anyakora of later falsifying business records and tampering with evidence to disguise his actions. Turning away a patient in an emergency is a misdemeanor, with a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $1,000 fine. But the tampering charges are felonies, and each carries a maximum of four years in prison. Mr. Kuriansky said that because the two felonies stem from the same event, Dr. Anyakora faces a combined maximum of five years in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Bernard J. Fried on July 12.
Dr. Anyakora argued that the Emergency Medical Service was notified that the hospital was overloaded with obstetrics patients and that new patients should have been diverted to other hospitals. Dr. Anyakora also said he had asked a nurse to attend to Ms. Brown because he was being called to treat another patient.
But Mr. Kuriansky said Dr. Anyakora's case was undermined by testimony from a hospital administrator that Dr. Anyakora had altered hospital records months later to make it look as though he had been called away to attend to a medical emergency with a patient who he said was in hypoglycemic shock. Among the clues to the alterations, Mr. Kuriansky said, was an incorrect date on a hospital form.
Dr. Anyakora, 35, was licensed to practice medicine in New York State in August 1991, when he began a one-year residency at Harlem Hospital, one month before the incident. He was the hospital's chief resident in obstetrics and gynecology.
In June 1992, five months after he was charged with criminal wrongdoing in the case, he left Harlem Hospital, where disciplinary action against him was delayed until after a resolution of the criminal charges against him.
While awaiting trial, Dr. Anyakora spent a year as a volunteer at the National Institute of Health outside Washington, was unemployed for another year and began working at a clinic in Avon Park, Fla., last November.
The convictions do not automatically bar him from medical practice, but Mr. Kuriansky said that the New York State Board of Professional Medical Conduct would be formally notified of the court's finding, as will Florida authorities, and each will review his case.
 
Unavailable for Comment
 Dr. Anyakora's lawyer, Robert Zatortski, did not reply to repeated telephone messages left at his home last night.
The anti-dumping law was intended, in large part, to prevent private hospitals from denying admission to patients who could not pay for their health care. Sponsored by former Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi of Queens, now the New York City Comptroller, the law was enacted in 1983 following a series of deaths of individuals brought to New York City Hospitals and denied admission.
John Ronches, executive director of the Committee of Interns and Residents, a union that represents the doctors at Harlem Hospital, said he thought it ironic that the law was first used instead against a doctor at a public hospital where the medical staff is badly overworked.
While Mr. Ronches said after the initial charges were made in 1992 that he felt Dr. Anyakora was being made a scapegoat for chronic problems at Harlem Hospital, he said yesterday that it would be inappropriate to comment in detail after the jury had made a decision.
 
Overloaded Hospital
 During the two-week trial, Mr. Zatortski pointed out that when Emergency Medical Service staff brought Ms. Brown to Harlem Hospital at 5:25 A.M. on Sept. 22, 1991, the hospital had already notified E.M.S. that it was too overloaded to accept new patients.
But the E.M.S. workers assisting Ms. Brown told the hospital staff that they had not been so informed, according to testimony, and pointed out that it was an emergency because Ms. Brown was bleeding and in an advanced stage of labor. The anti-dumping law specifies that E.M.S. workers can overrule instructions by hospital staff to go elsewhere if it is an emergency, prosecutors pointed out.
Ms. Brown testified that she had received prenatal care at Harlem Hospital and she was scheduled to deliver Jeffrey there. He was born in good health and a half-hour after the birth, both mother and baby were admitted to the hospital.

HEADLINE: Aiming at Cuomo, Pataki Starts TV Ads

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 27

 BODY:
Trying to prove he is the leading Republican gubernatorial candidate, State Senator George E. Pataki unveiled the first television commercials of the 1994 campaign today and aimed his fire directly at Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
In a pair of spartan 30-second advertisements, Mr. Pataki, 48, a fiscal conservative from Putnam County, blames Mr. Cuomo for a worsening state economy and a decline in public safety. Those are the two issues that polls say most concern New Yorkers. 
 In the commercial about crime, Mr. Pataki, a lawyer and farmer who is a former State Assemblyman, highlights Mr. Cuomo's annual veto of the death penalty and vows to restore it if elected. The ad about the economy charges that Mr. Cuomo raised taxes and state spending and points out that Mr. Pataki has voted against the state budget each year he has been in the Legislature.
 
Rivals for Nominations
 In both commercials, Mr. Pataki describes himself as a "conservative Republican," an apparent appeal to the Republican and Conservative Party advocates who will meet at party conventions in late May and early June. The ad is being broadcast primarily in Republican strongholds.
Mr. Pataki's need to stake out conservative ground is being driven by his competition for the Republican and Conservative nominations with Herbert London, who ran as the Conservative gubernatorial nominee in 1990. There now are four announced Republican candidates and a fifth, Evan G. Galbraith, is expected to declare his candidacy on Thursday.
Mr. Pataki hopes to emerge from the Republican and Conservative conventions with a front-runner's momentum. His advertising strategy seems intended to demonstrate the seriousness of his campaign and his willingness to take on Mr. Cuomo.
"I think the commercial proves that we've got a campaign that's up and running," said Robert H. Ryan, Mr. Pataki's campaign manager.
Mr. Ryan said the campaign would spend about $100,000 to broadcast the ads over the next few weeks. They will begin airing on Thursday on two cable channels on Long Island -- CNN and Channel 12 -- showing them 37 times between Thursday and Sunday, he said. The commercials then will be shown in selected upstate markets starting next week.
Mr. London, who has been battling Mr. Pataki for Republican leaders' endorsements, assessed his opponent's ad campaign as "an effort to establish legitimacy for a campaign that many people mock as a surrogate for Al D'Amato." Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato is backing Mr. Pataki and has pledged $400,000 of his own campaign funds to help him.
Mr. London does not plan radio or television ads before the conventions. But Morton B. Lawrence, a spokesman for Bill Green, a declared candidate, said Mr. Green, a former Congressman, might begin radio advertising in coming weeks. Mr. Cuomo has yet to start an ad campaign.
Mr. Pataki's ads state that "it's Mario Cuomo's fault" that "we're less safe than we used to be" and that "our economy is getting worse." But statistics do not fully bear out Mr. Pataki's claims. For instance, while the violent crime rate increased in New York from 1983, Mr. Cuomo's first year in office, to 1990, it decreased from 1990 to 1992.
Of Mr. Pataki's ads, Mr. Cuomo's campaign spokesman, Joel R. Benenson, said, "It sounds like Howard Stern without the road work." He was referring to the Mr. Stern's Libertarian platform to sign the death penalty into law, improve toll collections and require road construction to be done at night.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Photo: "THE AD CAMPAIGN: Race for Governor: Pataki Out of the Gate"
 
CANDIDATE -- George E. Pataki
 
PRODUCER -- Russo Marsh and Associates, Sacramento, Calif., and Alexandria, Va.
 
VISUAL -- The ad is deliberately simple, featuring a photograph of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo on the left and a photograph of Senator Pataki on the right. The script appears on the screen in white type as it is spoken by a narrator. The picture of Mr. Cuomo falls forward with a creaking thud as the narrator says, "It's time for a change."
 
THE SCRIPT -- "Mario Cuomo vs. George Pataki. Mario Cuomo raised taxes and state spending, driving out jobs. Senator George Pataki voted against Mario Cuomo's tax and spend budgets every time. Our economy is getting worse and it's Mario Cuomo's fault. It's time for a change. George Pataki is the conservative Republican who will defeat Mario Cuomo, cut taxes and reduce spending. George Pataki means jobs for New York. George Pataki for Governor."
 
ANALYSIS -- In his first ad, Mr. Pataki seems to be staking out conservative ground in the battle for support from the Republican and Conservative parties. In an effort to impress the party activists who will vote at the party conventions in late May and early June, the ads seek to demonstrate Mr. Pataki's seriousness as a candidate and his willingness to take on Mr. Cuomo. But Mr. Pataki's assertions that Mr. Cuomo raised taxes, drove out jobs and is to blame for a worsening economy are deceptive and incomplete.
Measured as a proportion of personal income, state taxes stayed virtually the same between 1982-83 ($74.40 per $1,000 in personal income, 14th among states) and 1991-92 ($74.21, 22d among states), according to the Census Bureau. Even when state and local taxes are combined, the burden has stayed about the same -- $153.49 per $1,000 in personal income in 1982-83 (3d among states) versus $151.54 in 1990-91 (2d among states). Some taxes, like those levied on businesses, cigarettes and petroleum have been raised by Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature, which has a Republican-controlled Senate. Others, like the personal income tax, have been cut significantly.
Mr. Pataki is correct that Mr. Cuomo raised state spending. New York's general fund budget increased from $17.5 billion in 1982-83 to $31.9 billion in 1993-94. But it is difficult to assess Mr. Cuomo's share of the culpability for "driving out jobs" during a nationwide recession. The state lost 517,000 jobs between 1989 and 1983, but has started to regain jobs slowly in the first three months of this year. And over the course of Mr. Cuomo's tenure, from 1983 to 1993, the state gained a net of 422,000 jobs. KEVIN SACK

HEADLINE: Christopher Asks Arab Lands To Extend the Iraqi Embargo

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, April 27

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to the Saudi capital today to rally several oil-producing gulf states behind extending the trade embargo against Iraq, seeking a counterweight to the growing number of countries who want to see the embargo eased.
With France and Russia pushing to ease the 32-month-old embargo, Mr. Christopher told the half-dozen Arab Foreign Ministers that maintaining the sanctions was vital to press Iraq to comply with United Nations resolutions calling on it to recognize Kuwait's borders and eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. 
 Mr. Christopher met with the Ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia and five other Arab states. "We join today with our gulf partners in unanimously and strongly expressing our common resolve to maintain the sanctions until Iraq complies fully," he said, referring to the United Nations resolutions.
 
Partial Lifting Is Urged
 The United Nations Security Council has imposed a trade embargo on Iraq, except for imports of food and medicine, until the Government of President Saddam Hussein takes several steps: recognizing Kuwait's borders, stop promoting terrorism, scrapping weapons of mass destruction and stop repressing its people.
Even though French and Russian officials concede that Baghdad still falls short in several of these areas, they are urging a partial lifting of the embargo, probably with regard to Iraq's oil exports. The reason is that they believe Iraq has made sufficient progress in eliminating its biological, chemical and nuclear threats. The Security Council is scheduled to debate the Iraq embargo in May.
According to Administration officials, the French want to ease the embargo because they see commercial opportunities in Iraq and want to ease the pain that Iraqis feel as a result of the sanctions. As for Russia, several officials said, it sees eventual export opportunities to Iraq and is eager to help Iraq repay some of its debts to Russia.
Explaining the purpose of Mr. Christopher's visit to Riyadh, a senior Administration official said, "Coming here was important because many of the countries thinking about easing the embargo are very sensitive to the attitudes of the gulf states."
 
A Joint News Conference
 Having seen Iraq invade Kuwait, the gulf states by in large remain hostile toward Baghdad, but they are not deaf to suggestions that the Iraqi embargo hurts their own economies as well as millions of innocent Iraqis.
In a joint news conference with the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, Mr. Christopher addressed these concerns, saying: "I want to send a message to the people of Iraq. We have no interest in prolonging your suffering. We would like to see a united and democratic Iraq resume its rightful place among the community of nations. The problem lies with the brutal regime in Baghdad."
A monitoring commission set up by the Security Council is scheduled to report on Thursday on Iraq's compliance with the United Nations resolutions. On Tuesday Iraq agreed with the Commission Chairman, Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, to speed up creation of an arms monitoring program, a move United Nations officials said was positive.
Prince Saud said Arab nations were examining the question of phasing out their boycott of Israel, saying they first wanted to see carried out the framework agreement of last September in which Israel promised to allow limited Palestinian autonomy in the occupied Gaza Strip and in Jericho in the West Bank. Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization are in intense talks to complete arrangements. Mr. Christopher is scheduled to meet in Cairo on Thursday with the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, and the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres.
 
Part of Boycott May Be Eased
 If the Arab countries are pleased with how Palestinian autonomy is carried out, a senior Administration official said, they might be prepared to end some aspects of the boycott, specifically ending the boycott of non-Israeli companies and their subsidiaries that do business with Israel.
At an airport news conference punctuated by thunder and lightning and a rare desert storm, Mr. Christopher said he met King Fahd for 75 minutes and they discussed the Mideast peace effort, the war in Bosnia and other topics.
Mr. Christopher used part of his session with the King to pursue President Clinton's favorite type of diplomacy: pocket book diplomacy. He urged King Fahd to award a contract of more than $4 billion to AT&T to modernize the over-stretched phone system in Saudi Arabia and add more than a million new phone lines.
On Tuesday, President Clinton sent King Fahd a letter, saying, "I hope AT&T, which has long been a market leader, will receive every opportunity to establish itself as Saudi Arabia's preferred partner, both for quality and cost."
AT&T is competing against other telecommunications giants, including Northern Telecom of Canada, Alcatel of France and Siemens of Germany.
In February, after an intensive sales pitch by numerous Cabinet secretaries reminding the Saudis of America's pivotal role in the Persian Gulf war, Saudi Arabia ordered $6 billion in passenger jets from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, which beat the European Airbus Industrie consortium in the competition.

MINNESOTA MINING & MFG. CO. (MMM,N)

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company said yesterday that first-quarter earnings fell 7.3 percent after it took a $35 million pretaxcharge to settle breast-implant litigation. The company reported net income of $306 million, or 72 cents a share. The earnings would have totaled about 77 cents a share without the charge. Per-share amounts reflect a 2-for-1 stock split last month.
Revenue rose 3.3 percent, to $3.632 billion. 
 Wall Street analysts had expected Minnesota Mining to earn 74 cents a share from operations, according to Zacks Investment Research.
Minnesota Mining, based in St. Paul, announced the litigation charge on April 11. It will contribute $325 million to a settlement fund in the next three years. The company has not made breast implants since 1984, when it sold McGhan Medical to the Inamed Corporation.
Minnesota Mining's products range from Post-It brand notepads and Scotch tape to sandpaper, computer floppy disks and laser imagers.
"Earnings were helped by a 6 percent gain in sales volume and by productivity improvement efforts," said Livio D. DeSimone, the chairman and chief executive. "However, economic softness in Europe and negative currency effects continued to hold back our earnings growth." (Bloomberg Business News)

HEADLINE: St. Pierre Journal;
A Seagirt Sliver of France Fears for Its Lifeline

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ST. PIERRE, St. Pierre and Mique lon

 BODY:
Twelve miles off Newfoundland's southern coast, a French official in a blue military shirt stamps passports "Port de St. Pierre," and Renaults and Citroens edge up the cobbled streets.
Early morning is fragrant with croissants and baguettes. Brasseries serve up mussels and skate fish wings, and the radio plays the chansons of the local Belle Riviere rock band. 
 France's last foothold in North America is a windswept archipelago of lichen-carpeted rocks, gnarled junipers and well-tended, brightly painted, hillside houses where 6,200 people live, most of them on the French public payroll.
The colony, roughly the size of New York City, consists of three main islands -- St. Pierre, the population and economic center, and Grande Miquelon and Petite Miquelon -- linked by a sandy isthmus. St. Pierre looks and sounds like a French village. The language has the soft lilt of Brittany or the Loire, and the residents identify with France, not Quebec.
Some 230 years after losing Canada, France lavishes upward of $25 million a year on the islanders to keep them happy.
In an earlier day of prosperity, the American Prohibition years of the 1920's, the islands were a center of bootleg liquor operations, and Al Capone frequented the waterfront cafes here. Now the colony lives off the French taxpayer.
The Government, which employs half the colony's working population, pays for electricity, water and medical services. Public employees -- from bureaucrats to the 40 gendarmes whose kepis are as distinctive as the flapping tricolor -- earn 1.6 times as much as their counterparts in France.
The state has spent millions of dollars on a cultural and sports center with an Olympic-size pool, gym, theater and art gallery. More millions have gone into the 1,000-seat hockey stadium.
The Culture Ministry flies in popular Paris singers and actors, sponsors exhibits by Parisian artists and bankrolls production of frothy boulevard comedies.
For most of April, the St. Pierrais savor white lies and amorous indiscretions in a chateau in Perigord, as depicted in the hoary comedy "J'y Suis . . . J'y Reste!" ("I'm Here . . . I'm Staying!"), with music by a 37-year-old local composer, Alain Lafitte.
Yet as they applaud their comedies, dine out in their brasseries and charge their peppy vehicles up and down the Place du General de Gaulle, many St. Pierrais wonder how long the good times will last.
For years, fishing had been an economic mainstay. An international moratorium on endangered stocks of cod and flounder two years ago ended employment for 400 of the local fishermen and 150 workers at the local fish processing plant -- a fifth of the working population.
Paris gives them generous unemployment assistance. But facing its own fiscal problems, Paris has decreed that it will end on May 31.
France keeps the islands as a symbol of past glories. President Charles de Gaulle, visiting St. Pierre in 1967, called the islands "the darling baby of mother France" and assured the St. Pierrais, "We will never abandon you."
It is nearly a quarter-century after de Gaulle's death. Now, whenever French Government officials visit St. Pierre, said Aurelien Claireaux, a local radio journalist, they are bombarded with questions about France's intentions. "They say there is no doubt about the long-term commitment to St. Pierre," he said, "but people are still nervous."
Albert Pen, Mayor of St. Pierre for 23 years and the region's Senator in Paris, predicts a "bad climate" unless new jobs can be found.
"People are used to a certain level of life," the 63-year-old politician said. "Take that away, and there will be trouble in the households."
To put some fishermen back to work, Paris has already approved about $35 million for a new and larger airport, which would employ about 60 people.
The Mayor thinks a casino would help, but the Bishop of St. Pierre and Miquelon, Francois Maurer, argues that a casino would introduce foreign criminal elements and be "disastrous." Most people doubt one will be built.
The Mayor and local businessmen are looking at other options, and they hope to attract foreign private investment by promoting the islands as a tax haven. "There are a number of opportunities, especially in developing new hotels," said Pierre Emmanuel Paturel, 64, a retired hotel owner and business consultant.
Jean-Claude Moraze, the grandson of one of Al Capone's trading partners, hopes to develop a swordfishing fleet, which would not be affected by the cod moratorium.
Many St. Pierrais fear that if the financial burdens get too great, France, preoccupied by events in Europe and demands at home, may cut its North American strings.
Didier Gil, the Algerian-born editor of a weekly newsletter, said: "They could cut us off tomorrow. Remember, our whole population could fit in one section of a soccer stadium in Paris."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Walt Disney Reinventing Itself

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 27

 BODY:
Widely considered the most successful entertainment enterprise in a decade, the Walt Disney Company, which once seemed to make money as effortlessly as Mickey Mouse waved his magic wand, does so no longer and has decided that it needs a change.
The makeover is already under way, engineered by Disney's chairman and chief executive, Michael D. Eisner, and its late president, Frank G. Wells, long before Mr. Wells's death in a helicopter accident this month. 
 Faced with a weak economy, declining profit growth, flops at the box office and troubles at its theme parks, notably the Euro Disneyland debacle in France, Disney needed a tuneup if it was to continue to sparkle.
"We were reinventing ourselves before Frank's death, but this tragedy has forced us to speed up the process," Mr. Eisner said in a recent interview at Disney's headquarters in Burbank. "I think you have to reinvent yourself almost every seven years or so, as businesses mature and situations change."
 
Foreign Markets a Focus
 Like other film studios and entertainment companies, Disney will focus on cultivating foreign markets, which represent the highest potential for growth, Mr. Eisner said. Reinventing Disney will also include exploring new technologies and expanding the responsibilities of the company's senior executives, many of whom will assume duties held by Mr. Wells, he continued.
Under Mr. Eisner and Mr. Wells, who were hired in 1984 to revive a languishing Disney, the company saw its annual revenue rise from $1.5 billion to $8.5 billion in a decade and its stock value increase 1,500 percent.
The growth was fueled by the rapid expansion of theme parks, resorts, retail stores and film and television production, but such remarkable gains are now proving harder to sustain than ever before, even with the magic of "Aladdin's" genie.
With Disney's revenues approaching $10 billion a year, and competition growing in the theme park and animation businesses, it will be far more difficult for the company to achieve the 20 percent annual earnings growth that management has projected over the next five years, industry analysts say.
"Walt Disney's success is based on a very simplistic approach: the filmed entertainment division comes up with new characters that are then used by the rest of the company to create a broader line of products," Christopher P. Dixon, an analyst for Paine Webber, said.
"But the big challenge of the 90's will be to take their brands and expand them into markets overseas and different venues," Mr. Dixon said.
That will involve the international expansion of the company's three major divisions: theme parks, filmed entertainment and consumer products. "During the first 10 years of this job we focused predominately on growing the domestic businesses," Mr. Eisner said. "Now we have to start over again in places like China and India and develop new products for these markets."
As an indication of how important international expansion is to Disney's future, Mr. Eisner said that "non-American born" executives would play a much more important role in the management of the company. "I think you will see names in our top management that are hard to pronounce as time goes on," he said.
Disney has already made significant headway in expanding its consumer products, publications, movies, videos and television programs in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America. Today, Disney has 16 offices serving 45 countries.
But Mr. Eisner's new international concentration comes after a disaster in Disney's most visible foray into Europe. From its inception, Euro Disney has lost money, hurt by Europe's recession and the company's misjudgments of European tastes.
Disney, which owns 49 percent of Euro Disney, banned alcohol at the park, offered visitors European food and fancy table settings, and expected them to patronize the hotels and gift shops. But many Europeans shunned the park or spent as little as possible there. As a result, Euro Disney lost nearly $1 billion in its first year and Disney's profit fell 63 percent.
Now Disney is allowing wine and beer to be sold, and the company has cut back the number of traditional restaurants while adding American-style fast-food operations. In addition, the company is offering some room discounts to attract visitors to the hotels.
"We know that Americans don't want us to open a French restaurant in New York or Los Angeles that serves a double patty cheeseburger, and that the French don't want us to come over there and do crepe, and the Germans don't want us to serve Knackwurst and Sauerkraut," Mr. Eisner said. "They want us to do what we do."
After Mr. Eisner threatened last year to close Euro Disney, creditors granted him a debt restructuring that will buy the project time to turn around.
"Maybe I am just stubbornly optimistic or arrogantly insensitive on the creative side," Mr. Eisner said, "but I think the park is the most fantastic product ever done by this company. A hundred years from now people will wonder how did this ever get built."
 
Additional Losses Seen
 Still, Euro Disney executives have said that they expect the park to post a loss this fiscal year, and that it will not show any significant revenue growth before 1996.
The theme park business is highly dependent on the health of world economies and consumer confidence. And with a weak economies in Europe and California, operating profit at Disney's theme parks in the first three months of this year fell 3 percent to $152.3 million, mainly because of a decline in overseas visitors to Walt Disney World in Florida and a drop in attendance at Disneyland after the California earthquake.
Judson C. Green, president Walt Disney Attractions, said that despite the recent declines, he expected overall park attendance and revenues to rise, ignited by the planned opening of new gates, rides and attractions. Still, Mr. Green said, Disney is cutting operating costs at the parks and aggressively pricing its hotels.
While no decision has yet been made, Mr. Green said that Disney was seriously considering building a theme park in the Far East, perhaps somewhere in the Pacific Rim. The company has also looked at building parks in Australia, South America and elsewhere in Europe, but "the politics and economics have to be right before we make a major move," Mr. Green said.
 
Consumer Produces Expanding
 Already, Disney's consumer products division, which oversees licensing, retailing, publishing and records, is expanding broadly throughout Europe, the Middle East, South America and Asia. Last year the division had operating income of $356 million, up 26 percent over the previous year.
A major contributor to the success of the consumer products division was the Disney stores, which sell everything from Mickey Mouse watches and Dopey cookie jars to Disney shirts, hats and jewelry.
Barton K. Boyd, president of Disney Consumer Products, said that there are 268 Disney stores, and the company plans to open at least 70 new stores a year. This year alone, Disney plans to open 100 stores in France, England, Germany, Spain, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and the United States. The Disney Store on the Champs-Elysees in Paris is the company's top grossing store.
"We are moving slowly and patiently to China," Mr. Boyd siad. "The grandparents remember the Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, and it won't take long before for their grandchildren to come to know them, too."
 
Gains From Film Division
 Despite numerous box-office flops in the past year, Disney's filmed entertainment division continues to post strong gains, buoyed by the popularity of Disney's animated features and robust home video sales, both domestically and overseas.
Disney Studios produces movies under three labels: Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone Pictures and Hollywood Pictures. Walt Disney Pictures produces animated features like "The Little Mermaid" and family-oriented features. Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures produce more mature films like "Pretty Woman" and "Sister Act."
Disney is expanding is presence in the international film and television market. Its animated films are a huge success overseas and have been translated into 25 languages. Disney's total box office last year was $644 million.
The company is also pursuing local programming partnerships. It has 35 Disney Clubs and other Disney programs that are broadcast internationally.
Disney's filmed entertainment division is still highly profitable, even though the studios have produced numerous movies of late that have been financial and critical disasters, leading to the removal this week of Ricardo Mestres as president of Hollywood Pictures. Hollywood had some box-office successes, like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" and "The Joy Luck Club," but the label had many more bombs, including "Blame It on the Bellboy," "Born Yesterday" and "Guilty as Sin."

HEADLINE: New York Area Braces for Onslaught of Visitors in June

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
An extraordinary conjunction of events -- World Cup soccer matches, the Olympic-style Gay Games and a sprawling 25th anniversary celebration of a gay-rights uprising -- is expected to bring vast throngs of visitors to New York City and northern New Jersey during nine days in late June.
If all goes as planned in the frenetic peak of June 18-26, organizers and public officials say, about 1.2 million people from across the nation and more than 60 countries will be housed, fed and moved in a logistical ballet that has been months in choreography, and there will be hoopla aplenty and a huge economic windfall for the region. 
 The events are the first three World Cup soccer games at the Meadowlands in New Jersey, the nine-day Gay Games IV and Cultural Festival in New York City, and Stonewall 25, a Manhattan march and rally commemorating a gay rebellion after a violent police raid in 1969 at Stonewall Inn, a Greenwich Village bar.
Organizers and public officials say the invasion of spectators, athletes and other participants could rival the crowds that gathered in and around New York for the Bicentennial in 1976 and Liberty Weekend in 1986, and could surpass those at national political conventions and other mass gatherings of the past.
While large gatherings have usually focused around a single site like Madison Square Garden or New York Harbor, the events in late June are far more complicated logistically.
Organizers of the Gay Games, for example, have arranged for more than 30 parks, gyms, pools, tennis courts, bowling alleys and other sites for their contests, accommodations for thousands of athletes and a festival of scores of entertainers and shows to take place on a Hudson River pier and on Randalls Island.
World Cup officials have had to arrange shuttle buses to take people from New York to the Meadowlands, accreditation and accommodations for 7,000 members of the news media, housing and meals for hundreds of athletes and their retinues, and hotels, parking and hospitality tents for thousands of fans.
 
Turning Life Askew
 Stonewall 25 organizers, city officials, the police and other agencies are still working out plans for Sunday, June 26, when more than 300,000 people are expected to clog major midtown thoroughfares as a gay and lesbian march moves from the United Nations to a rally in Central Park.
On that day and throughout the preceding week, the array of contests, concerts, parties, protests and ceremonies is expected to turn life askew in some parts of the city as crowds fill arenas, stadiums, hotels, restaurants, bars and transportation lines.
Problems exist. Some Greenwich Village residents are angry at the prospect of street closings, disrupted traffic, outdoor drinking, crowds, noise and litter. Concerns also have been voiced over AIDS, though the Clinton Administration has said the visitors would pose no public health threat and has waived a visa rule to let foreigners with the AIDS virus attend the Gay Games.
Moreover, the possibility of clashes between the police and gay protesters -- an ugly and embarrassing replay of the Stonewall riots of 1969 -- haunts the organizers and has prompted sensitivity training for the police. And negotiations involving organizers, the city and community groups continue on other issues, including the use of Yankee Stadium for closing ceremonies for the Gay Games.
But hotels say there are enough rooms for everyone, transportation officials say the logistics of moving people around are well in hand, and city officials and organizers who have planned for months say they expect the visiting legions to be wined, dined, entertained and protected without major disruptions.
And the officials and organizers estimate that the three events could generate more than $650 million in direct spending by visitors and spinoff economic activity, as well as publicity for tourism and big dollops of gay pride and civic boosterism.
"We're going to have a great many people and some very exciting days in New York," Fran Reiter, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Community Relations, who has coordinated city planning for the events, said in an interview. "It will be a celebration of what New York stands for -- the world's most diverse city."
Rich Altman, a spokesman for the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, said that many visitors will stay with friends or relatives and that despite a heavy demand for accommodations, many of the city's 58,000 rooms in 231 hotels are still available. "Our premise is that New York City is never sold out," he said
Not to be outdone, Bob Mulcahy, the chief executive of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, said that tens of thousands of visitors attending soccer games at the Meadowlands were taking accommodations west of the Hudson River, to be near the action.
 
New Jersey's 'Lion's Share'
 "A fair proportion will benefit New Jersey," Mr. Mulcahy said. "Many people will stay over here. In fact, I'd say New Jersey will receive the lion's share. This is the largest sporting event in the world and we're delighted to have a part of it."
Three of the seven matches to be played in June and July at Giants Stadium are scheduled within the span of the Gay Games: June 18 (Italy-Ireland), June 23 (Italy-Norway), and June 25 (Saudi Arabia-Morocco).
More than 500,000 visitors, many from Italy, Ireland and the other nations competing in the Meadowlands, are expected to attend the seven matches, said John Griffin, a World Cup spokesman. With sellout crowds of 76,000, more than 200,000 would be attending the first three matches in late June.
Eighty-two hotels in New York and northern New Jersey have been designated by World Cup '94 for the fans, but a survey by the Hotel Association of New York City last week showed that many rooms were still available in late June. And with many visitors staying with friends or relatives, even late bookers were expected to find rooms, though not always in the best locations.
Mr. Griffin said organizers had calculated that the New York-New Jersey area would reap $452 million in economic benefits from visitors attending the seven games, suggesting that the benefit from visitors attending the opening three games in late June would be nearly $200 million.
From June 18-25, more than 10,600 gay and lesbian athletes from 40 countries -- more than the number of athletes at the Barcelona Summer Olympics in 1992 -- are expected to compete in the Olympic-style Gay Games IV at parks, gyms and pools all over New York City.
 
Badminton to Water Polo
 Among the 31 sports are badminton, billiards, golf, ice hockey, judo, physique, power lifting, water polo and wrestling. Opening ceremonies are planned for Columbia University's Baker Field, but the organizers, with the support of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, are negotiating with George Steinbrenner for the use of Yankee Stadium for the closing ceremonies on June 25.
On June 26, the day after the games close, a festival of concerts, films, plays and other activities is expected to attract tens of thousands to a pier on the Hudson at 49th Street and to Randalls Island, the site of the track and field competitions.
Marlin Collingwood, a spokesman, said organizers expected 500,000 visitors, 100,000 of them from abroad.
Employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania, the headquarters of Gay Games IV and one of 30 hotels where rooms have been reserved for athletes and spectators, have expressed fears that some guests might carry the AIDS virus. But the Hotel Association and the hotel employees' union said there would be no need for additional training or new policies because there were no significant dangers.
In Greenwich Village the prospect of heavy street crowds has some people upset. Talks are under way between the city and community groups to close Christopher Street, from Seventh Avenue to West Street, on some evenings, and to let gay and lesbian bars set up sidewalk cafes.
Organizers and city officials are also said to be focusing on the often-volatile relationship between the police and homosexuals. Above all, both sides say, they want to avoid violent clashes like those that wracked Christopher Street in 1969 when the police raided Stonewall Inn.
"We've come a long way since the problems of 25 years ago," Ms. Reiter said. "The police are highly professional. They've worked closely with the gay and lesbian community on planning the Gay Pride Parade. The numbers this year will be bigger, but I don't expect any conflict."
Stonewall 25, the June 26 march and rally commemorating the clashes that were a turning point in the gay-rights movement, this year will take the place of the annual Gay Pride Parade, normally held in June.
Organizers say 300,000 to 400,000 people are expected to join the march starting about noon on the East Side and moving past the United Nations, west on 42d Street and north to a rally on the Great Lawn of Central Park. Dances, street fairs, worship services and other gatherings will also take place around town June 24-26.
While organizers gave varying estimates of the expected crowds, Ms. Reiter estimated that 1.2 million visitors would come to the city and would generate economic benefits of about $650 million.
"It's going to be very good for our city," Ms. Reiter said. "It will spotlight the city in the best way, as welcoming the world. These are the kinds of events we want to encourage -- they are good for our economy, good for our spirit, good for our soul."

HEADLINE: Pentagon Tests New Policy In Subsidizing an Industry

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
The White House's decision to subsidize the flat-panel computer display screen industry is an experiment in changing the Defense Department's relationship with commercial suppliers, Administration officials said today.
For two generations, the Defense Department has paid contractors to build special factories to make high-technology products not available commercially from American companies, like certain kinds of high-speed computer chips. But as foreign companies have won technological dominance in more and more industries, the Defense Department has been faced with a choice of buying from abroad or paying ever more money for goods from the small and often inefficient American factories. 
 In deciding to subsidize development of an American industry producing computer display screens in commercial quantities, the Defense Department is trying to pursue a third course. The hope of Administration officials is that bolstering a new industry will prove cheaper in the long run than making small purchases from special factories and will be better for national security than relying on foreign manufacturers, officials said.
Another rationale is that the Defense Department will also avoid becoming stuck with outmoded equipment from special factories, which tend not to modernize as quickly as commercial factories that must stay competitive or face bankruptcy.
Defense Department reliance on special factories for display screens would have been especially expensive, said an Administration official who insisted on anonymity. "It would have cost an arm and a leg, and the technology is changing so fast in the commercial sector that there's no guarantee that they were getting the latest," the official said.
The experiment with display screens, which the Administration said could be expanded to other industries if successful, ran into criticism from economists today, who said that it could set a bad precedent for encouraging high-technology companies to rely on Government money, and could undermine decades of American effort to win international restrictions on European government subsidies to companies there.
"It is a slippery slope -- the question is how much the President wants to slip down it," said Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia University economics professor.
By presenting the issue in terms of national security, the Administration has made it much more difficult to criticize the program, politicians and economists said today. The White House plan does not pass muster by conventional economic measures, said Robert J. Shapiro, a Democratic policy analyst.
But he quickly added, "I can't evaluate the national security policy aspects of it; it does make it a harder policy to evaluate."
The policy's goal of grabbing part of the world market from Japanese companies will further mute possible critics, said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat.
"Given the fact that it's the Japanese," he said, "I think it lessens the anxiety we might have -- if this were with Germany, we might have a different attitude."
The Administration strategy for helping the flat-panel display screen industry is unusually broad. The plan calls for the Defense and Energy Departments to provide most of the subsidies while the Commerce Department would provide overseas marketing assistance.
The Office of the United States Trade Representative would protest foreign barriers to American display screen exports; the Justice Department would keep track of any attempts by Japanese electronics corporations to squeeze out their small American rivals, and the National Economic Council would oversee the entire effort and encourage Government agencies to pool their display screen purchases and buy American.
 
Mainly in Laptops
 Advanced flat-panel displays are now used mainly in laptop computers and medical diagnostic equipment. But the Administration foresees their wide use soon in car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, and even portable maps for soldiers and travelers.
One of the biggest problems faced by the Administration in developing its new program was how to avoid violating international trade rules that ban commercial production subsidies. The answer was to provide research and development money as matching Federal grants for companies that undertake flat-panel display research and production, the same Administration official said.
For example, a company that spent $1 on research and invested another $1 in production equipment could receive a matching grant of $1 for further research, the official said. One goal of these subsidies is to prompt American companies to build four high-production factories, according to an interagency report.
But Mr. Bhagwati said that foreign countries could seek arbitration under existing international trade rules to challenge this approach. The rules ban research subsidies if the intent is to help companies' production, although proving intent can be difficult, Mr. Bhagwati said.

Trading Loss Lowers Profit For Procter

 BODY:
The Procter & Gamble Company, the country's largest maker of household goods and personal care products, said yesterday that its losses from interest-rate swaps pushed down earnings for its third quarter.
The company, based in Cincinnati, said earnings for the quarter ended March 31 slid 4 percent, falling to $482 million from $502 million in the comparable period a year ago. The current figure includes an after-tax charge of $102 million, announced earlier this month, for the trading losses. 
 Interest-rate swaps are among so-called derivatives that companies can use to hedge against sharp market fluctuations or even attempt to profit from them. The investments are called derivatives because they are based on, or derive from, the performance of an underlying asset, like interest rates or stocks.
Without the charge, profits would have improved by 16.3 percent for the quarter. "Pretax operating profit was up 20 percent versus January-March a year ago," the chairman and chief executive of P.& G., Edwin L. Artzt, said in a statement. "This improvement reflects our cost reduction programs along with solid unit volume gains in the U.S. and a continued double-digit volume growth rate in our international operations."
One P.& G. stockholder apparently did not share Mr. Artzt's enthusiasm. On Monday, Elaine Drage of Cleveland sued the company in the Hamilton County Common Pleas court, an Ohio state court, charging that company executives should repay the $102 million charge.
Excluding the after-tax charge, the results for the quarter showed that net sales had risen by 1.2 percent, to $7.4 billion, and net earnings per share rose by 16.7 percent, to 77 cents.

c-Included a charge of $1.125 billion, or $1.65 a share. Income before the charge was $1.688 billion, or $2.37 a share.
The company said that the year-ago periods are as published in the annual report, which included a restatement of the originally published July to March earnings. The restatement reflected the impact of retroactively adopting two accounting standards, for post-retirement health care and insurance benefits, and for income taxes.

HEADLINE: Dollar Falters Against Yen on Political Turmoil in Japan

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday to four-week lows against the Japanese yen and the German mark amid persistent concern that political turmoil in Japan would prolong the country's trade dispute with the United States.
Trading was less active than normal because many traders in New York took the day off. The stock, bond and commodities markets in the United States were closed in memory of former President Richard M. Nixon, who died on Friday. 
 "The dollar took a beating on light volume," Jack Stapleton, senior corporate dealer at Standard Chartered Bank, said. "There's still a lot of nervousness about Japan."
The Socialist Party bolted from Japan's coalition Government on Monday, raising concern about whether Prime Minister Tsutomo Hata can command a majority in Parliament and restart trade talks with the United States.
"The more political discord there is in Japan, the stronger the yen will be," David De Rosa, director of foreign-exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation, said. "The only thing that will drive the dollar higher is a resolution of the trade issues."
Without progress on trade, the Clinton Administration is considered more likely to resume calls for a strong yen to curb Japan's trade surplus by making the country's exports more costly.
 
Dollar at 102.35 Yen in New York
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 102.35 yen, its lowest level since March 31, down from 102.80 yen on Tuesday. The dollar also fell to 1.6710 marks, also a four-week low, down from 1.6770 marks.
Japan's central bank bought dollars for yen during much of the Tokyo session, traders there said. The Bank of Japan often buys dollars to try to slow the yen's climb, many times to no avail.
Losses against the yen helped drive the dollar lower against the mark and other currencies, traders said. Frustration with the dollar's inability to rise, even when economic reports and interest-rate changes favor it, also weighed on the currency.
Many traders had expected the dollar to gain in the first quarter of this year as American interest rates rose and German rates fell. Higher American rates usually make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors, bolstering demand for the currency. Instead, the dollar fell 4 percent against the mark and 8 percent against the yen since Jan. 1.
The dollar failed to rise against the mark yesterday, even though Germany's central bank lowered a short-term interest.
Elsewhere, the British pound rose to a three-month high of $1.5105 yesterday, before falling amid speculation that the Bank of England was selling pounds. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.5060, little changed from $1.5055 on Tuesday.
The dollar also fell in New York to 5.7395 French francs yesterday from 5.7556 francs on Tuesday and weakened to 1.4257 Swiss francs from 1.4301 francs. And it dropped to 1,608 Italian lire from 1,614 lire. The Canadian dollar fell to 72.67 United States cents from 72.82 cents.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A small health care company seeks its fortune in New York.

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim 

 BODY:
PHYSICIANS Health Services, a managed health care company with a cash hoard of $115 million and a strong base in Connecticut, would like to play with the big boys in the rapidly expanding New York market for managed care.
Although only five analysts follow the company, they all recommend it. The stock price went from a low of $12 in February of last year to $27.50 last month in Nasdaq trading. It fell to $22.25 in the stock market slide of March and early April but has bounced backed, closing at $25.33 on Tuesday. (The stock market was closed yesterday for former President Richard M. Nixon's funeral.) 
 The company, which was taken public last year by Dillon, Read and Smith Barney Shearson, said in March that it was seeking regulatory approval to operate health maintenance organizations in New York City and Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island. It is already in Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange and Dutchess counties.
Employers typically pay a set amount in advance to buy coverage from a health maintenance organization and offer financial incentives to employees who patronize the H.M.O. doctors.
Enrollment in all health maintenance organizations in the New York metropolitan area increased by 20 percent, to 1.5 million, in the nine months ending Jan. 1, according to the New York State H.M.O. Council, a trade group. The council said that 18.3 percent of the population was in H.M.O.'s, up from 15.1 percent a year ago.
Despite the surge in H.M.O membership, there is still plenty of room for growth. In market share, New York H.M.O.'s still lag far behind the West Coast and upper Midwest, not to mention Rochester, where close to 65 percent of the population is in H.M.O.'s.
"It could be a real sleeper in the H.M.O. group," Michael M. LeConey a health care analyst at RAS Securities, said of Physicians Health Services, which is based in Trumbull, Conn., and has about 170,000 enrollees. He recommended the stock in a report on Northeast region H.M.O.'s, along with better-known, larger companies, including U.S. Healthcare and Oxford Health Plans.
Art Winston, a money manager at Glickenhaus & Company, an investment management firm that owns Physicians Health Services shares, said the company was well managed and "relatively cheap," compared with the other H.M.O. stocks. He sees it as a natural takeover candidate for a larger managed care insurer entering southern Connecticut, where Physicians Health Services has contracts with a number of blue chip companies.
Not just any merger partner would be acceptable, however, because the Connecticut company is controlled by its physician-founders. "That eliminates a takeover by any H.M.O. with a reputation for being tough on doctors," said Robert M. Mains at First Albany Securities.
For investors, the company's doctor-owners are both an asset and a liability. On the plus side, they are credited with maintaining high quality, which has kept patients happy. The New York State Insurance Department reported that no complaints against the company were found to be valid last year, one of the best records in the state.
But some doctors have also been slow to bring costs down, reflecting the conflict between going all out on the patient's behalf and restraining costs to please the payer. In a recent contract it signed with Pitney Bowes, certain Physicians Health Services doctors were excluded because they were deemed too expensive by the client company.
"The downside for Physicians Health Services is that it is a doctor-owned and doctor-controlled H.M.O.," Mr. LeConey of RAS Securities said. "The risk always is that the doctors have enough influence to maximize reimbursement to themselves." But he thinks that growing competition "is going to finally force economic reality onto the Connecticut physician community," including the doctors at Physician Health Services.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Xerox Earnings Come In at Low End

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation reported first-quarter earnings yesterday that were at the low end of analysts' expectations.
The company, based in Stamford, Conn., said it had earned $129 million, or $1.05 a share, compared with $189 million, or $1.77 a share, in the comparable period a year ago. 
 Analysts had predicted earnings of $1.04 to $1.25 a share.
But the year-to-year comparisons were skewed by the company's decision to get out of the financial services business and by its sale of 8.1 million shares of stock last June.
In its core document-processing business, Xerox said, it earned $131 million, an increase of 5 percent from last year, but last year's figure was inflated by a one-time tax credit of $17 million. Earnings per share were $1.07, compared with $1.12. The decline was caused by an increase of 10 percent in the number of shares outstanding.
 
Productivity Improvements
 Xerox's chairman, Paul A. Allaire, said, "The increased income in the first quarter was due to significant productivity improvements and strong growth in equipment sales."
With stock markets closed, Xerox's stock did not trade yesterday. It closed on Tuesday at $96.625, up $1.875.
The company said that it had reduced its document-processing work force by 4,200 people worldwide during the quarter through attrition and restructuring and that by early 1996 it would have cut 10,000 workers and closed some operations.
Sales of copiers and other document-processing products increased by 1 percent, to $3.271 billion, including the effect of currency exchange. Adjusting for currency rates, revenues increased by 5 percent in the quarter, the company said.
 
Brazilian Inflation a Factor
 The main cause of the currency exchange adjustment, the company said, was its subsidiary in Brazil, where inflation is about 40 percent a month, compared with 25 percent a month a year ago. This produced a currency translation loss of $61 million in the quarter, compared with $23 million in the comparable period a year ago.
The company said its insurance group, Talegen Holdings Inc., had increased earnings to $37 million, from $16 million, despite losses caused by the earthquake in Southern California in January. The company is one of the few financial services that Xerox still operates, but Mr. Allaire said that "we are currently holding discussions with a number of parties interested in the Talegen insurance groups."
Revenues from the sale of advanced digital products increased by 21 percent during the quarter, and they now represent 19 percent of Xerox's total revenues.
Mr. Allaire said the company was continuing to make "significant" investments in new technology, and he noted last week's announcement of software that would connect computer terminals with digital copiers anywhere.

RN Off the Record

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: YORBA LINDA, Calif.

 BODY:
"Guns are an abomination," said Richard Nixon in one of our long talks last year. He added, "You can use that now."
Which I did in a column. The "now" referred to an agreement between my old boss and me: Some of what he said was for immediate quotation, some for private instruction, and the rest to be made public at my discretion "someday" -- by which he meant any time after the ceremony yesterday at which he joined the real Silent Majority. 
 Much of his strategic thinking will be available next month in his last book, "Beyond Peace." But here is Nixon as one admirer had a chance to see him, tossing off aphorisms with candor and purpose ("Bull sessions produce only what bulls produce").
On recent Russian leaders, preceding his last mission to Moscow: "Yeltsin is at his best in a crisis, just as Gorbachev was at his worst in a crisis. We stayed too long with Gorbachev; we mustn't stay too long with Yeltsin. We need contact with the opposition, and Yeltsin won't like it."
Specifically about Yeltsin: "He has bouts of depression, and takes medication for his back problem, like Woodrow Wilson. His close buddies are not very impressive. He feels the army didn't move quickly enough in the coup attempt against him." (Long pause.) "He'll trust only a few people, and will think only those who support him 100 percent are his friends." (I said I knew somebody like that once, and Nixon gave his short bark of a laugh.)
"I gave Clinton an evaluation of Yeltsin: not hard to read, straight out, refreshing, charismatic. But lacks experience in free-market economics, let alone running a democratic republic."
On the Mideast: "I have great respect for Rabin, but I didn't want to go to the dog and pony show on the White House lawn. I told him later that it takes a strong man to make peace; he's able to do what he's doing because Arafat is weak, and far worse than Arafat is waiting in the wings. Paul Johnson had a line that statesmen must differentiate between different degrees of evil."
On Bosnia: " 'Assertive multilateralism' is nonsense. De Gaulle said to Malraux: 'Parliaments can paralyze policy; they cannot make policy.' We need to get out of the arms embargo to get to a correlation of forces that can make peace. I'm more hawkish than Bush or Clinton on this. For now, say I'm more hawkish than Bush; I don't want to lose my effectiveness in foreign affairs."
On the foreign-policy Clinton (whose eulogy was unstinting and eloquent): "Foreign affairs is not a winner for him. He should play to his strength: try to keep the Nafta coalition together, throw the McGovern ites over the side. The left won't start a third party, and there's a big center out there. For the Republicans' sake, I hope he doesn't, but that's what he should do."
On the domestic Clinton: "I told him [a year ago] I gave him credit for a bold program. A leader tells people not where they want to go, but where they ought to go. That's from Burke. Clinton reminded me that with wage and price controls, I did something bold. Yeah, but it was a mistake." Nixon reminded me: "You wrote that speech, don't forget."
On China and M.F.N.: "What gets me is the old China hands who got all excited when I went to China, and who are now anti-China because there's no political freedom. Sure our goal is for democratic government that protects human rights, but it's economic freedom that spells doom for any closed society. M.F.N. is a blunderbuss; we shouldn't use that."
On the Chinese leadership: "Jiang Zemin impresses Americans because he can recite parts of the Gettysburg Address in English; State overestimates him. Li Peng is ruthless, intelligent, wants to turn back the clock, and in a struggle after Deng's death, would have Jiang Zemin for lunch. Zhu Rongji is totally committed to economic reforms, and politically -- as he demonstrated as Mayor of Shanghai -- as reasonable as can be and still be a leader. I'd bet on Zhu; he's China's best hope."
His deep-background handicapping of the 1996 Republican field must await another day.
RN's farewell, as he accompanied me to the door: "We have to build a society that the world can continue to admire. That's the message I would like to leave for the kids."

HEADLINE: KIPS BAY A TOUR;
And to the Left, Is the Niche For Fifi . . .

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN 

 BODY:
LADIES and gentlemen (but please, no children under 6), welcome to the 1994 Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club Decorator Show House. And what a show house it is! The Sara Delano Roosevelt House on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, spiffed up by 14 interior design firms, 5 decorative painters and a floral designer.
Please note that on this tour items of great interest have been identified with numbers. And if at any time you wish to go back and review the commentary on what you have seen, there is no need to press the rewind button. Simply read the paragraph over again. 
 As you may know, Kips Bay is the doyenne of show houses, now in its 22d year. If interior decorating is your delectation, you are in your element.
The Kips Bay Show House, at 47 and 49 East 65th Street, which opened on Tuesday and continues to May 15, is as important a bellwether as ever -- despite the beating the interior design profession has been taking for the last few years.
The loss of a generation of talented designers to AIDS, the sagging economy, the "I can-do-it-just-as-well-myself" syndrome as well as the rush to flea markets, auctions and discount designer outlets should have made upscale, over-the-top decorating extinct.
Yet, talented designers can still excite and inspire. The show house is their stage, whether it is Paul Siskin's wonderfully intriguing study for a psychiatrist (1), or Ronald Bricke's fairytale master bedroom, where a bed's canopy is equipped with a little high-tech magic (2). But first it's time to face the neo-Georgian facade of the five-story double town house that was built in 1907-1908 by Charles Platt for Sara Delano Roosevelt. Hidden behind the single facade are actually two separate houses: Mrs. Roosevelt occupied half the house and gave other to her son, Franklin, and his wife, Eleanore.
Before going inside, take a minute or so to appreciate the bravura of Ronaldo Maia's suspended boat-shaped planters overflowing with ferns, ivies and apple-blossom branches in full flower.
Pass under the tapestry canopy and proceed past Lina Fransioli's mural panels in the entrance, hung to look like frescoes. Proceed up the steps and turn left into House 47, Mrs. Roosevelt-mere's residence -- and into the first room on the tour, the great hall. It has been decorated in a mannered "Age of Innocence" vein by a Kips Bay newcomer, Anthony Antine, of Palisades, N.J. Noting the tortoise-shell knickknacks on the table and enveloped by the gold and red damask that was woven in Scotland from a Russian design, and used here on the walls and upholstery, and turned inside out on the draperies, let yourself imagine for a moment that you are waiting to be summoned upstairs by Mrs. Manson Mingott. Stop at the spot where the parquet has been painted in a star pattern and buy a $15 ticket that benefits the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club, an after-school program in the South Bronx.
Proceed toward the curved staircase, passing the Kips Treasure Chest, a boutique of donated items (there will be plenty of time to shop later) and at the top of the stair you will reach our next stop, the Sara Delano Roosevelt library, decorated by Noel Jeffrey.
Let's pause on the threshold of the paneled room that represents a new look for Mr. Jeffrey, a designer show house regular best known for his extravagant efforts. Mr. Jeffrey has taken what he said was "a more casual approach," and "played the whole thing down."
But everything is relative. The furniture, it turns out, is what top-flight decorators call "FFF." That's Fine French Furniture, or, as Mr. Jeffrey put it, "Jacob, Jacob, Jacob," for the 18th-century maitre menuisier, Georges Jacob, the master craftsman of the Louis XVI and Empire styles.
On the left, please note -- though it's hard to miss -- the surprisingly pastel-hued, nine-foot-high celadon leather screen that rises majestically behind the toile-covered sofa. "This is my statement of traditional decorating at this time," Mr. Jeffrey said. "Comfortable, simple and nothing to be afraid of."
Turning around, you pass Bert Westman's brooms on the wall, painted with an array of faux finishes. Yes, leopard is an option.
Now, please pause, for un petit moment, on the threshold of the luminous double drawing room that spans the two houses (mother-in-law was known to come through unexpectedly and rearrange the new bride's furniture on occasion). Today it is under Mariette Himes Gomez's elegant tutelage (3) and has been transformed into a cool, airy arbor with tastefully color-coded objets d'art and textured fabrics that range from pale green to toast.
Matching fireplaces face each other across a wide expanse that has been adroitly furnished with antique Italian consoles, English lanterns, a giant Georgian partner's desk, and a huge muted Savonnerie rug -- restrained by decorator standards.
You may want to take a minute to think about how you can adapt Ms. Gomez's clever window treatment in your own pied-a-terre: tall panels of pale chartreuse-and-white striped fabric looped over brass rods that swing open like translucent fabric shutters. Now turn around and continue up the stairs to the third floor and Scott Salvator and Michael Zabriskie's fabric-swathed guest bedroom (4), with charming twin headboards with arms like an armchair. (2)
"Don't you love them? They're beds that you can sit up and read in," Mr. Salvator informs us.
But please don't leave without noting the small side table, carved in a shell design. Mr. Salvator tells us that this is the last of its kind. "None of the other younger designers remember these things," Mr. Salvator, 34, said. . "You have to be 30 going on 60 to appreciate it."
Our tour continues across the hall, past Michael Tyson Murphy's trompe l'oeil chest in marquetry, in a sitting room designed by Dennis Rolland. . Raise your eyes to the all-grey ceiling painted with graphite -- the material of pencil fame. Before leaving Mr. Rolland's room, envy the remarkable shell-encrusted heads on the bookcase at left. (5)
Our next stop up the stairs on the left is Mr. Siskin's study for a psychiatrist (1). Tension and poetry are in the air. A clock ticks loudly. Mr. Siskin calls his room "It's about time." Not only does this seem to be a reference to the loss of his partner, Perucho Valls, who died last year, but to the strength of his solo performance. With your senses thus heightened, look around the sober, eloquent room that is the most evocative in the house.
Don't leave before admiring the fake leather bookshelves studded with nailheads on your left, or the voluminous one-armed couch, or the natural sisal trimmed with a black band on one side, or the huge rusted roman-numeral clock face.
"If Freud moved to the Upper East Side, this is what his office would look like," Mr. Siskin whispers.
Try and touch the tray of moss plants on the ottoman. It's strangely therapeutic.
Now it's time to walk past Robert Jackson's new murals depicting what he says is "a villa near Lucca, or Montecito, or Greenwich" -- you choose -- to reach Eric Cohler's combination library and kitchen, full of take-out ideas (6). To your right, look for the striped wallpaper-covered refrigerator and the dual wall-hung television sets, one tuned to recipes, the other to a soap opera. The fireplace filled with baguettes masquerading as logs is, as they say, interesting. I urge you to glance at the kitchen cabinetry. A niche provides a spot for a dog bed.
We move on through the door at left, to house 49 -- and walk into atherine Stephens' cozy, red plaid family room and across the landing to Gerald Tolomeo's library and conservatory. You must look up and marvel at a three-dimensional trellis below a painted blue sky (7) decorated with papier mache and painted leaves made by Donna Holsten.
Proceeding down the stairs you will come face to face with Ronald Bricke's bedroom (2), a triumph of style in charcoal and white. Be sure to see the demonstration of the small screen that drops from a canopy, made of bits of baroque molding (the projection TV is concealed at the other end). Do give the draperies -- more like bunches of white fabric knotted into ponytails by Mr. Bricke himself, their 15 seconds of attention. You are now on the fourth floor of House 49 and passing tall cabinets "woodgrained" by Philip Traina. Soon, you are across the hall, basking in the aubergine aura of Billy Francis's sitting room (8). The velvet on the walls has been graffaged, not flocked as we thought, "embossed with hot steam and copper pipes," Mr. Francis said. Before leaving this elegant, cozy lair, stop and smell the roses. They're palpably Zeze's finest.
Then it's down the stairs to Tom O' Toole's library (9), this one named for F.D.R. and all-American neo-classical, the decorating style for these sober times.Covet the folk art ships, grouped around the fireplace to your left, that were hand-carried from a Madison Avenue gallery a few blocks away.
Charlotte Moss's tented sepia boudoir beckons across the landing. Perhaps it's the sight of Madame de Pompadour's 18th century gowns in the closet. Or the lovebirds singing on the toile-de-Jouy.
Our tour continues down the stairs. Just when you would expect a grand finale, you come upon Robert Metzger's out of character, new-for-him Art Deco look (10): "Straight lines. No frills, no fluff," he said. But still plenty of glitz: black and white striped armchairs, an antique Chinese rug and a cache of lamps and armchairs that are Parisian in provenance.
Our tour ends here. But your decorating doesn't need to. Be sure to take home the Designer's Sources pamphlet. It makes great bedside reading.
Goodbye and thank you for joining us. See you next year.

HEADLINE: A War-Weary Serbia Dares to Hope

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, April 27

 BODY:
The spring weather is splendid in Serbia's capital, and as residents stroll through parks and sip coffee in downtown cafes, they dare to hope that the war in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina may finally be approaching an end.
With the threat of NATO bombing raids against Serbian positions near the Bosnian town of Gorazde now apparently lifted, and with foreign powers launching a new negotiating push, many Serbs here feel an unaccustomed optimism. 
 "Now the world is going to put pressure on all three sides, and that means peace is possible," said a middle-aged engineer as he waited for a streetcar. "I feel more positive than I have in a long time."
The engineer is evidently not alone. In a survey of 500 Belgrade households taken recently by a local bank, 77 percent of respondents said they believed next year would be better or much better than this year.
 
Shared Sense of Hope
 Foreign diplomats and Serbian political observers share the mood of hope that has settled over Belgrade. Some believe that prospects for a peace settlement in Bosnia may be closer than at any time since the war began more than two years ago.
But while it is widely agreed here that the principal Serbian leader, the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, is ready to press his longtime allies in Bosnia to negotiate seriously, two major questions remain. No one is certain how much influence Mr. Milosevic has over the notoriously independent Bosnian Serbs, nor can anyone guess whether the Clinton Administration is ready to insist that the Muslim-dominated Government in Sarajevo accept its military defeat and agree to a negotiated settlement.
Among factors leading analysts in Belgrade toward optimism are the growing war-weariness in Serbia, the increasing willingness of Russia to pressure its Bosnian Serb allies, and the formation this week of a "contact group" that is intended to coordinate Russian, American and European negotiating positions.
"Forming the contact group was a very important step, because it means that the three warring factions can no longer play one group of negotiators against another," said the chief of a European diplomatic mission here. "It is going to concentrate the minds of all parties."
 
A Change in Approach
 Signs of a softening in Serbia's position are visible on Government-controlled television broadcasts from Belgrade. Reports on the Bosnian war here no longer portray Croats as bent on repeating the massacres of Serbs they perpetrated in World War II, nor do they depict Muslims as fanatic mujahedeen intent on establishing a fundamentalist Islamic state on Serbia's borders.
Television reports have also begun portraying Bosnian Serb leaders, particularly Gen. Ratko Mladic, as ambivalent figures rather than as heroic defenders of Serbian nationalism.
"Serbs in Serbia no longer perceive the Bosnian Serbs as victims," said Predrag Simic, director of the Institute of International Politics and Economics, a research center whose clients include government agencies. "How can you have compassion for people like General Mladic and others? They are not people to pity. More and more, we see them as people who involve us in trouble. Antiwar feeling here is very strong now."
The era of hope in Belgrade has also been fed by a remarkable currency reform that has brought the annualized inflation rate down from a world record of 116 trillion percent, as computed by foreign diplomats in January, to zero. This was done by introducing a new currency tied directly to the German mark.
 
Hoarding of Goods Stops
 Encouraged by the newly stable currency, people have stopped hoarding goods, and items long withheld from the market are now appearing again. Smugglers also have new incentives to challenge the United Nations trade embargo on Serbia, and not only are luxuries like Scotch whisky, Swiss chocolates, French perfume and American power tools available, but people seem to have enough money to buy them.
The currency reform has also calmed social unrest that rose precipitously last winter. Laborers who launched a series of strikes are now quiet, and pensioners, who form a key bloc of support for the Government, now are once again receiving their benefits in money that has value.
Economists and ordinary citizens alike, however, understand that this improvement is only temporary. The new currency will remain stable only as long as the Government can back it with convertible reserves, and that will probably be only a few more months. If the Government has not managed to make progress toward lifting United Nations sanctions by then, the inflationary spiral will start again, and public anger at the Milosevic Government will rise as the value of the "new dinar" falls.
"It was a very clever trick, but nobody believes it can last past the summer," said a foreign resident of Belgrade who tracks the economy closely. "Milosevic is desperate to have the sanctions lifted. People's anger at the prospect of another winter of misery could blow him away, or at least confront him with enough discontent that he would be forced to go to a full dictatorship. He is already telling the Serbs in Bosnia that they better negotiate seriously this time around."
 
The Muslims' Attitude
 What no one here can gauge, however, is whether the increasingly self-confident Bosnian Serb leadership will respond to pressure from Moscow and Belgrade.
But even if the Bosnian Serbs can be persuaded to negotiate seriously after two years of mendacity, it is uncertain that their Muslim enemies will do so. As long as the Muslim-dominated Government in Sarajevo believes there is a prospect that the outside world, and particularly the United States, will come to its rescue if it holds out long enough, it seems unlikely to make compromises necessary for peace.
"At the end of the day, it comes down to how much pressure the Americans are willing to put on the Muslims," a foreign diplomat aid. "If the Muslims think they still have a chance of sucking the West into this, there is no incentive for them to go for the plan on offer."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the mood in Belgrade misidentified Slobodan Milosevic. He is the President of the Serbian republic, not the Yugoslav federation, which also includes the republic of Montenegro.

Baltimore Plays Connect-the-Attractions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL McDONOUGH 

 BODY:
Maybe it's the recession and the lack of toothsome commissions. Or the absence of a compelling new theory since deconstruction. Whatever the case, architects and designers seem to be getting comfortable with history again. Examples of "new but old" style -- contemporary with a retro twist -- abound. What might be mistaken for a look backward could be the beginning of something new.
SITE PROJECTS INC., a New York-based arts and architecture firm, is working with Anshen & Allen Inc., architects and planners, to improve the connection between Baltimore's restored but struggling Market Place buildings and its thriving Inner Harbor core. "The Maryland Science Center, the National Aquarium, the shops near the water are very successful," said Ed Hord, the managing partner of Anshen & Allen's Baltimore office. "But people have not wandered up the three blocks of Market Place, and businesses there have failed." 
 "Market Place has beautiful buildings but no street life to connect them," said James Wines, the president of Site.
The company is taking its cues from Baltimore's mercantile history to make the area an attraction with many recreational uses.
An existing slip will be extended and filled with vintage barges and fishing vessels that will become shops, restaurants and cafes. "It's a playground at the scale of a neighborhood," Mr. Wines said. The project is scheduled to be completed by 1996.

An Urban Bicycle With Attitude

BYLINE: By MICHAEL McDONOUGH 

 BODY:
Maybe it's the recession and the lack of toothsome commissions. Or the absence of a compelling new theory since deconstruction. Whatever the case, architects and designers seem to be getting comfortable with history again. Examples of "new but old" style -- contemporary with a retro twist -- abound. What might be mistaken for a look backward could be the beginning of something new.
IF you're looking for an urban commuting bicycle that is tough but stylish, the Globe series by Specialized bicycles of Morgan Hill, Calif., is a good bet. "We call it retro-moderne," said Reed Pike, a marketing administrator for Specialized. "It's a fairly sophisticated package with a lot of functional details." 
 Look for high-practicality features like the internal gear hubs that shift at the handlebar grips; a built-in wheel lock; a chain guard that protects baggy pants or skirts; full-wrap fenders that keep mud from splashing; a cargo rack; a built-in light, and a kickstand (remember them?). Available in two-tone combinations (including green and blue, and lilac and yellow) by July, the three- and seven-speed models will cost $299 to $429. Information: (800) 245-3462.

Failure on Haiti: How U.S. Hopes Faded

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times; This article is based on reporting by Elaine Sciolino, Howard W. French and Douglas Jehl and was written by Ms. Sciolino.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
The cameras had been turned off and the formal interview at the White House was over last week when President Clinton was asked about Randall Robinson's hunger strike to protest the Administration's policy toward Haiti.
In an extraordinary statement for an American President, Mr. Clinton not only admitted that his policy had failed, but also left the impression that he was somehow powerless to change course. 
 "I understand and respect what he's doing," Mr. Clinton said of the fast by the leader of TransAfrica Forum, a lobbying group and research center. "And we ought to change our policy. It hasn't worked. For the last 10 days, except for my forays on health care, I've done almost nothing but work on Bosnia and Haiti and one or two other foreign policy issues. He ought to stay out there. We need to change our policy."
As a candidate, Mr. Clinton railed against the Bush Administration's Haiti policy and promised to restore democracy to Haiti.
But after 16 months of lofty oratory, half-measures and mixed signals from Washington, Haiti's ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, is no closer to going home. Haiti's military leadership has consolidated its power through a brutal campaign of terror.
Mr. Clinton and Father Aristide, who have met three times, have never agreed on a common strategy. The Pentagon steadfastly opposed any involvement of the American military. Ambassador Lawrence A. Pezzullo, the career diplomat who was entrusted with Haiti policy until he was dismissed last weekend, often worked in a political vacuum and put too much faith in Haiti's military chiefs.
Most important, Mr. Clinton has focused only episodically on Haiti, as on other foreign policy issues.
And as the Clinton White House is preparing yet another incremental policy shift, interviews over the last week with senior Administration officials, diplomats, lawmakers and independent analysts show that even the Administration's plan to impose harsher sanctions may fail to convince Haiti's military to step aside.
There are no illusions in the Administration that these will guarantee the return of Father Aristide. If there is one overwhelming principle and national interest guiding American policy, it is to prevent a flood of refugees into southern Florida.
As the violence in Haiti has increased, many of the President's traditional allies -- Democratic lawmakers, the Congressional Black Caucus, American labor and leaders of Jewish groups and human rights organizations -- have castigated the policy. And last week, David R. Obey, the head of the House Appropriations Committee, stunned the White House when he called for an American-led invasion to oust Haiti's military rulers, to be followed by a new presidential election.
The criticism runs so deep that a 60-page study published last month by the United States Army War College criticizes the Administration for vacillation and confusing actions that have been interpreted in Haiti as indecisive. "Good intentions are not enough," the report says. "One must have clearly defined and realistic goals, the means of attaining them and the will to persist."
 
Clinton Deeply Troubled
 Mr. Clinton is said by aides to be deeply troubled by the violence, which has trained the spotlight on his policy of forcibly returning Haitians who are seeking political asylum. "They're chopping people's faces off," he has repeatedly said to his aides of the country's military.
The result has been a speedy policy review, and an announcement in recent days of elements of what the Administration is calling a major policy shift: an American-led campaign at the United Nations for tougher economic sanctions against Haiti's military Government, a substantial increase in relief aid and tentative proposals for an increase in United Nations and human rights monitors in Haiti.
But when Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and the deputy national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, briefed a group of House members today, the new policy ran into a buzz saw of criticism. Some members said it was doomed, while others insisted that what was needed was a credible threat of force, or perhaps even an outright invasion to overthrow the military rulers, several people who attended said.
And to someone like Mr. Robinson, who has had no communication with Mr. Clinton since he began fasting 17 days ago, the President's admission of a policy failure and the decisions that have followed simply add to the weight of evidence of an unfocused policy gone wrong.
"To have the President suggest that the policy should change and I should stay out there on a hunger strike while he abdicates his responsibility is deeply disturbing," he said in an interview. "The President can make the policy effective and humane with the stroke of a pen, but he hasn't changed a thing. It's sad to say, but he appears to be without a moral compass."
 
Early Lurchings
U.S. Credibility Waned and Died
 When Mr. Clinton was elected President, he made the spread of democracy a linchpin of his foreign policy. Haiti was to be the test case. But even before he took office, he sent confusing signals that prevented the Haiti policy from ever getting on course.
Although Mr. Clinton had criticized President Bush's policy of forcibly returning Haitians who fled to this country by boat, he adopted the same policy himself. A State Department analysis prepared for him explained why: Hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions, of Haiti's 6.4 million people would flee to the United States if the Coast Guard failed to turn them around.
In addition, the Administration's policy was based on the premise that democracy in Haiti meant the return of the democratically elected President. But it was only in the coming months that Mr. Clinton and his aides learned first hand just how difficult a partner Father Aristide could be. Opponents of the policy inside the Administration, particularly in the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency, had only to point to a C.I.A. analysis -- since deemed inaccurate -- that the populist leader and former priest was mentally unstable and therefore unworthy of much United States attention.
The poor communication between Father Aristide and the Administration was aggravated when Ambassador Pezzullo, working with the United Nations, formulated an agreement last summer at Governors Island in New York that lacked any enforcement mechanisms for removing the military leaders who overthrew him, a crucial flaw that in the end doomed the accord.
But by all accounts, the event that buried the accord and signaled the collapse of United States credibility came in October when a ship carrying American military trainers to Haiti was scared off by armed thugs demonstrating ashore. The Pentagon felt vindicated. Still reeling from the death of 18 soldiers in Somalia the week before, it had opposed sending any American troops to Haiti from the start.
Walter B. Slocombe, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, boasted at a cocktail party that by turning back the U.S.S. Harlan County, he had helped save the United States from a "small war," some of those present said. He vowed that the Pentagon would not risk American soldiers' lives to put "that psychopath" back in power.
Although Mr. Slocombe neither recalls nor denies making such a strong statement about Father Aristide, he said in an interview, "I do not have any reason to believe President Aristide is a psychopath."
In the months since, the cablegrams to the State Department from the American Embassy have sounded a recurring theme: The moment the Harlan County turned around, the United States lost all credibility. The status of the American Embassy has sunk so low that when Ambassador William L. Swing gave a reception marking the anniversary of Haiti's democratic constitution in March, most of Haiti's political leadership, including outgoing Prime Minsiter Robert Malval, declined the invitation.
 
Flip-Floppings
A Growing Need For Policy Change
 As the violence mounted in the wake of the Harlan County's retreat, there was an unwillingness both in the American Embassy in Port-au-Prince and in Washington to recognize that the American policy preventing Haitians from reaching the United States was becoming increasingly difficult to defend.
When the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, John Shattuck, publicly suggested that the Administration needed to review its policy on the forcible return of boat people, he was given a stern dressing-down by the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Peter Tarnoff.
On the diplomatic front, the Administration flip-flopped between pressing Father Aristide to make concessions and calling for tougher sanctions against the military rulers. In an increasingly desperate attempt to get a quick solution, Ambassador Pezzullo conceived a power-sharing plan with some elements of the military that Father Aristide rejected as immoral. Mr. Pezzullo was forced to acknowledge at a Congressional hearing that the United States had hand-picked the members of Parliament who were proposing the plan, helped them draft it and paid for their plane tickets so they could present it to Father Aristide in Washington.
After Father Aristide started a public relations offensive accusing the Administration of racism and won the support of lawmakers who demonstrated in front of the White House, the Administration announced a shift in policy.
Mr. Tarnoff called in Mr. Pezzullo on Thursday to tell him that the Administration was embarking on a new course. Mr. Pezzullo submitted his resignation to Secretary of State Warren Christopher two days later.
 
Latest Shift
Painful Choice Of More Sanctions
 In an interview with on NBC's "Meet the Press" in November, Mr. Clinton expressed reluctance to back a call by Father Aristide for a near-total embargo of Haiti, saying additional sanctions "will be more painful in the near term to average Haitians who are already suffering."
With the new sanctions proposal, however, Mr. Clinton has decided that the risk of further hurting the poor is worth the long-term goal of restoring democracy.
"It is a fact that the tougher the sanctions, the more you are going to hurt the average Haitian," Mr. Berger, the deputy security adviser, said in an interview. "But we're not going to get this done otherwise."
But the American-led sanctions resolution at the United Nations falls far short of an all-out effort to strangle Haiti's economy.
The American plan bans most trade except for food and medicine, bans non-commercial air traffic, prohibits all countries from admitting senior military and police officers and and urges other countries to follow the American lead and freeze their overseas assets. But it does not go as far as legislation proposed by six senators last week that would also ban all commercial flights, impose mandatory sanctions against third countries that do not abide by the embargo and overturn the policy of returning Haitians intercepted at sea.
"You shut down American Airlines flights and deny Mrs. Cedras the ability to pack up her Louis Vuitton luggage and visit Miami," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is the driving force behind the legislation, referring to the wife of Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the Haitian military leader.
And the overall plan that is emerging -- at least for the moment -- offers no strategy for next steps if the sanctions do not work, no timetable for Father Aristide's return, no plan on how to carry out the Governor's Island accord of last summer and no changes in the policy to return forcibly the Haitian boat people seeking political asylum.
Despite the rising wave of terror in Haiti, the Administration has already ruled out the creation of refugee camps along the border with the Dominican Republic and the processing of political asylum claims either on American ships or in third countries, senior Administration officials said.
 
No Desire to Send Troops
 The Pentagon, meanwhile, has made clear in inter-agency meetings that it has no appetite for putting any American troops in Haiti, even as military trainers and civil engineers, until there is a change in the military leadership.
Even some senior officials who are committed to Father Aristide's return to Haiti as soon as possible remain unconvinced that he himself is committed to making the leap from celebrated exile to head of state. That view is shared by Mr. Malval, who said in an interview shortly after his resignation as Prime Minister, "If we were to find another way out of this crisis, I think Aristide would find a way to keep it from happening."
There is a growing sense in some quarters of the Administration that the new strategy is at best a holding mechanism and that Father Aristide may not get back to Haiti before his five-year term ends in 1995.
That, says Mr. Talbott, is simply not true. "The present goal and objective is to restore democracy working through the United Nations and the Organization of American States and return a man whom 70 percent of the people voted for as President," Mr. Talbott said in an interview.
But the United States may have a long way to go before it can convince the military leadership and the people in Haiti of the seriousness of its intentions.
After all, the American Embassy in Port-au-Prince still buys the gasoline to fuel its cars on the black market, in violation of existing economic sanctions. And a generator fueled with contraband gasoline lights the tennis courts at the residence of the American Ambassador at night, even when no one is playing.

HEADLINE: 6,100 TO GIVE UP MUNICIPAL WORK IN GIULIANI OFFER

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
The administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that at least 6,100 municipal workers had accepted voluntary severance packages to give up their jobs, an important first step in the new Mayor's drive to cut the city work force and reduce the budget.
The number fell short of the Mayor's severance goal of 7,600, however, and Mr. Giuliani said he might still have to resort to layoffs to cut the payroll further. 
As the deadline for workers to take the severance passed last night, the Mayor said that despite what he characterized as overall success, there were some agencies, including the Department of Transportation, where so few workers had agreed to take the offer that he now had to consider "very targeted" layoffs in those agencies.
More broadly, Mr. Giuliani warned that even more layoffs could be necessary this year if he falls short in other parts of his plan to cut a total of 15,000 municipal jobs through voluntary severance and attrition and to close a $2.3 billion budget gap for the fiscal year that begins on July 1.
"There are other variables, including what happens with the other aspects of the budget in which we intended to get savings," the Mayor said at City Hall. "If we can get those, then we avoid the need for layoffs. If we can't, then the possibility of layoffs is there."
The administration had hoped that the severance program, offered after intense negotiations with the municipal unions, would cut a total of 7,600 of the 216,000 jobs paid for entirely by the city. By 4 P.M., only about 6,100 workers had accepted the severance packages, which ranged from $3,500 to $15,000 and other benefits, depending on years of service.
The city's Personnel Director, Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, said the final figure could change as late applications trickle in and as workers reconsider, which they are allowed to do until May 13. But the Mayor said he could begin deciding as soon as today whether layoffs would be necessary and where.
Throughout the sprawling municipal government, the severance deadline ended four weeks of opportunity, of sadness and of anxiety. For some, the decision came easily. For others, it proved wrenching. And until the end, many workers wavered, trying to decide whether to turn their backs on Civil Service careers or simply to walk away from the security of a job.
"I couldn't give you a black or white reason," David R. Zuckerman, 53, said of his decision to quit as a lawyer for the Probation Department after six years. "I have a chance to have $5,000, to look for something else and to take a break for a while."
But Billye Mayo, who works for the Probation Department, said, "Economically, it wasn't feasible" for her to take the offer.
"In the economy today, $15,000 doesn't last very long at all," she said.
Although the program ended up short of its target, Mr. Giuliani declared it a success that moved him toward his goal of cutting a total of 15,000 jobs by June 1995. The Mayor has committed himself to cut that many jobs to persuade the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation to free up a $200 million surplus to pay for the severance program.
"The program is more successful at this stage than we thought it would be," the Mayor said.
Eugene J. Keilin, the corporation's chairman, said the Mayor still had further to go. "It's a good start," he said, "but it's a long season."
 
'A Good Sign'
 Stanley Hill, executive director of the city's largest union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, agreed that the number of takers was "a good sign." But he disputed the need for any layoffs. "I think we should also recognize that we can find other ways to balance the budget than layoffs," he said.
The severance program marked the first significant, concrete step in Mr. Giuliani's pledges to wrestle down the size of the city's work force, which was slashed drastically to 160,000 after the fiscal crises of the 1970's only to climb steadily upward to 221,000 by 1990.
In addition to reductions through the severance program, the Mayor has proposed cutting an additional 7,400 jobs, including 2,500 at the Board of Education, to bring the total number of jobs to 201,000 over the next 14 months. The other cuts are planned to come through attrition and stricter adherence to a hiring freeze.
With the severance offer now closed, the administration will begin reassigning thousands of workers between agencies, filling what the Mayor's office determines as essential positions vacated through the severance plan. The Mayor said the process, agreed to by the unions for the first time, would prove as important as the severance payments since it allows his administration to redeploy workers from unneeded positions.
With more than 2,000 Civil Service titles and categories, the redeployment effort will be complicated and fraught with pitfalls. The administration, for example, expects to have to refill some positions vacated through severance because qualified replacements may not be found in the current work force. "Some people will have to be rehired," Ms. Barrios-Paoli said, "but we will explore every other possibility before that."
 
Below Severance Targets
 Most agencies reached or exceeded the severance targets, but others came in far below, including the Transportation Department, where preliminary figures showed only 250 of a targeted 1,000 workers took severance. The Department of Homeless Services had only 200 of a target of 680, while the Correction Department reached only 160 of 500.
It was those agencies that Mr. Giuliani identified as facing possible layoffs. Another agency that fell even farther short of its target was the Social Services Department, where 2,100 workers of an expected 3,600 accepted the severance. But one official said the agency would avert layoffs since the extra workers could be redeployed to other agencies.
The Mayor said the decision on layoffs would be made once his aides determine how successful they will be in reshuffling the remaining workers.
 
Impact on Services
 Another uncertainty that remains is the impact of the reductions on services. Mr. Giuliani said that would not be fully known until the redeployment was completed -- after he presents his executive budget to the City Council on May 10.
One worker who accepted severance said it was those impending cuts that prompted her to leave. Anita C. Vitale, a manager at the Division of AIDS Services, said she decided to leave the city payroll after 26 years after sitting through meetings at the Human Resources Administration to decide how to deal with the AIDS patients the division serves if in fact it is cut by the Mayor, as proposed.
"I couldn't participate in the destruction of this program," she said. She stands to receive $15,000 in cash as well as unused sick leave and vacation time, but she broke into tears as she pondered her decision. "I felt," she said, "like we were doing something really extraordinary."
John Valles, assistant commissioner in the Department of Transportation, said he was not ready to leave city government. "I love what I'm doing, and I don't feel I've completed my mission in Civil Service," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Expects U.N. to Toughen Haiti Embargo

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 28

 BODY:
A senior Clinton Administration official predicted today that the United Nations Security Council would vote next week to impose tough new sanctions on Haiti in its latest effort to force the military dictatorship there to step down and allow the return of the country's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The American representative to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, said that there was now "a major consensus" in favor of the Administration's latest plan for stepping up pressure on Haiti's military rulers, who overthrew President Aristide in 1991. Ms. Albright said she expects the Security Council to endorse the plan early next week. "Our goal, as always, is the restoration of democracy in Haiti," she said at a news conference here. 
 The American draft resolution, circulated to other Council members today, puts an immediate ban on all noncommercial flights to and from the impoverished country. This is intended to end Haiti's role as a staging post for international drug smugglers, one of its last remaining sources of foreign currency. The proposal also prohibits all countries from admitting some 600 of Haiti's senior military and police officers and urges them to freeze the overseas assets of these officers.
 
15 Days to Consider
 But if the top members of the military Government -- including Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, its leader, Philippe Biamby, his chief of staff, and the police chief, Michel Francois -- have not stepped down within 15 days and started to carry out the Governors Island agreement providing for Father Aristide's return to power, then the new Security Council resolution imposes a total commercial embargo on all trade with Haiti.
Administration officals say the two-week delay gives Haiti's military rulers time to reflect on their fate if they do not hand over power. It also delays the closing down of some industries that might be hard to restart.
The only exceptions to the total trade embargo, which is similar to those the Council has already imposed on Iraq and the rump Yugoslavia, are relief items, basic foods and the exporting of mangoes so that Haitians will not be tempted to cut down their mango trees for firewood.
The speed with which the Administration now wants the Security Council to act against Haiti and the publicity the United States mission here is giving its new initiative all suggest Washington is anxious to be seen to mean business this time. This follows the failure of its efforts to restore democratic rule to Haiti and renewed criticism of the Administration from Father Aristide himself, which led to the dismissal this week of President Clinton's special envoy to Haiti, Lawrence A. Pezzulo.
The complete ban on trade with Haiti extends to the whole world and makes mandatory the present voluntary embargo the United States and other members of the Organization of American States have imposed on Haiti and which some of their companies circumvent.
 
Economy Near Collapse
 As a result of this trade ban and the existing Security Council oil embargo against Haiti, Administration officials say the Haitian economy is teetering on the brink of total collapse. Almost all foreign trade has stopped, inflation is running at 60 percent a year and Haiti lacks 70 percent of its normal fuel requirements.
About 70 percent of the working population is thought to be unemployed and an equal percentage of the country's industrial capacity is idle. Electricity is available for only about four hours a day in the capital, Port-au-Prince, but virtually nowhere else.
In the past the Administration has hesitated to call for a total trade embargo because Washington felt this would deal a devastating blow to what little economic life remains there and because it feared the added hardship would fall mainly on the poor rather than on their military rulers.
Also, a total embargo risked sending a wave of Haitian refugees across the Caribbean into Florida and other parts of the United States.
 
New Refugee Stations
 Administration officials said today that the United States plans to set up two new refugee processing stations in Haiti to interview Haitians seeking admission to the United States as refugees because they fear persecution from the Haitian Government. Currently some 15,000 Haitians have applied for refugee status. About 3,000 have been admitted while 55,000 more are thought to be interested in applying but have not yet done so.
The United States said today that it would press the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, to tighten sanctions along the border to prevent gasoline and other goods from being sent into Haiti.
The Administration also plans to ask the United Nations and the Organization of American States to increase the number of human rights monitors in Haiti. And officials say the United Nations is looking into the possibility of sending back the small peacekeeping force charged with retraining the armed forces and improving communications in Haiti.

HEADLINE: Economy Grows 2.6% In Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
Throttling back from a breakneck autumn, the economy grew at a moderate 2.6 percent rate in the first three months of 1994 as bad weather, the California earthquake and weak exports restrained activity, the Commerce Department reported today.
At the same time, some gauges of inflation moved higher and some traders and investors concluded that the new data understated the pace of growth. 
 This spelled bad news for the bond market, where traders and investors are still concerned about a jump in inflation in the months ahead and are expecting the Federal Reserve, which has already raised short-term interest rates three times this year, to push them even higher soon. The price of the 30-year bond dropped sharply while the yield shot up to 7.26 percent from 7.10 percent on Tuesday. [Page D12.]
 
Different Conclusions Reached
 But some economists and Clinton Administration officials reached different conclusions from those of the bond market. They argued that the economy was growing solidly but with relatively low risk of a significant revival of inflation, although the rise in gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services within the nation's boundaries -- was somewhat below expectations.
"Over all, today's report should calm fears that the economy is growing at an unsustainably rapid rate or that inflation is about to spike upwards," the President's chief economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, said in a statement.
The economy's 2.6 percent January-March pace of expansion followed a fourth quarter in which growth had once been calculated as high as 7.5 percent before being revised to 7 percent, still the highest in almost 10 years.
While almost nobody expected that pace to be sustained, some analysts had worried that the economy was not cooling off enough to avoid reigniting inflation. In early February, for the first time since 1989, the Federal Reserve began raising short-term interest rates, lifting its foot from the monetary accelerator and moving toward a tap on the brakes.
Today's G.D.P. results, however, were said by economists to cast little light on whether the Fed acted too soon, although some Congressional Democrats stepped up complaints that the central bank was pushing rates higher more because of a hunch about future inflation than on evidence of current price pressures.
 
 
'Misguided' Actions
 Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, the head of the Budget Committee, called the Fed's moves "completely misguided," finding in today's report "absolutely no sign of accelerating inflation."
The first quarter "was significantly distorted and constrained by Mother Nature," said James E. Annable, chief economist for the First National Bank of Chicago.
For example, growth of home building slowed, and other types of public and private construction declined. The Commerce Department also said that consumer spending later in the quarter might not have fully made up for weakness in January.
On the other hand, inventories rose sharply as severe weather prevented sales or even shipments of many goods, adding 1.7 points to first-quarter output but generating a stockpile to inhibit growth later.
"The seeds of a slowdown are planted in this report," Mr. Annable said, forecasting a modest second-quarter rebound to a pace of 3.5 percent or more, followed by a slackening to 2.5 percent or less in the second half of the year as consumers run out of cash and borrowing power.
Despite the bad weather, personal consumption remained brisk over the winter, climbing at a 3.8 percent rate after a 4.4 percent burst during the fourth quarter.
The inflation gauges related to G.D.P. also posed an interpretive challenge. The fixed-weight index for gross domestic purchases -- reflecting prices paid by residents of the United States -- showed a rate of 2.3 percent, reassuringly unchanged from the preceding quarter.
 
Deflator Jumps to 2.6%
 But the overall fixed-weight index climbed to 2.9 from 2.3 percent and the so-called deflator jumped to 2.6 percent from what Ms. Tyson and others regarded as an unsustainably low 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter.
A fixed-weight index measures an unchanging group of items while the deflator is adjusted for shifts in what is actually produced or bought during the quarter.
"I'd be more concerned if it was the fixed-weight" index that was rising, commented Kathryn L. Kobe, vice president of Joel Popkin & Company, a Washington consult specializing in wage and price analysis. "We don't see any signs of real acceleration in inflation."
A department economist dismissed the rise in the overall fixed-weight index by attributing it to export prices and to an annual pay increase for Government employees.
Expressed in current dollars, rather than in 1987 dollars, G.D.P. rose at a 5.2 percent pace in the first quarter, down from 8.4 percent in the final months of 1993, the report also showed.
 
 
Less Savings
 Reflecting the jump in inventories, real final sales of domestic product rose just nine-tenths of 1 percent in the latest period, down from 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter.
Personal savings fell to 3.7 percent of disposable income from 4 percent over the same periods.
The department also reported that its monthly tally of orders for durable goods, those intended to last at least three years, showed a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent in March. This was somewhat below expectations, but analysts were heartened to see that February orders were revised to show a smaller, 1.9 percent decline instead of the 2.6 percent drop that was initially posted.
Moreover, excluding transportation equipment, new orders gained 1 percent, the 10th straight increase, and nonmilitary capital goods other than aircraft rose another 2.8 percent.
In still other indicators today, the Labor Department reported that first-time claims for unemployment insurance tumbled 31,000 last week, reversing recent increases and bringing the level down to 333,000.
And the Conference Board said its index of help-wanted advertising rose two points in March, to 117, following a 10-point February jump.
Data included in the gross domestic product for the fourth quarter of 1993 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

HEADLINE: Galbraith, a Former Envoy, Enters the Gubernatorial Race

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 28

 BODY:
Evan G. Galbraith, a businessman who was Ambassador to France in the Reagan Administration, formally announced his candidacy today for the Republican nomination for governor, joining a field that now numbers five.
In brilliant sunshine on the steps of the State Capitol, Mr. Galbraith, 65, outlined a platform to reduce state personal and corporate taxes by about half, institute the death penalty for all homicide-related crimes, eliminate most forms of welfare and cut the state payroll by 25 percent. 
 Saying that only a conservative can win the Republican nomination, he dismissed two more liberal Republican candidates, Bill Green and Richard M. Rosenbaum, and said the real contest will involve himself, State Senator George E. Pataki and Herbert London.
Without offering a detailed economic blueprint, Mr. Galbraith said he would pay for tax cuts by reducing the $62 billion state budget by $10 billion through layoffs, privatization and reduced services. He said that tax cuts would also stimulate economic growth that would increase tax revenues.
He said that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat seeking his fourth term, "doesn't know much about economics," and blamed him for the loss of 600,000 jobs in the state during the deep recession of the last five years.
But he saved his toughest words for the chairman of the state Republican Party, William D. Powers, whom he accused of using party resources to assist Mr. Pataki, a violation of state laws. He called Mr. Powers "our No. 1 thug."
John E. Sweeney, the party's executive director, said that although Mr. Powers has publicly expressed support for Mr. Pataki, he has not used party money to help him.
"Everyone knows Evan Galbraith is a failed candidate except Evan Galbraith," Mr. Sweeney said. "He's acting out desperately, and that's sad."
 
'Modestly Rich'
 A graduate of Yale College and Harvard Law School, Mr. Galbraith has been a managing director of Dillon Read and Company and is chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, which makes and imports cognac, perfume and other luxury products. He is also on the board of National Review magazine.
Calling himself "not rich rich, but modestly rich," Mr. Galbraith said he is paid about $900,000 a year. But he said he didn't expect to spend more than $100,000 of his own money on a campaign because "I have a lot of rich friends who have been as afflicted by Cuomo as I have."

HEADLINE: Report Sees Rise in AIDS For Children

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
A rising number of infant and childhood deaths from AIDS is beginning to set back years of hard-won improvements in childhood survival rates in the third world, the Census Bureau said in a report today.
The report, which makes projections on AIDS in 13 sub-Saharan countries, Brazil, Thailand and Haiti, predicted that unless there was a sharp slowing in the rate of infection in these countries, childhood mortality rates would triple by the year 2010. 
 For example, bureau demographers estimated that 209 of every 1,000 children would die in Malawi in the year 2010 as a result of AIDS, compared with estimates of 136 without the disease. In Thailand, the child mortality rate would be 103 out of 1,000, as against an estimated 21 without the disease.
Until the onset of the epidemic in the mid-1980's, these countries, like the other developing nations analyzed in the report, had seen marked improvement in the survival rates of children from birth to 5 years of age.
 
AIDS to Double Death Rate
 The report, compiled by the bureau's Center for International Research, also predicted that AIDS would double the overall death rate expected to occur naturally from 1985 to 2010 in the African countries the center studied, and in Brazil and Haiti. In Thailand, the researchers said, the epidemic would triple the expected mortality rate.
As a result of the large number of adults in their 30's and 40's who will die from AIDS, and the large number of infants who are infected in their mothers' wombs, life expectancy rates that have been rising over the last 40 years have started to fall in a number of countries.
For example, the report predicted that by 2010, the average life expectancy in Uganda would drop to 32 years. Without AIDS it would be 59. In Haiti, bureau demographers estimated, life expectancy would drop to 44 years from 59 years.
It is the rate of childhood survival in the third world that will be most significantly affected by AIDS, researchers said. Because 94 percent of the AIDS cases in sub-Saharan Africa are the result of heterosexual intercourse, a higher percentage of women become infected during their childbearing years than is the case in the West. But because it may be years before a person infected with the AIDS virus develops symptoms, women may not realize they carry the virus until after they have passed it on to their children in utero.
 
AIDS Cases at 14 Million
 The predictions are included in "World Population Profile: 1994," a report prepared by the bureau every two years and tracks worldwide population growth, fertility, mortality and contraceptive use. This year's report includes a chapter on the effects of AIDS on population trends.
It notes that despite the 14 million people estimated to be infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, the epidemic will not cause a decline in the population in most third world nations, including sub-Saharan Africa, where the World Health Organization has estimated 8 million people are infected.
But it will slow population growth. The demographers estimate that there will be 121 million fewer people in some of the most highly affected countries in Africa like Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe -- as well as in Haiti, Brazil and Thailand -- by 2010 because of the epidemic than if there had been no exposure to AIDS.
One country whose population is expected decline as a result of AIDS is Thailand, where the report predicts a change from a growth rate of 0.9 percent in 1985 to a loss of 0.8 percent by 2010. Researchers say Thailand already has a low birth rate and its death rate is expected to triple by 2010 because of the disease.
 
Economies to Be Hard Hit
 Moreover, the Census Bureau and researchers from the World Bank say, AIDS will devastate the economies of many countries in sub-Saharan African, already some of the world's poorest nations.
"Economic growth will be encumbered by increased morbidity and decreased productivity of H.I.V.-infected workers, and many others will be unable to enter the work force because of care-giving responsibilities among families," the report said.
Not only will AIDS strike down many workers in their most productive years, but research has also found that the disease disproportionately strikes at these countries' more educated populations.
Studies have shown that in many developing nations, especially Africa, men with more education and higher status tend to engage in more encounters of casual sex, and were thus more likely to be exposed to the virus. As a result, the disease has infected a higher proportion of the class of men whose education tended to make them more productive workers.

HEADLINE: Dow Down 31.23 Points, Tracking a Bond Selloff

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday, shaken by the bond market's selloff after a Government report raised investors' worries about inflation.
Surprisingly strong earnings from Johnson & Johnson and the General Motors Corporation cushioned the stock market's fall. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 31.23 points, to 3,668.31. Weighing heavily on stocks was the bond market's rout. 
 "The reversal in bonds is killing the stock market," William Lord, vice president in equity trading at UBS Securities Inc., said. "All the good earnings in the world aren't going to stop this."
Bond prices plunged and yields surged after the Government's estimate of gross domestic product growth in the first quarter fanned expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at its next policy meeting in May. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond jumped to 7.26 percent, from 7.10 percent on Tuesday.
Both the stock and bond markets were closed Wednesday in memory of former President Richard M. Nixon.
 
Nasdaq Index Falls 2.52 Points
 Most broader stock market indexes also retreated. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.77 points, to 449.10, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 2.52 points, to 731.69.
Bucking the trend, the American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.72 point, to 438.92.
The Commerce Department's estimate for first-quarter G.D.P. growth steered both stocks and bonds. The Government said G.D.P. growth slowed to a 2.6 percent annual rate in the first quarter from the fourth-quarter's 7 percent pace.
But one inflation measure in the G.D.P. report, the so-called price deflator, was higher than expected. It rose to a 2.6 percent annual rate in the first quarter from a 1.3 percent pace in the fourth quarter. Many economists had expected a 2.3 percent increase.
That rise fueled concern that the Fed may push up short-term rates for a fourth time this year to keep inflation under control. Since Feb. 4, the Fed has raised its target for its Federal funds rate, the interest rate on overnight bank loans, to 3.75 percent from 3 percent.
"Everybody fully expects the Fed to raise rates to 4 percent," Barry Berman, head trader at Robert W. Baird, said.
Declining stocks outpaced advancers, 1,275 to 936, on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading was active, with about 323 million shares changing hands on the Big Board.
 
Oil Stocks See Selloff
 Oil stocks were among yesterday's biggest decliners, reflecting a drop in petroleum prices. Chevron slid 2 1/4, to 88 5/8; Exxon dropped 1, to 61 7/8, and Mobil shed 2 1/4, to 77 3/8. Weak oil prices contributed to the decline, with crude oil for June delivery falling 34 cents, to $16.57 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Stocks briefly pared some losses around midday. The catalyst was a rebound in auto shares led by G.M.'s optimistic comments to shareholders in a conference call yesterday morning.
G.M. posted first-quarter earnings from operations of $1.86 a share, exceeding analysts' estimates of about $1.50 a share.
G.M., which had fallen as much as 2 1/8 early in the day, later rose as much as 1 1/8 following the conference call. In the end, though, G.M. closed unchanged at 56 3/4.
Ford Motor and Chrysler rebounded briefly along with G.M. before the broader market's selloff erased their gains.
Strong earnings reports helped a number of other stocks. Johnson & Johnson advanced 1 3/8, to 41 5/8, after it posted an increase of nearly 8.2 percent in first-quarter profits. Also, Xerox rallied 4 1/4, to 100 7/8; America Online vaulted 5 1/4, to 68 3/4; Cirrus Logic soared 3 3/8, to 36 3/8, and Premark International leaped 5 3/4, to 78 5/8.
Among biotechnology stocks, Sciclone Pharmaceuticals plunged 79/16 , to 53/16 , and Alpha 1 Biomedicals skidded 43/16 , to 2, after preliminary tests showed that an Alpha drug licensed to Sciclone might not be effective against chronic hepatitis B.
Meanwhile, Molecular Biosystems jumped 2, to 18, after the Food and Drug Administration granted it an "approvable letter" for one of its diagnostic imaging products.
Agco rallied 5 3/8, to 42, after it agreed on Tuesday to acquire the Massey Ferguson tractor-making division from Varity for $328 million.
In Tokyo, Japanese stocks ended lower yesterday. The Nikkei average of 225 stocks slipped 3.90 points, to 19,725.25. The Tokyo stock market is closed today for the Greenery Day national holiday.

HEADLINE: Meadowlands Sports Agency Proposing a Direct Rail Link

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., April 28

 BODY:
Seeking to keep pace in the furiously evolving entertainment business, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority today unveiled an $850 million plan for its Meadowlands complex that calls for a rail line to lure visitors to a grab bag of new attractions, from a conference center to an amphitheater to an ice rink.
At the core of the project is a proposal to ease the increasingly burdensome traffic congestion in the area by using about $133 million in Federal transportation funds to lay down the one-mile rail line. It would allow some of the millions of visitors who come for Giants football, Nets basketball or a host of other events every year to ride trains from Manhattan and New Jersey to the center of the complex. 
 The planned expansion in the Meadowlands, scheduled to be finished by the end of the decade, represents a risky venture for an agency that carved a lucrative enclave from the swamps of northern New Jersey in the 1970's, only to fall on such difficult times in recent years that it has required state aid.
To succeed, the authority must not only obtain financing and approval from many Federal and state officials and developers, but also correctly predict the future leisure tastes of an often fickle public. The authority's strategy is to pile choice upon choice, hoping, for example, that people might attend a football game, browse through retail stores offering sporting goods and clothing and then have a picnic in a new tailgating area or maybe a drink at a sports bar -- all without leaving the complex.
"We now have to look for other sources of revenues and be creative in the ability to generate those revenues," Michael D. Francis, the authority's chairman, said at a news conference this morning.
Perhaps the biggest challenge for the authority is to persuade the state to spend about $55 million to relocate Route 120, which now runs through the complex. That move would open up space for a private developer to build numerous projects: a 600-room hotel; a television studio; a 500-seat theater; restaurants and sports bars; retail stores, especially those selling sporting goods; health clubs; museums, picnic areas and office buildings.
 
New Train Station in Secaucus
 Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who can veto the Meadowlands expansion, has not yet announced her position on it. Her past criticism of using state money for such projects might indicate that she would reject it. But Mr. Francis, whom she appointed and who was a political fund-raiser for her, said today that he was confident that both the Governor and State Legislature would support it. The Assembly has scheduled a May 19 hearing on the project.
The rail line would connect the Meadowlands to a station in nearby Secaucus that is to be built by the end of the decade with nearly $400 million already allocated by Congress. That station, known as the Secaucus transfer, is supposed to alleviate overcrowding by linking many of the state's rail lines and providing easy access to and from Manhattan.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, the Democrat who represents the Meadowlands area, said that if New Jersey's elected officials united to lobby Congress, he and the rest of the state's Congressional delegation should be able to obtain approval for the money for the rail line to the Meadowlands. But he said that if that effort failed, he and many others would oppose the expansion because the rail line was so crucial.
"The proposal is a well-thought-out, balanced and reasoned approach to getting more out of the asset of the sports complex," Mr. Torricelli said. "But since my highest priorities are the local interests, my position can go from enthusiastically supporting to doggedly trying to defeat it depending on whether or not there is a mass-transportation component."
The authority estimates that the building of the new attractions would cost a private developer about $220 million. Mr. Francis said today that he and Robert E. Mulcahy 3d, the authority's president, had spoken with several interested developers, including Melvin Simon, who has built some of the largest malls in the country. The developers would pay the authority for the rights to build.
In today's dollars, the transit plan and private development would cost $400 million to $500 million, Mr. Francis said. When inflation and other costs are included over the length of the project, the price tag rises to about $850 million on completion.
 
No Baseball for Now
 With the expansion, the authority, which has more than 3,000 full- and part-time workers, is seeking to bolster revenues that have suffered in recent years as attendance has dropped sharply at its race track. Because its balance sheet has suffered, the authority has been forced to ask the state for assistance in servicing its debt: $17 million this year, which is expected to rise to $26 million next year.
The expansion at this point focuses on enlarging the 750-acre complex, which includes Giants Stadium, Byrne Arena and the Meadowlands race track, and does not include the construction of a baseball stadium in the area. That issue has loomed large because George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the owner of the Yankees, has threatened to move the team from the South Bronx, saying that he is unhappy with the neighborhood and the condition of Yankee Stadium.
If he abandoned New York for the Meadowlands, Mr. Steinbrenner would be following a path already trodden by the Giants and Jets of the National Football League. But a baseball stadium is apparently not feasible now because of its enormous cost and land constraints. And Governor Whitman has said she refuses to spend taxpayers' money to coax sports teams to New Jersey.
The expansion has generated intense interest in nearby towns, with some residents bemoaning the possibility of ever-greater swarms of people converging on the area, and others allowing that the project might be good for local business. Most everyone is concerned about traffic, mindful of the football Sundays when the roadways become insufferable.
"If their theory about the commuter situation is correct, then I don't think it will impact at all," said Mayor Dominick Presto of Carlstadt, referring to the authority's decision to rely on the rail line to unclog the highways. "But if they are wrong, it's going to be a bad, bad situation."

HEADLINE: Rifkin Shows Severe Psychosis, Expert Says

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., April 28

 BODY:
Joel Rifkin tested "off the scale" as a paranoid schizophrenic, showing an extreme inability to think logically or experience time, a clinical psychologist testified today in the trial of Mr. Rifkin, who has confessed to strangling 17 women.
"His mind is like a videotape in that it fast-forwards, then suddenly rewinds," said the psychologist, Dr. Barbara R. Kirwin, who has worked with the criminally insane for 20 years. "There is no normal time sequence in his thinking." 
 Dr. Kirwin, the first and only witness for the defense, said she had spent more than 170 hours studying and testing Mr. Rifkin. She said the results showed that "at the time of the offenses, Mr. Rifkin suffered from a mental disease of such severe pervasiveness as to impair his ability to know the nature of his actions."
 
'Extremely Volatile'
 Since the defense has acknowledged that Mr. Rifkin killed 17 women, the jury is being asked to determine only whether he will spend the rest of his life in prison or in a state hospital for the criminally insane.
Dr. Kirwin said Mr. Rifkin's mental illnesses were made worse because he was "an extremely volatile, hypersensitive person, one who is likely to react to the slightest emotional nuance in a psychotic way."
Under questioning by the defense attorney, John Lawrence, Dr. Kirwin told the jury that Mr. Rifkin had difficulty "making sense out of the world," that he could "not always trust what he heard or saw one day to the next," which made him "unsure of what was fantasy and what was reality."
But when asked by Mr. Lawrence if she had found any evidence of sexual perversion in Mr. Rifkin, Dr. Kirwin said, "No, I did not."
This appeared to contradict testimony during a pretrial hearing by another psychiatrist who said that Mr. Rifkin had taken mementos from his victims so he could later achieve sexual satisfaction by reliving the encounters.
Dr. Kirwin, before beginning a private practice in Huntington, L.I., in 1986, was director of administration for the treatment of violent inmates at the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center, a state hospital for the criminally insane. She has appeared numerous times as an expert witness for the prosecution in Nassau County Court, but this was her first appearance in Nassau for the defense. She said she was being paid $165 an hour.
 
An Attentive Defendant
 Mr. Rifkin appeared attentive as she testified. He sat quietly at the defense table, dressed in a conservative business suit and tie.
He is on trial for the murder of his 17th victim, 22-year-old Tiffany Bresciani, whom he picked up in lower Manhattan on June 24, paid $20 for sex, then strangled. He was arrested in Nassau County four days later while trying to dispose of her body, which was found in the back of his pickup truck by state troopers who stopped him for a traffic violation.
Mr. Rifkin, a 34-year-old unemployed landscaper from East Meadow, L.I., subsequently confessed to killing Ms. Bresciani and 16 other women over a four-year period and of dumping their bodies in Suffolk County, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, where he also faces murder charges.
The Nassau prosecutor, Fred Klein, is expected to cross-examine Dr. Kirwin when she returns to the witness stand on Friday. He was limited today to asking procedural questions about evidence.
In an apparent effort to unnerve the witness and discredit her testimony, Mr. Klein fired a series of questions at her about some handwritten comments on Mr. Rifkin's test results, which the defense had submitted as evidence.
"I'm sorry, I'm confused by your questions," Dr. Kirwin said as the heads of the jurors moved back and forth as if at a tennis match.
"I'm sorry you're confused, Dr. Kirwin," said Mr. Klein.
 
'Notes? What Notes?'
 The brief exchange was a hint of things to come. Shortly before 3 P.M., as Dr. Kirwin referred to some notes she had taken on earlier tests of Mr. Rifkin by another psychologist, Mr. Klein startled the jury by suddenly jumping to his feet and shouting: "Notes? What notes? I have never seen those notes."
The prosecution is entitled to all notes related to the testing of Mr. Rifkin.
Judge Ira H. Wexner asked the jurors to leave the courtroom so that Mr. Lawrence could supply a set of the notes to the prosecution. Mr. Klein has repeatedly asserted that the defense has been withholding evidence. Not until this afternoon's incident, however, had the jury been aware of the charge, which Mr. Lawrence has repeatedly denied.
The prosecution is to begin calling its own experts on Monday, starting with Dr. Elliot Park Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist who has testified at the trials of John Hinckley Jr. and the serial killers Jeffrey Dahmer and Arthur Shawcross.
Mr. Lawrence said during a break in the trial that it did not matter how many rebuttal witnesses the prosecution put on the stand. "This is not a game of quantity," he said. "It's a game of quality, and I have to rely on the strength of my expert witness."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls to 8-Month Low Vs. Yen on Trade Concerns

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled to an eight-month low against the Japanese yen yesterday amid increasing concern that political jousting in Tokyo would aggravate Japan's long-running trade dispute with the United States.
Heavy selling in the American bond and stock markets also weighed on the dollar. Bonds dropped after a Government economic report showed some signs of inflation. 
 In trading yesterday, the dollar fell as low as 101.30 yen, its lowest since Aug. 19. In New York, it was last quoted at 101.36 yen, down from 102.35 yen on Tuesday. The dollar also dropped to 1.6622 German marks, from 1.6710 marks.
"Everyone is selling dollars for yen because they don't see any progress on the trade front," Dennis Pettit, foreign-exchange manager at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, said. "There's no one to buy dollars except the Bank of Japan."
The dollar started falling on Monday after Japan's Socialist Party bolted the coalition Government. That left Prime Minister Tsutomo Hata with a minority in Parliament, raising concern about whether he can restart trade talks.
If the United States does not gain trade concessions from Japan, many traders expect the White House to resume calls for a strong yen, which makes Japanese exports more expensive. The Bank of Japan bought billions of dollars in recent weeks to try to slow the yen's rise, traders said.
Traders were more willing to sell dollars for yen yesterday because Japanese markets will be closed for most of next week for the Golden Week holidays, which start today. The Bank of Japan will probably have to rely more on foreign central banks to slow the yen's rise during the holidays, traders said.
A selloff in the Treasury bond market also prompted dollar sales yesterday, traders said.
The British pound rose to $1.5136 in New York yesterday, from $1.5060 on Tuesday. The dollar fell to 5.6991 French francs from 5.7395 francs and slipped to 1.4126 Swiss francs from 1.4257 francs. The dollar fell to 1,591 Italian lire from 1,608 lire. The Canadian dollar slid to 72.36 United States cents from 72.67 cents.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Coffee Prices Rise to a High As Fears of Oversupply Ease

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Coffee prices climbed to a two-and-a-half-year high yesterday after exporters said they would reduce their inventories gradually rather than flood the market.
Coffee exporters have been holding coffee off the world market since October in an effort to bolster prices. Traders had been concerned that exporters would rush to sell coffee stockpiles once prices rose high enough. 
 But officials from the Association of Coffee Producing Countries said on Tuesday that coffee would not be dumped on the market.
When coffee supplies are sold, said Eduardo Libreros, an official with the exporters group in New York, "we will do that in a very, very careful way."
Coffee for July delivery, the most active contract, rose 3.95 cents yesterday, to 88.55 cents a pound, its highest price since October 1991 on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
 
 
'Less Helter-Skelter'

"That's a plus, because it allows for a less helter-skelter distribution of stocks," said Bill O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch & Company.
Still, some traders said yesterday's gains would increase the temptation to sell off coffee stockpiles.
"In three or four days, it could be right back down," said John Connolly, managing director with the Alpine Capital Management Group in Englewood Cliffs, N.J. "They've still got a ton of coffee" that will be sold eventually, he said.
On other commodity markets, copper prices gained amid expectations that European economies would soon emerge from recession. Copper for July delivery gained 2.15 cents, to 91.40 cents a pound, its highest price in more than a month on the Commodity Exchange of New York.
 
Gold Prices Gain
 Gold prices also rose on the Commodity Exchange, with the June futures contract, the most active, gaining $1.50, to $376.80 an ounce.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, lumber prices surged their daily trading limit as the lowest lumber prices since October spurred renewed demand. Lumber for May delivery rose $10, to $317.50 for every 1,000 board feet, after rising its limit on Tuesday. Commodity markets were closed on Wednesday in memory of former President Richard M. Nixon.
Warmer weather is letting builders resume construction that was delayed by the winter's severe cold, pushing up lumber demand.
And crude oil prices slumped following a report late Tuesday showing stockpiles of crude and unleaded gasoline rose last week. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June crude fell 34 cents, to $16.57 a barrel. Unleaded gasoline fell 2.12 cents, to $48.59 a barrel, and heating oil fell 0.85 cent, to $46.52 a barrel.

HEADLINE: Air Quality Inside Jetliners Is Not Harmful, Study Says

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
The reduction of fresh air in airline cabins since the mid-1980's poses no harm to passengers and crew members, according to a study commissioned by the airline industry that was made public today.
"Both older aircraft, with an all-fresh air system, and newer aircraft that have a combination of fresh and recirculated air, meet or exceed standards that are designed to insure a healthy environment," said Jim Landry, president of the Air Transport Association, which financed the study and represents major airlines. 
 Consolidated Safety Services, a Virginia consulting firm that conducted the study for the industry, tested the air in jetliner cabins during 35 flights without notifying the airlines or the crews. It found that the air quality met Federal health and safety standards for workers in offices and factories.
But a spokesman for flight attendants criticized the study on the ground that air quality standards for offices and factories are not appropriate for judging the crowded confines of a loaded airplane.
 
Workplace Standards Used
 Aaron Sussell, an industrial hygienist with the National Institute of Occupational Safety, said the study had improperly used his agency's standards and those of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Those standards were meant to protect people in the workplace, he noted, but airplanes serve the general public, which requires more stringent rules because passengers include infants, the elderly and disabled people.
A case in point were carbon dioxide levels as high as 1,395 parts per million. These were well below OSHA's maximum of 5,000 but above the limit of 1,000 parts per million set for the general public by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditional Engineers.
In the 1980's, airlines in the United States reduced the amount of fresh air circulated in the cabins, from 100 percent fresh air pumped in every three minutes, to half fresh air and half recirculated air every six or seven minutes. The airline industry says the reduction of fresh air saves an average of $60,000 per jetliner each year because less fuel is needed to cool the air that comes in through the plane's engines.
Since the change was introduced, some flight attendants and passengers have complained of headaches, nausea and other health problems, especially after long flights. Many attribute the problems to the reduced ventilation.
 
House Hearings Planned
 The Air Transport Association's study has disputed this claim. "Results of the study did not reveal a potential for human health hazards," said Dr. Jolanda Janczewski, president of Consolidated Safety Services Inc. of Okaton, Va., which has conducted studies for Federal agencies.
The study was made public in anticipation of Congressional hearings on the issue that are scheduled for next month by the Aviation Subcommittee of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee. "We thought it was important to get this study out in advance of the hearing," Mr. Landry said.
The study measured contaminants aboard 35 flights involving two older planes that provided 100 percent fresh air and two newer aircraft that provide 50 percent fresh air and 50 percent recirculated air. The older aircraft were a Boeing 727 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.; the newer aircraft were a Boeing 757 and a McDonnell Douglas MD-80.
The newer aircraft generally had a higher level of contaminants than the older aircraft, but these were still within the range allowed by the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Public Health Service's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, the study said.
"Total and average levels for volatile organic compounds, respirable particulates and bacterial and fungal contaminants were relatively low for all types of aircraft, seating configuration, flight duration and airlines," the study said.
A 1986 study recommended that fully loaded airline cabins have "maximal airflow" of 100 percent fresh air. The study was conducted for Congress by the National Research Council, which includes the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine.
The study noted that the fresh air varied from less than 7 cubic feet per minute for economy-class passengers to 50 cubic feet per minute for first-class passengers to up to 150 cubic feet per minute for the cockpit, where the air is needed to cool electronic equipment.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of Manhattan and Brooklyn, has introduced a bill that would provide a minimum of 20 cubic feet of fresh air per minute for all passengers.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
G.M.'s Profit Jumps 66.5% in Quarter

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 28

 BODY:
With auto sales booming in North and South America and strengthening in Europe, the General Motors Corporation reported today that its first-quarter profits jumped 66.5 percent from a year earlier, to $854 million.
The robust earnings, which at 81 cents a share exceeded the expectations of automotive securities analysts, came despite a previously announced $758 million charge G.M. took to account for benefits for some former employees. Without the charge, G.M., the world's largest auto maker, earned $1.6 billion. 
 In the first three months of the year, G.M.'s revenues climbed 8.5 percent, to $37.5 billion.
 
 
Stock Drops, Then Rebounds
 Immediately after G.M. announced its results, its stock slid as much as $2.125 a share on the New York Stock Exchange in a frenzy of selling that may have been prompted by confusion over whether the recovering North American operations had performed as well as expected. G.M. shares recovered by midday and closed at $56.75, unchanged.
The report showed that the North American operations lost $197 million, compared with a loss of $170 million a year earlier. But excluding the one-time accounting charge, the operations earned $511 million on rising sales.
"The North American turnaround is genuine, and it's very, very good," said Wendy Beale Needham, the auto industry analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York.
Reflecting growing confidence at the company, journalists attending the earnings announcement at G.M. headquarters here were pointedly issued green badges, replacing the black badges issued with fourth-quarter earnings and the red ones of previous quarters.
The profit margin for North American operations improved from eight-tenths of a percent a year earlier to 2.1 percent, before the accounting change. The margin, a measure of G.M.'s success in cutting costs, is still short of the 5 percent goal Mr. Smith has set, said G. Richard Wagoner, the executive vice president who is G.M.'s finance and purchasing chief. "That's in the right direction, but on a long-term basis nowhere near where we want to go," he said. "We are not at all satisfied with the profitability on our car lines."
A shift by buyers during the quarter away from luxury vehicles and toward smaller, less profitable cars like the Chevrolet Cavalier in the United States and the Opel Corsa in Europe also ate into profits, he said.
But Ms. Needham said that growing margins were already generating a handsome return per vehicle. According to her calculations, the net profit per vehicle in North America, before interest or taxes, jumped from $149 in the fourth quarter of 1993 to $650 in the first quarter. A year ago, G.M. was losing $51 a vehicle, on average, in North America. Ms. Needham said the improvement stemmed from "cost reduction in terms of material and head count."
 
 
 
Lower Rebates
 G.M. also reduced rebates to its customers and other financial incentives. Incentive costs per vehicle fell 16 percent from a year earlier, to $800. During the fourth quarter of 1993, incentive costs averaged $880.
G.M.'s international operations contributed $425 million to the bottom line, a threefold increase from a year earlier. Mr. Wagoner attributed the jump in part to surging sales in South America. In Brazil, where auto sales are soaring as customers rush to showrooms to beat inflation, G.M. sales rose 25 percent for the quarter.
"What continues to surprise me is just how strong the overseas business is," said Maryann Keller, an analyst for Furman Selz in New York.
In the United States. G.M.'s car sales outperformed the industry in the first quarter. Its retail car sales increased nearly 19 percent, to 759,407, according to Ward's Automotive Reports. Its sales of light trucks -- including pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles -- rose 21 percent, to 463,805. During the quarter, the car market as a whole was up 15.4 percent, and the truck market rose 22.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Are Happy Days Here Again? Art World Prepares for a Test

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
ARTISTS may moan that theirs is a lonely profession. But the people who make the international art world move -- the dealers, collectors and auction-house experts -- tend to travel in packs. And their destination, for the next two weeks anyway, is New York City.
Art shows are happening all over Manhattan during this period, at conventional spots like galleries and the Seventh Regiment Armory and at more offbeat sites like a ship terminal and a hotel off Gramercy Park. Each show has been timed to coincide with the spring sales of contemporary, Impressionist and modern art that start at Christie's and Sotheby's on Tuesday evening. (The public viewings of the art that will be auctioned begin this weekend at the two houses.) 
 These semiannual auctions are the only public barometer of the art market, but this season they are also an excuse to capitalize on an optimistic mood that has been fluttering through the art world for the last six months. Some dealers say they are participating in an art show this spring because business is better, and so they have the capital to invest in publicity; others say they believe the exposure can give their business the boost it still needs. Whatever the reasons, everyone is getting into the act: from blue-chip galleries that are mounting special exhibitions to fledgling dealers who will literally be selling art out of their suitcases.
This weekend's biggest show of all, Art New York International, involves 65 dealers from more than 15 countries at Pier 92. It features well-known Manhattan galleries like Andre Emmerich, Robert Miller and Holly Solomon, as well as Waddington Galleries of London, Galerie du Centre of Paris and Busche Galerie of Berlin. The art ranges from a $1 million Dubuffet to the work of emerging artists like Fabian Marcaccio for under $1,000. The show also has a 10,000-square-foot indoor sculpture space, with works by Leger, de Chirico, Robert Indiana and Fernando Botero.
Another serious first-time show, one scheduled around the Impressionist and modern sales, is the International Fine Art Fair, opening at the Seventh Regiment Armory on May 13. Sixty-five international dealers will show paintings, drawings and sculpture from the Renaissance through Impressionism.
When word began circulating about these shows, other galleries became competitive. "We figured there would be a lot of out-of-towners coming to New York," said Ronald Feldman, a SoHo dealer who helped organize a multi-gallery open house, sponsored by the Art Dealers Association of America.
They named it "the best free show in town," Mr. Feldman said, observing that he frequently gets calls asking how much his gallery charges for admission. "These calls are telling," he said. "This isn't just about selling art. We want to broaden our audience." About 40 uptown galleries held an open house last night. A group in SoHo will do the same thing tomorrow morning. Although Saturdays are always heavy-traffic days in SoHo, many galleries will have their artists present to discuss the works.
A more ad hoc event is taking place this weekend at the Gramercy Park Hotel, where 30 conventional hotel rooms are being transformed into live-in art-fair booths with the installation of artworks. Aptly named the Gramercy International, this alternative art fair will concentrate on emerging artists and, consequently, less expensive works. The dealers include well-regarded galleries often on the cutting edge of trends, from David Zwirner, American Fine Arts, Fawbush and Jay Gorney in SoHo to Jay Jopling of London, Ma Galerie of Paris and Walcheturm of Zurich.
"I thought it would be fun," said Paula Cooper, the SoHo gallery owner, who is one of the few long-established dealers in the group. Ms. Cooper said she chose the Gramercy International over Art New York because of her younger artists, including Robert Gober, Rudy Stingel and Tony Feher.
 
Into the Auction Rooms
 The laid-back setting of the Gramercy Hotel couldn't offer a greater contrast to the pristine carpeted walls of Sotheby's and Christie's. But never mind. During the next two weeks, the auction rooms will be filled with more blockbusters than either house has had a chance to sell since the boom years of the 1980's.
For art lovers, the viewings at Sotheby's and Christie's provide a chance to see some historically important works before they disappear into private collections. For art professionals, this spring provides yet another test of the art market. For the last two years, auction house experts have been crying poor. As confidence in the market waned, so did the amount of art for sale. "This spring our volume has increased significantly, both in terms of quality and price," said Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's in New York. "I guess the time has come to see if we're as good as our word."
Dreamy scenes of Venice by Monet, Cubist works by Picasso as well as vintage Jasper Johnses are all going up for sale, at estimates that are 15 to 20 percent higher than they would have been six months ago. The price levels, Mr. Burge said, correspond to where the market was during the first half of 1988. At the high end, the spring sales offer more paintings with estimated prices of $4 million or more than have been up for sale in three years. "A year or two ago, if you talked about $5 million to $10 million paintings, people winced," said Diana D. Brooks, who heads Sotheby's auctions worldwide. "There's no wincing now."
Most of these big-ticket works come from estates, traditionally the anchor of important auctions. "We have more estate property than we've seen for a while," said Mr. Burge. "You might assume people don't die during a recession, but actually, estates were holding on and not selling unless they absolutely had to. This spring a number of collectors have died and their property has come willingly on the market."
 
Some Loans for the Sellers
 But the process of getting that estate business was so competitive this year that the auction houses reportedly gave sellers substantial loans or advances on the property to be auctioned. This practice challenges the conventional role of the auction house as disinterested agent. Neither Christie's nor Sotheby's would discuss its financing terms.
The splashy advertising and marketing of the spring sales does raise the question of just how large a financial stake the auction houses have in the property they are selling. "Less than people think," said Mrs. Brooks of Sotheby's. At Christie's, Mr. Burge said, "The company does not discuss the arrangements it makes with its sellers."
Christie's is advertising works from two major estates. One, called simply "a European estate," is showcased in its own hard-back catalogue. The property is from the estate of Jacques Koerfer, a German businessman who lived in Switzerland. Among the highlights is Picasso's Cubist work "Violin, Bottle and Glass," from 1913, estimated to sell for $4 million to $6 million. A true connoisseur's painting, it exhibits all the strength and deftness of the finest Cubist compositions. It has been in the same private collection for nearly 30 years and the painting is immaculate, neither lined nor varnished. The same is true for Gauguin's rich 1888 landscape "River L'Aven Through Pont-Aven," from the same collection, which is estimated to bring $5 million to $7 million.
The second estate on view at Christie's is a small, but impressive collection of four Impressionist works that belonged to Neil A. McConnell, a New York-based investment banker who died in May. Mr. McConnell bought primarily from William Acquavella, one of New York's most prominent dealers. Cezanne's "Still Life With Open Drawer" (1877-1879), which Christie's estimates will sell for $4 million to $6 million, "is an amazing painting, all about gravity and the device of the open door," said Michael Findlay, director of the Impressionist and modern art department at Christie's. "It's quite unique because everything is just a bit off center." The McConnell estate also includes a large Monet, "The Mula Palace," a sparkling image from 1908 painted as though the artist was looking at the Gothic facade of the palace in Venice through a zoom lens. Christie's has estimated it will sell for $4 million to $6 million.
 
Another Monet of Venice
 The Monet is on the cover of Christie's catalogue for the May 10 Impressionist and modern art sale. By coincidence, Sotheby's catalogue for its May 11 Impressionist and modern sale also features a Monet scene from Venice, "The Grand Canal and the Santa Maria Della Salute" (1908), one of six variations of the church the artist painted during his first visit to Venice. The painting is being sold by the Onichi Museum in Japan, and Sotheby's estimates it will bring $7 million to $8 million.
Most of the other top works in Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art sale come from the estate of H. Gates Lloyd, a former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, and his wife, Eleanor, who founded the Washington Gallery of Modern Art. They amassed a collection of great breadth, including a Mondrian, "Composition" (1939-42), that is in pristine condition and is estimated to bring more than $3 million, and Henry Moore's "Festival Reclining Figure," a 1951 bronze created for the 1951 Festival of Britain, a centenary exhibition organized by the Arts Council of Great Britain. The Moore is expected to fetch $1.5 million to $2 million.
Another rare picture from an estate at Sotheby's is Klimt's "Lady With a Fan" (1917-18), a portrait of a beautiful woman against a colorful background of flowers and exotic birds. "It's rare because most of the great Klimts are in Austrian museums," said David Nash, director of the department of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's. Mr. Nash estimates the painting will bring $7 million to $9 million. "I'm still looking for solid ground with certain estimates," Mr. Nash said. "It's still difficult to predict what the market will bear."
 
Fresh Signs of Recovery
 It is even more difficult in the field of contemporary art, which has taken longer to crawl out of its slump than the Impressionist and modern market. Six months ago, contemporary art showed the first signs of a recovery since 1990, and the offerings this spring confirm that the worst is over.
"It's the best sale we've had since the market's fall," said Diane Upright, Christie's head of contemporary art, speaking about both quality and prices. "But great things are still difficult to get." Among the few highlights of the Christie's sale, on May 3, are a classic Jackson Pollock drip painting, "No. 22" from 1949, which is expected to bring $2 million to $3 million; Mark Rothko's "Four Reds" (1957), estimated at $1.2 million to $1.8 million, and the Pop icon "Great American Nude No. 2," by Tom Wesselmann, estimated to fetch $150,000 to $200,000. Sellers include Meshulam Riklis, the financier who owns the financially troubled McCrory Corporation, and Michael D. Abrams, of the publishing family. But the Christie's sale pales next to Sotheby's contemporary sale on May 4.
Sotheby's has put together an outstanding group of works, especially strong in 1950's and 60's blue-chip artists from celebrated collections. The painting on the cover of the sale catalogue, for example, is Jasper Johns's "Highway," a 1959 painting that is being sold by Peter Brant, the newsprint manufacturer and owner of Interview Magazine, and his wife, Sandy. The colorful abstract painting depicts the feeling of being caught in traffic with the red and yellow traffic lights on the bottom. It comes from one of the artist's most desirable periods and is estimated to sell for $8 million.
A later, untitled Johns, from 1983, is being sold by the publisher S. I. Newhouse Jr. and his wife, Victoria. It is estimated at $1.5 million to $2 million. Mr. Newhouse has been quietly selling some of his collection for several years now. In this sale, he is also offering Roy Lichtenstein's "Black Flowers," from 1961, which is estimated to bring $1.8 million to $2.5 million, as well as Claes Oldenburg's "7-Up," a wall relief that Sotheby's expects will bring $250,000 to $350,000.
Another rare work for sale that night is David Smith's "Cubi V," 1 of the 28 polished stainless steel sculptures the artist began creating in 1961, which is estimated to fetch $2.5 million. "This sale has all the right ingredients," said Lucy Mitchell-Innes, director of Sotheby's department of contemporary art worldwide. "There's a real hunger out there for 1950's and early 1960's work, which has been rare to the market."
While both auction houses are gearing up for bigger sales than ever, a question mark still hangs over them. "There are two important issues," Mrs. Brooks said. "The first is, how fast is the market coming back? And the second, how many buyers are willing to actually step up to the plate?"

Miracle With Reasons

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
By the standards of today's world the election in South Africa is a political miracle. Many would have predicted that white domination would end in a cataclysm of violence, not a one-person-one-vote election supported by all major parties and population groups.
But it is a miracle created by human beings. A series of calculated political judgments made possible the relatively peaceful transition to a new South Africa. 
 President F. W. de Klerk made the judgment, long overdue, that white rule could be maintained only at devastating costs, economic and social. He understood that the present leaders of the African National Congress were the most moderate interlocutors the whites could hope to find. He took the dramatic step in February 1990 of releasing Nelson Mandela and his colleagues from prison.
Mr. Mandela took the path of reconciliation from the day of his release. When I interviewed him two months later, I asked whether he favored the prosecution of men who had carried out murders on behalf of the Government. He answered:
"No, no, no. The whole spirit of negotiations would be against taking revenge on any particular individual. You think of a settlement as involving the entire community in support of the settlement. Otherwise it will be an intolerable situation."
That spirit of inclusiveness and reconciliation was carried on through the long negotiations and then the election campaign. Mr. Mandela urged campaign crowds to support the police, who had been the hated enforcers of apartheid. He went the last mile to bring the prickly Mangosuthu Buthelezi into the election.
The new Constitution, drafted mainly by lawyers of the A.N.C. and the governing National Party, contains assurances to whites and other minorities. It has a detailed bill of rights and a Constitutional Court to enforce it against the future government.
Perhaps most important, the negotiators agreed to conduct the first election on the basis of proportional representation. In a system like Britain's or ours, with legislators elected by districts, few whites would have won -- because only a few districts in South Africa have white majorities. P.R. will produce many more white members, because each party will have the same share of seats as it has of votes in the whole country.
The A.N.C. agreed to P.R. even though it will give the party fewer winners. As a study by the Center for Voting and Democracy in Washington put it, the leaders realized that the distortions caused by a district system "would be fundamentally destabilizing in the long run for both minority and majority interests."
The Constitution also provides that any party with 5 percent of the vote will have a seat in the cabinet. There will be a government of national unity for five years, with Mr. de Klerk as a likely vice president.
Those concrete measures made it easier for the National Party to give up its absolute hold on power. And on top of them, Mr. Mandela and his colleagues have given assurances to the bureaucracy and the army that their interests will be protected. Their pensions, too.
A.N.C. leaders have taken all these steps on the premise that a new government can succeed only if most South Africans accept it as legitimate. Mr. Mandela told a television interviewer: "To be dismissive of opposition -- that is what was done in Angola and Mozambique. We must not make that mistake."
Americans might look at South Africa and think about our politics. South Africans lined up for hours, determined to vote; half of us do not bother. There, victims of oppression built bridges to those who held power; here we increasingly have the politics of division and hate. They used proportional representation to mitigate conflict; we mocked a Lani Guinier who thought we should consider a form of P.R. for the same reason.
Of course the commitment to reconciliation and national unity will be tested by the realities of governing. South Africans who live in shacks hope to achieve at least their modest expectations of a water tap and a job, and those will not be easy for the Government to provide. But many people meant it when they said, as they waited to vote, that this was giving them what they wanted most of all: human dignity.

HEADLINE: As Competition Expands, Nursing Homes Diversify

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
From the corner outside his apartment on 51st Street in Borough Park, Brooklyn, Anthony Nardi can see patients from the Metropolitan Jewish Geriatric Center's nursing home one block away, sitting outside in their wheelchairs, their creased faces turned toward the warm noon sun.
That single-block distance pleases him immensely: he, too, is a patient of Metropolitan, having suffered two heart attacks and a stroke that left him weak beyond his 62 years -- but he is served by the staff in his home. 
 As a way of staying competitive with home care and the widening array of alternative services for the elderly, nursing homes in the New York area and around the country have begun to reinvent themselves, offering programs and services that reach beyond the traditional, residential institutions that so many people now say they want to avoid in favor of aging at home.
Some in the industry have compared the new nursing homes with shopping malls offering "boutique services" under one roof. Metropolitan, for example, offers adult day care and visiting nurses to people still living at home. It also has a respite program that allows people who need to go away on business or a vacation to leave an elderly relative temporarily in the nursing home's care.
The Glenn Hill Convalescent Center in Danbury, Conn., opened a housing complex for older people on the same grounds as the nursing home, offering amenities like housekeeping and meal service, while allowing them to live as independently as they like in spacious apartments designed to accommodate the needs of the elderly.
Pacific Homes in Woodland, Calif., has gone into what it calls the personal security business, in which older people in the community can pay to have the nursing home check up on them daily.
The Eddy, in Troy, N.Y., has evolved over the last decade from a 19-bed nursing home to a diversified organization providing a variety of services to some 14,000 mostly elderly clients.
For the frailest and the sickest among the elderly, and for younger people with debilitating injuries and illnesses, many nursing homes now also run subacute care units, admitting for long-term and temporary rehabilitation people who might otherwise have to remain in a hospital at greater expense.
"Our whole industry is on the verge of changing dramatically," said Craig Duncan, executive director of the Eddy. "We are moving away from an institutional base except for the frailest population, and that's because we have better-educated older consumers telling us what they want, and that is to stay out of a nursing home. If we want to maintain and gain a share of that market -- and let's face it, all of us are revenue-driven -- we had better respond."
Since these changes are fairly new, nursing home operators, both nonprofit and for-profit organizations, are still weighing which new services will prove most lucrative, said Donna L. Wagner, vice president for programs at the National Council on the Aging.
As with nursing home stays, reimbursement for these different services by Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers varies widely by state and by case. Much of the diversification by nursing homes is in areas that are not medical -- like adult day care, apartment complexes, transportation -- and are paid for out of pocket.
For someone requiring extensive care, health care experts say, putting together a home health care program either through a nursing home or other organization roughly equals, on the average, the cost of keeping someone in a traditional nursing institution, about $36,000 a year.
But the experts point out that people who can maintain their independence with support services usually heal faster and remain healthier than those forced unnecessarily into institutions, saving future health care dollars.
"Your home instead of a nursing home" is how Metropolitan's long-term home health care program was pitched to Mr. Nardi. But that also reflects the way Metropolitan and other nursing homes are responding to changing philosophies about aging that now promote independent living for people who in the past had been institutionalized.
Through Metropolitan, for example, Mr. Nardi has a home health aide who comes five days a week for seven hours each day, helping him to dress, bathe, prepare meals and go to doctors. Every two weeks he is visited by a nurse he calls a "master sergeant" who takes his blood pressure and other vital statistics.
He occasionally consults with a social worker about filing insurance forms and has blood tests done monthly in his apartment by a laboratory technician. And every four months a senior nurse comes by to re-evaluate his plan of care. Because of his age, disability and need, Mr. Nardi's costs are covered entirely by Medicare and Medicaid.
 
'I'm a Free Man Here'
 "There are days I can't go out of my house and days I can't get out of my bed," said Mr. Nardi, a chatty man who loves to talk about his days as a chef in Italian restaurants and to reel off sports trivia. "But I'm a free man here. I got my freedom all around. The home is still down the block."
There are about 1.7 million beds in more than 16,500 nursing homes nationwide: about 75 percent of them are for-profit concerns, 20 percent of them are nonprofit and 5 percent are operated by Federal, state and local governments.
Changes within the $70 billion nursing home industry will not lead to the extinction of those residential institutions, people in the industry and experts on aging say. With the United States Census Bureau predicting that the over-65 population will grow two and a half times over the next 40 years to more than 70 million people, and that the population of people over 85 will nearly triple to about 9 million, there will still be a demand for nursing homes.
 
A Range of Services
 But increasingly, people in the field say, for-profit and nonprofit nursing home operators have begun to compete not with one another but with organizations and establishments that have developed programs aimed at replacing the traditional homes. But unlike companies that provide specific services, like home care, the nursing homes hope to attract customers by providing a continuum of services that treat people, from the time they are most healthy to when they are most sick.
"They read the tea leaves correctly," said Daniel Thursz, president and chief executive officer of the National Council on the Aging. "There is still a place for nursing homes at the end of the continuum and for certain kinds of dementia. But nursing homes are facing the fact that they are only one of many alternatives and they will not be able to survive if they provide only that one service. What's going on is an important change that recognizes the desire of almost all people not to be institutionalized."
Glenn Crest, an apartment complex for older people in Danbury, Conn., was opened in December 1987 by the owners of the Glenn Hill Convalescent Center on the same grounds as the nursing home. Its owners recognized earlier than most in the industry that society was moving toward more community-based options for its increasingly aging population.
In a three-story building with 24 one-bedroom and 24 two-bedroom units -- each with a bay window, fully-equipped kitchen and bathroom, washer-dryer, living room and terrace -- Glenn Crest offers, among others services, a home-delivered meal daily, housekeeping, transportation to shopping and doctors' appointments and an emergency call system.
These services are included in the monthly rental fee, which is $1,860 for the one-bedroom apartment and $2,340 for the two-bedroom, and, like rent, is not reimbursed by insurance. Residents who get medical care in the nursing home pay extra for their treatment, which is reimbursed by either Medicare or private insurance.
Some residents have ailing spouses who live in the nursing home, and all it takes is a walk across the manicured lawns to visit. Inside the nursing home itself, Glenn Hill has a subacute care unit, respite care and a hospice.
"It made economic sense for us to expand this way," said James K. Malloy, Glenn Hill's administrator. "We've been in the business of providing services to the elderly since 1963. Reaching out to other segments of that population, meaning well people and very sick people, was logical."
 
Subacute Care
 One of the nontraditional services being most vigorously pursued by nursing homes is subacute care, which is comprehensive inpatient treatment for people recovering from illnesses like pneumonia, injuries like a broken hip or chronic diseases like arthritis that do not require the intensive level of diagnosis or surgery available at hospitals.
Usually, when nursing homes enter the subacute market, they broaden beyond geriatric clientele to include younger patients. Since they operate without the high overhead of hospitals, nursing home subacute care units typically charge 20 to 60 percent less than hospitals, according to studies by industry analysts and health maintenance organizations, which are increasingly sending patients from hospitals to such institutions.
A study last year by Dean Witter found that for appropriate patients, average daily charges in such units ranged from $300 to $550, while charges for the same treatment in acute care hospitals ran between $700 to $1,000. Health care analysts estimate that about 10 to 20 percent of general acute care hospital patients could be cared for in subacute care units at nursing homes.
Given the growth of managed medical care in the country and the increasing population of elderly people, industry analysts estimate that the subacute care units for nursing homes have the potential to grow into a $5 billion to $20 billion market in the next decade.
 
'Everyone Is Specializing'
 The field is so ripe that the American Health Care Association, which represents about 11,000 for-profit and nonprofit nursing homes, published a business guide this month to aid its members in setting up subacute care units.
"I don't know anybody in this business who just wants to keep being or buying up traditional nursing homes," said Richard F. Grosso Jr., administrator of the Lakeview Subacute Care Center in Wayne, N.J. "Everyone is specializing." His institution has changed over the last 14 years from a 120-bed traditional nursing home to a center with a variety of specialized subacute care wards, including ones for oncology and ventilators, and only 30 traditional beds.
"We shouldn't be linked to bricks and mortar," said Eli S. Feldman, chief executive officer of Metropolitan in Brooklyn. "We're here to provide the best services for the individual the way they want it, which is why we took an organization that was 100 percent institutional to where we are delivering services to 20,000 people in their own homes. We are changing as an industry. We have to evolve or we will die."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
U.S. Enters Currency Market To Prop Up Tumbling Dollar

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration intervened in foreign exchange markets today to prop up a sagging dollar and faltering investor confidence that was already pushing interest rates higher at home.
The Federal Reserve, acting for the Administration, bought dollars and sold yen as the dollar tumbled to near its lowest point against the Japanese currency since World War II. It also sold marks for dollars as the American currency seemed to accelerate its slide against the German currency. The dollar stabilized quickly against the yen and the mark after the intervention. 
 Since Tuesday, the weakening dollar has helped send long-term interest rates soaring. The yield on the 30-year bond ended at 7.30 percent today, up from 7.10 percent on Tuesday. For the Administration, which is depending on low interest rates to fuel the economy, a sharp rise in long-term rates would undermine its goals.
Investor confidence is a fragile commodity, and if it is lost, financial markets can turn sour quickly. Some currency analysts said that the Administration's apparent willingness before today to let the dollar continue to drop against the yen had been fostering concern.
In addition, they said that the 4 percent slide of the dollar against the German mark in the last three weeks was a signal that some investors were losing confidence because they were selling dollars despite the attraction of better economic growth here than in Germany.
"The dollar had fallen into the crisis zone," said John P. Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers. "There was evidence of deteriorating investor confidence in the dollar, because some investors had concluded that the Administration was content to see the dollar weaken in order to pressure Japan in the trade negotiations."
In a highly unusual move that emphasized the importance of the effort to support the dollar, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen publicly announced the intervention by the Federal Reserve. "U.S. monetary authorities intervened today in foreign exchange markets to counter disorderly conditions," Mr. Bentsen said. "This is in line with our previously articulated policy that recognizes that excessive volatility is counterproductive to growth."
While it is not unprecedented for the Treasury to acknowledge interventions in foreign currency markets, its normal policy is not to discuss such moves.
Several economic analysts have argued for some time that the Administration's Japan trade policy, which was tacitly fostering a weaker dollar and a stronger yen, was working against its domestic fiscal and monetary policy, which aimed to hold down long-term interest rates to stimulate steady growth. The fact that the Administration had to step in today to bolster the dollar against the yen seemed to be an acknowledgment that it could no long pursue this contradictory approach.
The Federal Reserve started buying dollars this morning as the currency suddenly plunged against both the mark and yen. The dollar was on the verge of collapsing through the 100.35-yen level, the post-World War II low that was set last August. But the dollar also fell against the German mark to 1.64 marks from 1.66, a big move for one day -- especially when the fundamentals of the American economy appear to be sound.
By the end of trading in New York, the dollar was at 101.70 yen, up from 101.36 on Thursday. Against the mark the dollar was at 1.6540, up from its morning level but down from 1.6622 the day before.
 
Viewed as Dangerous
 American officials have always viewed such currency volatility as dangerous. Not only does it hamper trade -- since corporations, exporters and importers cannot know what value a currency will have from week to week -- but it plays havoc with interest rates. When the dollar weakens, it fuels inflation by making imports more expensive. More inflation, in turn, can force the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates and traders to sell, pushing long-term interest rates up.
A falling dollar can also force the Treasury Department to raise interest rates on its notes and bonds to keep attracting foreign buyers. Such upward pressure on interest rates is exactly the opposite of what the White House wants right now, as rising rates would crimp economic growth.
While the intervention stabilized the dollar today, the Administration's resolve was likely to be tested in the weeks ahead as currency traders try to find out how far the Treasury and the Fed will go to defend the dollar.
Market analysts and traders cited a combination of factors that prompted the dollar's decline. One was the widespread expectation among speculators that the new Japanese Government would be too weak to resolve its trade dispute with Washington. That might mean that the Clinton team would rely on a strong yen for the time being to force Tokyo to open its markets. When the yen is strong against the dollar everything Japan sells is more expensive and Japanese exports are hurt.
As for the German mark, analysts pointed to the fact that recent strong growth data from Germany suggested that the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, might not lower interest rates as quickly as expected. If German rates remain relatively high, investors will be tempted to keep more money in marks than in American dollars.
Many analysts believed that as long as Japan refused to negotiate on American terms an agreement to open some of its closed markets, the Clinton Administration would rely on a strengthening yen to squeeze Tokyo. The Administration's policy was viewed as "benign neglect" of the dollar at best and "malign neglect" at worst, Mr. Lipsky of Salomon Brothers said.
But what may have spurred today's further drop in the dollar against the yen was the formation of the new, weak, minority Cabinet in Tokyo, led by Tsutomu Hata. Such a fractured Japanese Cabinet seems unlikely to be able to adopt the tough, market-opening reforms sought by Washington. This seems to have convinced some currency speculators that Washington would rely on a strong yen.

HEADLINE: A Brown Seeks Her Own Political Identity

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Kathleen Brown was in tears. In a few hours she would announce her candidacy for governor of California, and her brother, Jerry, a former governor himself, had told her that he would not join dozens of other family members at her speech in San Francisco.
Mr. Brown resented being trotted before the cameras when his father was Governor and was not about to play a prop again for his younger sister. "I've got my own ideas on how you do these things," he said. "Maybe a little of the schmaltz is all right. But that's not the way I would have done it." 
 But Kathleen Brown would not hear of it and prevailed on her often-aloof brother to show up for the February announcement. "I wanted him there and it was important to me," Ms. Brown recalled. "He's my brother. I said, 'Hey, this is family.' "
Family, in fact, is what Kathleen Brown's race for the Democratic nomination for governor is all about. Ms. Brown, who for the last three years has been the state treasurer, readily admits that she would not be running, let alone leading in the polls, if her name were not Brown, if her father, Edmund G. Brown, had not had the job, and if her brother, Edmund G. Brown Jr., had not followed in his footsteps.
While her last name has catapulted Ms. Brown this far, it is also her biggest liability. The Browns are perhaps the most absorbing -- some say peculiar -- political dynasty short of the Kennedys in the country. As she struggles to define herself and refute critics who say she has been a disappointing candidate, she finds herself caught between the competing impulses of family loyalty and political preservation.
These inherent conflicts were on display at the announcement in San Francisco. Her 89-year-old father, who is still beloved by Californians and adores Kathleen, his youngest daughter, is in poor health and was confined to his home. While Ms. Brown wanted her brother there with 45 other relatives to present a picture of family unity, her advisers were not nearly so eager. And when a reporter asked Ms. Brown whether she was keeping her distance from her brother, he bounded to the stage and, uncharacteristically, kissed his sister.
Yet, the embrace was misleading. Mr. Brown has refused to endorse his sister and has spoken highly of a dark-horse candidate, Tom Hayden, the anti-war leader who is now in the State Senate. (Kathleen Brown endorsed her brother when he ran for President in 1992.)
For those who missed the picture of the bad-boy iconoclast kissing his good-girl traditionalist sister, the seasoned publicity machine of Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, faxed copies to newspapers up and down the state. "Jerry Brown is the ghost in the attic, the crazy aunt locked in the basement," said Dan Schnur, the Wilson campaign's acid-tongued spokesman. "And he is going to be a constant reminder to the people of California of all the things they don't like about Kathleen Brown."
He may be regarded by many as a political oddball, but how could he not endorse his own sister?
Ms. Brown was asked the question over a decaffeinated cappuccino and a toasted bagel at a favorite breakfast spot of hers on Sunset Boulevard the other day. She stared down her interviewer in mock disbelief and then broke out laughing: "This is Jerry Brown we're talking about."
John Garamendi, the state's insurance commissioner and Ms. Brown's leading rival in the Democratic primary on June 7, is also making an issue of the Brown clan. He hardly needed to be more explicit when he declared at the recent state party convention that he was the candidate who "does not believe he is entitled to this job." His campaign manager, Darry Sragow, says Ms. Brown has a "coronation complex."
 
Help, Then Hindrance?
 The conventional wisdom is that the Brown legacy may help Ms. Brown draw votes in the primary but would be a liability in the general election when she needs to broaden her appeal. Saying he was simply staying out of politics, Jerry Brown denied in a telephone interview from Oakland, Calif., that he was trying to help his sister by not endorsing her. And he put her lead in the polls in stark, if not self-serving terms: "You know that her connection to me is the key reason that Garamendi can't move."
Since Ms. Brown's public life consists of only one term as treasurer and service on the Los Angeles school board more than a decade ago, it is no surprise that she is overshadowed by memories of her father and brother. But their vastly different approaches to government are obsolete in an era of fiscal turmoil, when California has lost its allure.
Pat Brown's legacy as Governor from 1959 to 1967 was a free-spending and fast-building California. He beat Richard M. Nixon in 1962 but lost to Ronald Reagan in 1966. Even those who do not remember the elder Mr. Brown recall Jerry Brown's campaigns for President in 1976, 1980 and 1992 and his stewardship of California from 1975 to 1983, with his futuristic notions about the environment and technology.
 
Combining 2 Styles
 In the interview, Ms. Brown, who got her law degree from Fordham University in 1984, gave a nod to the legacies of her better-known family members while trying to establish her own identity. After protesting the inevitable comparisons ("I am my own person," she said), Ms. Brown suggested that she was striving for a hybrid between the back-slapping appeal of her father and the more remote and more intellectually curious Jerry Brown.
"I am well aware of the great strengths my dad had and of his limitations," she said. "And I think in some ways my brother reacted to what he perceived as the shortcomings of my father's administration. In my dad's era, there was so much of 'all politics is local.' And when my brother came to the governorship he brought his extraordinary global vision and he ignored the local. He didn't want to build new highways.
"I feel that you can't do it one way or another."
Unlike her brother, who had a competitive relationship with his father, Ms. Brown is known as her father's daughter. She shares his easy way with people and seeks to benefit from the nostalgia for him, peppering her speeches with tales of growing up with Pat Brown. "Kathleen is Pat's favorite," said Bob Mulholland, a Democratic consultant in Sacramento who is close to the family. "This is a father who really loves his kids but really shines when Kathleen comes into the room."
In another contrast with her brother, who is single, Ms. Brown emphasizes that as a woman and a 48-year-old grandmother, she would bring a new perspective to the governorship.
For months, however, Ms. Brown, whose slogan when she ran for treasurer was "a different shade of Brown" has been widely perceived as beige -- too bland when contrasted with the passion of her father and brother. She was also attacked for being unable to advance a clear vision.
Even worse, she was labeled wishy-washy in shifting her positions, like her 11th-hour decision to oppose the North American Free Trade Agreement on the ground that it would cost the state too many jobs.
Yet, Ms. Brown has maintained a comfortable lead over the cash-strapped Mr. Garamendi and Mr. Hayden, and is viewed as the easy favorite for the nomination in part because her family name has allowed her to dwarf her opponents in contributions. She also benefits by drawing on the female majority that votes in the Democratic primary, and polls show her ahead of Mr. Wilson.
Still, Ms. Brown was worried enough to reshuffle her senior staff in March. She hired Clint Reilly, a bright consultant with a reputation as a hired gun, to run her campaign, and at a recent state party convention, Mr. Reilly unveiled what he said was a new Kathleen Brown.
In a well-delivered speech, Ms. Brown said her priority would be the economy, and she hammered away at a new anthem: "Jobs for a million people." But many political analysts said her new vision was hardly ambitious given economic trends showing that a million new jobs would be created in that period anyway.
 
'A Person on My Own'
 Ms. Brown was sure-footed at a news conference afterward, until the questioning went beyond the subjects at hand. She stumbled when asked about a controversy over whether to divert water to Los Angeles from Mono Lake in Northern California.
"She was hitting buttons on jobs," said Shirley Blumberg, a delegate from Mammoth. "But I didn't think it came from her gut. She hasn't managed yet to say, 'I am a person on my own. I am not under the direction of my father and mother.' "
Ms. Brown defends her early performance, saying she is confident that she is far more capable than Mr. Wilson but acknowledging that she has not always succeeded in articulating a clear message. "The problem has been distilling it into its essence," she said.
She allowed how it is not always easy being a Brown. "How many kids would hear their mother on '60 Minutes' asked, 'Who's smarter?' " she said with a laugh. For the record, Bernice Brown replied to Morley Safer on the program last year: "I think Jer---- Well, I---- Kathy is smart. Don't misunderstand. But Jerry's brilliant." Softening the blow, she called her daughter "a better politician."
Maybe that is why Ms. Brown does not turn to her brother for political advice. (Still, Ms. Brown insists that they are close enough that they spent Easter together.)
In keeping with smart politics, the Brown campaign has already has made several decisions to differentiate Ms. Brown from her 56-year-old brother. For example, advisers said Ms. Brown steered clear of supporting an insect spraying program for fear that it would remind voters of her brother's much-attacked sluggishness on the medfly controversy when he was Governor.
Jerry Brown does not seem worried about how his own legacy might affect his sister's aspirations. He is host of a radio program out of Oakland, Calif., and wants nothing to do with the brand of politics that propelled him to the governor's office and that Kathleen Brown is now practicing. "I did the hack politics," he said.
But John Buchanan of Los Angeles, a delegate at the state party convention, sympathizes with Kathleen Brown's familial tribulations. "What's she supposed to do, disown her brother?" he asked. "Of course not."

HEADLINE: On Return, Gay Native Son Is Killed, And a Hometown Is Looking Inward

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SMITHTON, Pa.

 BODY:
Two years ago, Paul Edward Steckman gave up his Manhattan apartment and moved back to this tiny town on the Youghiogheny River to care for his ailing mother, leaving behind the career he had nurtured over two decades in New York playing the piano at restaurants, hotels and piano bars.
Mr. Steckman, then 44, moved into his mother's home, one block from the church where he used to play the organ -- and from the spot where he was beaten to death last month at 1:30 A.M. by a 17-year-old man who said that Mr. Steckman had made sexual advances. 
 The killing of a native son, a gay native son, has shaken Smithton, where everybody knows everybody, and most everybody has had something to do with coal mining, steel mills or the Jones Brewery, which sits on the edge of town, next to the railroad tracks and the river.
For some, Mr. Steckman's death was a chastening lesson in small-town intolerance. But it may also have been a tragic mismatch between a young man determined to prove his toughness and an older man who drank too much and, for Smithton, was shockingly open about his sexual interests.
 
Chilling Effect
 "It's just unheard of, a crime like this in a close-knit little town like Smithton, where people will do anything for each other," said Nancy Ullom, a longtime friend of Mr. Steckman's. "Paul was always a little different, even in high school, but everybody loved him for his sense of humor. I can't say I'm a gay-rights activist, but it never mattered to me what Paul was. He was just a wonderful friend. If there is anybody else in the area who's gay, they'd probably think twice now about expressing it."
When it comes to attitudes toward homosexuality, there is a vast gulf between Smithton and New York. About a third of Smithton's 300 or so citizens are over 65, many of them old friends of Mr. Steckman's mother, Opal, and they refuse to believe that Mr. Steckman was homosexual.
Harold Axel, a retired steelworker whose green-awninged house overlooks the spot on Second Street where Mr. Steckman was killed, said homosexuality simply did not exist here.
"Paul was just in the wrong place at the wrong time," he said. "Nobody can convince me that Paul made advances. If he was a homosexual, that would have been something that occurred in New York, not here. We ain't got none of them around here."
 
Trouble Was Coming
 But the younger men in Smithton, the ones who hang out at the Zoo, the rowdiest of the town's bars and the one Mr. Steckman went to on the night of his death, had a different view. "Everybody knew he was a homosexual," said Ron Johnston. "He would come into the Zoo and flirt with people. It was real obvious."
Down the street, at the Wood Shed, where fishermen on the Youghiogheny (pronounced yahk-uh-GAY-nee) buy maggots, red worms, wax worms, meal worms and night crawlers, or hang out around the pool table, some said it was inevitable that Mr. Steckman would find trouble.
"He would proposition people," said Eric Celapino. "Maybe in New York you could get away with that, but not here."
Mr. Steckman's New York friends, who knew him by his professional name, Paul Edwards, are still trying to understand his death in a place so near, yet so far, from New York. They are planning a memorial service for him on May 1 at the Bitter End, a Greenwich Village music club.
"Paul was killed so senselessly," said Pam Wilson, who knew him for 10 years and whose husband owns the Bitter End. "I feel like I've lost part of my soul. Paul was incredibly talented. But he was also a very vulnerable, nonviolent person."
 
Deadly Encounter
 The person charged with beating Mr. Steckman to death is Samuel Louis Sethman, a 6-foot-2-inch, 250-pound 11th grader.
According to testimony at his preliminary hearing on April 7, Mr. Sethman told state troopers that he had been drinking from a case of stolen beer when Mr. Steckman, "a known queer," had approached him on the street and asked him to go to a bar. Mr. Sethman said he had told Mr. Steckman, who was 5 feet 8 inches and 170 pounds, to leave him alone but that Mr. Steckman had followed him and pinched his buttocks. Mr. Sethman said he became enraged and began to strike Mr. Steckman.
Mr. Sethman, who is free on $100,000 bond, will be tried as an adult because of the seriousness of the charge. He will be arraigned in the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas in May. His lawyer, John DeBarardinis, has advised him not to speak to reporters.
Smithton people try to rationalize Mr. Sethman's actions. "I think he wanted to beat him up to be cool, to say, 'I beat up a faggot,' but then it went too far," said Michael Gluz. "I've heard people say Paul Steckman deserved to be beat up, but nobody deserves dying like that."
People in Smithton also talk a lot about Paul Steckman these days, trying to understand his killing, and his life. They remember that in high school Mr. Steckman played for the glee club and dated and became engaged to a local girl, who called off the wedding at the last moment.
They remember that Mr. Steckman was one class ahead of the father of Mr. Sethman, and they remember the string of misfortunes that trailed the young Sam Sethman: his abandonment by his mother, then his father's death and the death of the grandmother who was raising him, leaving him to live with an aunt.
People in Smithton also remember that a few weeks before Mr. Steckman's killing Mr. Sethman was walking around town with 50 stitches in his head, a bloody memento of a fight in the next town.
Behind the bar at the Longhorn Saloon, where Mr. Steckman used to buy fish sandwiches for his mother, Betty Nagy talked about Sam Sethman's reputation as the rough kid in town. "Whenever there would be new graffiti or something, everybody would say, 'Oh, that's Sammy again,' " said Mrs. Nagy who, like many Smithton residents, is intensely loyal to the Steckman family.
Mr. Steckman's New York friends said they had warned him that a return to small-town life might be too big a change from life on the Upper West Side. But Mr. Steckman was concerned about his mother's failing health, discouraged about his career, which had flagged during the recession, and he had no personal commitment to keep him in the city.
"He had had long-term relationships, but not since the mid-80's," said Brian Hamilton, a Los Angeles actor. "He'd lost a lot, a lot of friends to AIDS, and I think he sometimes wondered why they all died and he was left."
Liz Temkin, who said she would talk to Mr. Steckman four or five times a day, said he had seemed lonely. "He was very involved with his friends, and he had some relationships with men, but nothing that lasted long," she said. "That was a void in his life. He went to gay bars sometimes. But with AIDS and everything, I think he was very careful."
While Mr. Steckman's New York friends described him as comfortable with his sexual orientation, Mr. Furno thought otherwise.
"Coming back to Smithton was a regrouping time for him," said Mr. Furno. "He was struggling with being gay, whether it was acceptable to God, or acceptable to his mother, or even acceptable to himself."
 
Ill-Starred Return Home
 Looking back, he and others say, it was clear that Mr. Steckman did not take easily to life in Smithton. Twice he was picked up for driving while intoxicated. His habit of staying up late at night bothered his mother. He developed a relationship with a man in a nearby town, but it did not last. And when the other man suddenly broke it off, Mr. Steckman was so distraught that he made harassing phone calls to the man, who complained to law enforcement officials.
In Smithton, Mr. Steckman renewed friendships with three women he had known as a child, calling every day when one was treated for cancer and letting another stay with him for weeks while she planned her future. And he had pleasant relationships with his neighbors, many of whom admired his devotion to his mother.
"He was a very sociable person," said Nancy Bures, Mr. Steckman's sister, who lives in nearby Greensburg. "But of course I worried when he came home to live. I really didn't think it was a good idea."
Much of Mr. Steckman's life in Smithton was devoted to caring for his mother, who was in her 80's.
"He was still, in his 40's, working out his feelings for his parents," said Mr. Furno. "Caring for his mother, who was going blind and had emphysema, was not easy for him. But it gave him a purpose, and a free place to live. When Opal finally went into the nursing home, Paul visited every day and fed her."
 
Lofty Ambitions
 Mr. Steckman's friends say he was devastated when his mother died exactly four months before he was killed. But in the months between his mother's death and his own, he began to make a name for himself in Western Pennsylvania music circles, performing at private parties, at the Vista Hotel in Pittsburgh and at the Latrobe Country Club, where he played the night before he was killed.
"He really wanted to be a star, not someone who played in a restaurant, where most people don't stop talking enough to listen," said Ms. Temkin.
Mr. Steckman never intended to stay in Smithton: Soon after his mother's death, he began planning to move to Pittsburgh or New York, where there would be both a gay community and music jobs.
On the Saturday night he was killed, Ms. Bures said, her brother was to have drinks with a friend. But at 9:30 p.m. on March 27, the friend called to say she was too tired to go out. Mr. Steckman went out by himself. It was, apparently, on his way home that he ran into Mr. Sethman.
"He was not a person who would pick a fight," Mr. Bures said. "No one deserves to be beaten like that. I still can't believe it. Not in Smithton."

HEADLINE: Many Doctors Don't Offer Their Workers Insurance

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
One in three doctors' offices does not provide health insurance for employees, the American Medical Association reported today.
In this respect, it said, doctors are like many other small businesses: they would incur additional costs if they were required to provide coverage for employees, as President Clinton and many other Democrats have proposed. 
 Doctors tend to support the expansion of health insurance coverage, but "many medical practices are small businesses and are likely to be adversely affected by legislation that raises payroll expenses," the report said.
The A.M.A. focused on offices with 25 or fewer doctors, which accounted for 98 percent of all practices in the survey. It found that one-third of these offices did not provide health benefits to employees. But the researchers said that doctors' offices were more likely than other small businesses of similar size to offer health benefits.
 
Few Subsidies for Doctors
 Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, small businesses with low average wages would be eligible for Federal subsidies to help defray the costs of health insurance. But doctors have relatively high incomes, and their earnings raise the average for a doctor's office, so that few offices would qualify for subsidies, the association said.
The proposed employer mandate is at the heart of President Clinton's health plan. Mr. Clinton would require employers to buy health insurance for their workers. Many small businesses oppose this requirement, saying they cannot afford the extra expense.
But some big businesses that already provide health insurance coverage contend that all employers should be required to do so.
The Safeway grocery chain said today that it would put a message endorsing universal coverage on paper bags used at one of its stores in Washington. The message says, "Safeway supports affordable health care for all Americans."
Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to visit the store next week to show appreciation for the company's position. Brian G. Dowling, a Safeway spokesman, said the company might put a similar message on paper bags at other stores after testing reaction at the supermarket in Northwest Washington.
Safeway has 1,078 stores and 105,000 employees. Mr. Dowling said that at least 90 percent of the workers received health insurance through the company.
Mr. Dowling said Safeway was not specifically supporting Mr. Clinton's health plan. "We support health care reform," Mr. Dowling said. "We have not endorsed any particular plan. However, we believe in universal coverage. An employment-based system is the most realistic and practical approach to achieve universal coverage."
The announcement by Safeway came as Clinton Administration officials tried to generate fresh support for the idea of an employer mandate. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and Robert E. Rubin, assistant to the President for economic policy, said today that they felt sure employers would eventually support the proposal.
"After the posturing and negotiation, businesses will support our position," Mr. Rubin said at a briefing for journalists. "As we get closer to the end of the legislative process, we will get substantial support from businesses."
He and Mr. Reich refused to comment on Congressional proposals that would exempt companies with fewer than 10 employees from any requirement to buy or provide health insurance.
The American Medical Association found that the likelihood of insurance coverage tended to increase with the size of doctors' offices. Fifty-eight percent of solo practitioners offer health insurance to their employees, the survey found. Seventy-four percent of offices with two to four doctors offer coverage, and 85 percent of offices with five to nine doctors offer such benefits, it said. Slightly more than half the doctors surveyed were solo practitioners.
 
A Broader Recommendation
 For several years the medical association asserted that all employers should be required to provide health benefits to employees. But at a meeting in New Orleans in December, the policy-making arm of the A.M.A., the house of delegates, voted to recommend other approaches as well.
The alternatives include tax-free medical savings accounts and an "individual mandate," requiring people to obtain insurance with or without help from employers.
Researchers at the American Medical Association said that some doctors provided free health care to their nurses, receptionists, laboratory technicians and other office employees, regardless of whether the employees had insurance.
The association found that specialists with the highest earnings, including surgeons, anesthesiologists and radiologists, were more likely to offer health benefits to their employees. These specialists must offer such benefits to attract highly trained personnel, the report said.

HEADLINE: Warning To China On Trade

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
President Clinton has decided to designate China as one of the world's biggest pirates of American products, a step that could lead to new trade sanctions against Beijing by the end of the year, Administration officials said today.
The officials said Mr. Clinton reached that decision after his top trade and economic advisers recommended unanimously this afternoon that he take steps to punish China for its pirating of American compact discs and computer software. 
 The decision is scheduled to be announced on Saturday by the office of the United States trade representative, the officials said. Under law, Mr. Clinton must submit to Congress each year a list of the worst violators of American copyrights and other intellectual property rights. This year, the deadline falls on Saturday night.
 
Deadline on Trade Status
 With a separate June 3 deadline looming for his decision on whether to withdraw China's preferential trade status, the President's decision is certain to send to Beijing a strong message of American unwillingness to compromise its trade standards. But by not making the announcement himself, Mr. Clinton will likely avoid casting himself as an ogre in the sensitive negotiations that American officials still hope will produce a breakthrough allowing the Administration to extend China's most-favored-nation status.
In deciding to designate Beijing as a "Priority Foreign Country" under the 1988 trade measure known as Super 301, Mr. Clinton is singling out perhaps the most notorious offender of laws intended to stop other countries from making illegal copies of American recordings, software and books and profiting from their sales without paying royalties to the artists, authors and designers who created them.
A recent estimate by the trade representative's office concluded that China's failure to crack down on pirate companies cost American entertainment countries some $800 million in lost exports last year.
 
Officials Express Concer
 Some Administration officials had expressed concern that adding China to the list might merely reinforce Chinese intransigence, causing Beijing to refuse to take the steps on human rights that the United States has said it must take to maintain its preferential trade status. Because China has emerged as a big trading partner, American officials are deeply wary of having that relationship disrupted.
But Mr. Clinton's advisers told him during a telephone conference this afternoon that China's violations of American intellectual property rights were so egregious that to overlook them, even this year, would undermine the credibility of American trade law.
At the same time, recent progress by China toward meeting the human rights standards imposed by the United States has led some of Mr. Clinton's advisers to argue that tough action by the Administration now would not necessarily lead to a fatal rupture.
The designation of China as a priority offender under the Super 301 law brings no immediate penalties against Beijing, meaning that any showdown over pirating will be delayed until after the June 3 deadline on China's most-favored-nation status. But if China does not agree to a solution after negotiations lasting seven to nine months, the United States would be required under law to impose restrictions on selected Chinese exports.
The United States last added China to the pirating list in 1991, and the threat of retaliation then forced the Chinese to adopt modern copyright, patent and trademark laws. But Congressional critics led by Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat, have contended that China has failed to enforce its new restrictions.
According to Senator Baucus, who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee on international trade, at least 26 pirate compact disk factories are operating in China with a production capacity of 50 million CD's a year. In addition to causing American recording artists to lose more than $820 million last year in revenue, the Chinese factories are also beginning to compete with American subidiaries in other Asian markets.
"The situation is intolerable," Senator Baucus said recently. "If a country as big as China can go into full-scale piracy, our efforts in all other countries, no matter how successful, will become meaningless."

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Jumped by 11.1% in March

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
Encouraged by a buoyant economy and a snapback from poor weather, sales of new homes climbed 11.1 percent in March, to an annual pace of 739,000, the Government reported today.
The unexpectedly brisk sales, the highest since September, pushed inventories of unsold homes back under five months' worth, and suggested that the industry's activity would continue at a high level for some time, despite higher mortgage rates. 
 "Job prospects, income prospects have historically been more important determinants than interest rates" for housing, said David W. Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association.
The Commerce Department also reported today that once again, growth in personal incomes somewhat exceeded growth in personal spending during March. Incomes rose $33.1 billion, or six-tenths of 1 percent, while spending rose $18.9 billion, or four-tenths of 1 percent.
But while housing analysts welcomed the sales results, which nearly equaled the surge of 12.1 percent in new dwellings on which construction started in March, they cautioned that the current pace would probably ease a bit as the year unfolded.
"Can you justify continued sales and production at the very elevated levels" that prevailed in late 1993, Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, asked rhetorically. "My answer is no. Housing has probably seen the peak of its activity for a while."
The market has already benefited, he and other specialists said, from the previously indecisive buyers who were driven to action when mortgage rates reversed course and began to rise last autumn.
Sales rose last month in all regions but the Midwest, though the gains were uneven. In the Northeast, sales climbed 38 percent, to a pace of 69,000 houses a year on a seasonally adjusted basis. The South reported an advance of 19.6 percent, to 329,000, while sales in the West edged up 1.4 percent, to 215,000.
In the Midwest, sales edged down by eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 126,000, according to the report, published jointly by the Departments of Commerce and of Housing and Urban Development.
The stock of unsold houses would last 4.9 months at the current sales pace, down from 5.4 months in February, and matching the level for October and November, when sales were comparably strong.
The actual number of new houses sold last month -- that is, without annualization or adjustment for recurring seasonal variation -- was 75,000, or 25 percent more than the total in March 1993.
The average price of a new home sold last month rose by $1,000, to $154,500, while the median price -- half the houses cost more, half less -- edged up $100, to $130,000.
Sales of new homes generally run only at about half the pace of housing starts, which were 1,473,000 last month, because the sales figures do not include dwellings built on buyers' own lots or units in apartment houses.
Sales of existing homes were reported earlier this week to have rebounded 5.7 percent in March, to a pace of 4.06 million.
The income and spending report was generally as expected, analysts said, and included upward revisions in both elements for February, and downward revisions for January.
Income from all sources ran at an annual rate of $5.63 trillion, up six-tenths of 1 percent, with February's gain now put at 1.8 percent, the biggest since December 1992, instead of the 1.3 percent that had been initially reported.
The exceptionally big rise in February mainly reflected a rebound from uninsured losses to homes and business property from the California earthquake, subsidy payments to farmers, and bonuses to workers in the automobile industry. Without these special factors, the Government said, the February increase would have been only four-tenths of 1 percent.
The effects of the earthquake showed up mainly in losses of rental income to property owners.
The higher spending last month was concentrated in cars and other big-ticket durable goods, which rose at a pace of $10 billion, in the face of higher interest rates. Spending in the far larger services category rose $8.6 billion, while spending on nondurable goods was mostly unchanged.

HEADLINE: Newspaper Guild Is Last of 12 Unions at The Times to Approve a Contract

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
Members of the New York Times unit of the Newspaper Guild of New York decisively approved a new contract with the newspaper yesterday that is to run through the year 2000, guild officials said last night.
With the ratification, The Times has secured contracts with all of its 12 unions through the end of the century. All of the newspaper's union contracts now contain no-strike clauses.
The guild represents about 1,600 news, advertising, clerical, cafeteria and other employees. When voting was completed last night, officials said 577 members had voted yes and 86 had voted no, with 3 abstentions. 
 The union said the wage increases it won were comparable to those won by The Times's other unions and amounted to 3.5 percent, 3.2 percent and 3.1 percent over three years, beginning retroactively in 1993. Wages for the period after 1996 are subject to renegotiation.
In a joint statement after the union vote, Barry F. Lipton, the guild president, and John M. O'Brien, The Times's executive vice president and deputy general manager, expressed pleasure at the agreement.
"Our members clearly saw this as a very good settlement," Mr. Lipton said, "particularly given the tough economic conditions that prevail in our industry."
Mr. O'Brien said: "By working together, we will have the best opportunity to build a strong and secure future for our newspaper."
The Times won the right to reclassify some categories of work other than journalists, resulting in lower pay levels for some new employees. A spokesman for the newspaper, William K. Adler, said the pay of current employees will not be affected by the reclassifications. Mr. Adler also said the newspaper could not estimate how many new employees would be hired at the lower wages.
Union leaders told their members at meetings yesterday that they had defeated broad management efforts to weaken existing job-security protections. But in one major area, the union made significant concessions. Under the prior contract, employees with 10 years of seniority at the newspaper were given "enhanced job security" protections and could be laid off only for cause in most cases.
That protection will apparently now be given only to current employees when they reach 16 years of service. It appears that new employees will qualify for that protection when they have worked at The Times for 20 years.
A second major job-security issue involved the extent to which seniority, a traditional union protection, would continue to protect union employees in the event that The Times lays off employees. New York newspaper executives have complained for years that seniority rules have hampered their ability to manage their newsrooms.
The issue is particularly sensitive because The Times has said it is beginning an effort to reduce its white-collar workforce and has not ruled out layoffs. Yesterday The Times spokesman, Mr. Adler, said the new contract reflected management's "desire" to achieve staff reductions through buyouts and other voluntary means. But Mr. Adler said, "it is not possible to rule out layoffs under any circumstances."
The prior contract assured employees that any layoffs would begin on a last-hired, first-fired basis. But it provided an exception that said employees of "outstanding ability" or those involved in special functions could have their jobs preserved.
In a concession by the union, The Times has now broadened that exception and the newspaper's management can dismiss more senior employees "if The Times determines" that more junior employees have superior qualifications. The Times's determination can be overturned in arbitration only if "clearly erroneous."

HEADLINE: Consumers' Optimism Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for April rose to 92.6 from 91.5 in March, according to people with access to the survey.
The preliminary reading for April issued two weeks ago was 94.2. In February, the Michigan index reached 93.2. 
 The index is based on 100, set in 1966. A monthly reading rising closer to 100 indicates that consumers are becoming more optimistic about the economy. Since 1966, the peak for the sentiment index has been 101, set in March 1984. The low was 51.7, set in April 1980.
The university also reported that its April index of consumer expectations had fallen to 82.6 from 85.1 in March. The early reading was 84.8.
The April index of current economic conditions rose to 108.1 from 101.4 in March. The early reading was 108.9.

HEADLINE: U.S. Changes Aim of S.& L. Enforcement

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
Federal savings and loan regulators announced today a new enforcement policy that focuses on active institutions, rather than failed ones, ending another chapter in the effort to go after wrongdoers from the nation's costliest financial crisis.
The Office of Thrift Supervision, which is part of the Treasury Department, said the change in enforcement priorities stemmed from the improved financial condition of the industry. 
 The pace of institutional closings by the office has dropped sharply. Last year there were only 299.
Some of the biggest and most publicized civil actions were brought by the office after the collapse of hundreds of savings and loans in the 1980's. Those cases involved seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution from some of the nation's leading law and accounting firms.
 
Discussed for More Than a Year
 Carolyn Lieberman, the acting chief counsel of the thrift office, said the shift in enforcement priorities had been discussed within the agency for more than a year and was a result of several factors: the closing of fewer institutions, fewer requests from officials in the field for enforcement actions, and the ability of other agencies, like the Resolution Trust Corporation, to get monetary relief in cases that the Office of Thrift Supervision chose not to pursue.
The office regulates the industry while the Resolution Trust Corporation disposes of the portfolios of failed institutions.
Savings and loan industry officials said they were delighted by the change in enforcement policy. They said they were particularly happy with the Office of Thrift Supervision's decision to give priority to forcing dishonest executives to pay restitution to existing institutions, rather than pursuing dishonest executives of failed institutions and forcing them to repay the Federal Government for the losses borne by taxpayers.
"We really think it's a logical focus of their limited resources in preserving the health of the industry," said Robert P. Schmermund, a spokesman for the Savings and Community Bankers of America, an industry group based here.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Platinum Soars Amid Signs Of Demand by Auto Makers

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Platinum prices soared yesterday amid signs that demand for the metal by the Big Three auto makers is rising during a period of instability in South Africa, the world's top platinum producer.
The active July platinum futures contract jumped $7.70, to $402.30 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Other precious metals also rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, June gold gained $1, to $377.80 an ounce, while May silver rose 9.8 cents, to $5.338 an ounce.
Platinum prices have been seesawing in recent days over worries that the first all-race elections in South Africa would be accompanied by widespread violence. But even after no large outbreaks materialized, investors were worried yesterday about the policies of a new government, which is expected to have Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, at its head.
"Everybody's beginning to wonder what is going to happen," said Nina Lipton, research manager with the Platinum Guild International in New York. "The cost of production is likely to go up because the Government will have to create more taxation for the social policy programs they've outlined."
 
Used in Catalytic Converters
 Most of the world's supply of platinum comes from South Africa and Russia, both politically and socially unstable.
Prices also climbed amid signs of rising sales by the Big Three auto makers, which use platinum in making catalytic converters.
The Ford Motor Company reported a 58 percent gain in first-quarter earnings yesterday, following strong reports from Ford, Chrysler and General Motors indicating that despite rising interest rates the auto makers may have their best year since 1989.
"It appears the auto sector is booming, and the trend is for better growth overseas, with a booming business returning to Europe" after years of recession, Ms. Lipton said.
On other commodity markets, lumber prices rose their daily trading limit in nearby contracts in a continued technical correction after weeks of losses. Lumber prices have plunged amid slack demand and oversupply. May lumber rose $15, to $332.50 for 1,000 board feet, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Coffee prices continued to move higher on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York after news that Brazil did not plan to release millions of pounds of coffee for sale at one time. Investors had feared such a development would flood the market and send cash prices plunging. May coffee rose 1.10 cents, to 89.15 cents a pound.
Energy prices advanced on the New York Mercantile Exchange on word of gasoline refinery shutdowns. June crude oil rose 33 cents, to $16.90 a barrel; May unleaded gasoline rose 0.61 cent, to 49.20 cents a gallon, and May heating oil rose 0.53 cent, to 47.05 cents a gallon.

Antar Gets 12 1/2 Years For Fraud

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: NEWARK, April 29

 BODY:
Eddie Antar, the founder of the Crazy Eddie electronics chain, was sentenced today to 12 1/2 years in prison for racketeering and stock fraud, more than four years after his company collapsed and he fled the country.
Mr. Antar, who was convicted in July, was also ordered to repay $121 million to stockholders who were victimized in what authorities described as one of the country's largest stock frauds. 
 Mr. Antar, legs shackled and wearing blue prison garb, apologized for the "pain and agony I caused my family."
"I don't ask for mercy," he said, "I ask for balance." Mr. Antar, 46, has been in jail since he was arrested in Israel in June 1992. He was extradited to the United States in January 1993.
 
Prosecutor's Comparison
 United States Attorney Michael Chertoff, who prosecuted the case, called Mr. Antar the "Darth Vader of capitalism."
Mr. Antar's brother, Mitchell, 38, was sentenced to 4 1/4 years in prison and ordered to pay $3 million in restitution, the amount the Government contended he made through sales of falsely inflated stock. Neither brother was fined.
A third brother, Allen, 44, was acquitted. Three former executives of Crazy Eddie who pleaded guilty are to be sentenced next month.
Eddie Antar said he was confident that he and Mitchell would be exonerated on appeal.
The brothers were accused of receiving more than $80 million by selling stock that they artificially increased in value through inventory inflation and other means.
In February 1990, the Securities and Exchange Commission won a $73 million judgment against them, which with interest is now $90 million. The agency has since identified more than $72 million that Eddie Antar accumulated, and it has collected more than $62 million. The money collected is to be disbursed to the victims in the case.
At its peak, Crazy Eddie had 43 stores and reported annual sales of $350 million, although tens of millions of dollars of that figure were in false sales.

HEADLINE: Prosecution Claims Records Prove Rifkin Is Not Insane

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., April 29

 BODY:
Joel Rifkin, who has confessed to killing 17 women, was an honor student in high school, made the dean's list in college and scored in the superior category on intelligence tests, according to evidence presented today by the prosecution in his murder trial.
Fred Klein, the prosecutor, also produced reports by a Nassau County jail psychiatrist indicating that since Mr. Rifkin's arrest on June 28 in the slaying of Tiffany Bresciani, 22, of Manhattan, he has not been psychotic, appeared able to discern his situation without emotion and has occupied himself with his legal defense. 
 Mr. Klein was trying to bolster his argument that Mr. Rifkin is not insane, as his lawyer claims, but is "an intelligent, cunning man who is very capable of telling right from wrong."
The only witness for the defense, Dr. Barbara R. Kirwin, a clinical psychologist and expert on the criminally insane, was called back to the witness stand today by Mr. Klein to defend her testimony on Thursday that Mr. Rifkin was so mentally ill that he could not separate fantasy from reality when he killed Ms. Bresciani and his 16 other victims.
 
Straight 'A' Student
 Mr. Klein produced Mr. Rifkin's academic records from East Meadow High School and the State University of New York at Farmingdale, which Mr. Rifkin attended for two semesters before dropping out. He said Mr. Rifkin got straight A's in 1987, despite his father's death on Feb. 28, 1987. Dr. Kirwin had testified on Thursday that Mr. Rifkin had gone insane after his father's death.
Mr. Rifkin, a 34-year-old unemployed landscaper who says he killed his first victim in March 1989, dismembered her body and scattered its parts in New Jersey, sat slumped in his chair at the defense table, his chin resting in his hands.
The jury must decide whether he is guilty of murdering Ms. Bresciani, whose decomposing body was found in the back of his pickup truck by state troopers who stopped him for a traffic violation, or not guilty by reason of insanity.
If found guilty, he faces 25 years to life in prison. If found legally insane, he will be remanded to a state hospital where he would probably remain for the rest of his life.
Mr. Rifkin also faces murder charges in Suffolk County, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, where he dumped the bodies of many of his victims along rivers, canals, dirt roads and empty fields.
The trial is to resume on Monday when Mr. Klein calls Dr. Elliot Park Dietz, an expert on serial killers who appeared for the prosecution at the trials of Jeffrey Dahmer, who drugged and killed 15 young men in Milwaukee, and Arthur Shawcross, who murdered 11 women in Rochester.
Dr. Dietz, like Dr. Kirwin, rarely testifies for the defense in criminal cases. In fact, Dr. Kirwin has appeared four times in Nassau County Court as a prosecution witness in murder trials.
Mr. Klein mentioned all four cases to the jury today, implying that Dr. Kirwin, as a clinical psychologist, was not fully qualified to be an expert witness for the defense in a criminal insanity case because she was not a forensic psychologist.
 
Credentials Questioned
 "Didn't you once testify that clinical psychology was primarily for the treatment of the mentally ill, and that it has to do with treatment in a clinical setting, not a courtroom," he said.
"I don't recall," said Dr. Kirwin. "I would have to see a transcript of my testimony."
After producing the transcript and reading it to the jury, Mr. Klein continued to question Dr. Kirwin's credentials and methods of testing and analyzing Mr. Rifkin.
Mr. Klein asked her if she had studied the reports on Mr. Rifkin prepared by Dr. Allen Reichmann of the Nassau County Department of Mental Health, who interviewed Mr. Rifkin two days after his arrest last summer and on several occasions since.

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton's Risk in Macedonia

 BODY:
Greece is slowly strangling independent Macedonia's economy with a dangerously misguided blockade. The collapsing economy, in turn, is generating explosive friction among Macedonia's diverse peoples, which could endanger the lives of 500 American peacekeepers dispatched to Macedonia to contain ethnic strife.
The risk should have moved President Clinton to press Greece to lift the blockade when he met with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou last week. Instead he reportedly bowed to the Greek-American lobby, well placed in Congress and the White House, and soft-pedaled his opposition to Athens's perverse policy. 
 Macedonia is where Belgrade's ambitions to incorporate the republic into Greater Serbia run smack into competing territorial claims. Albania and Bulgaria historically have sought to absorb much of the same territory, and Greek nationalists also have their eyes on that prize. The Greek Government fears that the intense rivalries could endanger Greece's hold on its own part of Macedonia. But Athens is letting its hysteria over history rob it of sound judgment.
During much of this century, Macedonia has been divided between northern Greece and Yugoslavia. In the late 1940's, Yugoslavia, allied with Greece's Communists, tried and failed to grab all of Greek Macedonia. In 1991, when Yugoslavia fell apart, the portion of Macedonia in Yugoslavia declared its independence.
Greeks fear that the new republic may soon break up into conflicting ethnic groups, with links to Albania, Bulgaria and Serbia, and that the trouble could spill over into Greek Macedonia. Although Prime Minister Papandreou says he favors the survival of an independent Macedonia, Greece's stubborn stance on recognition and its economic embargo are fast making that impossible.
Playing to impassioned nationalists at home, the Greek Government objected to the new republic's use of the name Macedonia, as well as its flag and Constitution. Greece first tried to block recognition of the republic. When Greece's European Union partners granted recognition, Athens imposed a blockade. That not only makes landlocked Macedonia more dependent on trade with Serbia; it is also destabilizing the country as economic privation intensifies ethnic friction.
Mr. Clinton sent American troops as monitors to Macedonia in hopes of heading off ethnic conflict. They could get caught in the middle if the blockade pushes Macedonia into civil war. Mr. Clinton is pandering to the Greek lobby at his own peril.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Ford Posts $904 Million Profit, Highest Since 1989

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., April 29

 BODY:
Rounding out a spate of positive financial news from the nation's auto industry, the Ford Motor Company today reported its best quarterly results since 1989, posting a first-quarter profit of $904 million, or $1.66 a share. That sum, up 58 percent from a year earlier, reflected an extraordinary charge against earnings of $440 million from the sale of First Nationwide Bank, a savings and loan.
A year ago, Ford reported a first-quarter profit of $572 million, or $1.02 a share. On Thursday, the General Motors Corporation posted a first-quarter profit of $853.7 million, or 81 cents a share, a 66 percent gain from a year earlier. Last week, the Chrysler Corporation reported a record quarterly profit of $938 million, up 77 percent from a year earlier.
 
Big Gains in U.S.
 Like the gains at Chrysler and G.M., Ford's improved results stemmed largely from higher United States automotive sales. Ford also gained from a better performance overseas as well as from its financial services group, absent the First Nationwide write-off. On April 14, Ford agreed to sell First Nationwide to First Madison Bank for $1.1 billion. 
 Net income from worldwide automotive operations was $955 million, compared with $176 million a year earlier. Automotive operations in the United States accounted for $835 million of the profit, compared with $113 million a year earlier. Excluding the write-off, financial services earned $389 million, down from $396 million. Ford's total revenue for the quarter was $30.4 billion, up 13.6 percent from $26.8 billion a year ago.
 Ford said the latest good financial news should be just the beginning, since automotive sales are expected to grow even stronger. "If you think of this in baseball terminology, the recovery is in the first inning in Europe and the third or fourth inning in the United States," said David N. McCammon, vice president-finance and treasurer.
 Mr. McCammon said Ford expected sales of cars and light trucks in the United States to surpass the previous record of 16.3 million vehicles, putting Ford's forecast in line with those of many economists who believe sales will not peak until late 1995 or 1996. Despite positive earning news, investor concerns about the duration and robustness of the upswing in automotive sales have knocked Big Three stocks off their recent highs. Ford shares closed at $58.375 a share yesterday, up 87.5 cents, in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Harvey Heinbach, automotive stock analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company, said his firm expected sales of 16.8 million vehicles in 1996. "If we're right, these stocks will bounce back," he said. One risk, however, is nervous institutional investors who do not want to be caught giving back gains won over the last two years and are, therefore, inclined to sell the stocks. "The last thing they want," Mr. Heinbach said, "is a round trip."
 David Healy, auto analyst for S. G. Warburg & Company, called Ford's report "a clean, good quarter." But, he said, shares of Ford and other auto companies "will have trouble as long as interest rates are going up."

 
8% Rise in Output
 Mr. McCammon said supplies of Ford's most popular models -- the Explorer sport utility vehicle, Mustang sport coupe and Windstar mini-van -- were tight, but "the rest of the stocks are in good shape." The auto maker is scheduling an 8 percent increase in North American production in the second quarter, which means more overtime, faster assembly line speeds and full production at Ford's Oakville, Ontario, assembly plant, where production of the Windstar van is replacing compact-car output.
 In the first quarter, Ford factories in North America ran at 110 percent of straight-time capacity; absolute maximum capacity is about 125 percent of straight time, or two eight-hour shifts a day.
 Prices of cars and trucks have firmed, as evidenced by the smaller rebates that Ford paid to stimulate retail sales. The average rebate was $565 in the quarter, down from $720 a year earlier.
 Ford estimated that its pretax profit on vehicles sold in the United States was $1,400 a unit, compared with about $2,000 for Chrysler and $800 for G.M. Mr. McCammon said the main reason for Chrysler's superior profitability was its model mix, which is skewed toward light trucks: mini-vans, sport utilities and pickups. Accordingly, Ford is raising the percentage of its production that consists of light trucks to 52 percent, from less than half.
