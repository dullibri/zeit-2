HEADLINE: High Fatality Rate Found for Low-Cost Buses

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The low-cost bus industry, which has revolutionized transportation for students and other budget-conscious travelers, has racked up an alarmingly high number of fatal accidents and safety violations over the last few years, and regulators are having a hard time enforcing federal safety standards, according to a government study released on Monday.
The National Transportation Safety Board found that so-called curbside bus companies, which pick up riders on sidewalks rather than in terminals, were involved in fatal accidents at seven times the rate of traditional carriers like Greyhound. 
Curbside buses, which first gained popularity in the Chinatown districts of Manhattan and Boston by offering frequent rides between major cities for as little as $1 a seat, also were cited for violations related to driver fatigue and training at a higher rate than their conventional cousins.
In general, the report found that low-cost bus companies were a safe mode of travel and that accidents happened infrequently. In fact, among bus carriers that operate on regular schedules, the low-cost buses recorded proportionally fewer accidents than their share of the market.
But when those accidents occurred, they were far more likely than those involving traditional carriers to result in serious injury or death. (In a not particularly reassuring footnote, the report said that ''most of the deaths in fatal motor coach accidents are occupants of other vehicles.'')
The report, the most extensive study of the curbside motor coach industry undertaken by the federal government, was prompted by a bus crash in the Bronx in March that killed 15 passengers returning from a casino trip.
''This industry has been growing so exponentially,'' said Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, whose office requested the review. ''We have to be a step ahead of them and make sure we implement the types of safety measures that are necessary.''
Senator Charles E. Schumer, who spoke at a news conference on Monday unveiling the report, described it as ''a wake-up call'' and asked federal officials to create a more rigorous regulatory system for the industry.
In a statement, the Transportation Department, which has oversight of the motor coach industry, said it had nearly doubled its safety inspections on buses in the past five years. It also recently issued rules banning bus drivers from talking on cellphones or sending text messages while driving.
But the agency did not dispute the findings that federal regulators can often be stymied by the unique nature of the low-cost bus industry.
Because the buses do not park in traditional terminals, officials must make inspections on crowded street corners, which they said could be logistically difficult. Regulators are also barred from inspecting buses in the middle of a scheduled trip, which can reduce the element of surprise.
Many drivers and owners of low-cost bus companies do not speak English, and their records are often kept in other languages, which investigators described as frustrating. Officials say they are concerned that the language barrier means some owners do not fully understand every federal regulation.
Another challenge is a practice that officials called ''reincarnation'' -- when bus companies with safety violations simply start a new concern under a different name and reuse the vehicles and drivers. That tactic has been used by the company involved in the fatal Bronx crash, World Wide Travel, which is still running its buses through two other companies connected to the owner.
Ms. Velazquez, a Democrat whose district includes Chinatown, acknowledged that curbside bus companies contributed to the economic and social activities of her constituents.
''But we have a responsibility to make sure that cannot be at the expense of the lives of those who are using it,'' Ms. Velazquez said. ''The focus of our effort is not to punish this industry, or impose unnecessary regulation. It is to restore travelers' confidence.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in some editions on Tuesday about the fatality rate in the low-cost bus industry misspelled the surname of a New York State representative, one of the officials who requested a review of the industry. She is Nydia M. Vela--zquez, not Velasquez.

HEADLINE: Europe's Sovereign Debt Crisis Stymies Financial Overhaul

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON - As the Continent grapples with the sovereign debt crisis, financial regulatory revision in Europe has been put on the back burner, with some rules delayed until at least 2013.
The changing priorities have left investment banks, hedge funds and even nonfinancial companies in a holding pattern about compliance and costs, a situation that is weighing on earnings prospects.
''It's the uncertainty that's killing everybody,'' said Anthony Belchambers, chief executive of the Futures and Options Association, a trade organization based in London for companies involved in the derivatives markets. ''No one can measure the scale or cost of the regulation until it's finalized.'' 
In the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009, European regulators outlined the broad aims of a financial overhaul. But policy makers dragged their feet in the months that followed, unable to come to a consensus on critical areas like derivatives trading. Now, rule-making has been all but forgotten as they deal with teetering economies like Greece and Spain.
Most European rules won't be in place before 2013, more than a year behind the original deadline, according to the Financial Stability Board, an international body tasked with strengthening the financial markets through improved regulation. Policy makers in the United States, which has faced its own delays, are on track to complete the bulk of their regulations by next year, with some already approved.
The biggest problems on the Continent center on how to wrangle the $600 trillion global derivatives markets. Negotiations have largely pitted Britain, which favors looser regulation, against France and Germany, which want stricter limits placed on markets.
France and Germany, two euro zone heavyweights, argue that only over-the-counter trades should be reported to central repositories that collect the data and be cleared through central counterparties. Britain, which handles 75 percent of such trading in Europe, says that would put London at a disadvantage to rivals in Paris and Frankfurt. Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has fought to extend regulation to all derivatives, including those traded on electronic platforms.
The debate comes as Germany's Deutsche Borse stands poised to become the world's largest platform for derivatives trading if its planned merger with NYSE Euronext receives regulatory approval. Under the European Union's current proposal, Deutsche Borse and Europe's other electronic platforms would face less regulatory oversight than Britain's over-the-counter financial dealers. British officials fear that would hurt London's dominance as Europe's financial capital if businesses leave in search of trading centers with fewer regulatory costs.
On Oct. 4, both sides reached a basic compromise. Initially, the European Union will regulate only over-the-counter derivatives starting in 2013. The rules will eventually expand to include electronic-traded derivatives, although no time frame was given.
''The whole process has been very disjointed,'' said Sean Sprackling, a director at the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers in London.
For European companies, the protracted legislative process has made it difficult to know what compliance and risk management structures they will need to develop - and at what cost.
Under the European proposal, Siemens, Philips, the British supermarket giant Tesco and other nonfinancial businesses will be exempt from reporting their derivatives transactions to trade repositories and clearing them through central counterparties. But the plan has added a caveat. When the rules take hold, those so-called end users whose derivatives trading operations reach a certain threshold will have to comply with regulations governing trade repositories and clearinghouses. Details on the threshold, however, have yet to be agreed on.
End users that rely on investment banks to develop and execute their derivatives - rather than in-house teams - may still have to expand their compliance teams despite working through a financial intermediary. That would be an extra cost that would hit earnings just as Europe's nonfinancial companies are struggling to respond to a renewed slowdown in the global economy.
''A number of end users will be captured by the full regulation even if they're dealing through a licensed firm,'' Mr. Belchambers of the Futures and Options Association said.
Banks and other financial institutions have threatened to move their operations elsewhere if the changes in the United States and Europe become too onerous. But those fears are overblown, according to Barnabas W. B. Reynolds, head of the financial institutions advisory practice at the law firm Shearman & Sterling in London.
For one, the derivatives rules in the United States and Europe are expected to have broadly similar objectives. So even though there will be a gap when the two regions have different regimes, it is unlikely to be long enough for companies to benefit from any regulatory arbitrage.
And analysts also say they believe it is unlikely that companies will seek out regulatory-friendly markets in Asia like Hong Kong and Singapore. Mr. Reynolds said New York and London simply provided greater stability during periods of turmoil.
''The pecking order of financial centers will remain the same,'' he said. ''In a time of uncertainty, there's always a flight to quality.''

HEADLINE: Board Meeting and a Crucial Phone Call

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
5:27 p.m. Updated
On Sept. 23, 2008, Rajat K. Gupta called the hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam after a Goldman Sachs board meeting and told him secrets about the company, according to an indictment unsealed last week.
That same day, Mr. Gupta had two doctor appointments, dined with Ethiopia's health minister and got a haircut. 
His calendar for Sept. 23, 2008 - entered into evidence during Mr. Rajaratnam's trial as Government Exhibit 3035 - provides a lens into the busy and influential life of Mr. Gupta at a time when federal prosecutors say he was also breaking the law.
Mr. Gupta, then 59, was an eminence grise in the worlds of international business and philanthropy, juggling his work as a senior partner emeritus at McKinsey, the elite management consulting firm that he once ran, with his public company directorships, investment activities and charitable pursuits.
After an early morning call with an executive in Qatar, Mr. Gupta spent the next several hours with physicians. He also sandwiched in a 15-minute haircut before being driven into Manhattan from his home in Westport, Conn.
Mr. Gupta did not get to his office at McKinsey until 2 p.m., the calendar says. He then had back-to-back meetings with Sandeep Tyagi, chairman of Estee Advisors, a money management firm based in Singapore, and K. Balasubramanian, a board member of the GMR Group, an infrastructure investment business in Bangalore, India.
The Goldman call came at 3 p.m. He participated in a 38-minute board meeting by phone during which the bank approved a $5 billion investment by Warren E. Buffett - news that the convulsing stock market, and Goldman's investors, would surely love.
The government highlighted Mr. Gupta's Sept. 23 schedule at the Rajaratnam trial during the testimony of Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive.
The calendar established for the jury that the Goldman board meeting had taken place when it did. Then, using a phone log, prosecutors showed that Mr. Gupta called Mr. Rajaratnam immediately afterward. Minutes later, just before the stock market closed, Mr. Rajaratnam bought large blocks of Goldman shares, according to trading records shown during the trial.
A jury convicted Mr. Rajaratanam in May. On Wednesday, the government charged Mr. Gupta, 62, with passing tips to Mr. Rajaratnam about Goldman and Procter & Gamble, where he also served as a director. Two of the five counts against Mr. Gupta, who is fighting the charges, relate to Mr. Rajaratnam's Sept. 23 Goldman trades.
Mr. Gupta's day did not end with the Goldman meeting. He spent the balance of the afternoon on his numerous nonprofit causes, including a meeting with Julian Schweitzer, the World Bank's head of health nutrition, and Raymond G. Chambers, the United Nations special envoy for malaria.
During those meetings, around 5 p.m., Goldman announced Mr. Buffett's big investment to the public.
Mr. Gupta closed out the day with a dinner at Django, the now-defunct Midtown Manhattan brasserie, in honor of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the health minister of Ethiopia. He then spent the night in a room at the Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue, the calendar shows. His suite was booked by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm where, just that month, he had been named a senior adviser.
The next morning, prosecutors say, with Goldman's shares opening higher, Mr. Rajaratnam sold his position in the bank, booking an illegal profit of about $840,000.

HEADLINE: A Nursing Home Shrinks Until It Feels Like a Home

BYLINE: By LAURIE TARKAN

 BODY:
Toni Davis spent much of her childhood roaming the corridors of a nursing home in West Orange, N.J., where her mother was the director. Even now she recalls the pleas of the residents there: '' 'Please help me, please take me home with you,' they'd beg,'' Ms. Davis said. ''I remember asking my mom, 'Why can't we take them home for dinner for just one night?'''
Following in her mother's footsteps, Ms. Davis is now director of Green Hill Retirement Community, a nursing home and assisted living facility, and she is determined to make it into a place where residents feel little reason to leave. She has added fish tanks and bird cages, hung pictures on the walls carpeted the corridors, and brought in dogs for pet therapy.
Still, the nursing home looks like... a nursing home. ''No matter what you do, you can't get that homelike feeling in an institution because it's too big,'' she said. 
So now Ms. Davis, along with two dozen other nursing home operators across the country, is trying something different. This year, behind two large institutional buildings on the Green Hill campus, she has opened four small Arts and Crafts-style houses for elderly residents.
Just 10 residents live in each so-called Green House, which looks nothing like a traditional nursing home. The front door opens onto a large living and dining area; on one side is a hearth surrounded by upholstered chairs, and on the other is a long communal dining table where meals are served. An open kitchen faces the table, so caregivers can chat with elderly residents while preparing meals.
Private bedrooms and baths surround the main living area. The house has a front porch and back deck with tables and chairs. There are no corridors, no nursing stations, no medicine carts (each room has a locked cabinet containing the resident's medications) and no trays of food delivered to the rooms.
There are 117 Green Houses across the United States now, part of a quiet but intriguing effort to de-institutionalize elder care. The movement has its roots in the 1987 Nursing Home Reform Act, which declared that residents of long-term care have the right to be free from abuse or neglect. Nursing homes across the country have tried a variety of strategies to become more ''resident-centered.''
''It's happening all over the country, in a lot of different models,'' said Sarah Wells, executive director of the National Consumer Voices for Quality Long-Term Care, an advocacy group based in Washington.
The Green House concept is the most comprehensive effort to reinvent the nursing home, experts say -- including the way medical care is delivered. In traditional nursing homes, employees typically have narrowly defined jobs: Some give baths, some cook, some do laundry. It's a system based on efficiency that tends to ignore individuals' preferences and needs.
In a Green House, each home is staffed with two certified nursing assistants who perform all of these jobs, but for fewer residents. In addition, one registered nurse typically supports two or three houses.
''If you have one person doing everything, they can spend more time with the residents and get to know somebody as a real person,'' said Robert Jenkens, a director at NCB Capital Impact, a nonprofit community development finance institution that has partnered with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to provide consulting and loans for organizations developing many Green Houses.
''You're also less locked into a rigid 'wake, meal, bath' schedule, and you can reorganize someone's day based on her preferences,'' he said.
If nurses' aides aren't feeling rushed to dress and bathe residents, the thinking goes, they're more likely to let them perform more of these tasks themselves, fostering independence.
Erika Dickens, a certified nursing assistant, worked in the traditional nursing home at Green Hill for 20 years but recently was transferred to the new Green House.
''I used to feel like my hands were tied. I had to get the elders out of bed at a certain time, even if they didn't want to,'' she said. ''Now if someone doesn't want to get out of bed for breakfast one day, I'll bring her a milkshake.''
The notion that elder care should be de-institutionalized is a popular one. According to a poll released in September by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health, 82 percent of pre-retirees (adults over age 50 who have not retired but plan to) and 78 percent of retirees are somewhat or very concerned about being in an institutional environment that is not as comfortable as a home.
''Loneliness, helplessness and boredom are the three plagues of nursing homes,'' Mr. Jenkens said. ''Arguably, much of the institutionalized practice induced this.''
Still, it's not clear that the Green House model can be widely duplicated. Though the day-to-day costs are no greater than those of larger nursing homes, the homes are typically built in clusters of two or more and require comparatively large initial capital investments. ''It would increase long-term costs if it were implemented to replace every nursing home in the country,'' said Dr. Catherine Hawes, director of the program on aging and long-term care policy at Texas A&M Health Science Center.
Perhaps more important, whether the Green House model improves care for the elderly, compared with institutional settings, is not known. Several small studies, none particularly rigorous, have found that Green Houses deliver similar care for no more money than traditional nursing homes. The homes do this largely through reducing supervisory positions and training certified nurse assistants to take on more responsibility.
Green Houses also have a lower vacancy rates than conventional nursing homes, and they accept patients on Medicare and Medicaid, making them an option for low-income elderly. On average, about 54 percent of Green House residents are on Medicaid, while the rest pay for the care privately.
Residents of Green Houses experience fewer bed sores than those in conventional nursing homes, according to one survey, and each day they get 24 minutes more of direct and personalized care and 1.5 hours more of nursing staff time than those living in traditional nursing homes. Residents say they feel like they have deeper relationships with the staff, and family members report higher satisfaction with the physical environment, privacy, their own autonomy, health care and meals. Employees, too, report less stress. The turnover rate is significantly lower than in a traditional nursing home. Green House certified nursing assistants are paid on average about 5 percent more than those in institutional settings.
Even if this model of elder care turns out to be impractical on a large scale, Ms. Wells said, ''we can learn a lot from what the Green House is doing and can translate these methods into things that existing nursing homes can use.''
Many residents and their families find the Green House to be a substantial improvement over standard nursing home care. Diane LoCicero moved her 88-year-old mother, Evelyn, from the traditional nursing home into one of Green Hill's Green Houses this year. Her mother is far more relaxed now, said Ms. LoCicero, and she actually enjoys visiting the place.
''Before, it was like a hospital and I hated to visit,'' Ms. LoCicero said. ''Now, I'll stay here for hours.''
On a recent day in September at Green Hill, Jane Larkin, 82, a retired home economics teacher who suffered a stroke in 2007, sat in her wheelchair at the long dining table and marveled at the differences between this residence and the traditional nursing home in which she'd once lived.
''There's more opportunity to be social here. We can get outdoors easily, and people like to visit more,'' she said. ''Sometimes, I give the girls advice when they're cooking, like I'm their teacher. There was no opportunity to do that in the other place, because we were isolated in our rooms.''

HEADLINE: MF Global Bankruptcy Rattles Wall Street Firms

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED

 BODY:
The markets were haunted this Halloween by the ghosts of the past financial crisis.
With MF Global filing for bankruptcy on Monday, investors pummeled many financial stocks, fearful that problems were lurking on the books of other Wall Street firms. It was a crisis of confidence, not unlike in 2008 when the markets punished stocks on mere speculation of trouble.
On Monday, companies with perceived exposure to MF Global bore the brunt of the pain. The Jefferies Group, which issued a statement saying it had a minimal stake in the brokerage, fell by nearly 10 percent. The Fortress Investment Group, which proactively disclosed that it had ''literally zero'' exposure, dropped by more than 11 percent. 
''Investors across the financial sector are definitely on high alert trying to avoid or minimize these sovereign debt exposures,'' said Ed Ditmire, an analyst at Macquarie Capital.
MF Global made a risky bet in a tumultuous market. Recently, the firm revealed that it had $6.3 billion of sovereign debt in troubled countries like Italy and Spain. The position was nearly five times the firm's equity of more than a billion dollars. As the sovereign debt crisis reached a peak in October, two rating agencies cut the grades on the company's debt, saying they questioned the firm's risk controls given the size of the position.
The downgrades sent the company into a tailspin. Trading partners asked the firm to post more money against their portfolio. Adding to the jitters, MF Global reported a third-quarter loss, which further eroded its stock and made its capital position even more tenuous. The firm drew down a $1.3 billion credit line as it fought to stay afloat. But it proved insufficient, and MF Global was forced to file for bankruptcy.
After Moody's downgrade last week, MF Global sent a letter to clients trying to reassure them of the firm's strength. On Monday, as some clients called to ask questions and liquidate their accounts, MF Global was not picking up the phone.
Some financial exchanges prevented MF Global employees from entering Monday, while others, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the IntercontinentalExchange, halted the firm's trading in the morning. That forced clients of MF Global to sit tight or liquidate their holdings.
''I'm disappointed in the way the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, MF Global and the regulators have handled this bankruptcy,'' said James L. Koutoulas, chief executive of Typhon Capital Management, a hedge fund client of MF Global. ''They had no contingency plan in place and just cut off our trading screens, and we're forced to liquidate clients' accounts unfavorably.''
It is difficult to know what other firms could face the same pressure. Most of the small brokerages that clear futures trades like MF Global are private companies, so their capital positions are not as vulnerable to the whims of the public markets. The rest of the industry is dominated by large banks, which analysts say have sufficient capital.
The irony is that MF Global's sovereign debt may turn out to be right - eventually. The firm was ostensibly making the wager that Europe would come to the rescue of its troubled economies and the countries would not default on their debt.
In such a event, MF Global's holdings would most likely have paid off. But investors and others just did not have the patience to wait and see.
''The positions still have not caused any losses to the best of my knowledge,'' said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill. ''But this risk-taking is just excessive compared to the size of the balance sheet.''
Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Hay Shortage Compounds Woe in Drought-Stricken Texas

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
TERRELL, Tex. -- Dozens of ranchers waited for hours for the donations, in a line of pickup trucks that stretched for a mile in this rain-starved region east of Dallas.
It was the small-town-Texas equivalent of a big-city bread line: a hay line.
The ranchers assembled outside a building-supply store here two weeks ago to receive free bales of hay for their cattle and horses. The first 10 farmers spent the night in line. By the end of the morning, seven 18-wheeler truckloads of hay had been distributed to nearly 40 people, but the demand exceeded the supply -- ranchers at the back of the line had to be turned away after the hay ran out.
In a typical year, hay can be a kind of agricultural afterthought, a humdrum staple of country life that is as plentiful as it is affordable. But the historic drought that has devastated much of Texas has transformed these simple bales of dried grass into some of the most sought-after goods in the state. The worst one-year drought in Texas history has produced a statewide hay shortage that has more than doubled the price of large round and small square bales, forcing many ranchers to sell or even abandon all of their cattle and horses because they cannot afford to feed them. 
Hay fever has taken on new meaning in Texas.
The owner of Master Made Feeds outside Dallas has been paying a 5 percent finder's fee to anyone who can help him locate hay. One man used his tractor to bale the hay growing on a highway median one recent afternoon in South Texas, providing him with a free though unlawful supply. Much of the hay that people have been buying lately is not Texas hay -- it comes from Oklahoma, Louisiana, Nebraska and other states, adding transportation costs to already stiff prices. One rancher in Bronte, Tex., sends a driver about 600 miles once a week to and from Oklahoma to load up on hay, spending $600 per trip in fuel and driver costs alone.
''The whole state of Texas is ringing my phone,'' said Sherry Nix, the manager of McCracken Hay Company in Elgin, Okla., which has been so flooded with Texas customers that in September it reported $1 million in sales. ''We got six phone lines in here. It sounds like the stock market exchange sometimes.''
In Yorktown, a small South Texas town about 70 miles from San Antonio, one rancher sold half of his herd because of the scarcity and high price of hay, and he has resorted to feeding his remaining 15 cows hamburger buns and other day-old breads that he buys in bulk. The rancher, Robert R. Roller, 65, said he usually fed the bread to his cattle as a winter supplement, but now gave it to them daily to compensate for the lack of hay. The bread costs him $20 a week. The hay costs him roughly $300 a week.
''This summer, I was going through six bales a week,'' Mr. Roller said. ''You multiply that by $65, $75 a bale. That's just the hay. That don't account for the feed I give them. I went through every bit of my savings for the last five years. If I had a family to feed, there wouldn't be a cow on this place. I couldn't afford it.''
The drought at the root of the hay shortage has taken a record toll on Texas agriculture, even as wildfires have devoured millions of acres. It has cost farmers and ranchers an estimated $5.2 billion in agricultural losses, making it the state's costliest drought on record, according to economists with the Texas AgriLife Extension Service. That estimate includes hundreds of millions of dollars in lost hay production from the lack of rain. Texas agricultural officials said hay production was expected to reach 5.9 million tons this year, about half of what the state produced last year.
As hay prices continue to climb -- an 800-pound round bale in Terrell was $115 in mid-October, up from roughly $60 last year -- some ranchers have given up, selling off their herds and getting out of the cattle business, temporarily in some cases and permanently in others. Several large cattle raisers have taken another course of action, moving their herds out of state to greener pastures in a modern-day version of a cattle drive.
''Hay to our livestock industry is equivalent to milk and bread to everyday families,'' said Todd Staples, the state's agriculture commissioner. ''We've seen many producers sell out everything. Because there was no hay, no pasture. Many of them have vanished. Literally, gone up in dust.''
The shortage of hay has led to a variety of relief efforts. The seven truckloads of hay distributed in Terrell were donated by Indiana farmers, in an event organized by members of the Indiana Motor Truck Association. In July, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas suspended the permitting requirements and height restrictions on hay trucks to allow for easier transportation of hay within the state. Mr. Staples asked agriculture commissioners across the country to waive similar restrictions in their states for trucks bringing hay to Texas. Eight states, including Oklahoma, Louisiana and South Dakota, lifted their regulations in response.
The Texas Agriculture Department's hay hot line, which is both a toll-free phone number and a Web site, has become a kind of Craigslist for hay, where hundreds of ranchers, transporters and landowners from 42 states make connections to buy, sell or donate hay.
Some believe that state officials have failed to do enough.
About 4,400 people have signed online petitions on Change.org calling for Mr. Perry to use the National Guard or state resources to bring hay to Texas. One petition was started by the chief executive of Ranch Hand Rescue, a nonprofit farm-animal rescue group in Argyle, Tex. The numbers of abandoned and neglected horses and donkeys have increased in recent months throughout Texas, in part because people are having difficulty paying for hay and feed, according to the authorities and rescue groups. The Ellis County Sheriff's Office in north-central Texas has taken in 68 horses, donkeys and other abandoned and loose farm animals so far this year, an increase from 12 in 2007.
Bedford Burwell, a cattle rancher and feed store owner in Terrell, planned to sell his remaining 100 head of cattle. He is 70, and has been in the cattle business since he was a teenager.
''It's just costing too much to feed them,'' Mr. Burwell said as he stood outside D&B Feed and spoke of getting rid of his cows. ''I don't really want to. There's things that you got to do in life that you really don't want to.''

HEADLINE: Activists Denounce Film Deal In China

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS and DAVID BARBOZA; Shi Da contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The Hollywood producers of a slapstick comedy that began shooting last week in a city in China's eastern Shandong Province describe their feature about a young man facing a birthday, ''21 and Over,'' as an ''epic misadventure of debauchery and mayhem.''
As it happens, scores of Chinese human rights activists who in recent weeks have been descending on the very same city, Linyi, describe a different kind of misadventure and mayhem in their thwarted efforts to visit Chen Guangcheng, an embattled lawyer who is under house arrest there. 
With few exceptions, outsiders who have made the trip to Linyi have been violently assaulted, robbed, detained and then sent on their way by the guards who keep Mr. Chen, who is blind, and his wife imprisoned in their farmhouse. Those same guards, at the behest of local Communist Party officials, have occasionally beaten the couple, most recently in July as one of their children looked on, according to a report released last week by the group China Aid.
Once hailed by the official media for his work defending peasants and the disabled, Mr. Chen has been under so-called soft detention since September 2010, when he completed a 51-month prison sentence related to his legal campaign against family planning officials in Linyi.
Local party leaders, confronted by foreign reporters who themselves have been roughed up and repelled by thugs, offer Orwellian retorts, denying that Mr. Chen is under house arrest and insisting that outsiders are free to visit him.
The decisions by the Hollywood concern, Relativity Media, to shoot in Linyi and to enter into a business arrangement with its Communist Party chief have created an unexpected headache for the studio, which is facing boycott calls from Chinese rights activists. ''After what the local government did to Chen Guangcheng and to so many other people, it's outrageous that an American company would do business with them,'' said He Peirong, a friend of the detained couple who can recount, in fine detail, the assaults she has endured during five unsuccessful visits this year. ''We hope the company can put social responsibility ahead of corporate profits.''
For American companies eager to catch a ride on China's soaring economy, the case highlights the potential perils of doing business with a government whose occasionally heavy-handed approach to critics can create public relations challenges.
Relativity Media, whose past successes include ''Salt,'' ''The Social Network'' and ''A Serious Man,'' brokered a deal to gain entry into the Chinese film market, the world's fastest growing -- and to cut some of the red tape often associated with shooting and distributing foreign films in China. Although most of ''21 and Over'' was shot in Seattle, it manages to work in a scene in Linyi that involves the young protagonist, who has been forced into a night of carousing by two friends on his 21st birthday -- which also happens to be the night before a critical interview for medical school.
One of the Hollywood company's two Chinese partners is the state-backed Huaxia Distribution Company.
In a statement, Relativity Media said it was proud of its partnership but insisted it was unaware of Mr. Chen's situation or the case that originally landed him in trouble -- a class-action lawsuit against officials accused of forcing thousands of Linyi women to have abortions and sterilizations.
''From its founding, Relativity Media has been a consistent and outspoken supporter of human rights and we would never knowingly do anything to undermine this commitment,'' the company said in a statement on Sunday.
Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, said he did not fault the company for its decision to shoot in Linyi although he said executives might have done well to Google the place and its political leadership before so avidly promoting the partnership. ''They have to be aware of their relationship with notorious abusers,'' he said. ''They failed to do their due diligence.''

HEADLINE: Breaking a Long Silence On Population Control

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Major American environmental groups have dodged the subject of population control for decades, wary of getting caught up in the bruising politics of reproductive health.
Yet, virtually alone, the Center for Biological Diversity is breaking the taboo by directly tying population growth to environmental problems through efforts like giving away condoms in colorful packages depicting endangered animals. The idea is to start a debate about how overpopulation crowds out species and hastens climate change -- just when the world is welcoming Baby No. 7 Billion.
''Wrap with care, save the polar bear,'' reads one of the packages. ''Wear a condom now, save the spotted owl,'' says another.
Kieran Suckling, executive director of the center, a membership-based nonprofit organization in Tucson, said he had an aha moment a few years ago. ''All the species that we save from extinction will eventually be gobbled up if the human population keeps growing,'' he said. 
In the United States, the birth rate has fallen steadily since the baby boom, from 3.6 births per woman in 1960 to 2.0 today, or just under the replacement level, at which a population replaces itself from one generation to the next. Yet even at that rate, demographers estimate, the country will grow from 311 million people now to 478 million by the end of the century, because of both births and immigration.
The highest birth rates -- from five to more than six births per woman -- are occurring in a handful of nations in Africa and Asia, including Nigeria and Yemen. Yet among large economies, the United States is second only to Australia in the amount of carbon dioxide it emits per capita, according to the latest figures from the federal Energy Information Administration.
''Every person you add to the country makes all these tremendous demands on the environment,'' said Joel E. Cohen, chief of the Laboratory of Populations at Rockefeller University and Columbia University.
But experts are reluctant to suggest an ideal birth rate. ''There isn't any magic number,'' Dr. Cohen said.
As recently as the 1970s, the subject of population control was less controversial, partly because the baby boom years had given rise to concerns about scarcity of resources, some population experts and environmentalists said. Then came China's coercive one-child policy and a rise in social conservatism in the United States, combined with the country's aversion to anything perceived as restricting individual freedoms, be it the right to bear arms or children.
Some groups also fear whipping up anti-immigrant sentiment and opposition to family planning. Immigration now accounts for about one-third of the growth rate in the United States.
''We see reluctance and fear to deal with this issue,'' said Jose Miguel Guzman of the United Nations Population Fund.
Groups contacted for this article generally declined to discuss the issue or did not return calls.
The Center for Biological Diversity's condom campaign, begun on college campuses last year, now includes video ads in Times Square and lobbying in Washington for more family planning services. It is an aggressive strategy even for the center, which is best known for barraging federal agencies with lawsuits intended to protect species and ecosystems.
The condom campaign is intended to raise awareness and help reduce unintended pregnancies. ''Reproduction is always going to be a matter of free will,'' said Randy Serraglio, the manager of the campaign. ''This is about getting people to make the connection.''
A study published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed how slowing the country's population growth rate to 1.5 births per woman from 2.0 could result in a 10 percent drop in greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury and a 33 percent drop by the end of the century.
But the notion that curbing births is an effective way to control emissions is not an easy sell.
When Oregon State University released a study two years ago calculating the extra carbon dioxide emissions a person helps generate by choosing to have children, the researchers received hate mail labeling them ''eugenicists'' and ''Nazis.''
The study, which also calculated the impact of a birth beyond the child's lifetime ''should the offspring reproduce,'' said that each American child generated seven times as much carbon dioxide over time as one child in China, and 169 times as much as one in Bangladesh. Reducing car travel, recycling and making homes more energy efficient would have a fraction of the impact on emissions that reducing the birth rate would, it found.
''There are important consequences to having children, and we tried to quantify them,'' said Paul A. Murtaugh, an associate professor of statistics and one of the study's co-authors. ''It should be on the table. It needs to be.''
Some groups, like the World Wildlife Fund and Conservation International, said they worked on population-related issues mostly internationally. The president of the National Audubon Society declined an interview without explanation. The chairwoman of the Green Group, a loose association of several dozen environmental organizations, did not return calls or e-mails.
The Natural Resources Defense Council president, Frances Beinecke, said her group focused on addressing climate change through energy strategies and conservation efforts. ''Particularly in this economic environment, we're not in a position to just add, add, add,'' Ms. Beinecke said of her group's agenda.
Kevin Knobloch, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the research on reducing emissions by cutting birth rates was not yet ''robust'' enough to make a convincing case for a clear way forward.
A country's carbon footprint does not necessarily shrink when the birth rate drops, Mr. Knobloch said. In India and China, he pointed out, smaller families have consumed more as their incomes rose -- a common trend in developing countries. ''It gets complex very quickly,'' he said.
Carl Pope, the chairman of the Sierra Club, said his organization now had one population officer on staff who was working on international reproductive health services. In this country, Mr. Pope said, there are reasons for keeping a low profile on the issue.
''Look at Planned Parenthood,'' he said, recalling the group's bruising battle with Republican lawmakers over federal financing last spring. ''There's a huge atmosphere of intimidation. The moment you say 'family planning,' immediately somebody pulls out abortion.''
The 2.0 fertility rate in the United States is higher than the rates in other developed countries, including Germany and Japan (1.3), Canada (1.6) and Britain (1.8), according to figures from the United Nations.
John Seager, president of the group Population Connection, said organizations had been more assertive about lobbying the Obama administration for money to finance family planning services overseas.
Unintended pregnancies account for roughly half of all annual births in the United States, according to studies by the Guttmacher Institute, which is based in New York and promotes reproductive health worldwide.
By tackling such pregnancies, the fertility rate could be brought down to about 1.9 births per woman, slightly below replacement level yet high enough to ease concerns about economic stagnation and support for the elderly, said John Bongaarts, a demographer with the Population Council, a research group in New York.
Dr. Bongaarts described the inaction by environmental groups as a missed opportunity. ''The global warming community is staying away from anything having to do with population,'' he said, ''and that's frustrating.''

HEADLINE: Domestic Oil Drilling

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Drilling in Fast-Growing Areas Ushers in New Era of Tension'' (news article, Oct. 25): 
Many farmers and ranchers in Colorado and throughout the West are excited about the new economic opportunities that come with increased oil and gas development, but many are also concerned about the serious negative effects that unchecked development could have on the water and natural resources that are vital to our agricultural livelihood.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar should be commended for his efforts to stand up for the needs of local agriculture, while also laying out a responsible path forward to increased domestic energy production. Despite numerous protests from the oil and gas industry, Obama administration policies have led to the highest level of domestic oil and gas drilling in the last 24 years and increased protection for our air, water and land.
The simple truth is that we can have both more responsible energy development and common-sense protections for our Western lands and agriculture.

HEADLINE: Anxieties Stir as Greece Plans Referendum on Latest Europe Aid Deal

BYLINE: By NIKI KITSANTONIS and RACHEL DONADIO; Niki Kitsantonis reported from Athens, and Rachel Donadio from Rome.

 BODY:
ATHENS -- In a surprise move that jolted Europe and put his political future in play, Prime Minister George A. Papandreou announced Monday that his government would hold a referendum on a new aid package for Greece, putting austerity measures -- and potentially membership in the euro zone -- to a popular vote for the first time.
The vote on the austerity package introduces a note of uncertainty in what had seemed to be a done deal, threatening the comprehensive agreement reached by European leaders last week to shore up the euro zone. A rejection by the voters would also be likely to be treated as a vote of no confidence in the government and lead to early elections. 
The anxiety stirred up by those fears hammered United States financial markets on Monday, showing once again how the domestic politics of even the smallest members of the European Union can create troubles that not only threaten the currency but reverberate around the globe.
Addressing lawmakers on Monday evening, Mr. Papandreou said the decision on whether to adopt the deal, which includes fresh financial assistance, debt relief and deeply unpopular austerity measures, properly belonged to the Greek people.
''Let us allow the people to have the last word, let them decide on the country's fate,'' he said.
It was unclear how the referendum would be worded, but Mr. Papandreou said it would be a vote on whether or not Greeks supported the debt deal and the program of austerity measures in exchange for foreign aid.
The stakes are extremely high. A no vote could break the deal between Greece and its so-called troika of foreign lenders -- the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- which have demanded structural changes and austerity measures in exchange for aid.
Without the aid, Greece would not be able to meet its expenses and would default on its debt, sending shock waves through the euro zone and the world economy.
A yes vote, on the other hand, would move the package forward, effectively shifting responsibility for the nation's painful economic choices from Mr. Papandreou's Socialist Party onto the public. That outcome would help Mr. Papandreou shore up his political fortunes and avoid the instability of early elections.
The center-right opposition has opposed the bulk of the austerity program, and the prime minister's popular support has dwindled as Greeks have been hit by a seemingly endless series of tax increases and wage and pension cuts. On Sunday, the center-left newspaper To Vima reported that a majority of Greeks viewed the deal negatively.
At a time when Mr. Papandreou is under intense political and social pressure, including from members of his own Socialist Party, the move was seen as the last card he could play.
It also appeared to give the Greek government a bit more leverage in negotiations with Europe. The terms of the deal, in which banks have been asked to voluntarily take a 50 percent write-down on Greek debt, have not been finalized and must still be accepted by the banks. Putting the package up for a vote, with the distinct possibility of rejection, could induce banks to agree to the deal rather than face greater losses if Greece defaults.
''It's not motivated by the intention of some sort of brinkmanship with Europe, but it may have this sort of positive or negative effect,'' said George Pagoulatos, a professor of European politics and economy at Athens University of Economics and Business. ''It raises the stakes. It's about, 'Will we remain in the euro with a lower public debt, or will we lose everything that we will achieve?' ''
Mr. Papandreou also said that he would seek a parliamentary vote of confidence in his administration, just four months after winning a similar vote before pushing an earlier batch of austerity measures into law. The vote of confidence is expected to be held on Friday, and he is expected to squeak by with his narrow three-vote majority in Parliament.
The referendum will probably be held in January, government officials said, essentially buying the government time while the details of the deal are hammered out.
Addressing lawmakers on Monday evening, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos framed the debate as one of Greece's staying in the euro zone, the group of 17 European Union countries that use the euro, or not. ''It's for the people to decide to stay in Europe or go back to the drachma,'' he said.
While the austerity measures have proved incendiary for much of the public, setting off widespread strikes sometimes accompanied by episodes of street violence, being part of the euro zone generally meets with high approval.
Takis Michas, a political analyst with Forum for Greece, an Athens research institute, said posing the question this way was ''a master stroke on behalf of Papandreou in the sense it is forcing the various parties to take a very responsible position.''
''If he succeeds in framing the issue as being one of remaining in the euro zone, obviously he is going to get a huge yes,'' Mr. Michas added. ''But it depends on whether he can frame the question in those terms.''
Under the Greek Constitution, the government must propose the language of the referendum, which would need to be approved by Parliament and then by the president.
Some analysts said the referendum was an invitation for instability. ''When the debate is very passionate and things are tense, holding a referendum could be risky,'' said Alexis Papahelas, the editor of the center-right daily Kathimerini.
If the referendum fails, he said, ''we have a very big chance that the country would go into a disorderly default.''
A spokesman for the center-right New Democracy Party, Yiannis Michelakis, said a referendum was dangerous. Mr. Papandreou, he said, ''has tossed Greece's future in Europe in the air like a coin.''

HEADLINE: Cooper Union, Ailing Fiscally, Weighs Adding Tuition Charge

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA; Chelsia Rose Marcius contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Facing serious financial trouble in a weak economy, Cooper Union, the New York City college founded in 1859 to provide free education for the working class, may begin charging undergraduate tuition for the first time in more than a century, its president said Monday.
''Altering our scholarship policy will be only as a last resort, but in order to create a sustainable model, it has to be one of the options on the table,'' Jamshed Bharucha, who took over as president in July, said in an interview. 
Such a change would be a cultural shift for an institution whose tuition-free education and esteemed programs in engineering, architecture and art have made it one of the nation's most selective schools, admitting 5 percent to 10 percent of applicants annually, depending on the department.
Peter Cooper, a self-taught industrialist, inventor and social reformer, founded the college with the mission of making higher education available to all; it was among the first to admit blacks, women, students of any religion and those who could not pay, making it need-blind long before the term existed.
Dr. Bharucha emphasized that lower-income students and many middle-income ones would continue to attend free, and that none of the 900 current undergraduates would be charged. He said that if the school decided to charge tuition, it was not clear whether it would set its price comparable to those at other private colleges, $40,000 or more, or adopt a different payment structure.
Despite consternation at the East Village school and on Facebook among students and alumni who had heard murmurs of a possible change, Dr. Bharucha said no decisions had been made. He plans to ask the board of trustees next week to approve creation of a task force to look into ways to solve the school's persistent, and worsening, budget problems, and report back next spring.
''We have to find new, robust revenue streams, and we have to do that quickly,'' he said.
For many Cooper Union alumni, the idea of charging tuition feels like an assault on the college's identity and social mission.
''It's a contradiction to everything we've learned about Cooper,'' said Milton Glaser, 82, the graphic designer and co-founder of New York magazine. ''It's the last opportunity for free education on that level in the entire country.''
Gerard W. Ryan, an alumnus who works at Motorola and has been an adjunct professor of computer science at Cooper Union, said, ''I think the idea is dreadful, and I really hope it doesn't come to pass.''
''This spirit of Peter Cooper, that there should be an excellent education for everybody, that's pervaded everything,'' he added. ''It's in the DNA of the school.''
But he praised Dr. Bharucha for confronting financial troubles he did not create.
In its first decades, Cooper Union collected tuition from students who had the means to pay. But since 1902, following major gifts from Andrew Carnegie and Cooper's descendants, it has been free for all undergraduates. (Students enrolled in nondegree night programs do pay tuition and undergraduates pay for room and board.)
A result has been a student body that, for an elite college, is unusually diverse, ethnically and economically. Fewer than half of Cooper Union's students are white, and almost two-thirds attended public high schools.
Dr. Bharucha said that in recent decades, the school had resorted to unsustainable practices to support its operations -- like selling assets and dipping into the principal of its endowment, which stood at $577 million in mid-2010 -- rather than just spending the endowment's earnings. In recent years, it also spent heavily on a new academic building and renovations of its historic building, both on Cooper Square.
The school also generates significant income from real estate it owns, including the land under the Chrysler Building, but the value of those properties has also been dropping.
Word of a possible change leaked out in recent days, leading to student protests over the weekend. On Monday night, Dr. Bharucha discussed the matter with a large group of students for the first time, addressing a gathering at Rose Auditorium.
Dr. Bharucha said Cooper Union needed to introduce new sources of revenue, reaching $28 million a year by 2018, or about one-quarter of the expected operating costs. He said being more aggressive about winning research grants and raising money from alumni would cover part of that. In the meantime, he said, there will be belt-tightening, like a freeze on faculty hiring he has imposed.
He said the school needed money not just to keep up with current costs, but also to invest in academic facilities and provide more financial aid for poorer students' room and board.
''I will not be forcing solutions on the organization,'' he said, adding that he wanted employees, students and alumni involved in finding answers. ''But we have to do the hard thinking now.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the possibility that Cooper Union, the New York City college, might begin charging undergraduate tuition for the first time in more than a century, misidentified, in some editions, the location for a campus meeting that its president, Jamshed Bharucha, held with students on Monday. He met students in Rose Auditorium, not in ''the Great Hall, site of dozens of great speeches.''

HEADLINE: Sharp Drop for Stocks on Wall Street

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Michael J. de la Merced and Ben Protess contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks in the United States followed markets in Europe sharply lower on Monday as investors shifted focus to how and when the latest solution for the euro zone debt crisis would be implemented.
Equities fell 2 percent or more, sending the broader market in the United States back into negative territory for the year. Still, the rally of last week allowed the main indexes to finish the month of October between 9 percent and 11 percent higher.
It was the end of a month of peaks and deep losses, inspired by corporate earnings, merger news, and economic data for the United States that pointed to a slow, but not a stalled, recovery. 
The stock market rebounded in recent days as deal took shape in the euro zone to help resolve the sovereign debt troubles. But trading has eased back in the past two sessions.
''Risk aversion is once again taking hold in markets,'' said Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. strategists in a market commentary.
Major indices in Europe closed down around 3 percent, and by the close Monday in New York, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was almost 2.5 percent lower, at 1,253.30, while the Dow Jones industrial average was down about 2.3 percent at 11,955.01 and the Nasdaq composite was down by 1.9 percent.
''Although encouraged by what we consider to be a good start, we suspect Europe will require other measures going forward to effectively deal with its sovereign debt problems,'' said USAA Investment Management Company in another note.
Analysts have forecast a period of market volatility in the wake of the deal last Thursday, saying that European officials must still demonstrate viable efforts to restore growth and bring longer-term fixes to the debt problems of the countries that share the euro.
Italian 10-year government bond yields pushed above 6 percent, to levels not seen since August. Credit-default swap rates on a basket of Western European government debt were wider at 304, a difference of about 15 basis points from Friday, according to Markit, although Greece debt spreads was just a half point wider and spreads widened in Italy by 40 basis points.
In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro zone blue chips closed down 3.1 percent, while markets in Germany and Paris lost about 3.2 percent. The FTSE 100 in London was down 2.8 percent. Asian markets were down around 1 percent or less.
''I think it is a big sell-off -- profit-taking after an enormous, ferocious, violent run upward,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, speaking about the declines in stocks.
But he also forecast that some of the data to be released this week could restore market attention to the economy in the United States.
''I think Europe is certainly part of the reason'' for the down day, he said. ''Where we end this week is going to have more to do with the data coming from Main Street, U.S.A.''
In particular, Federal Reserve policymakers hold a two-day meeting that ends on Wednesday, and on Friday the government's monthly report on the job market is released. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect 95,000 in nonfarm payrolls for October, down from 103,000 the previous month.
Last week figures on United States gross domestic product showed growth rose in the third quarter, suggesting that the recovery had not stalled: total output of goods and services grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent.
Financial stocks were down 3.8 percent on Monday. Energy stocks were nearly 4.4 percent lower and materials were down 4 percent. The first American casualty of the European debt crisis, MF Global, filed for bankruptcy protection for its United States parent company on Monday.
''Firms can go under remarkably quickly,'' said Guy LeBas, the chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, reflecting on the liquidity issues of the company
''What we are seeing are the skeptics of the European plan come out of the woodwork today,'' Mr. LeBas said, remarking on trade in general in the financial markets.
The United States 10-year Treasury bond yield was 2.13 percent compared with 2.32 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: The Road Ahead for Occupy Wall Street

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Beyond Occupy'' (column, Oct. 31):
Bill Keller misses the point of the Occupy Wall Street movement. An amalgam of issues motivates the millions of people throughout the country who have identified with the effort. 
Their number includes students in debt for educations that do not lead to employment, homeowners whose property is underwater, individuals whose retirement savings are suddenly at risk, voters who see that those they elect tend to the needs of a constituency of which they are not a part, and people who see that the financial ''experts'' whose machinations brought down the economy are not held accountable.
These are Americans who deserve better than to be piously mocked for their lack of leadership and a constrained agenda. The incestuous liaison between financial power and elected politicians is the issue. Those who are a part of that partnership should take note that if elections don't count and demonstrations are ignored, the Occupy movement may include civil disobedience or worse.
DONALD de FANO Somerset, Mass., Oct. 31, 2011
To the Editor:
Occupy Wall Street faces brutal attrition by weather and indifference in the coming months unless it takes these steps:
First, declare victory in getting the movement known throughout the nation and the world.
Next, declare Phase 2: spending the winter months lobbying and spearheading petition drives.
Finally, threaten to reassemble in the spring if sufficient progress is not being made toward reform.
This not only provides a graceful way to exit Zuccotti Park, but also gives the participants a few months to figure out what exactly they want.
HOWARD B. WEBER New York, Oct. 31, 2011
To the Editor:
Bill Keller and most of the media pundits fail to get the Occupy movement. Specific aims won't provide a lasting solution for our ills. The root problem is a broken and corrupt system that values money above all else. We have to change the system itself to vastly reduce the power of money.
For more than three decades, nearly every political decision by Congress and the White House, regardless of party in control, has been made with an eye to its effect on the 1 percent. They are the only ones who are represented in our representative government.
RAY BELLAMY Tallahassee, Fla., Oct. 31, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''Did You Hear the One About the Bankers?'' (column, Oct. 30):
Thomas L. Friedman has it absolutely right. But I would go a step further with the idea he quoted from the blogosphere: ''U.S. congressmen should have to dress like Nascar drivers and wear the logos of all the banks, investment banks, insurance companies and real estate firms that they're taking money from. The public needs to know.''
Let's simply ban any lobbying that involves money, and any other form of lobbying must be recorded and published with easy access for the public.
The United States preaches about corrupt governments, yet functions on a grand scale of ''legalized bribery,'' as Mr. Friedman puts it.
The results of this hypocrisy can clearly be seen in the multiple Occupy demonstrations across this country.

HEADLINE: Congress Questions the I.R.S. About Delays in Its Oversight of Nonprofit Hospitals

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
In August, the Illinois Department of Revenue moved to revoke the property tax exemptions enjoyed by three major nonprofit hospitals after a court ruling determined that a fourth hospital in the state did not provide enough charity care to justify the tax benefit.
Those hospitals, however, remain exempt from federal taxes -- a far bigger benefit -- because the Internal Revenue Service is not collecting information to assess the extent of the care for poor and uninsured patients that nonprofit hospitals nationwide are supposed to provide. In September, the governor of Illinois suspended the revocation pending legislation that set more definitive guidelines.
An overhauled tax form for nonprofits would give the federal tax agency that data, but complaints from the American Hospital Association and aspects of the new health care law have prompted the I.R.S. to delay requiring hospitals to fill out the portion of the form on charity care. Hospitals may not have to fill it out this year, either, because the agency has yet to make a decision. 
Jessica Curtis, project director for the hospital accountability project of Community Catalyst, a consumer advocacy group, said she could not understand why the I.R.S. had not enforced the reporting requirement. The new schedule ''asks a good set of questions that are pretty straightforward and easy to answer,'' Ms. Curtis said. ''Many of them are questions most major hospitals have already been voluntarily answering, anyway.''
She said regulators might not understand the impact such disclosure had on poor patients and their advocates. ''In the current environment, more and more patients are trying to figure out what's available to them, and this schedule would help,'' she said.
Sarah Hall Ingram, commissioner of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division of the I.R.S., said the new federal health care legislation, not hospital complaints, had influenced the agency's decision to reconsider the requirement.
Now, Congress has started asking questions about the reporting required of nonprofit hospitals -- and a wide range of other issues around the tax agency's oversight of charities. Last month, Charles W. Boustany Jr., Republican of Louisiana and a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, sent the I.R.S. a letter seeking an explanation of how it conducted nonprofit oversight and what it was doing to tighten compliance with the laws and regulations governing charity and philanthropy.
In particular, Mr. Boustany asked the I.R.S. to explain its plans for monitoring the so-called community benefits that nonprofit hospitals provided. He also wanted the agency to outline how it would comply with requirements for filing annual reports to Congress on the charity care provided by all hospitals.
In the letter, Mr. Boustany, who is chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on oversight, wrote that panel members were concerned that ''tax exempt organizations may not be complying with the letter or the spirit of the tax-exempt regime, yet continue to enjoy the benefits of tax exemption.''
In a subsequent telephone interview, Mr. Boustany said: ''We need to get a general sense of what's going on in this whole sector of the economy. Ways and Means hasn't looked at it for some time, and I'm really trying to take the role of oversight very seriously.''
In the last decade, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Bill Thomas, the former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, were the most aggressive among lawmakers trying to exert control over the nonprofit sector. ''There is strong bipartisan interest,'' Mr. Boustany said, in having Congress be more active in supervising these organizations.
A number of lawyers, accountants and state regulators say Congressional attention is long overdue. They have expressed frustration with what they regard as the I.R.S.'s failure to police nonprofits, which come to life at the rate of roughly one every 10 minutes.
''I thought we had learned from the financial crisis what happens when regulators don't do their jobs,'' said Dean A. Zerbe, national managing director of the tax consulting firm Alliantgroup and formerly a staff lawyer on the Senate Finance Committee. ''It's often the most vulnerable in our society who lose when the I.R.S. refuses to regulate nonprofits.''
The I.R.S. concedes that several regulatory issues have remained unresolved for some time, but it blames Congress for muddy mandates. It also notes that its rules have to apply to museums and homeless shelters alike.
But provisions under the 2006 Pension Protection Act offer an example of lengthy delays in enforcement. For instance, the I.R.S. was supposed to issue rules to force more gifts to be donated from supporting organizations, which are similar to private foundations but do not have a 5 percent payout requirement, and the charitable giving accounts known as donor-advised funds, which similarly have no federal payout rate.
Five years after the pension law was passed, the I.R.S. is still soliciting comments on new rules for supporting organizations, and it has not even begun tackling donor-advised funds.
Senator Grassley, the author of the provisions, said the I.R.S. tells him that the Treasury Department has not signed off on the proposals for supporting organizations -- and Treasury officials say the I.R.S. is procrastinating. ''Every day that Treasury and the I.R.S. play the blame game is another day that money doesn't get into the hands of the charities that are the whole reason for the existence of these funds and organizations,'' Mr. Grassley said.
Ms. Ingram said the pension legislation imposed such great demands on the agency that it had to engage in triage. Its first priority became the overhaul of the nonprofit database, resulting in the revocation of tax-exempt status for hundreds of thousands of charities. Pending even longer are efforts to impose greater disclosure of the use of management companies and other related businesses that can mask compensation paid to nonprofit executives. The I.R.S. has been seeking comment on that issue for 10 years, said Paul Streckfus, editor of the newsletter EO Tax Journal.
''This is deja vu all over again, been there, done that, since this issue first came up a decade ago,'' Mr. Streckfus said. ''Ten years have passed without resolution of this issue, which doesn't reflect very well on the I.R.S.'s ability to regulate the tax-exempt sector.''
He pointed out that the National Association of State Charity Officials had repeatedly filed objections to the tax agency's proposals on the issue. State regulators worry that stricter rules ''could encourage tax-exempt charities to hide lavish executive compensation by transferring managers to third-party contractors to make such arrangements invisible.''
Ms. Ingram said that the issue had been addressed when the I.R.S. overhauled the tax form nonprofits use.

HEADLINE: Portraying the Face of Job Growth

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The presidential campaign of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas started broadcasting its second television ad on Monday in Iowa.
THE SCRIPT Mr. Perry looks directly into the camera and says, ''If you're looking for a slick politician or a guy with great teleprompter skills, we already have that, and he's destroying our economy. I'm a doer, not a talker. In Texas, we created 40 percent of the new jobs in the entire country since June of 2009. And we cut a record $15 billion from our state budget. Now, they say we can't do that in Washington. Well, they're wrong, and they need to go. I'm Rick Perry, and I approve of this message.'' 
ON THE SCREEN In the second of his ads to hit the Iowa airwaves, Mr. Perry loses his tie. The camera captures his face in a close-up against a gleaming white background, a match to his gleaming white teeth, which viewers see an awful lot of because he grins throughout the ad. There are no big graphics or action shots, just Mr. Perry looking into the camera for 30 seconds.
ACCURACY Mr. Perry repeats what has become his central message to voters: that he is a capable economic steward with a proven record. The job creation statistic he cites is backed up by official numbers from the state and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. There is some question about whether the more accurate measure compares Texas to the net change in jobs nationally or to the number of jobs created only in states with employment increases, but there is no doubt that Texas has been an engine of job growth.
Critics have noted that the unemployment rate in Texas was 7.7 percent in June 2009 yet now stands at 8.5 percent, the highest level since the late 1980s. The other figure in the ad -- that the state cut $15 billion from its budget -- is accurate. But like nearly all state budgets, there is some fudging. In May, state lawmakers approved a budget that reduced spending by making deep cuts to public education ($4 billion) and economic development ($2.7 billion), but also by reducing their estimates of the cost of Medicaid over the next two years. Some estimates put the possible shortfall at $4.8 billion.
SCORECARD So far, Mr. Perry has a claim that none of his Republican rivals can make: that he has presided over a state with booming job creation. But then there is the matter of whether a governor can ever credibly claim responsibility for job growth when so many factors other than public policy determine the direction of a state's economy. Texas has, in fact, been adding jobs steadily since 1980. With its reference to his being ''a doer, not a talker,'' the ad nods to Mr. Perry's choppy debate performances and tries to turn them into an asset. He's genuine, not scripted and publicist-approved, the ad suggests, which could be a dig at Mitt Romney and President Obama.

HEADLINE: Studying the Numbers On Perry's Flat Tax

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Gov. Rick Perry's proposal for an opt-in flat tax would primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans, according to a new analysis from the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research organization. Compared with current tax policy, the plan would most likely reduce federal tax revenue by $570 billion, or about 15 percent. 
The plan, released last week as part of Mr. Perry's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, allows taxpayers to calculate their personal income taxes under the existing tax code, which is progressive. But it also allows taxpayers to instead have their income taxed at a flat 20 percent rate. In this alternative system, long-term capital gains, qualified dividends and Social Security benefits would not be taxed, and only a handful of deductions would be allowed. Once a household chooses the new system, it cannot switch back.
Because no one would be forced to use the alternate system, Mr. Perry has said, no one would have to pay higher taxes (at least initially; presumably if a family's income changes a few years after entering the plan, it may no longer be advantageous). Even so, the greatest beneficiaries of the flat-tax option -- that is, the households that would be most likely to switch to this system -- are far and away the highest earners:

-296,845
Top 0.1 Percent
99.0
-1,556,660
Of all households in the bottom quintile of the tax distribution, only 18.9 percent would pay less in taxes under the Perry plan.
Meanwhile, 83.3 percent of households in the top quintile would get a tax cut. Closer inspection shows that almost every household in the top 1 percent would be offered a tax cut.
The size of the typical tax cut is also much larger for the richest households, both in raw numbers and as a share of that household's income. For households in the top 0.1 percent, for example, after-tax income would rise by 27.4 percent. If every American household, however, chose the flat-tax system, after-tax incomes across the country would increase by an average of just 5.3 percent.
In addition to changes to individual income taxes, the Perry plan would also reduce the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent; allow companies to expense all investment purchases immediately; make any income that American companies earn abroad exempt from United States federal taxes; and repeal the federal estate taxes and various taxes contained in the Affordable Care Act.
The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, has also created tables showing tax cuts by dollar income (as opposed to percentile) and how families with different marital structures and varying numbers of children would most likely be affected.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Japan Intervenes in Effort To Weaken Its Currency

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's latest effort to shore up the export end of its economy by forcing down the value of the yen came too late to help businesses like the Honda Motor Company and the Panasonic Corporation, which on Monday blamed the strong yen for hurting their profits.
The Japanese government intervened in foreign exchange markets early Monday, selling yen for dollars for the fourth time in a little more than a year. 
The strong yen is a burden for Japan as it seeks a path to recovery after natural and nuclear disasters this year. While companies have been quick to rebuild factories and restore supply chains, the yen has undermined revival for the nation's exporters, which drive much of its economic growth, by making their products less competitive overseas.
Honda said its net income fell 56 percent to 60.4 billion yen, or $796 million, in its fiscal second quarter, compared with 135.9 billion yen a year ago, and sales fell 16.3 percent to 1.886 trillion yen. With the yen trading at an average of 78 to the dollar, compared with 86 a year ago, Honda said exchange rates knocked 36.7 billion yen off of its books.
It is forecasting an average of 75 yen to the dollar for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends in March.
Honda's shares fell $2.68, or 8.23 percent, to close at $29.87 on Monday.
Panasonic, meanwhile, cited the yen in warning that it expected to lose 420 billion yen in the 12 months through March, a sharp reversal from an earlier forecast of 30 billion yen in profit.
Its shares fell $0.92, 0r 8.4 percent, to close at $10.06 on Monday.
In addition, both companies said that the sustained flooding in Thailand would hurt future business. Parts shortages because of the flooding will force Honda to cut North American factory production by half in November, the company said.
The Toyota Motor Company also cut overtime for production in North America this week because of the flooding, which began in July.
In early foreign exchange trading Monday, the dollar fell to a post-World War II low of 75.31 yen, apparently prompting Japanese officials to act. As Japan confirmed its unilateral intervention, the dollar jumped more than 4 percent against the yen before falling to 78.17 yen by evening. On Tuesday morning, the yen was largely unchanged against the dollar.
Given the limited and short-term results of past interventions, it was unclear whether the effect of the action on Monday would last. Japan has held back from intervening more actively as the United States has pressed another major Asian exporter, China, to ease its control of the renminbi.
Jun Azumi, the Japanese finance minister, said at a news conference that Japan would continue to intervene until it was satisfied with the results. He declined to comment on how much of the currency the government had sold to weaken it.
Mr. Azumi called the yen's climb ''excessive,'' blaming speculative traders for the movements and warning that the movements did not reflect Japanese economic reality.
''I have repeatedly said that we would take decisive steps against speculative moves in the market,'' Mr. Azumi said. But the market ''has unfortunately not reflected our economic fundamentals at all.''
Japan intervened as world leaders remained focused on efforts to contain the European debt crisis. Speaking in Tokyo, the head of Europe's bailout fund said the Japanese government had reassured him of Japan's continued purchase of European bonds, according to Reuters.
Europe has been urging countries with large foreign exchange reserves, like China and Japan, to help bail out Europe's indebted economies by buying bonds issued by the European Financial Stability Facility, the European bailout fund.
''The Japanese government will continue to buy the E.F.S.F. bonds that we have been issuing over the last 10 months, and we will continue to be in contact about future operations,'' Klaus Regling, the chief executive of the fund, said after a meeting with Takehiko Nakao, the Japanese vice finance minister for international affairs, Reuters reported.
Mr. Regling arrived in Tokyo after visiting Beijing over the weekend with similar requests.
The last time Japan entered currency markets was Aug. 4, when it sold a record 4.5 trillion yen and bought dollars, causing the yen to tumble temporarily. But a week later, the currency was back above its levels before the intervention.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Dissenting, or Seeking Shelter? Homeless Stake a Claim at Protests

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Reporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood from Boston, Robbie Brown from Atlanta, Dan Frosch from Denver, Ian Lovett from Los Angeles, Colin Moynihan from New York, Malia Wollan from Oakland, Calif., and Steven Yaccino from Chicago.

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Robert Gaffney, who came here from Oklahoma 10 years ago, settled on a scrap of burlap the other day on a grassy hill outside City Hall, surveying the tents and crowd that make up Occupy Los Angeles. For many of his neighbors at City Hall Park, this is a center of protest and political grievance. For Mr. Gaffney, it is the latest piece of land that he calls home.
It is, he said, more comfortable than the sidewalk in Hollywood that he has been living on for the last few months. It is safer and less sketchy than Skid Row, the homeless colony a few blocks away.
''It's different here,'' said Mr. Gaffney, 31. ''I find myself getting sleep. Interesting conversation.'' He held up a pair of dirty socks. ''But I haven't figured out how to do laundry.'' 
Mr. Gaffney is hardly an unusual presence in the Occupy demonstrations across the country these days. From Los Angeles to Wall Street, from Denver to Boston, homeless men and women have joined the protesters in large numbers, or at least have settled in beside them for the night. While the economic deprivation they suffer might symbolize the grievance at the heart of this protest, they have come less for the cause than for what they almost invariably describe as an easier existence. There is food, as well as bathrooms, safety, company and lots of activity to allow them to pass away their days.
''When the tents went up, everybody moved in,'' Douglas Marra, a homeless person in Denver, said. ''They knew they could get stuff for free.''
But their presence is posing a mounting quandary for protesters and the authorities, and divisions have arisen among protesters across the country about how much, if at all, to embrace the interlopers. The rising number of homeless, many of them suffering from mental disorders, has made it easier for Occupy's opponents to belittle the movement as vagrant and lawless and has raised the pressure on municipal authorities to crack down.
In Atlanta on Saturday, demonstrators who had been thrown out of Woodruff Park by the police moved into upper floors of the Peachtree-Pine homeless shelter in a full-scale embrace of the cause of the 600 residents who live below them. It gave the demonstration more of a political focus, and not incidentally expanded its size.
''The homeless bring numbers,'' said Alex Smith Jr., 50, a former repairman who lives at the shelter and joined the protests. ''They bring a voice.''
But in places like Nashville, New York, Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif., protesters talk about feeling unsafe because of the presence of homeless people.
''There are a lot of them here that have mental problems and that need help. They are in the wrong place,'' said Jessica Anderson, 22, who is herself homeless, sitting with friends on a tarp at the Los Angeles site. ''They have been creating more problems. There was one guy who showed up last night and he would not shut up: Saying all kinds of crazy stuff all night.''
In Nashville, organizers described the homeless as more of a detriment to the movement than an asset. ''This is keeping people away: It distracts a lot of energy away from the issues we're fighting for when we're just managing life in the camp,'' said Bob Titley 56, one of the participants in Occupy Nashville. ''A lot of women felt unsafe camping out at night. It discourages a lot of people from participating.''
The influx of homeless has been continuing at a steady pace, even as the overall populations of some of the demonstrations have faded under the pressures of dropping temperatures, the passage of time and increasingly aggressive police tactics. Some organizers estimated that as many as 30 percent of the people camping out in some cities were chronically homeless, a figure that seems impossible to verify.
That said, in many encampments, the evidence of a homeless population was plentiful amid the more high-quality tents: blankets, shopping carts, piles of clothes, and people sleeping on the grass, a sheet pulled over their heads. Nan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said the demonstrators and the homeless have some shared interests.
''Homeless people, I think, identify with Occupy because it's about inequities,'' she said. ''And it's another group that is trying to live outside. It's not surprising that there's a confluence here.''
Interviews across the country attest to the complexity of the situation.
At Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, some homeless have integrated themselves into Occupy Wall Street, protesters said. But others, they said, appeared to be opportunists looking for free food and clothes, and were often disruptive. Hero Vincent, 21, said that he was a member of a security team that roamed the park and has several times broken up disputes involving people who appeared to be homeless.
''It's bad for most of us who came here to build a movement,'' he said. ''We didn't come here to start a recovery institution.''
In Chicago, where there has been a steady influx of homeless people, organizers said there were just occasional problems, involving drinking alcohol or provoking violence. ''We just ask them to leave,'' said Taylor Stekkinger, 18, a member the group's organizational committee.
While some homeless people said they were appreciative of the protesters' cause, other said they were more grateful for the amenities. Cameron Rose, 26, who spent the past two months sleeping in restrooms and under highways in Oakland, called it a welcome respite from a life of worry about food and safety.
''If I need clothes, someone donates clothes,'' he said. ''If I need to take a shower, someone helps me find a place to do that. If I need medical help, there are medics here. Everyone gets fed well, 24/7. I need medical marijuana but I have no money. Here, people give it to me.''
At a food tent here in Los Angeles, the homeless are often the first in line when a pot of stew comes out, many of them wandering over from Skid Row.
''If you are hungry and are in need of a meal, we will serve you as long as you do not disrupt the occupiers,'' said Michele Watson, one of the managers of the food tent, on a soft and sunny day that was a reminder of why so many homeless people have settled in this city. ''We don't turn anyone away. I don't care what your address is.''

HEADLINE: Global Shares Fall As New Anxiety Arises Over Europe

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER and JACK EWING; Michael J. de la Merced and Ben Protess contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks in the United States and in Europe were sharply lower on Monday as uncertainty emerged about the agreement reached in Europe last week to address the debt crisis there.
Major equity indexes fell 2 percent or more, sending the broader market in the United States back into negative territory for the year. Major indexes in Europe fell about 3 percent.
Stocks were lower throughout the session, under pressure from disappointing economic data in Europe, and tumbled sharply late in the session after the prime minister of Greece, George Papandreou, said that his Socialist government would hold a national referendum on the rescue package, raising questions about Greece's ability to follow through on its part of the hard-won deal to stabilize the euro.
That announcement came after the release of economic data earlier in the day by the European statistics agency that inflation remained well above the European Central Bank's target level and that unemployment in Europe remained stubbornly high. 
Bank stocks were hit particularly hard after the European debt crisis claimed its first American financial institution, MF Global, the brokerage firm run by Jon S. Corzine. MF Global, holding more than $6 billion in sovereign debt of European countries, filed for bankruptcy protection. Citigroup and Bank of America each fell about 7 percent.
The economic data in Europe came at a bad time for Mario Draghi, who will take over as head of Europe's central bank on Tuesday and will preside over his first policy meeting on Thursday. The bank's policy committee will face a choice of whether to keep a tight rein on inflation or address rising unemployment and further signs of a looming recession.
As signals of a downturn accumulate, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development called on Monday for the central bank to essentially ignore inflation by cutting interest rates to encourage growth.
''The status quo is not acceptable,'' Angel Gurria, the secretary general of the agency, said in Paris as the organization updated its economic forecasts ahead of the meeting of the Group of 20 government leaders in Cannes, France beginning Thursday.
In comments aimed at G-20 leaders, Mr. Gurria called for a bolder response to what the organization said would be ''a marked slowdown'' in the euro area next year, including periods of declining economic output. Growth in the United States will also remain weak next year, the organization predicted, below the level needed to substantially reduce unemployment.
''Much of the current weakness is due to a generalized loss of confidence in the ability of policy makers to put in place appropriate responses,'' the organization said in a statement.
In the United States, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 31.79 points, or 2.47 percent, to 1,253.30. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 276.10, or 2.26 percent, to 11,955.01 and the Nasdaq composite index was down 52.74 points, or 1.93 percent, at 2,684.41.
''Risk aversion is once again taking hold in markets,'' strategists at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company said in a market commentary.
The S.& P. was down 0.35 percent for the year after Monday's declines, while the Dow was up more than 3 percent and the Nasdaq 1 percent. Still, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1,041.6 points in October for its biggest monthly point gain ever.
Treasury instruments surged in a flight to safety.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year bond rose 1 26/32, to 100 3/32, and the yield fell to 2.12 percent from 2.32 percent late Friday.
''Although encouraged by what we consider to be a good start, we suspect Europe will require other measures going forward to effectively deal with its sovereign debt problems,'' said the U.S.A.A. Investment Management Company in another note.
In Italy, the prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi is under pressure to improve the economy. But Italy appears to be a source of worry for investors about whether the country will be able to service its debt. On Monday, 10-year Italian government bond yields pushed above 6 percent, the highest rate since August. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro zone blue chips closed down 3.1 percent, while the DAX in Germany and the CAC 40 in Paris lost about 3.2 percent. The F.T.S.E. 100 in London was down 2.8 percent.
Official data from Europe reinforced the pessimistic economic outlook. Inflation in the 17 European Union countries that use the euro was steady in October at a 3 percent annual rate, according to figures from Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency. That was contrary to analysts' predictions of a slight decline because of slowing economic growth.
Meanwhile, unemployment edged higher, to 10.2 percent in September from 10.1 percent in August, Eurostat said.
The data, along with a muted official forecast for Spanish growth, offer no easy choices for Mr. Draghi, who succeeds Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the central bank.
The Bank of Spain said Monday that the Spanish economy stopped growing in the three months through September, as government austerity measures cut into domestic consumption.
At the same time, inflation remained well above the central bank's target of about 2 percent. As a result Mr. Draghi, eager to establish his credentials as an inflation fighter, may be hesitant to preside over a rate cut just days after assuming the leadership.
''Our forecast is for the first cut to be delivered this week, but this uncomfortably high headline-inflation reading may make the E.C.B. want to wait until December,'' analysts at HSBC wrote in a note to clients.
Unemployment was highest in Spain, at 22.6 percent, and in Greece, at 17.6 percent. Italy recorded one of the biggest jumps in joblessness, to 8.3 percent from 8 percent, as well as one of the biggest increases in inflation, to 3.8 percent from 3.6 percent.
''I think it is a big sell-off -- profit-taking after an enormous, ferocious, violent run upward,'' James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said in discussing the decline in stocks.
But he also forecast that some of the data to be released this week could restore market attention to the economy in the United States.
''I think Europe is certainly part of the reason'' for the down day, he said. ''Where we end this week is going to have more to do with the data coming from Main Street, U.S.A.''
In particular, Federal Reserve policy makers hold a two-day meeting that ends on Wednesday, and on Friday the government's monthly report on the job market is to be released.
On Monday, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index had a reading of 58.4 in October, meaning business activity in the United States continued to expand, but at a slower pace than in September, when it registered 60.4.

HEADLINE: Report Says New York Fed Didn't Cut Deals on A.I.G.

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The findings of a federal investigation released Monday raised new questions about the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's handling of the 2008 bailout of American International Group.
The report, by the Government Accountability Office, says that New York Fed officials have offered inconsistent explanations for their decision to pay other financial companies the full amounts they were owed by A.I.G., and that some of the explanations were contradicted by other evidence.
The report also asserts that the decision to pay the full amounts, rather than seeking concessions as the government later did in other cases, disregarded the expectations of senior Fed officials in Washington and the expressed willingness of some of the companies to accept smaller payments. 
In one case, when a company offered to accept a smaller amount of money, officials at the New York Fed responded that they had decided to pay the full amount of the debt, the report said.
The agency's report revisits a controversial chapter in the history of the financial crisis: the government's decision to sink tens of billions of dollars into A.I.G., the world's largest insurance company, which was running out of money to cover its vast and losing bets on the health of the housing market. Much of that money was then paid to other companies to honor their outstanding contracts with A.I.G.
The basic conclusion echoes the findings of previous federal investigations. The rescue mission succeeded, but efforts to minimize the costs and risks borne by taxpayers were insufficient. But the new report also raises concerns about the explanations subsequently offered by New York Fed officials.
For example, the G.A.O. says that officials at first told its investigators that they had initiated discussions about possible concessions with most of the 16 companies that stood on the other side of insurance-like contracts, called credit-default swaps, with A.I.G.
Then, according to the report, the officials said they had contacted eight companies before abandoning the effort. Even then, the report said, only four of those companies confirmed that they had been contacted by the Fed.
The New York Fed declined to comment on the specific account of the negotiations. Officials of the bank, including Timothy F. Geithner, then the president of the New York Fed and now the Treasury secretary, have testified that they needed to act quickly to prevent greater damage to the financial system, and that they chose the approach that was most likely to succeed and easiest to enact.
The bank said in a statement Monday that it had ''put together an effective lending program that minimized disruption to the economy from A.I.G. while safeguarding the taxpayer interest.''
Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, said the report highlighted the importance of the financial legislation passed last year.
''This report reinforces the need to implement provisions in Dodd-Frank that will prohibit the use of taxpayer dollars to artificially prop up or benefit one firm,'' said Mr. Cummings, who with Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, requested the report as a final word on the controversy.
The Federal Reserve Board of Governors voted in September 2008 to let the New York Fed lend up to $85 billion to A.I.G. as part of a deal that placed the company under federal control. The bailout was expanded several times, ultimately expanding to more than $180 billion. And roughly a quarter of that money was used to pay 16 companies that had bought credit-default swaps from A.I.G. -- a roll call of the most prominent names on Wall Street, including Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs.
Federal Reserve officials in Washington expected that the New York Fed would negotiate discounts with those companies since, without the government's intervention, they might have received far less.
An analysis commissioned by the New York Fed recommended concessions around $1.1 billion to $6.4 billion. But according to the New York Fed, when it asked companies if they were willing to accept voluntary discounts, only one company said yes, conditional on everyone else doing it, too.
New York Fed officials told the G.A.O. that they had little leverage to secure concessions from the companies. Moreover, they concluded that A.I.G.'s inability to secure concessions in earlier negotiations suggested that the banks were unwilling to compromise. And they were constrained by a decision to apply the same repayment terms to all of the counterparties.
The G.A.O. report questions the basis of the Fed's insistence on equal treatment, noting that there were significant differences in the quality of the assets covered under the insurance agreements, and therefore the potential losses for each company were quite different. An analysis found that under extreme conditions, the losses would vary from 75 percent of the original value down to 1 percent.
The differences, the study concluded, ''might have offered an opportunity to lower the amount'' that the government sank into the rescue. Fed officials told the G.A.O. that negotiating with each company individually was impossible given the pressure to act.
The report also questions the Fed's assertion that it could not wrest concessions from French banks -- who held some of the largest contracts -- because French law banned them from accepting discounts unless A.I.G. had filed for bankruptcy. A French official told the G.A.O. that there was no such prohibition, although such a decision might have raised legal concerns.
The Fed's actions contrast with the agreement that European governments, led by Chancellor Angela Markel of Germany, secured from some of the same institutions in October to accept discounts of up to 50 percent on their holdings of Greek debt.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Inequality

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
We live in a polarizing society, so perhaps it's inevitable that our experience of inequality should be polarized, too.
In the first place, there is what you might call Blue Inequality. This is the kind experienced in New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Dallas, Houston and the District of Columbia. In these places, you see the top 1 percent of earners zooming upward, amassing more income and wealth. The economists Jon Bakija, Adam Cole and Bradley Heim have done the most authoritative research on who these top 1 percenters are.
Roughly 31 percent started or manage nonfinancial businesses. About 16 percent are doctors, 14 percent are in finance, 8 percent are lawyers, 5 percent are engineers and about 2 percent are in sports, entertainment or the media. 
If you live in or around these big cities, you see stores and entire neighborhoods catering to the top 1 percent. You see a shift in social norms. Up until 1970 or so, a chief executive would have been embarrassed to take home more than $20 million. But now there is no shame, and top compensation zooms upward.
You also see the superstar effect that economists have noticed in the income data. Within each profession, the top performers are now paid much better than the merely good or average performers.
If you live in these big cities, you see people similar to yourself, who may have gone to the same college, who are earning much more while benefiting from low tax rates, wielding disproportionate political power, gaining in prestige and contributing seemingly little to the social good. That is the experience of Blue Inequality.
Then there is what you might call Red Inequality. This is the kind experienced in Scranton, Des Moines, Naperville, Macon, Fresno, and almost everywhere else. In these places, the crucial inequality is not between the top 1 percent and the bottom 99 percent. It's between those with a college degree and those without. Over the past several decades, the economic benefits of education have steadily risen. In 1979, the average college graduate made 38 percent more than the average high school graduate, according to the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke. Now the average college graduate makes more than 75 percent more.
Moreover, college graduates have become good at passing down advantages to their children. If you are born with parents who are college graduates, your odds of getting through college are excellent. If you are born to high school grads, your odds are terrible.
In fact, the income differentials understate the chasm between college and high school grads. In the 1970s, high school and college grads had very similar family structures. Today, college grads are much more likely to get married, they are much less likely to get divorced and they are much, much less likely to have a child out of wedlock.
Today, college grads are much less likely to smoke than high school grads, they are less likely to be obese, they are more likely to be active in their communities, they have much more social trust, they speak many more words to their children at home.
Some research suggests that college grads have much bigger friendship networks than high school grads. The social divide is even starker than the income divide.
These two forms of inequality exist in modern America. They are related but different. Over the past few months, attention has shifted almost exclusively to Blue Inequality.
That's because the protesters and media people who cover them tend to live in or near the big cities, where the top 1 percent is so evident. That's because the liberal arts majors like to express their disdain for the shallow business and finance majors who make all the money. That's because it is easier to talk about the inequality of stock options than it is to talk about inequalities of family structure, child rearing patterns and educational attainment. That's because many people are wedded to the notion that our problems are caused by an oppressive privileged class that perpetually keeps its boot stomped on the neck of the common man.
But the fact is that Red Inequality is much more important. The zooming wealth of the top 1 percent is a problem, but it's not nearly as big a problem as the tens of millions of Americans who have dropped out of high school or college. It's not nearly as big a problem as the 40 percent of children who are born out of wedlock. It's not nearly as big a problem as the nation's stagnant human capital, its stagnant social mobility and the disorganized social fabric for the bottom 50 percent.
If your ultimate goal is to reduce inequality, then you should be furious at the doctors, bankers and C.E.O.'s. If your goal is to expand opportunity, then you have a much bigger and different agenda.

HEADLINE: Failed Solar Company's Auction Draws Bargain Hunters

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KANELLOS

 BODY:
FREMONT, Calif. -- To some people, the bankruptcy of the solar-module maker Solyndra shows the folly of government trying to pick winners in technology markets. To others, the furor over its $535 million federal loan guarantee represents an attack on the solar industry and the Obama administration's clean energy policies.
And then there are those who see bargains on slightly used scanning electron microscopes, walk-in ovens and multiton cranes. 
This week, auctioneers will sell off many of Solyndra's assets, including Herman Miller chairs, laptop computers and miles of copper wiring. But the real steals will lie in the exotic manufacturing tools, which could go for 25 to 90 percent off.
Solar start-ups and other technology companies are already scouting for deals in the auction, which will be conducted in person and online on Wednesday and Thursday.
''A commercial electron microscope can sell for $600,000 to $1 million. A used one at auction can sell for $750,000 to $250,000,'' said Michael Bartholomeusz, chief executive of AQT Solar, which plans to join the bidding. ''The equipment is probably in pretty good condition. A lot of these tools are made to last in a productive environment for five to 10 years.''
Solyndra probably will not be the last clean energy company offering discounts on its industrial equipment.
On Sunday, Beacon Power of Massachusetts, a maker of flywheel systems used to store electricity, filed for bankruptcy protection. The company, which had promoted its technology for managing the electricity produced by solar and wind power plants, had received a $43 million federal loan guarantee and had borrowed $39 million of that amount.
Solar has become one of the more active segments in industrial liquidation auctions, said Ross Dove, a managing partner at Heritage Global Partners, which will conduct the Solyndra auction.
In October, Heritage handled the sale of the assets of SpectraWatt, a defunct solar company spun out of Intel in 2008, to Canadian Solar for $4.95 million. SpectraWatt had raised over $90 million from private investors and received loans from New York State. Court documents show SpectraWatt has liabilities totaling more than $38 million.
Four or five other solar auctions could occur in the coming months, Mr. Dove said. BP Solar unloaded equipment through Heritage earlier this year.
Prospective bidders in the Solyndra auction were allowed a look at the equipment on Monday at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters.
The dizzying array of items for sale, on display in four buildings for the preview, underscores the complexity of modern manufacturing. One room contained a collection of environmental testing chambers, used to heat solar panels at 85 degrees Celsius (about 185 degrees Fahrenheit) at 85 percent humidity for 1,000 hours.
Another piece of machinery, a corrosion chamber from Singleton, simulates salty seaside fog.
Aaron Robinson, a regional sales manager for Envirotronics, was browsing, with an eye on possibly buying some items cheap and flipping them for a quick profit. But buyers need to beware, he said. ''There are no warranties. You buy it as-is,'' he said. ''We don't even know if they work.''
Ted Martinez, president of MCT Industries, a military contractor in Albuquerque, flew up to check out the selection of industrial robots. He said a Kuka robotic arm (lot number 709) might sell new for $150,000 to $200,000, but at auction, it's possible to buy one for $30,000 to $60,000.
Of course, not everyone will walk away happy.
Terry Liu, a marketing manager for Quanta Laboratories, a testing and verification company in nearby Santa Clara, Calif., was looking at a batch of copper tubes and wires. ''It's probably a great deal,'' he said.
Unfortunately, the auction lot consists of 40 pallets of cables, far more than he needs. ''I only have a 28,000-square-foot warehouse,'' he said.
Mr. Dove declined to estimate how much money the auction might bring in, although the proceeds might not put much of a dent in Solyndra's liabilities, which stood at $749 million as of Jan. 1.
Taxpayers will probably have to wait until later in the month, when Solyndra's intellectual property and real estate will be sold in a separate proceeding, before learning whether they will recover any money from the company's bankruptcy. Under a deal approved by the Energy Department during the company's final months, private investors are entitled to recover $69 million from the asset sales before the government gets any money.
The Dove family is in some ways the technology industry's go-to undertaker. In the 1970s, Ross and his brother Kirk took over a mercantile business founded by their grandfather and moved into industrial auctions.
The family handled the sale of the roll-top desk once owned by Fred Joseph, the former chief executive of the junk-bond firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, and patents for a putter owned by a golf club manufacturer.
''My little brother Kirk sold the big 'E' from the Enron lobby,'' Mr. Dove said.
In the 1990s, the brothers began buying up regional auctioneers and sold the business, then called DoveBid, to GoIndustry in 2008. Heritage was formed right after that.
''We do really well in bullish economies because there are a lot of mergers and acquisitions,'' Mr. Dove said. ''We also do well in distressed economies because there are a lot of insolvencies and plant closures.''
And Solyndra is not the only client with starry-eyed dreams that came crashing down to earth: on Nov. 11, Heritage will sell the remains of Rocketplane Kistler, a Wisconsin company that was trying to build reusable spacecraft for NASA.

HEADLINE: Cain Confronts Claim From '90s of Harassment

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Contributing reporting were Jeff Zeleny, Susan Saulny, Mike McIntire, Matt Flegenheimer and Trip Gabriel.

 BODY:
Herman Cain, a surprise leader in the Republican race for the presidency, acknowledged Monday that he was accused of sexual harassment while chief of the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s, but he denied wrongdoing in an episode that has consumed his rising candidacy.
Facing the biggest test of his campaign just as it was demanding notice from a political world that had not seen him coming, Mr. Cain spent the day in a whirlwind of television interviews and news briefings that were originally supposed to highlight his economic plans but became an exercise in damage control.
He maintained that he had been falsely accused and that internal investigations at the association had corroborated that. But his explanations evolved during a day in which conservative supporters rallied against what they called an unfair attack from the news media, while others expressed fresh doubts about a campaign that has yet to prove it has the mettle to survive a national nominating battle.
Mr. Cain's shifting explanations and the gaps in the story made it hard to determine the impact of the revelations on his long-term prospects in states like Iowa, whose crucial caucuses are just two months away. 
In the early afternoon, Mr. Cain told a gathering at the National Press Club in Washington that ''I am unaware of any sort of settlement'' related to harassment accusations, which he called ''a witch hunt.'' But in an interview with Greta Van Susteren of the Fox News Channel shown Monday night, he acknowledged that in at least one case ''there was some sort of settlement or termination,'' worth ''maybe three months' salary.''
The allegations against Mr. Cain were first reported on Sunday night by Politico, which detailed separate incidents between Mr. Cain and two women on the association staff that led to paid separation packages. The incidents, it said, included ''conversations allegedly filled with innuendo or personal questions of a sexually suggestive nature.''
Mr. Cain described one of the incidents in his interviews with Fox and with PBS, telling the PBS anchor Judy Woodruff: ''I referenced this lady's height, and I was standing near her, and I did this saying, 'You're the same height of my wife,' because my wife is five feet tall, and she comes up to my chin. This lady's five feet tall, and she comes up to my chin.'' He said, ''So obviously she thought that that was too close for comfort.''
In separate interviews, two people who were affiliated with the restaurant group at the time said that they knew of the second female employee, and that she had received a payment related to harassment accusations against Mr. Cain during his 1996-99 tenure as the association's chief executive. The two spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid being pulled into the matter publicly.
They said the second woman similarly had complained about what she said had been Mr. Cain's inappropriate conduct toward her. One of them said she had been taken aback by one interaction in particular while they were traveling, but this person declined to give details. He said he believed the allegation of harassment was not the only issue involved in the woman's termination package.
The restaurant association declined to comment on what it termed ''personnel matters that allegedly took place nearly 15 years ago.'' And neither of the women returned phone and e-mail messages left for them at home and at work.
With only scant details from the encounters available so far, the already tricky business of divining how the allegations may effect Mr. Cain's rising political fortunes was made all the more difficult on Monday.
His candidacy has been enigmatic from the start, and his rise to the top -- or near the top -- in national polls and in surveys of early voting states has upended expectations in the Republican presidential contest. Aides to rivals including former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who shares top billing with him in polls, and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who trails them both, have expressed skepticism that Mr. Cain's campaign can go the distance but have been unable to ignore his strong marks from voters or the appeal of his blunt policy prescriptions.
Minutes after news of the allegations broke Sunday night, comparisons were drawn to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and the 1991 confirmation process in which he was accused of having harassed Anita Hill, his former aide.
''This is another high-tech lynching,'' the conservative commentator Ann Coulter asserted, reprising Mr. Thomas's famous term from his confirmation hearings. But there was uncertainty in the early voting states.
''The verdict is out, and people want to give him the benefit of the doubt,'' said Steve Scheffler, the chairman of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, who has met with Mr. Cain and other candidates. ''If it's no more than exaggerations or rumors, his campaign is not hurt. If it's more than that, there could be some challenges for him.''
Perhaps no state is more important to Mr. Cain's campaign than Iowa, whose Republican caucusgoers have given their nod to unlikely conservative candidacies like that of former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas in 2008.
While Mr. Cain was a leading candidate in the Iowa Poll published in The Des Moines Register over the weekend, he had drawn criticism among conservative voters for professing opposition to abortion but also saying he believes the decision should in limited cases be left to the family and not the government.
Having spent little time in Iowa in recent months and failing to take obvious steps to recruit supporters or precinct leaders who are the traditional foundation of a winning caucus campaign, he has become something of a mystery to many Republicans in the state.
His lack of traditional campaigning, his continuation of a book tour and his occasionally attention-grabbing statements -- including a proposal for an electrified fence along the southern border that could kill Mexicans trying to enter the United States illegally -- have led to doubts about his overall seriousness.
New questions about the stewardship of his campaign arose on Monday after The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that the campaign may have accepted tens of thousands of dollars in goods and services from a tax-exempt organization founded by Mr. Cain's chief of staff, Mark Block, an apparent violation of campaign finance laws.
Documents obtained by the newspaper suggest the group, Prosperity USA, paid for Mr. Cain's travel expenses to Iowa, Louisiana, Las Vegas and Houston as well as $3,764 for iPads. Federal election and campaign laws prohibit tax-exempt groups from engaging in political activity or contributing to election campaigns. Officials at the campaign and the group did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Mr. Cain said on Monday that he was coming under so much scrutiny now because he is leading in so many polls, joking, ''I really know what it feels like to be No. 1.''
On PBS, Mr. Cain seemed to acknowledge that his tendency to joke could have caused some of the problems between him and the woman at the restaurant association, saying ''no'' when asked if he had ever behaved inappropriately, then adding, ''But as you would imagine, it's in the eye of the person who thinks that maybe I crossed the line.''
One of the people who said he had known of some of the harassment allegations and one of the payments, a former staff member, said Mr. Cain's personal style might have led to misunderstandings.
''Herman is a very gregarious person. He put his arm around me on many occasions,'' he said. ''If you were a young lady and this is the C.E.O. -- you know how it is when someone in power puts their arm around you -- you might feel uncomfortable.''
Tim Albrecht, a Republican activist who has worked on several presidential races in Iowa, predicted Mr. Cain would get a ''fair shake'' if he answered the allegations quickly.
''Iowans are forgiving folks,'' said Mr. Albrecht, a spokesman for Gov. Terry Branstad. ''But they want to know if there's validity to it or if there is fire around that smoke.''

HEADLINE: Corzine Crashes Like It's 2008

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
When Goldman Sachs went public on May 4, 1999, Jon Corzine, who was then the firm's chief executive, held a stake that was suddenly valued at $305 million. So, perhaps, it's uncharitable to complain about the piddling $12 million severance he was poised to gain if he had managed to sell his current firm, MF Global Holdings, over the weekend.
But I'm going to complain anyway. The idea that Corzine, who single-handedly destroyed MF Global Holdings, was in a position to command so much as a penny in severance is horrifying. It suggests two things. The first is the extent to which ''heads-I-win-tails-you-lose'' remains the operative concept for Wall Street compensation. The second is that one's politics doesn't much matter when it comes to lining one's pockets. Corzine is an avowed liberal who has decried income inequality and Wall Street pay -- but right up until the end, he had his hand out for millions he didn't deserve. 
To read a recounting of Corzine's tenure at MF Global Holdings is to wonder how he missed the 2008 financial crisis. Oh, yes! That's right: he was the governor of New Jersey, a job he won in 2005 after one term in the Senate. Still, you would think that as a former Wall Street titan, he would have noticed that taking giant bets on shaky, long-term bonds while financing your operations with overnight loans that can be pulled at any second is not exactly a recipe for success.
But that's exactly what Corzine did. After taking over the firm in March 2010 -- just months after losing his re-election bid to Chris Christie -- he decided to transform the derivatives broker into something sexier, something more like his old firm, Goldman Sachs. In particular, he wanted MF Global to risk its own capital, trading for its own account, just like Goldman had so successfully done when he was running it.
Stunningly, the risky bets he took at MF Global were on European sovereign debt. ''Europe wouldn't let these countries go down,'' he reportedly told another Wall Street executive, according to The Wall Street Journal. The firm's position in European bonds grew to $6.3 billion -- and its leverage ratio to 40 to 1, according to Egan Jones, a ratings agency. That is, it had $40 of debt to every $1 of equity. It was remarkably 2008-ish.
As was the denouement. After a poor fiscal second quarter was announced last week, its stock fell off the cliff and Moody's downgraded its debt. Its trading partners became skittish, and its access to the overnight lending market started to disappear. It was the classic modern Wall Street run on the bank -- just like Lehman Brothers. Finally, Corzine's only hope was to sell the firm. When that effort failed early Monday morning, a bankruptcy filing was inevitable. Just like Lehman.
When I read MF Global Finance's second-quarter results, though, what popped out at me was its compensation expenses: 64 percent of revenues went to compensation. In any industry but Wall Street, that would be obscene. Indeed, in a talk he gave at Princeton last year, Corzine said that he'd been ''arguing about compensation sins of Wall Street'' for decades. Not enough to actually do anything about it, though, once he was back in charge of a firm.
Then there's Corzine's own compensation. When he walked in the door, he negotiated a salary of $1.5 million. (Incredibly, MF Global Holdings paid a $400,000 fee to Corzine's lawyers.) He also received a signing bonus of $1.5 million, and $11 million in stock options.
But here's the kicker. Like many executives -- on Wall Street and off -- Corzine's agreement also covered his eventual departure. If he left MF Global because, say, it was sold, his $11 million in stock options would immediately vest, and he would get a $12.1 million golden parachute. Of course, the MF Global proxy statement doesn't call it a golden parachute. It calls the payment ''severance.''
There is nothing in the proxy statement about what would happen if Corzine destroyed the firm by making bad trading bets. There is nothing that links his payout to, you know, performance. No matter what, he would be owed the $12.1 million. All he had to do was sell the firm.
So that's what he tried to do. I'm not saying the payout was his only motive or even his primary motive. But, in less than two years, he took a $7-a-share stock and turned it into a $1.20 stock. Had he succeeded in selling MF Global, the price would surely have been less than $1. It seems almost criminal that Corzine was still entitled to a $12.1 million payment after destroying so much value. Yet that would have been the result. And you wonder why people are angry?
Instead, the deal he had been negotiating fell through -- and so did Corzine's severance. Now he's just another unsecured creditor. In this day and age, I guess that counts as progress.

HEADLINE: It's Lonely Without Goldman Net

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
He was from Goldman Sachs.
That is the refrain you hear over and over again when MF Global insiders try to explain why they went along with Jon Corzine's risky trades - the same ones that caused a crisis of confidence at the firm and, ultimately, its bankruptcy on Monday.
Mr. Corzine was at Goldman Sachs for nearly 25 years, rising to become its senior partner before being ousted in a boardroom coup in 1999. He was considered a bright, aggressive trader who had a history of making big bets that paid off. When he joined MF Global last year - after a decade in politics as a Democratic senator and governor of New Jersey - he talked openly about his ambition to create a mini-Goldman. 
Being a former Goldmanite has long been considered the ultimate calling card.
But, in some cases, it has proved to be a liability: A series of blunders by former senior Goldman executives raises questions about whether Goldman's secret sauce can actually be exported. Think John Thain. Or Robert Rubin. Or J. Chris Flowers.
''Those people walked around with halos around them. Myths have been created on Wall Street. Nowhere is the myth bigger than at Goldman,'' William Cohan, the author of ''Money and Power, How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World,'' a 658-page volume that explored the firm's history and culture, said in an interview.
But Mr. Cohan, pausing briefly, added that whatever myths might exist around Goldman, ''Everybody puts their pants on the same way, one foot at a time.''
It is a lesson that some of Goldman's smartest alumni have learned the hard way, none more so than Mr. Corzine.
His outsize bets at MF Global on European sovereign debt - many of which he made personally - proved the firm's undoing because of the large amount of leverage that he used to magnify his bets. As of the firm's filing at the end of June, it had $44.4 billion worth of liabilities; yet it only had $1.4 billion of equity. That kind of leverage was enough to scare credit ratings agencies into downgrading the firm last week, which led counterparties to stop trading with it.
In truth, Mr. Corzine's bet may still prove to be correct. Many of the Italian and Spanish bonds that Mr. Corzine bought - most of which mature in 2012 - are still trading at 98 and 99 cents on the dollar. Mr. Corzine's investment thesis always was that the European Central Bank and the European Union would find a way to prop them up. But Mr. Corzine's bets also relied on short-term funding and, given the skepticism in the market, counterparties quickly ran for cover.
Even if Mr. Corzine's gamble was right, it is hard to believe that he could have made such a large bet at Goldman Sachs.
''The one thing Goldman really does well - better than everyone else - is the internal accounting and compliance function. They give those people a lot of power,'' Mr. Cohan said. At MF Global, Mr. Cohan asked: ''Who in the world was going to stand up to Jon Corzine? Nobody. They didn't have the compliance or the culture.''
That may be the special ingredient at Goldman. While the firm encourages risk-taking by its traders, it also empowers its risk managers - at other firms considered the back office - to constantly challenge even the most senior leaders to keep them from going over the cliff.
Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's current chief executive, loves to tell people that he spends ''98 percent of my time thinking about 2 percent probabilities.'' That is not something you hear from most bank chief executives.
In the case of Mr. Corzine, at MF Global, he was the chairman and chief executive. Given that he was directing the investment strategy, he might as well have been the compliance officer too. The only people with any authority who could have meaningfully pushed back were the board. And it is possible the Goldman halo may have even kept regulators at bay.
''The firm may have been cut some slack given who he is,'' said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. (Still, he says he think it was unlikely.)
Once outside of the Goldman fishbowl, with its layers of risk management, Wall Street can become a lonely place for some of its most famous alumni.
Mr. Thain, Goldman's former chief financial officer, took the top job at Merrill Lynch after personally doing what he thought was a deep dive into the firm's financial records and declaring that the firm had a clean bill of health. Less than a year later, he was forced to sell the firm to Bank of America and was later fired after the disclosure of huge losses. (In fairness, Mr. Thain didn't create Merrill's problems - they happened on Stanley O'Neal's watch - but he didn't manage them particularly well.)
Robert Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman - and former Treasury secretary - joined Citigroup as a senior adviser and board member in 1999. A dazzling trader when he was at Goldman, he counseled Citigroup that the firm should take more risk. While he did not manage the firm's trading or its day-to-day activities, the firm lost more than 70 percent of its value during his tenure, and ultimately the government had to bail out the company twice. It is clearly debatable whether he deserves blame, but the outcome is incontrovertible. What is clear is that Citigroup did not have the kind of risk management or culture that Mr. Rubin had grown accustomed to at Goldman.
Likewise, Mr. Flowers, a remarkable Goldman banker, left the firm in 1998 to strike out on his own. One of his first investments - Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which became Shinsei Bank - turned out to be a grand slam home run, reaping him $1 billion in profits. But since then, the investment has lost ground and his investment record has been spotty. His most recent fund has already lost almost $4 billion.
Which brings us back to Mr. Corzine, who is a good friend of Mr. Flowers. Mr. Corzine happens to be an operating partner and investor in Mr. Flowers's firm. Mr. Flowers is, in turn, an investor in MF Global. His fund stands to lose about $48 million as a result of MF's bankruptcy. Maybe they could have used another risk manager from Goldman?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Tales From the Supercommittee

 BODY:
There are only three weeks left for the Congressional supercommittee to come up with a plan to reduce the federal deficit by at least $1.2 trillion, and there is no sign that the panel is anywhere close to reaching an agreement. Only one side, in fact, seems to be trying -- the Democrats -- and it is being far too accommodating, given the fierce obstructionism of the other side, the Republicans. 
Last week, Democrats offered a $3.2 trillion compromise -- proposing cuts to domestic spending and social-insurance programs that were so large as to be imprudent. Their proposal was instantly rejected by Republicans on the panel. Why? Because the Democrats included $1.3 trillion in new tax revenues, which is exactly $1.3 trillion more than Republicans are willing to accept.
In contrast, Republicans say they are willing to cut $2.2 trillion from the deficit, but only about $40 billion of that would be from new revenues. None would be from new taxes. (Republicans are actually proposing to lower overall tax rates, paid for by ending some tax loopholes. They say that that would produce $200 billion in new tax revenues, based on the discredited notion that the government can then count on higher revenues from increased growth. No impartial judge, including the Congressional Budget Office, accepts this kind of estimate.)
If the Republicans maintain this intransigence until the Nov. 23 deadline, they will trigger a huge sequester of federal dollars: an across-the-board, $1.2 trillion cut in spending, including $454 billion from defense programs. But it already seems clear that nothing is more important to them than protecting corporations and the wealthy from tax increases: not the Pentagon, not homeland security, not education, and not the country's economic health. President Obama got burned earlier this year when he tried to work out a ''grand bargain'' with the Republican leadership of the House. The only real compromise it was interested in was one in which it dictated all of the terms.
Nonetheless, in an almost naive gesture of good faith, Democratic Congressional leaders began talking last week about their own version of a grand bargain that goes far beyond the supercommittee's minimum mandate to avoid the sequester.
The plan would cut $475 billion from Medicare and Medicaid over 10 years, including $200 billion in cuts to beneficiaries, which is far more than the Obama administration proposed in September. It would also cut $400 billion from regular discretionary spending, which, combined with earlier cuts this year, would be bigger than those proposed by the Gang of Six or Bowles-Simpson deficit reduction panels, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Both cuts would go too far in reducing programs vital to the nation's most vulnerable population.
Democratic officials say these cuts would be considered only alongside tax increases. The danger is that Republicans will try to scoop up those proposed cuts while rejecting the increases. In the next 23 days, we will learn whether the six Democrats on the committee will hold out for real balance, and whether even a single Republican will dare to join them.

HEADLINE: Corzine-Led Firm is Said to be Eyed on Missing Funds

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS, MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and SUSANNE CRAIG; Azam Ahmed contributed reporting.

 BODY:
9:55 p.m. Updated Federal regulators have discovered that hundreds of millions of dollars in customer money has gone missing from MF Global in recent days, prompting an investigation into the brokerage firm, which is run by Jon S. Corzine, the former New Jersey governor, several people briefed on the matter said on Monday.
The recognition that money was missing scuttled at the 11th hour an agreement to sell a major part of MF Global to a rival brokerage firm. MF Global had staked its survival on completing the deal. Instead, the New York-based firm filed for bankruptcy on Monday.
Regulators are examining whether MF Global diverted some customer funds to support its own trades as the firm teetered on the brink of collapse. 
The discovery that money could not be located might simply reflect sloppy internal controls at MF Global. It is still unclear where the money went. At first, as much as $950 million was believed to be missing, but as the firm sorted through its bankruptcy, that figure fell to less than $700 million by late Monday, the people briefed on the matter said. Additional funds are expected to trickle in over the coming days.
But the investigation, which is in its earliest stages, may uncover something more intentional and troubling.
In any case, what led to the unaccounted-for cash could violate a tenet of Wall Street regulation: Customers' funds must be kept separate from company money. One of the basic duties of any brokerage firm is to keep track of customer accounts on a daily basis.
Neither MF Global nor Mr. Corzine has been accused of any wrongdoing. Lawyers for MF Global did not respond to requests for comment.
Now, the inquiry threatens to tarnish further the reputation of Mr. Corzine, the former Goldman Sachs executive who had sought to revive his Wall Street career last year just a few months after being defeated for re-election as New Jersey's governor.
When he arrived at MF Global - after more than a decade in politics, including serving as a Democratic United States senator from New Jersey - Mr. Corzine sought to bolster profits by increasing the number of bets the firm made using its own capital. It was a strategy born of his own experience at Goldman, where he rose through the ranks by building out the investment bank's formidable United States government bond trading arm.
One of his hallmark traits, according to the 1999 book ''Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success,'' by Lisa Endlich, was his willingness to tolerate losses if the theory behind the trades was well thought out.
He made a similar wager at MF Global in buying up big holdings of debt from Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium and Ireland at a discount. Once Europe had solved its fiscal problems, those bonds would be very profitable.
But when that bet came to light in a regulatory filing, it set off alarms on Wall Street. While the bonds themselves have lost little value and mature in less than a year, MF Global was seen as having taken on an enormous amount of risk with little room for error given its size. By Friday evening, MF Global was under pressure to put up more money to support its trading positions, threatening to drain the firm's remaining cash.
The collapse of MF Global underscores the extent of investor anxiety over Europe's debt crisis. Other financial institutions have been buffeted in recent months because of their holdings of debt issued by weak European countries. The concerns about MF Global's exposure to Europe prompted two ratings agencies to cut their ratings on the firm to junk last week.
The firm played down the effect of the ratings, saying, ''We believe that it bears no implications for our clients or the strategic direction of MF Global.''
Even by Sunday evening, MF Global thought it had averted its demise after a disastrous week. Over five days, the firm lost more than 67 percent of its market value and was downgraded to junk status, which prompted investor desertions and raised borrowing costs.
Mr. Corzine and his advisers frantically called nearly every major Wall Street player, hoping to sell at least some of the firm in a bid for survival.
On Friday, the asset manager BlackRock was hired to help MF Global wind down its balance sheet, which included efforts to sell its holdings of European debt. BlackRock was able to value the portfolio, but did not have time to find a buyer for it given the other obstacles MF Global faced, according to people close to the talks.
By Saturday, Jefferies & Company became the lead bidder to buy large portions of MF Global, before backing out late in the day.
On Sunday, a rival firm, Interactive Brokers, emerged as the new favorite. But the Connecticut-based firm coveted only MF Global's futures and securities customers.
While MF Global was resigned to putting its parent company into bankruptcy, Interactive Brokers was also willing to help prop up other MF Global units, including a British affiliate.
By late Sunday evening, an embattled MF Global had all but signed a deal with Interactive Brokers. The acquisition would have mirrored what Lehman Brothers did in 2008, when its parent filed for bankruptcy but Barclays of Britain bought some of its assets.
But in the middle of the night, as Interactive Brokers investigated MF Global's customer accounts, the potential buyer discovered a serious obstacle: Some of the customer money was missing, according to people close to the discussions. The realization alarmed Interactive Brokers, which then abandoned the deal.
Later on Monday, when explaining to regulators why the deal had fallen apart, MF Global disclosed the concerns over the missing money, according to a joint statement issued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Regulators, however, first suspected a potential shortfall days ago as they gathered at MF Global's Midtown Manhattan headquarters, the people briefed on the matter said. It is not uncommon for some funds to be unaccounted for when a financial firm fails, but the magnitude in the case of MF Global was unnerving.
For now, there is confusion surrounding the missing MF Global funds. It is likely, one person briefed on the matter said, that some of the money may be ''stuck in the system'' as banks holding the customer funds hesitated last week to send MF Global the money.
But the firm has yet to produce evidence that all of the $600 million or $700 million outstanding is deposited with the banks, according to the people briefed on the matter. Regulators are looking into whether the customer funds were misallocated.
With the deal with Interactive Brokers dashed, MF Global was hanging in limbo for several hours before it filed for bankruptcy. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a number of exchanges said they had suspended MF Global from doing new business with them.
It was not the first time regulators expressed concerns about MF Global.
MF Global confirmed on Monday that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the S.E.C. - had ''expressed their grave concerns'' about the firm's viability.
By midmorning on Monday, the firm filed for bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Time Warner Trims Its Excesses

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
The sprawling taupe-colored offices of Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner's chairman and chief executive, overlook Central Park from the 11th floor of one of Manhattan's most plum pieces of commercial real estate. Mr. Bewkes cannot wait to move out.
To him, the company's corporate headquarters in the gleaming towers of the Time Warner Center is an ''indulgence,'' a giant reminder of past mistakes made by one of the world's largest media companies. ''There was a burgeoning overhead reaching $500 million a year, including this edifice you're sitting in,'' Mr. Bewkes said.
Time Warner, one of New York City's largest commercial tenants, is now studying how to consolidate most of its four million square feet of office space. That probably means finding a new headquarters in a less expensive part of Manhattan and vacating the Time Warner Center, the Time & Life building at Rockefeller Center and many of its remaining 13 New York-area buildings. The company estimated that cutting back on its real estate footprint could save as much as $150 million a year. 
The real estate moves are part of a larger effort to slim down a company that many investors say they believe became bloated during the acquisition frenzy of the last decade, when media companies raced to acquire expensive Internet companies. The failure of the 2000 AOL-Time Warner merger, widely considered one of the worst corporate marriages of all time, and other debacles like News Corporation's $545 million loss on MySpace, have motivated companies to rebalance.
''For every action there's an equal or opposite reaction,'' said Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. ''The conglomerate-building of the 2000s, which peaked with AOL-Time Warner, well, this is the reaction.''
Barry M. Meyer, chairman and chief executive of Warner Brothers, said the trend toward major corporate expansion pushed companies ''to tack on new businesses that were kind of adjacent.'' That strategy, he said, ''defused efforts rather than focusing them.''
These lessons have taken hold under Mr. Bewkes at Time Warner, which owns Time Inc.; HBO; Turner Broadcasting stations like CNN, TNT and TBS; and the Warner Brothers studio. The company will also consolidate shared services like human resources and information technology. Some departments will be relocated to other parts of the New York area and states like Florida that offer tax incentives.
The cost-reduction measures are expected to save $500 million annually starting in the next several years, and are meant to help Time Warner afford a bigger investment in content -- the television shows, movies, sports and news that drive revenue. Spending on content has jumped 7 percent annually since 2008 as Time Warner has shed costs in other areas, the company said.
''The idea is to take money being spent on insignificant things out and put it into significant things which are programming, journalism and digital translations of our products,'' Mr. Bewkes said.
On Wednesday, Time Warner will release its third-quarter profits. In the second quarter, which ended in August, the company reported its highest growth rate since 2007 and revised earnings up slightly for the year.
The slimming down at big media companies is partly a matter of survival. In recent years, fast-growing Internet companies like Groupon, Facebook and Netflix, recent bumps notwithstanding, have made old media companies seem stodgy and oversize, and with sagging stock prices to prove it. Costly mistakes have compounded the problem and accelerated the desire to shed assets that are not core to their businesses.
Mr. Bewkes took over Time Warner in 2008 and the next year spun off Time Warner Cable. Also in 2009, he completed the spinoff of AOL and vowed to make Time Warner a purely content-driven company. He dissolved NewLine, the 40-year-old movie production company, into Warner Brothers, which resulted in roughly 600 layoffs. In 2003, as chairman of Time Warner's entertainment and networks group, Mr. Bewkes brokered the $2.6 billion sale of the Warner Music Group.
In the years ahead, real estate consolidation represents a major initiative for Time Warner. Leases on several of its New York office buildings expire as soon as 2017; the company said it would be willing to break longer-term leases.
In September, Time Warner said it would open a 500-employee office next year in Tampa, Fla., mostly for human resources, payroll and information technology functions. Florida will provide $3.15 million in state and local tax incentives. ''How many data centers do we have, 40?'' said Mr. Bewkes. ''We're going to get down to five.'' Analysts say the reshuffling could result in hundreds of layoffs, something the company declined to comment on.
Last year, Time Warner and CBS Corporation reached a $10.8 billion, 14-year deal that allows Turner's networks to show some games from the men's N.C.A.A. basketball tournament. The company also introduced a Netflix-like service, called HBO Go, that gives HBO subscribers access to the channel's shows via the Internet.
The budget for HBO programs, which drive subscriptions to the premium cable channel and sell internationally, has jumped at least 13 percent since 2006. Next year, HBO will have 14 original series, its highest number ever, including expensive dramas like ''Boardwalk Empire.'' ''That level of increase, which others might think aggressive, was against a tough economic backdrop,'' said Bill Nelson, the network's chairman and chief executive.
Still, Mr. Bewkes has been criticized on Wall Street for his slow embrace of digital streaming deals. He advocates making television and movies accessible over the Internet only to viewers who already pay for a monthly cable or satellite subscription, an idea he calls ''TV Everywhere.''
The cautious embrace of digital deals is primarily meant to protect Time Warner's profitable ad-supported cable channels, particularly TBS and TNT, but those assets have an uncertain future, analysts said. Ratings at TBS, TNT and CNN are down in recent years, according to Nielsen. TBS is paying the late-night host Conan O'Brien a $12 million annual salary, which now looks like an expensive misstep because his show lags in ratings in the crucial 18-49 age group.
Time Warner's stock has gained 7.6 percent in the last year, to $34.99, outperforming the Walt Disney Company, which has dipped 3.5 percent, but it has lagged behind Viacom, which has jumped 13.5 percent.
In emphasizing content, Mr. Bewkes is drawing on his experience at HBO, where as chairman and its chief executive from 1995 to 2002 he oversaw the pay-cable network's push into original programming. Additional spending resulted in lucrative assets like ''Sex and the City'' and ''The Sopranos.''
''You have to remember what Bewkes's legacy is and that's HBO, and HBO succeeded and has continued to succeed and become profitable by investing in content,'' said Larry Haverty, a manager of the Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust, a closed-end fund that owns stock in Time Warner. ''The times the company has gotten into trouble is when they've strayed away from content.''
Mr. Bewkes likes to talk about HBO's bet in 1997 on the 10-part World War II mini-series ''Band of Brothers,'' then the most expensive television series ever. To help cover the $134 million cost, he significantly reduced the network's total marketing budget for the year, which left some executive producers on other HBO shows feeling slighted, according to people with knowledge of the matter who would discuss the matter only anonymously.
''Band of Brothers'' won seven Emmy awards, brought in over $200 million in international deals and DVD sales and still sells well globally. ''The success of the media business isn't going to be determined primarily by cost-cutting,'' Mr. Bewkes said. ''The cost structure simply gives you the gasoline to invest.''

HEADLINE: Despite Losses, Investors Stick With Paulson

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED and JULIE CRESWELL


HIGHLIGHT: John Paulson, one of the winners of the subprime crisis, is having a bad year. Investors are showing unusual patience. 

 BODY:
John A. Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager who made his fortune betting against subprime mortgages, has been fodder for Wall Street gossip as rivals wondered whether investors would bolt after suffering staggering losses this year.
At least for now, pensions, endowments and wealthy individuals are standing by their money manager. Redemption requests, which were due by Oct. 31, totaled less than 8 percent of assets, or roughly $2.4 billion, according to a letter that Mr. Paulson sent to investors on Tuesday.
It's a rare feat for a hedge fund. When returns sink by as much as 50 percent - as one portfolio did at Paulson & Company - investors typically flee at the first opportunity.
But Mr. Paulson has built a reservoir of credibility, largely through past performance and marketing efforts.
Longtime clients are still giddy from 2007, when one credit-focused fund gained 600 percent amid the broader market downturn. Newer institutional investors that have lost millions, like public pensions in New Mexico and Missouri, figure returns will bounce back. Some are even pouring additional money into its funds in anticipation of a turnaround, money that will help offset some of the withdrawals.
"We still have a very high conviction that long-term Paulson is a very good investor," said Jon Sundt, the chief executive of Altegris in La Jolla, Calif., an investment manager that oversees $3 billion. "We have had some investors who have been adding to their investments in Paulson."
Still, Mr. Paulson, who is set to report positive monthly returns in a few days, is in a precarious spot. Since employees account for half of the fund's overall assets, the recent withdrawals amount to nearly 16 percent of the outside capital. And the firm is also attracting new money mainly by offering a break on fees to existing investors, rather than by cultivating new clients.
Should returns remain in the doldrums, some big clients have indicated they will withdraw their money. The next deadline to withdraw from most funds will be next year.
Mr. Paulson's spectacular fall has been watched as closely as his impressive rise.
The soft-spoken son of a corporate finance executive, Mr. Paulson, a former investment banker, ventured out on his own in 1994. Over the years, he produced steady gains, returning an average 16 percent a year in his oldest fund through 2006. He entered the big leagues in 2007, earnings billions of dollars betting against subprime mortgages.
Since then, investors have plowed money into his firm, encouraged by consultants like Cliffwater Associates and banks like Morgan Stanley and Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. At the start of the year, Paulson & Company oversaw $38 billion compared to just $4 billion in 2007.
Some industry players have complained that Mr. Paulson has shown little restraint in his fund-raising efforts, amassing assets at the expense of performance. His marketing team boasts a staff of more than two dozen professionals, higher than many large hedge funds. And he also has separate teams devoted to different types of investors, including endowments, foundations and pension funds.
The firm started to show cracks this year. Mr. Paulson lost $500 million on Sino-Forest, a Chinese timber company accused by an analyst of running a vast Ponzi scheme. His stakes in Bank of America, Citigroup and Hewlett Packard - part of a bullish call on the economy - have also withered.
He conceded to investors in October that he "made a mistake." The Advantage Plus fund is off 47 percent through September. To climb out of that hole and start charging lucrative performance fees, the fund will need to post least 100 percent. Other funds like Advantage and Recovery will have to notch returns of at least 60 percent to get above water. The losses are so significant that some competitors joke Mr. Paulson would need to pull off a Hail Mary, with returns on par with the subprime play.
Investors who have recently met with the money manager say his usual swagger has diminished, and he appears worn. Last month, protesters at Occupy Wall Street focused on his Upper East Side townhouse. He responded in a statement, that "instead of vilifying our most successful businesses, we should be supporting them."
Despite the reversal, investors are largely remaining patient. Some are loath to sell their positions in Mr. Paulson's funds at their low point. Other big institutions are willing to stick by the money manager given the proven team and strong record.
"With a fund of our size, we are going to constantly have investments that do very well and those that don't," said M. Steve Yoakum, executive director of the $30 billion Public School & Education Employee Retirement System of Missouri, which has $118 million with Mr. Paulson. "One of the biggest differences between institutions and private investors is the tendency to sell when things are bad."

HEADLINE: Study: Few Hospitals Qualify for Digital Funds

BYLINE: BRUCE JAPSEN


HIGHLIGHT: About 10 percent of the nation's hospitals meet criteria that would enable them to qualify for extra payments under Medicare and Medicaid. 

 BODY:
Though hospitals are eligible for billions of dollars in federal stimulus money to bring their facilities into the digital age to save money and improve the quality of health care, just one in 10 is ready to meet government standards to qualify for the funds, a new analysis shows.
A study by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), based in Chicago, shows just 10 percent of the nation's hospitals are "now ready" to address all 14 core measures the government is requiring before they can get extra payments from the federal Medicare health insurance program for the elderly or Medicaid health insurance for the poor. 
Hospitals have to first meet criteria that include such things as eliminating handwritten orders and giving patients electronic copies of their medical records when discharged, generally on a disk or a secure e-mail. Hospitals also have to reconcile medications every time a patient moves from one type of care setting to another, such as when a patient is transferred from the emergency room to a nursing floor.
Two years ago, President Obama signed into law the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which was part of the federal stimulus legislation. Nearly $18 billion was to be made available to medical-care providers for the adoption of electronic health records and other information technology, like computerized prescribing systems.
But before providers could get the extra money, they first had to adopt "meaningful use" criteria or show they were using electronic health records in a meaningful way.
"Meaningful use is showing that you did more than install it, but you are actually using it," said Tom Smith, chief information officer at NorthShore University Health System, which operates four hospitals in Chicago's north suburbs along Lake Michigan.
NorthShore, which spent more than $40 million in recent years to introduce electronic health records for its hospitals and 400-doctor medical group, is one of the few hospital operators that has been receiving extra payments. Just 564 hospitals have received extra Medicaid or Medicare payments this, year, the first year of incentive payments.
NorthShore received $11 million in extra Medicare money in its fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Executives say the system is poised to get another $17 million over the next four years as it meets additional government criteria in the next two to three years for providing meaningful use of its health information technology.
The study did not track physician readiness, though many hospital operators, like NorthShore, own doctor practices and are including them in their submissions for funds from Medicare. Government figures indicate just a fraction of physicians are ready to receive incentive payments.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services statistics show that 8,523 physicians are receiving the incentive payments from Medicaid or Medicare for electronic health record enhancements. The American Medical Association says there are about 750,000 physicians who provide patient care in the United States. But the Obama administration believes the financial payments are spurring rapid adoption of health information technology among medical care providers.
Dr. Farzad Mostashari, the national coordinator for Health Information Technology, said fewer than 10 percent of office-based physicians were using electronic prescribing technology in December 2008 and that more than 40 percent did today. In addition, Dr. Mostashari said one-third of primary care doctors were now working with regional extension centers that connect physicians with one another and hospitals across the country to health information technology.
"All of the early indicators are pretty remarkably positive," Dr. Mostashari said. 
Though the vast majority of hospitals have yet to begin receiving the extra Medicare money, HIMSS executives said more were coming online. Another 31 percent of the hospitals in HIMSS's sample of 778 hospitals "should be prepared to meet Stage 1 of meaningful use shortly," the health information trade group said in its report.
"We know hospitals are working hard at it," said John Hoyt, an executive vice president of HIMSS. "Their strategic plan is to get the money. I think they are highly motivated and making good progress."
And NorthShore executives believe the government and patients are getting a good return on the investment.
"Every time we don't do an extra test or have a patient have some kind of allergic reaction, it saves Medicare money," Mr. Smith said.

HEADLINE: Readers Respond: Not-So-Super Committee

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Readers respond to today's lead editorial on the Congressional supercommittee. 

 BODY:
Today's lead editorial takes the deficit-reduction supercommittee to task, scolding the Republicans for their continued fierce obstructionism, and the Democrats for being too accommodating. The editorial board argues that the Democrats' proposed cuts to domestic spending and social-insurance programs are "so large as to be imprudent."
Most readers wonder what else is new. Beach dog, a commenter from New Jersey, writes "Greed and stupidity continue. As the economy stagnates the middle class withers, the Republicans continue to inhabit a parallel universe." And dbsweden, of Sweden, says "we've been there before and seen the Democratic cowardice on display alongside the Republican intransigence."
Other commenters are raising the question of why Washington is focused on cutting the deficit to begin with. RLS of Virginia says "When budgets are cut, state and local governments will be forced to lay off more workers. That means revenues go down, expenditures go up to pay for unemployment, food stamps and Medicaid, and deficits increase. Debt can easily be paid off in good times when people have jobs, spend money, and tax revenues go up."
At least one reader defends the Republicans. RCB of Savannah, Ga., writes "It would seem too obvious to debate except in D.C. that businesses are not in business to pay higher taxes, fees, compliance, etc just look at how your state and local governments compete to attract new business by offering to reduce tax burdens."
Thanks for the comments. Keep them coming.

HEADLINE: 10 Ways to Teach About Election Day

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Ten activities for using The New York Times to turn any election day into a teachable moment with students. 

 BODY:
Any election - whether off-year, midterm or presidential and whether local, state or federal - presents opportunities for learning about civics and how government actually works as well as the importance of active citizenship.
Whether you are teaching about the electoral process in an off year or gearing up for the next presidential race, here are 10 suggestions for how to teach about elections, with links to relevant past lesson plans and other resources.
1. Play Election Bingo: Students peruse The New York Times or a state or local newspaper for information about the upcoming elections. They then play Election Bingo, using a modified version of our bingo (PDF) in which each box consists of a question that is only answerable using information gleaned from the articles that students have examined.
2. Create Fact Sheets: Using newspaper Web sites, voter Web sites and other reliable sources, students find all the offices and issues that will appear on the ballot in your district. They research each candidate's background and stance on important topics, and research all sides of the issue(s) about which local citizens will vote. (If no initiatives will appear on your district's ballot, you may want to assign one up for a vote elsewhere, like the personhood initiative in Mississippi.) Then students create fact sheets to distribute to voters, perhaps by displaying them at the local library.
3. Write Personal Statements: Students explain their political ideology and why they support certain issues, parties and candidates, drawing on political reporting in The Times and elsewhere to make their points, in personal essays. They might also express their views by answering our Student Opinion questions Do You Trust Your Government? and "Would You Vote This Year If You Could?"
4. Get Out the Vote: Working in teams, students create young voters campaigns that both encourage civic participation and educate future voters about their rights and the electoral process. Each team creates a name and mission statement for their campaign, an explanation of why it is important for young people to understand their specific topic and a campaign strategy that describes how they will reach and energize the young people they want to get involved in the electoral process, along with a post-election plan to encourage awareness and interest beyond election day. Their strategies may include plans for how to engage young people who are not yet eligible to vote. How can they get involved
5. Hold a Mock Election: Hold a class or schoolwide mock election using a "ballot" that has all the offices and issues that will appear on the real ballot. Be sure students cast their votes privately and anonymously in a quiet, respectful manner, and remove all election materials, like fact sheets and campaign items, from the "polling place." Have a volunteer "election board" count the votes. After the election is over, students analyze the election data.
6. Visit a Polling Place: To see citizenship in action, students visit their local polling place on election day and write descriptive pieces about what they observe there or news-style articles based on on-site interviews with voters and volunteers. They should choose a specific focus. Descriptive writers might focus, for example, on how election workers handle confused or frustrated voters or on the general scene and atmosphere. Reporters might conduct exit polls or ask voters and volunteers about why they are participating or what message they would like to share with young people.
7. Hunt for Election Results: Students go on an election scavenger hunt, guided by prompts like these: "Produce one statistic on how much money a particular candidate spent on his or her election campaign"; "Find one photograph that could have the caption 'Democracy'"; "List state ballot initiatives that passed." When the scavenger hunt is complete, they create a school newspaper, news radio or television feature reporting the most important news coming out of the election results.
8. Examine the Local Election: Students investigate issues at state in a local election and how they compare with the same or similar issues on the state and national levels. How does a large issue like unemployment play out both locally and nationally
9. Debate a Local Initiative: Students research a local or state ballot initiative to understand, what the initiative would change and the main arguments for and against it. After researching the initiative and the arguments on both sides, students debate the merits of the initiative.
10. Create Candidate Profiles: Where do candidates for office stand on issues? How are they represented and defined in the media, and how accurate are those portrayals? Students create candidate profiles for all of the candidates in local, state or national races as part of a class voter guide that can be distributed in your school or locally.

HEADLINE: Credit Suisse Plans More Job Cuts Even as Profit Rises 12%

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The second-largest Swiss bank said its third-quarter net profit rose to 683 million Swiss francs, and it announced 1,500 additional job reductions. 

 BODY:
6:28 p.m. | Updated 
LONDON - Credit Suisse, the second-largest Swiss bank after UBS, said on Tuesday that its third-quarter profit rose 12 percent, to 683 million Swiss francs, even as the bank announced a further 1,500 job cuts as a result of the weak global economy and continued volatility in the financial markets.
The results missed market expectations. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had predicted a profit of 1.1 billion francs (about $1.3 billion).
Earnings were bolstered by an accounting gain of 1.3 billion francs on Credit Suisse's own debt, which helped offset falling returns from its investment banking, asset management and private banking operations.
Credit Suisse had already announced plans in July to eliminate 2,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting effort. The new layoffs are expected to contribute to a one-time overall cost savings of 2 billion francs by the end of 2013, the bank said.
"During the third quarter we experienced a challenging environment with a high degree of uncertainty, low levels of client activity across businesses and extreme market volatility," Credit Suisse's chief executive, Brady W. Dougan, said in a statement. "We believe subdued economic growth and the low-interest-rate environment and increased regulation that we are seeing may persist for an extended period."
Mr. Dougan said the additional job cuts were a result of a reorganization of the bank's operations, including a reduction in its investment banking operations and an expansion of its wealth management business.
The markets reacted negatively to the company's earnings announcement. The bank's share price dropped almost 8 percent, to $26.71, in New York on Tuesday.
Credit Suisse is the latest European bank to report less-than-impressive earnings linked to the Continent's sovereign debt crisis.
Last week, Banco Santander of Spain reported a 13 percent drop in nine-month net profit, and UBS said earnings fell 39 percent in the third quarter from the period a year earlier, weighed down by a trading scandal that cost the bank $2.3 billion.
Other banks have fared slightly better. On Monday, Barclays of Britain said its profit rose 5 percent in the third quarter, helped by lower provisions for bad loans.
And Deutsche Bank of Germany reported a quarterly profit last Tuesday that exceeded analysts' expectations, though it warned of future job reductions in its investment banking unit after a drop in trading revenue.
Credit Suisse's investment banking division is expected to shrink after the bank announced a 50 percent reduction in its risk-weighted fixed-income assets by 2014. The move comes as the division reported a 190 million franc loss in the third quarter. That contrasts with a 394 million franc gain in the period a year earlier.
"The results are disappointing, but almost all the disappointment comes from investment banking," analysts at J.P. Morgan Cazenove said in a report issued Tuesday.
The bank also said it had set aside 478 million francs in its private banking operations to offset legal costs related to tax evasion charges in both the United States and Germany. Third-quarter net profit in Credit Suisse's private banking division dropped 78 percent, to 183 million francs, from the period a year earlier.
Mr. Dougan said the bank was focusing on new markets, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, to expand its private banking business. Credit Suisse plans to increase revenue from emerging markets to 25 percent of the bank's total by 2014. That compares with just 15 percent from countries like China, India and Brazil this year.
Like the rest of the European banking sector, Credit Suisse has been hit by volatility in the Continent's financial markets and continuing uncertainty related to the sovereign debt crisis.
The bank's core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of the bank's ability to withstand financial shocks, was 10 percent at the end of September. Banks in the euro zone are being required to raise their ratio to 9 percent to protect against exposure to the debt of countries at risk.

HEADLINE: BB&T to Buy Assets From BankAtlantic

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: BB&#038;T, the large North Carolina-based lender, has agreed to buy the bulk of BankAtlantic, a move that will expand BB&#038;T's footprint in the Southeast. 

 BODY:
BB&T agreed on Tuesday to buy the bulk of BankAtlantic in a move to expand BB&T's footprint in the Southeast. 
BB&T, based in North Carolina, will pay $301 million to acquire roughly $2.1 billion in loans and $3.3 billion in deposits from BankAtlantic, making it one of the largest recent bank mergers this year.
But the strategy echoes deals reached during the financial crisis when healthier banks acquired assets from struggling institutions.
 BB&T agreed to buy only the best assets from BankAtlantic, declining to take on nonperforming and other "criticized assets," according to a BB&T statement. That leaves BankAtlantic's parent company, BankAtlantic Bancorp, holding $623.6 million in assets, more than half of which are troubled loans.
"This acquisition of BankAtlantic is a compelling strategic expansion into important long-term markets in Southeast Florida," Kelly S. King, BB&T's chairman and chief executive, said in the statement. He also highlighted that the deal "expressly excludes nonperforming and other criticized assets, as well as other risks, which satisfies our criteria with respect to risk management." 
BankAtlantic Bancorp's chairman and chief executive, Alan B. Levan, acknowledged that the deal featured a "very unique structure." Still, he said, "with the strength of BB&T, one of the nation's largest financial holding companies, we are confident that BankAtlantic's customers and employees will be served well by this transaction." 
BankAtlantic Bancorp, the bank's parent company, will keep a range of performing and nonperforming loans as well as $18.7 million of tax certificates, a controversial business where banks buy homeowners' tax debt. 
Once the deal closes, BankAtlantic Bancorp will adopt a new name and probably sell the remaining assets over time. 
Deutsche Bank Securities advised BB&T, while BankAtlantic was advised by Sandler O'Neill & Partners and Cantor Fitzgerald & Company.

HEADLINE: Olympus Scandal Reveals How Little Has Changed in Japan

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: The case exposes the all-too-cozy nature of the Japanese business model of the 1980s and seen in today's China - consensus driven, government supported and rife with cronyism. 

 BODY:
If there were any doubt remaining, the scandal surrounding the Olympus Corporation of Japan has proved Michael Crichton wrong. What does the late Mr. Crichton, the author of "Jurassic Park" among other books, have to do with this, you may be asking?
Mr. Crichton was responsible for "Rising Sun," the popular book and movie that appeared in the early 1990s when Japan was today's China, about to dominate the world. In "Rising Sun," Japanese businessmen were portrayed as crafty, willing to do anything to succeed against the bumbling Americans. Japanese were even stealing our women, arranging for them to serve as sushi platters at their decadent parties (you have to see the movie to believe this one) . "Rising Sun" and movies like "Gung Ho," which starred Michael Keaton and involved the Japanese takeover of an American auto plant, created a perception that Japanese businesses were going to dominate the world. The Japanese were consensus driven and without the fractious disputes of American capitalism.
Behind this model were the keiretsu, in which Japanese corporations had cross-shareholdings in one another and cooperated to aid one another. Further support came from the Japanese government, which appeared to direct their overall strategies and investments. Against these forces, Mr. Crichton pointed to American doom.
Flash forward to 2011 and it all seems laughable. The Japanese economy cratered almost immediately after "Rising Sun" appeared, and has been in recession for almost two decades.
It is here that Olympus, the camera maker and medical imaging company, and its scandal are relevant. It brings to light the severe failings of Japanese businesses, failures that were papered over by the 1980s boom years.
The Olympus case is disturbing. It appears that Olympus paid $687 million in advisory fees to an unknown group of people for the $1.9 billion purchase of the Gyrus Group of Britain.
Takeover advisory fees are typically around 1 to 2 percent of the transaction value, but this fee was about 36 percent of the entire purchase. Moreover, the money went to a small, little-known brokerage firm named Axes America, which then transferred some of the fee to a newly created Cayman Island company.
Both firms were shut down not long after the payments were made. In three other acquisitions, Olympus paid $773 million for companies that appeared to have little strategic value, and wrote down their value by 76 percent only a year later.
When the newly appointed chief executive of Olympus, Michael C. Woodford, a Briton, demanded an investigation, he was abruptly terminated by a unanimous vote of the Olympus board. Mr. Woodford went public in airing his concerns over these payments. In the wake of this disclosure, Olympus stock has fallen by half before recovering somewhat. United States authorities are investigating.
The Olympus scandal exposes the all-too-cozy nature of Japanese business that was subject to so much praise in the 1980s. Japanese corporations are dominated by insiders, and companies are often run for the benefit of these insiders rather than shareholder interests. Because of the keiretsu and cross-holdings, shareholder pressure and oversight have traditionally been minimal. Hostile takeovers are almost nonexistent, as is shareholder activism.
Though there has been increased government scrutiny of business practices, Japanese regulators have been slow to force changes. Boards were recently required to have at least one independent director or an independent auditor. The result is that Japanese companies have on average about one independent director, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Independence, however, has been loosely defined, and management too often still appoints related parties. There is also a systematic failure of Japanese boards to question management. The Olympus board ostensibly had three independent directors, yet none appeared to question Mr. Woodford's firing.
This operational style - consensus driven, government supported and rife with cronyism - benefited Japan in the years after World War II. Japan was one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The Japanese model worked well in a rising tide as Japanese businesses took advantage of their low-cost base and globalization to reap easy gains against way too comfortable American corporations. Japanese companies were given an able assist by Japanese protectionism, which provided a stable home market.
But Japanese business and its economy have not made the adjustment to the globalized world. The keiretsu have loosened ties during the Japanese recession, but the cronyism has remained. American businesses, under much more capitalistic and shareholder pressure, also adapted and became more competitive.
I would add that we might want to pause and reflect on the value of corporate governance that is too often criticized in the United States as meaningless and burdensome. The active takeover market and corporate governance movement hastened changes in the United States.
There are two important lessons here. First, it remains to be seen if the Olympus case becomes the shock that stirs Japanese business to change. Only last week, Daio Paper, the country's largest maker of tissue products, announced that it would file a criminal complaint against its former chairman, accusing him of illegally siphoning off $140 million, some of it to his own account and some to a Japanese subsidiary of the Las Vegas Sands.
While Daio Paper is taking an active stand, the fact that United States authorities rather than Japanese regulators appear to be taking the lead in investigating the Olympus transactions speaks volumes. Without strong leadership at the top or an inquisitorial prosecutor like an Eliot Spitzer, or a Ferdinand Pecora in the 1930s, meaningful reform is likely to elude Japan.
The men leading Japan do not appear to appreciate the problem. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda told The Financial Times in an interview that "what worries me is that it will be a problem if people take the events at this one Japanese company and generalize from that to say Japan is a country that [does not follow] the rules of capitalism."
The second lesson is one of familiarity. Right now, the discourse is about Chinese domination. The Chinese economy is what economists term command and control. The state directs industry and has profited greatly by doing so. In the United States, meanwhile, there is an outcry over a relatively small loan guarantee to Solyndra, the solar company.
China has clearly benefited from its cheap labor and huge investment. But it also has cronyism, state protectionism and hidden debts at the local level. This sounds like Japan in the 1980s.
It may be that the Chinese economy is different and the government will be able to more actively steer its businesses to change. Or it may just eventually become another Japan, stuck with businesses that do not adapt and do not discard cronyism in order to become more open and competitive.
In retrospect, Mr. Crichton's 1980s view failed to grasp an increasingly competitive and global world economy. Mr. Crichton saw the tide coming in but never looked to see what was below the sea line. After all, it appears to be one of those bumbling Western businessmen who opened the window on Olympus's very odd doings.

HEADLINE: Federal Inquiry of MF Global Escalates

HIGHLIGHT: Multiple federal agencies are examining whether MF Global diverted customer money to support its own trades. 

 BODY:
Federal officials are escalating an investigation into MF Global, the bankrupt brokerage firm run by Jon S. Corzine, as the search continues for roughly $600 million in missing customer money. 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which first detected the missing money last week, decided to issue subpoenas to MF Global and demanded that the firm retain any documents that may be related to the investigation, according to people briefed on the situation. 
 The trading commission along with the Securities and Exchange Commission and exchanges like the CME Group are examining whether MF Global diverted customer money in recent days to support its own trades in a last-ditch effort to save itself - a serious violation of federal rules.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also joined the inquiry, according to a person with knowledge of the case.
The F.B.I. has only started its review of the matter, and there is still no indication that criminal laws were violated. An F.B.I. spokesman declined to comment. 
Neither MF Global nor Mr. Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey and once a top executive at Goldman Sachs, has been accused of any wrongdoing.
In Federal Bankruptcy Court in downtown Manhattan on Tuesday, MF Global's lawyers played down the missing money. Ken Ziman, one of the lawyers, said in the firm's first hearing that banks or clearinghouses had been slow to produce the money.
"To the best knowledge of management, there is no shortfall," Mr. Ziman said.
But regulators on Tuesday still could not locate the customer money, and the firm had not accounted for it.
The downfall of MF Global, and the growing federal investigation into the missing money, threaten to bruise Mr. Corzine's reputation. After losing his bid for re-election as New Jersey's governor in 2009, ending a decade-long run in politics, Mr. Corzine returned to Wall Street, landing at MF Global in March 2010.
In his new role, Mr. Corzine sought to transform MF Global from a sleepy brokerage firm into a high-flying Wall Street presence reminiscent of his former employer, Goldman Sachs. He started buying debt from Italy, Ireland and other troubled European nations at a discount. 
Amid the continuing sovereign debt crisis, the holdings alarmed investors and led to widespread concerns about the health of MF Global. By the last week of October, the stock was in free fall and Mr. Corzine moved to strike a deal to sell off all or part of the firm. 
Early Monday, MF Global disclosed to regulators that it had failed to segregate clients' accounts, breaking fundamental Wall Street rules. The revelation of missing money dashed a potential deal and propelled the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
While it is unclear where the money went, some of the money is expected to turn up as MF Global sorts through the bankruptcy process.Little, if any, money trickled in on Tuesday, however, according to two people briefed on the matter, and roughly $600 million in unaccounted assets remained. 
As of Tuesday night, regulators were still at MF Global's headquarters poring over the firm's books, according to people briefed on the matter. They are, in part, examining whether MF Global used customer money to satisfy demands from trading partners that the firm produce more cash to meet its financial obligations. 
Exchanges, too, are increasing the pressure on MF Global to come up with the assets. 
CME, the giant exchange where MF Global conducted business until Monday, said it was investigating the missing money. With special permission from regulators, CME was planning to take the unusual step of transferring MF Global's customer accounts to other brokerages, potentially without all of the money, according to a person briefed on the matter.
"While we are unable to determine the precise scope of the firm's violation at this time, we are investigating the circumstances of the firm's failure," Craig Donohue, CME's chief executive, said during the exchange's earnings call on Tuesday. 
"We recognize that yesterday was a very difficult day for all concerned," Mr. Donohue added. "As is nearly always the case in matters like this, this is a very fluid situation involving complex legal, regulatory and bankruptcy related issues."
To keep the firm running during the Chapter 11 proceedings, lawyers for MF Global sought approval for several initial motions in bankruptcy court on Tuesday. The presiding judge, Martin Glenn, agreed to let MF Global use $8 million of its remaining $26 million in cash for essential operations, like salary for a skeleton staff. MF Global can use the funds until Nov. 14, at which point the firm would need additional approval.
MF Global said it would try to find extra cash in its operations and raise money by liquidating assets. Mr. Ziman said that the firm was also searching for a lender to provide bankruptcy financing.
As part of the hearing, MF Global also reached an agreement with JPMorgan Chase, the firm's chief unsecured creditor, which had laid claim to most of the firm's $26 million in cash. By letting MF Global use some of the money, JPMorgan argued, it was being pressed into providing an involuntary bankruptcy loan.
To assuage those fears, MF Global agreed to cover some of JPMorgan's legal fees. 
"This is a lifeline for the enterprise," Mr. Ziman said at the hearing.

HEADLINE: K.K.R. in Talks With Samson Investment

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is in exclusive talks to buy some or all of the Samson Investment Company, a family-owned oil and natural gas exploration company. 

 BODY:
After a string of smaller deals in the oil patch over the last two years, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is gearing up for a potential blockbuster takeover.
The private equity giant is in exclusive talks to buy some or all of the Samson Investment Company, a family-owned oil and natural gas exploration company, according to a person briefed on the matter.
K.K.R. has been studying a possible Samson transaction for some time and has been lining up financing with several banks, this person added, cautioning that the talks could still fall apart.
Should the two sides reach a deal, it would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts since the financial crisis of September 2008. K.K.R. can already lay claim to one of the priciest private equity deals in the last year, having led the purchase of Del Monte Foods for $5.3 billion.
Samson currently runs more than 4,000 wells and has at least partial ownership of more than 11,000 wells across the country, according to its Web site. 
Among its businesses is drilling for oil and natural gas in shale formations, an increasingly popular tactic that has driven a wave of takeovers in the energy industry.
A deal would bring to a close the Schusterman family's 40-year control of Samson, which has become a respectable oil exploration player that is still based in Tulsa, Okla. The company's current chairwoman and chief executive is Stacy Schusterman, daughter of the founder, Charles Schusterman.
Ms. Schusterman acknowledged the company's discussions with K.K.R. in an internal memorandum obtained by The Tulsa World:
"If a definitive agreement is reached with K.K.R., it will be because they recognize both the value of our assets and our team," Ms. Shusterman said in the statement. "K.K.R. has stated that if we move forward, they are committed to building our team at each of our current locations."
A K.K.R. spokeswoman declined to comment.
News of K.K.R.'s talks with Samson was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

HEADLINE: Is the Web Amplifying Consumers' Voices?

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Is the power of consumers to change corporate behavior on the rise? 

 BODY:
First, Netflix dropped its plan to make customers have separate accounts for mail order and online movies. Now, Bank of America has reversed plans to charge a $5 monthly fee for some customers who use their debit cards to make purchases. Both decisions came after the original plans were sharply criticized by their customers.
Which leaves us at Bucks wondering: Is consumer power newly ascendant? Or was this just a coincidence involving two separate corporate moves, each of which proved so boneheaded that it had no chance of sticking?
Americans have always been able to make their opinions known by talking to each other and by voting with their feet - the Occupy Wall Street movement, with its "us versus them" theme, is a classic example of the take-it-to-the-streets approach.
But it seems that the new social media may have played a big role here, by making it easier for the masses to organize in-person protests and to voice their unfiltered outrage. (I, for one, first learned of the Netflix move when a Facebook friend vented her frustration.) And it also seems unlikely, if not impossible, that a young woman protesting a bank fee would have rated a personal phone call from a high-ranking Bank of America executive had she not first attracted thousands of supporterson an online petition site.
Yet in other cases, consumer sentiment hasn't seemed to have much impact on unpopular changes--like, for instance, the addition of fees for checked bags by many major airlines.
What do you think? Are new ways of communicating giving consumers more power to change corporate behavior?

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Chain Stores Spreading More Slowly

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Dunkin' Donuts is no longer spreading like the jelly oozing out of a doughnut, according to an annual census of chain stores released by the Center for an Urban Future.. 

 BODY:
New York City may have reached its Dunkin' point.
 After opening more than one store a week in the city for the previous two years, Dunkin' Donuts did not become any more ubiquitous this year, according to an annual census of chain stores released on Tuesday by the Center for an Urban Future. The center, a research organization that has tracked the proliferation of chains in the city for several years, said this year it found the first real signs that the long recession slowed their spread.
 The total number of locations operated by national retail chains in the city rose slightly to 6,994 in 2011, but almost three-fourths of those chains did not add stores in the past year, the report said. 
 All of the growth came outside Manhattan, where the number of chain stores dropped by more than 2 percent, according to the report. The fastest growth came in Queens, which had 5.4 percent more chain stores than in 2010, and in the Bronx, where the growth rate was 3.8 percent.
 Over all, Dunkin' Donuts still had the most stores in the city - 466 - but the Subway sandwich chain narrowed the gap by adding 41 stores for a total of 430. Only about one-fourth of Dunkin' Donuts' locations were in Manhattan, in contrast to Starbucks, which had three-fourths of its 263 New York City stores in Manhattan.
 This year's report marked the demise of the Borders book chain and of the Hollywood video stores. Blockbuster was down to 10 stores, from 45 two years ago. Rapidly replacing video rental shops on the city's streetscape were cellphone stores: Metro PCS and T-Mobile added 100 stores between them in the last year.
 But easily the fastest-growing chain in the city was Family Dollar stores, a discounter that had 49 locations, up from just 5 in 2010, the report said.

HEADLINE: Graduates Versus Oligarchs

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The 99 percent slogan aims too low. 

 BODY:
Dean Baker raises an important point here: it's really awfully late in the game to be saying that the important inequality issue is college graduates versus non-graduates. It's not clear that this was ever true, and it certainly hasn't been true for a while.
I wrote about this years ago, using Ben Bernanke's maiden testimony as Fed chair as an entry point. As I said then, Bernanke -- like many others -- had made
a fundamental misreading of what's happening to American society. What we're seeing isn't the rise of a fairly broad class of knowledge workers. Instead, we're seeing the rise of a narrow oligarchy: income and wealth are becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small, privileged elite.
I think of Mr. Bernanke's position, which one hears all the time, as the 80-20 fallacy. It's the notion that the winners in our increasingly unequal society are a fairly large group - that the 20 percent or so of American workers who have the skills to take advantage of new technology and globalization are pulling away from the 80 percent who don't have these skills. 
...
Why would someone as smart and well informed as Mr. Bernanke get the nature of growing inequality wrong? Because the fallacy he fell into tends to dominate polite discussion about income trends, not because it's true, but because it's comforting. The notion that it's all about returns to education suggests that nobody is to blame for rising inequality, that it's just a case of supply and demand at work. And it also suggests that the way to mitigate inequality is to improve our educational system - and better education is a value to which just about every politician in America pays at least lip service.
The idea that we have a rising oligarchy is much more disturbing. It suggests that the growth of inequality may have as much to do with power relations as it does with market forces. Unfortunately, that's the real story.
Let me illustrate this point with some CBO data. First, from the new report, here are the income shares of the top 1 percent and the rest of the top quintile:
There has been no rise in the share of the 81-99 group! It's all about the top 1 percent.
Second, even within the top 1 percent the gains are going mainly to a small minority. An earlier CBO report, using slightly different methods, looked inside the top 1 percent up through 2005. Here's some of that data:
The big gains have gone to the top 0.1 percent. 
So income inequality in America really is about oligarchs versus everyone else. When the Occupy Wall Street people talk about the 99 percent, they're actually aiming too low.
One last point: I see that David Brooks is arguing that the oligarchy issue, if it matters at all, is a coastal phenomenon, not the issue in the heartland. Let me point out, then, that we have one country, with a tightly integrated economy. High finance is concentrated in New York, but it makes money from the United States as a whole. And even when oligarchs clearly get their income from heartland, red-state sources, where do they live? OK, one of the Koch brothers still lives in Wichita; but the other lives in New York. 
Put it this way: having much of the wealth your state creates go to people who are in effect absentee landlords, whose income therefore shows up in another state's statistics, doesn't mean that you have an equal distribution of income. Out of state shouldn't mean out of mind.
Look, I understand that some people find the notion that we've become an oligarchy -- with all that implies about class relations -- disturbing. But that's the way it is.

HEADLINE: In Corzine Comeback, Big Risks and Steep Fall

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ


HIGHLIGHT: The collapse of MF Global, and the discovery that hundreds of millions of dollars were missing from the firm's customer accounts, have cast a dark cloud over Jon S. Corzine's legacy and reputation. 

 BODY:
When Jon S. Corzine joined MF Global last year it seemed like a strange choice - the firm had none of the glamour, let alone the profits or footprint of Goldman Sachs, the bank he ran during the 1990s.
On Wall Street, it was as if a manager of the New York Yankees was making a comeback in the minor leagues.
Mr. Corzine, 64, who not only presided over Goldman but later served in the United States Senate and then as governor of New Jersey, seemed surprised himself.
"Don't ask me any hard questions," he joked to a visitor who met with him just days after Mr. Corzine took over in March 2010. "I hadn't heard of this company a week ago."
Now, nearly everyone has.
MF Global, a commodities and derivatives brokerage house, collapsed on Monday in the biggest bankruptcy on Wall Street since the failure of Lehman Brothers. The firm imploded after a big investment in European bonds - a bet he directed and defended as not particularly risky as recently as last week - led investors, clients and ratings agencies to lose confidence in the firm.
The fall of MF Global, and the discovery that hundreds of millions of dollars were missing from the firm's customer accounts, have now cast a dark cloud over Mr. Corzine's legacy and reputation. Federal authorities have stepped up an inquiry into why the firm failed to keep its customers' money separate from the company's - a regulatory violation.
MF Global was supposed to be Mr. Corzine's comeback vehicle after New Jersey voters turned him out in 2009. Instead, the collapse of the firm appears to be a humiliating coda to the career of a one-time titan of Wall Street.
His insistence on taking more risks, including buying the debt of European countries like Italy and Spain, along with a contract that would have provided him with an additional $12.1 million if he left the firm, paint a picture of excess.
And Mr. Corzine, with a fortune estimated at half a billion dollars at its peak, did not confine his future ambitions to Wall Street. Even as he was seeking to revive his financial career, Mr. Corzine, a Democrat, had long styled himself as a financial executive moving seamlessly between Washington and Wall Street, in the mold of former Treasury secretaries like Robert E. Rubin or C. Douglas Dillon.
With MF Global's bankruptcy, that goal seems forever out of reach. It has also taken a big toll on a man known for the kind of optimism that comes naturally to experienced traders and political leaders.
Six weeks ago, Mr. Corzine journeyed a few blocks from the firm's Midtown Manhattan office to the Hilton Hotel for a routine presentation to money managers. Mr. Corzine's manner was anything but routine, however.
"He looked like he had just seen a ghost," said one participant. "He looked visibly disturbed."
Mr. Corzine could not be reached for comment.
Friends say this is one more humiliation in a career marked by painful public ousters, whether it was from the executive suite at Goldman or from Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion.
"That's part of the tragedy here," said Robert G. Torricelli, the former Democratic senator from New Jersey whose political career was also cut short. "Jon is very proud and this must be exceedingly difficult. You can lose an election and not take it as personally because it's a reflection on issues and trends. But this is obviously different: all eyes are on him. It's one thing to make financial misjudgments and to pay the price yourself. But it's another when institutions are damaged."
Mr. Corzine's arrival seemed like a coup for MF Global when it hired him as chief executive. MF Global has been a leading player in brokering trades in commodities and derivatives like futures contracts.
But MF Global had the potential to be more than a brokerage firm, Mr. Corzine thought. When he was at Goldman, that firm had bought a commodities trader in 1981, J. Aron & Company, which was encouraged to take more risks and became a huge success.
Mr. Corzine replaced old-line traders and brokers with more aggressive hires from Goldman Sachs, UBS and Soros Fund Management.
In May 2010, in his first investor call as chief executive of MF Global, Mr. Corzine discussed what could go wrong at the brokerage firm as it ratcheted up risk. "It will be mistaken judgments," he said, "that go beyond limits, which I don't intend to allow happen."
Yet despite his confidence in risk management, Mr. Corzine's message to traders was clear: Take more risks. "He was instrumental in pushing our firm forward with risk taking in every book, whether it was U.S. government bonds, currencies, or in repos," said one trader. "Everything was full throttle go."
European sovereign debt looked especially tempting. Instead of the near-zero yields on United States Treasury bonds, short to medium Italian and Spanish bonds were earning 2 to 3 percent. Simply holding those to maturity and collecting the yields would buttress profits as other businesses shrank.
And while most Wall Street firms sharply ratcheted down their use of leverage, MF Global continued to pile on large amounts of debt. On the eve of its collapse, it had about $34 of debt for each $1 of capital it held, according to data from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. By contrast, Goldman Sachs' leverage ratio is $13.50 for every $1.
The combination of potential losses on the European debt and the MF Global's thin capital cushion is what spooked investors, setting off the crisis. MF Global's demise was the eighth largest bankruptcy in the country's history, but with $41 billion in assets it was considerably smaller than Lehman which had assets of $691 billion.
For those who have followed Mr. Corzine's career, however, the problems at MF Global have elicited a strong sense of deja vu.
In 1994, Mr. Corzine ascended to the top of Goldman Sachs despite hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses at the bank's bond unit, which he had overseen. He assumed leadership of Goldman, say his former colleagues, in part because he was one of the few partners who understood how to extricate the bank from its soured trades.
Mr. Corzine, a lifelong trader with a large appetite for risk, recently reflected on his past experiences dealing with crises in William D. Cohan's book "Money and Power, How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World," a recent history of the bank.
"Until you've actually traded and had to deal with one of those come-to-Jesus moments with a bad position," he said, "and you have to make the decisions about whether to eliminate it, hold it, reduce it - those kind of existential moments involving the people you work with and your firm, those are the kinds of things that really get your attention."
Mr. Corzine's worldview had been forged at Goldman, where he spent 24 years. After growing up in a farm town in Illinois, where he was captain of his high school basketball team, Mr. Corzine, armed with an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago, joined Goldman Sachs in 1975 as a bond trader. Bond trading was then low on the totem pole of Goldman. But he gained notice making big bets - and generating big profits - trading government bonds. At the age of 33, he made partner.
As Goldman's senior partner from 1994 to 1999, he led the bank through the Asian financial crisis and the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund. His crowning achievement was Goldman's initial public offering in 1999, though the controversial move led to a power struggle that ultimately cost him his job.
In 1998, he also drew the ire of his Goldman partners for discussing a merger with Mellon Bank without conferring with the firm's management committee, a misstep that also contributed to his being replaced by Henry M. Paulson Jr., who later became secretary of the Treasury under President George W. Bush.
Upon leaving Goldman, Mr. Corzine turned his attention to public service, spending a sizable chunk of his fortune - more than $100 million - to pursue political office.
After being elected to the Senate as a Democrat from New Jersey in 2000, Mr. Corzine distinguished himself in Washington for his financial acumen. But he viewed himself as more of an executive than a legislator, and decided to run for governor in 2005 before completing his term.
Mr. Corzine's one term as governor was marked by difficulties. He complicated his run for governor by divorcing his wife of more than 34 years shortly before announcing his candidacy and was dogged throughout his time in office by complaints that his romantic relationship with a leader of state employees' union left him in an untenable conflict of interest.
His first year in office, he presided over a weeklong government shutdown when the legislature originally balked at his proposal to increase the sales tax. The next year, he was badly injured in a car accident when his speeding state vehicle crashed. Mr. Corzine, a passenger who was not wearing a seat belt, endured months of difficult rehabilitation that aides and critics said drastically affected the rest of his term.
Working at MF Global, Mr. Corzine's life has revolved around Manhattan; he is rarely seen in Hoboken, where he keeps an apartment. Last year he married Sharon Elghanayan, the former wife of K. Thomas Elghanayan, a New York real estate developer.
National politics remained a focus of Mr. Corzine after he joined MF Global. He pitched in to help raise money for President Obama - who had campaigned for Mr. Corzine during his re-election bid for governor.
Mr. Obama's first major re-election fund-raiser in New York was held at the Manhattan home of Mr. Corzine's wife, with tickets going for $35,800 each. And Mr. Corzine was one of the president's most elite bundlers, supporters who tap friends and business associates to bring in checks: He has helped Mr. Obama raise more than $500,000 this year.
When White House officials sought to broker a meeting between disgruntled Wall Street executives and Mr. Obama's new chief of staff this year, they turned to Mr. Corzine, who organized a sit-down at the Four Seasons. Mr. Corzine was on the list. There had even been talk of his being named the next Treasury secretary.
Now, instead of a big job in Washington, Mr. Corzine faces difficult questions about what happened on his watch and whether he should have returned to Wall Street at all.
"He wanted to be back in the game," said one old friend. "He thought he could make it work."

HEADLINE: A Close Look at the Perry Tax Plan

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Perry's proposal for a flat tax leaves many questions unanswered and makes little economic sense, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
In an effort to rejuvenate his flagging campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas announced his support for a flat-rate income tax in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article on Oct. 25.
Mr. Perry said he would establish a single rate of 20 percent on corporate and individual incomes, with individuals receiving a personal exemption of $12,500. The estate and gift tax would be abolished, and there would be no taxation of dividends and capital gains. All deductions, credits and exclusions would be eliminated except for mortgage interest, state and local taxes and charitable contributions.
The flat tax is an idea that has been kicking around Republican circles for 30 years. The publisher Steve Forbes made it the centerpiece of his unsuccessful 1996 and 2000 runs for the G.O.P. nomination. He is now advising Mr. Perry and was glowing in his praise for the governor's plan. Writing in The New York Post, Mr. Forbes said it would "usher in a great economic boom."

Larry Kudlow of CNBC, who has never seen a Republican tax cut he didn't like, was so excited by Mr. Perry's flat tax and Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan that he attributed the recent stock market rise to their influence. In a National Review column on Oct. 21, he said the stock market rally was "discounting a new G.O.P. growth plan that will replace the dreary Obama tax-the-rich mantra."
Although Mr. Perry praised the simplicity of his plan, it would actually complicate the tax computation for many people, because they would have to calculate their taxes two or even three different ways when the alternative minimum tax was also included. That was because Mr. Perry's flat tax would be an optional tax system; those who wanted to stay in the current system could do so.
This is really just a gimmick to allow Mr. Perry to say with a straight face that everyone would get a tax cut. "Taxes will be cut across all income groups," he said. His plan allows Mr. Perry to skirt every difficult issue about the impact of tax reform, like the huge increase in taxes that would be paid by the poor because they would lose all refundable tax credits, including the earned income tax credit.
Keep in mind that refundable credits give many people a negative tax rate. That is, they pay no income taxes but still get a Treasury refund. Going from a negative rate to zero would mean a tax increase for such people, as a Tax Foundation analysis illustrates.
To prevent people from gaming the system, Mr. Perry would insist that all those choosing the flat tax would have to stay in that system permanently. It's not clear if those paying income taxes for the first time would be permitted a choice.
The idea of an alternative flat tax system was originally cooked up by a Wall Street Journal editorial writer, Steve Moore. But at least his idea was that the alternative system would be something like a pure flat tax with no deductions whatsoever. However, Mr. Perry would keep three key deductions in his system, which undermines the whole point of the flat tax, which is to wipe the slate clean. It also makes no sense because those who want to keep the deductions for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and state and local taxes could simply stay in the current system.
One consequence of Mr. Perry's flat-tax deviationism is that his proposed tax form is lengthened to a full page from the original postcard that Mr. Forbes promised. Because the 1040EZ tax form that most people use is also one page, it's hard to see those who care about the length of their tax return flocking to the Perry plan.
Of course, if everyone could simply choose to be taxed less or not, it absolutely guaranteed that Mr. Perry's plan would be a massive revenue loser. In 2007, the Tax Policy Center analyzed a plan similar to Mr. Perry's that had been proposed by Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, who briefly competed for the 2008 Republican nomination. The analysis found that revenues from allowing people to choose would be substantially less than if everyone were forced into the new system.
Giving people a choice also substantially mitigated whatever positive economic effects would be achieved from a flat tax. Its whole point is to change economic behavior by, for example, forcing people to stop investing so much of their savings in owner-occupied housing and investing instead in corporate stock or other forms that will add to the economy's productive capacity.
Because no one is forced to change their behavior under the Perry plan, there is no reason to think that there will be an increase in economic growth if it is implemented. It would just lose revenue and complicate the tax code. That's all. Edward Kleinbard, an University of Southern California law professor, calls the Perry plan "a promise to put a unicorn in every pot."
Mr. Perry has countered with an "analysis" by John Dunham, a former tobacco industry economist, that shows growth will explode under his plan. The analysis states that it was commissioned by the Perry campaign and presumably was not done free. Using "dynamic scoring," the analysis says gross domestic product will be an astonishing $3.5 trillion larger by the year 2020. Implausibly, it says that federal revenues would be $407 billion higher than under the Congressional Budget Office's current projections and will rise even as a percentage of G.D.P.
There is no explanation whatsoever for how these estimates were arrived at, and they appear to have come from some sort of black box. When I asked Professor Kleinbard, who was formerly staff director for Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, what he thought about this, he corrected me. The estimates came from a "black magic box," he said.
As Simon Johnson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently explained on this blog, studies show that perhaps a third of a tax rate cut might be recouped through higher growth, and only if spending is cut enough to keep the deficit from rising.
Governor Perry says he will slash spending to 18 percent of G.D.P. from its current level of 23 percent. No explanation was offered of how this would be done or how such a huge spending cut would ever be enacted by Congress. It should be noted that even if every domestic program other than Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is abolished, that would not be enough for Mr. Perry to reach his goal -- all those programs together come to just 4.2 percent of G.D.P.
Thus, Mr. Perry's plan cannot be taken seriously. I don't think it's meant to be, at least by those of us who don't plan on voting in Republican primaries. It's just a signaling device, telling the Republican faithful that they can trust Mr. Perry on the tax issue.
Whether the plan makes any sense as a matter of policy is irrelevant to its purpose, which is to win him the Republican nomination. With an Oct. 25 ABC News/Washington Post poll showing the flat tax much more popular among Republicans than Mr. Cain's 9-9-9 plan, it might just work.

HEADLINE: Herman Cain and the 'Liberal Media'

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Why is the right wing convinced that the allegations against Herman Cain are baseless, and racist? 

 BODY:
I've always been impressed, well alarmed really, at how quickly the right wing jumps on an issue almost in unison. This week, it was the news that Herman Cain, one of the contenders for the Republican presidential nomination, was accused of sexual harassment when he was running the National Restaurant Association.
I barely had time to read the articles, and try to figure out whether there was any solid information about what exactly happened, when folks like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh had long made up their minds. They were already denouncing what they imagined to be an organized attack by the "liberal media." I didn't see any signs of a left-wing conspiracy, vast or otherwise, but it's true I missed the morning conference call with Barbra Streisand (apologies to Marc Maron, who used to tell that joke on his Air American radio program).
Ms. Coulter and Mr. Limbaugh, and others on the right, also claimed the hubbub was racist. Mr. Limbaugh said the left was smearing Mr. Cain with "the ugliest racial stereotypes" and Ms. Coulter said liberals "are terrified of strong, conservative, black men."
That's ludicrous, unless you think the simple reporting of allegations against an African-American man is an act of racism. This line is especially hard to take since it was the Republicans who perfected the art of injecting racial fears into modern-day politics (remember Willie Horton in 1988?) and have conducted an unrelenting personal attack on President Obama that sometimes has not-so-subtle racial overtones.
By the way, Mr. Cain has been injecting "ugly racial stereotypes" in his campaign for months. Back in August, long before anyone ever heard of the sexual harassment claims, he ran a peculiar campaign ad called "He Carried Yellow Flowers," in which a snaggletoothed black drunk notes that a tough-looking white cowboy is, as the title has it, carrying yellow flowers. The cowboy responds: "Why is it always about color" with you liberals.
The cowboy then goes on to make the usual crack about Mr. Obama's experience as a "community organizer." Somehow I doubt he means the community of 300 million Americans. That sort of thing is not a dog whistle attack. It's audible to anyone. Oh, and, there was Mr. Cain's suggestion in a Times Magazine interview last June that Mr. Obama is not a "real black man."
Just imagine the uproar if a Democratic candidate had been accused of sexual harassment. Would conservative talking heads have immediately accepted the candidate's assertions that the allegations were utterly without merit? Hardly. Certainly Fox News would not have invited the Democrat to a warm-and-fuzzy interview with an anchor who called him by his first name, as Jenna Lee did with "Herman."
The claims are a legitimate news story. And Mr. Cain's responses have been extremely puzzling. First, he refused to comment. Then he flatly denied that he had ever sexually harassed anyone, and said he was unaware of financial settlements between the National Restaurant Association and any accusers. (Remember that he was CEO of the association at the time, and that Mr. Cain has based much of his campaign on being a take-charge kind of businessman). Then he suddenly remembered one of the settlements in some detail.
Mr. Cain's handling of the sexual harassment story is of a piece with the rest of his incoherent campaign. He claimed an economist advised him on his 9-9-9 plan. Turned out it was a bank employee with a degree in accounting. He's bashed Islam and mosques, taken it back, then bashed them again. He can't be bothered to learn the names of foreign leaders who help the United States in the war in Afghanistan.
Mr. Limbaugh says that "what is known as the mainstream media" is after Mr. Cain because it can't abide the idea of a competent black conservative candidate. I guess Mr. Limbaugh would include me in that group. It's true that I think Mr. Cain is "unfit to lead" the United States, as Mr. Limbaugh put it. But that's not because he is African American, or because he's a right-wing politician. It's because he hasn't shown that he's fit to lead. And I'm not singling him out. At this point, I don't think any of the GOP contenders truly have shown that, either.
An earlier version of this post misattributed a joke to Rachel Maddow. It was Marc Maron, not Rachel Maddow, who used to joke about getting his marching orders from Barbra Streisand.

HEADLINE: Coach Inc. Agrees to Occupy Third of Hudson Yards Tower

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: The leather goods maker provides a major step forward for the long-gestating development project on the far West Side. 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Tuesday that Coach Inc. would buy over 600,000 square feet in the first tower of the Hudson Yards site - in a major step forward for the long-gestating development project.
"This deal means that the market has spoken: The Far West Side's economic potential has now become an economic reality," the mayor said in making the announcement, accompanied by city officials and real estate executives.
Coach, the upscale maker of handbags and other leather goods, would occupy the bottom third of a 1.7-million-square-foot tower, to be on 30th Street and 10th Avenue. The tower is part of a proposed 5.5-million-square-foot complex, encompassing a second tower and a seven-story retail space, that would stretch over several blocks, between 30th and 33rd Streets and 10th and 11th Avenues. Construction of the initial tower is expected to begin next year and to be completed by 2015.
Coach's chief executive officer, Lew Frankfort, said the company would relocate its corporate headquarters and 1,500 employees from its current offices along 34th Street to the new building. Although the site will not be a manufacturing center, the staff there will include artisans who make Coach's samples, prototypes and limited edition products.
The tower is part of a proposed 26-acre mixed use project, being developed over former railyards by Related Companies, in partnership with Oxford Properties Group. The master plan for the project includes 6 million square feet of commercial office space, 1 million square feet of retail space, 5,000 apartments in nine residential buildings, a 150-room hotel, a cultural center, and a new public school. The site would be reachable by a new extension of the No. 7 subway line, which is scheduled to be completed by December 2013.
Christine C. Quinn, the speaker of the City Council, praised Coach for the decision to move to Hudson Yards. "Finally, we're going to give you a building as nice as your pocketbooks," she said.
The tower Coach will occupy is adjacent to the northernmost section of the High Line. It will also abut the complex's proposed cultural center, which the architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro are helping to conceptualize. The mayor said he hoped that the cultural center would house art exhibitions, theatrical events, movie premieres and, eventually, Fashion Week, which now takes place at Lincoln Center.
The city also announced that CSX Transportation Inc. has agreed in principle to donate the third and final section of the High Line elevated railbed, which will allow the park to be finished. The new half-mile section, which hugs the West Side Railyards, runs west to 12th Avenue, from 30th Street and 10th Avenue, and then continues north to 34th Street.
In 2005, CSX donated the portion of the High Line south of 30th Street to the city. The new agreement, which is subject to final stipulations, will also preserve a spur that crosses over 10th Avenue at 30th Street.
Last week, the mayor announced that the Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation had donated $20 million to the High Line.

HEADLINE: In Doling Out Economic Incentives, Bloomberg Looks Outside Manhattan

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Under Mayor Bloomberg, the city has given fewer incentive deals to companies in Manhattan than previous mayors. 

 BODY:
Under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, New York City has continued to give tax breaks and other financial incentives to businesses, but he has spread them more widely around the city than his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, according to a study released on Tuesday by the city's Independent Budget Office.
The study, an analysis of all the incentive deals the city made with corporations and nonprofit organizations since 1993, found that Mr. Bloomberg has been less generous to Wall Street and the media industries in Manhattan than either Mr. Giuliani or his predecessor, David N. Dinkins. But it said that the city's Economic Development Corporation did not provide enough information to judge how many jobs those deals created or retained in the city.
The city's public advocate, Bill de Blasio, said job creation was the main measure of how effective the development corporation had been in doling out almost $900 million in incentives. Mr. de Blasio introduced legislation that would require the agency to report the number and cost of jobs created by each project it assists.
"More targeted reporting will help us identify effective projects so we can replicate them and weed out those efforts that fail to create jobs," Mr. de Blasio said. "Without better information, we risk wasting increasingly scarce taxpayer dollars and missing opportunities to put New Yorkers back to work."
Michael Jacobs, an analyst at the Independent Budget Office who prepared the report, said the development corporation often counted all of a company's jobs in the city, not just those created at the site of a project. That practice made it impossible to say how much the city spent to create each job.
What was clear, Mr. Jacobs said, was that "the dollars given out by Bloomberg have been spread around more industries and more parts of the city" than during the Giuliani administration.
Fewer than half of the projects - measured by their total value - have been in Manhattan during Mr. Bloomberg's time in office, compared with almost three-fourths of the total under Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Dinkins, the report found.
And fewer than one-fifth of the economic incentives went to the finance and information industries under the Bloomberg administration, compared with about two-thirds under each of the two previous mayors.
But Bettina Damiani, who scrutinizes the city's corporate incentives at Good Jobs New York, said that much of that shift was attributable to the generous deals the city gave to the owners of the Yankees and the Mets to build stadiums in the Bronx and Queens.
"The stadium stuff was such a blatant misuse of resources and did so little to address the unemployment crisis of the people in the Bronx," Ms. Damiani said, referring to the Yankee Stadium incentives. "Subsidizing projects without a guarantee that it's going to help low-income people is, to me, a problem."
David Lombino, a spokesman for the development corporation, said the agency closely monitors the projects it subsidizes, which would not have been undertaken without the incentives. "Enforcing the terms of our agreements to create jobs is extremely important to us, and we're always looking for ways to improve our processes and increase transparency," Mr. Lombino said.
Ms. Damiani applauded the Bloomberg administration for providing more information about the deals that the development corporation helped out and said it was clear that Mr. Bloomberg had taken a different approach to choosing how and where to provide incentives. But, she added, "The jury is still out on whether different is better."

HEADLINE: Dorothy Rodham, Mother of Hillary Clinton, Dies at 92

BYLINE: BRIAN KNOWLTON


HIGHLIGHT: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had canceled a trip to London and Istanbul to stay in Washington with her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who died on Tuesday morning. 

 BODY:
10:43 a.m. | Updated The family of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put out a statement Tuesday saying that Dorothy Rodham died shortly after midnight in Washington. 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has canceled a trip to London and Istanbul in order to stay in Washington with her mother, Dorothy Rodham, 92, who has fallen ill, the State Department said Tuesday.
No details were provided on the nature or gravity of Mrs. Rodham's illness. Her husband, Hugh Rodham, died in 1993.
Mrs. Clinton was originally scheduled to have left Washington late Monday, to attend a meeting in London on cybersecurity and a conference in Istanbul aimed at shoring up regional support for Afghanistan, a matter made more urgent by a recent series of high-profile attacks in Kabul as plans for a United States troop drawdown proceed. 
Presidents Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan were to meet in Istanbul ahead of the conference. Injecting a note of uncertainty, Iran is among the 14 countries to be represented - a presence not necessarily seen as a helpful by the United States.
A senior Obama administration official said Monday that the countries attending the conference were expected to reaffirm a commitment to Afghan sovereignty and discuss plans to help Kabul assure its own security while developing a sustainable economy.

HEADLINE: Romney and Cain Pass on Iowa G.O.P. Dinner

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: A scheduling conflict means that Mitt Romney and Herman Cain will be in Washington on Saturday instead of in Iowa at an important Republican dinner. 

 BODY:
On the campaign trail, Mitt Romney likes to quote Ronald Reagan, quipping that liberals aren't ignorant - it's just that what they know is wrong.
But when five of his 2012 rivals take the stage Friday night for the Iowa Republican Party's Ronald Reagan Dinner in Des Moines, Mr. Romney will be conspicuously absent. Like Herman Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather's Pizza, Mr. Romney will instead be in Washington, where is he scheduled to address fiscal conservatives at the Americans For Prosperity Foundation's annual summit that afternoon.
Mr. Romney plans to preview his fiscal policy speech Thursday, at a campaign stop in Exeter, N.H.
"I think it's going to be an interesting dynamic because we'll have two of the leading presidential candidates," said Levi Russell, a foundation spokesman. "The two candidates have appeal to a different kind of voter, and their messages are a little different, so it will be interesting to see how the crowd responds to the two of them and what kind of a reaction they have."
During a one-day swing through the western part of Iowa in October, Mr. Romney said that he would "love to win in Iowa."
But his decision to skip the dinner reflects his campaign's arm's-length strategy toward the state. Despite working hard to finish strong in the January caucuses, Mr. Romney has only been to Iowa twice since announcing his candidacy, and he is aiming to keep expectations low so that not placing first - like in 2008, when he finished second - is not seen as a crushing defeat. 
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, Newt Gingrich, Representative Ron Paul of Texas, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Rick Santorum will all speak at the Reagan dinner. 
Mr. Romney, however, is not ceding Iowa to any of his rivals. Mr. Perry has a full day of events in the state on Tuesday, and the Romney campaign sent out a news release Tuesday morning titled, "Rick Perry: Wrong for Iowa."
"At today's events in Iowa, Governor Perry probably won't mention his support for tuition breaks for illegal immigrants at Texas colleges and universities, or the fact that he is promising job creation that would fail to even keep pace with population growth," read an e-mail from Ryan Williams, a Romney spokesman. "Rick Perry has been in office for nearly three decades, and Iowans should know that he will say and do anything to get elected."

HEADLINE: For Trailing Candidates, Encouraging Words in Iowa

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: With two months to go, the race for the Iowa caucuses is still wide open, Governor Branstad said, and front runners can fade. 

 BODY:
PELLA, Iowa -- Mitt Romney wasn't there. Nor was Herman Cain. But for the five Republican presidential candidates who did appear, Terry E. Branstad, the Republican governor of Iowa, offered encouraging words, as they all gathered on Tuesday at a National Association of Manufacturers forum.
The five candidates are trailing in the polls. But with two months to go, the race for the Iowa caucuses is still wide open, Mr. Branstad said, and past campaigns have shown that front-runners can fade.
Mr. Branstad, who is popular with Iowa Republicans, said he wasn't close to endorsing anyone yet. But he said it was "unfortunate" that Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, and Mr. Cain, the business executive, who are leading recent polls in the state, did not attend the forum.
"They missed a great opportunity," Mr. Branstad said. Their campaigns did not respond to a question about why they did not attend.
The candidates who did make it agreed on a lot: Cut regulations. Cut spending. Lower taxes. Repeal "Obamacare." For that matter, get rid of almost any policy connected with President Obama, who they depicted as determined to put people out of work and even drive some industries out of business.
The current government "is maniacally anti-jobs," Newt Gingrich said. "Obama is a left-wing radical who believes in class warfare."
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said the president "is at war against the coal industry."
Rick Santorum struck a conciliatory note with Occupy Wall Street demonstrators -- "they are concerned that middle America is being hollowed out" -- but he said Mr. Obama is "going around the country beating up on businesses."
Ron Paul added his own hope that Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, would quit, and "throw in the towel and say, `I'm very sorry, Keynesian economics' " doesn't work.
(Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for the Obama re-election campaign, said what the Republican candidates really favored was a return "to the policies that led to our challenges, letting Wall Street write its own rules and more tax cuts for large corporations, millionaires and billionaires that shift a greater share of the tax burden onto the middle class.")
Asked about federal benefits for ethanol and wind energy, which are both important in Iowa, most candidates agreed, as Mr. Perry said, that the federal government shouldn't be "in the business of picking winners and losers" in the industry.
Mr. Gingrich, though, said he supported wind energy tax credits, and he later told reporters he also supported helping oil, ethanol and other forms of energy as well.
Mr. Perry highlighted his claim in Texas that a college education should cost no more than $10,000. "It is costing way too much money for a young person to go through college," he said.
He also made a pitch for his recent proposal for an optional flat tax. And Mr. Perry, who has enjoyed close ties with a number of lobbyists in Austin, said, Washington corporate lobbyists are going to hate me as president of the United States."
Mr. Gingrich offered an education-and-employment proposal: "Attach a mandatory training requirement to all unemployment compensation," he told the forum. In 99 weeks of benefits, he said, almost anyone could be trained to do a job.
He also complained about Europeans who, without the know-how and energy to compete fair and square, find ways to "scheme" to beat American industry.
No fan of plaintiffs' lawyers, Mr. Gingrich nevertheless said he would appoint "the toughest, most energetic trial lawyer" as the United States trade representative with instructions to "kick-in doors" every day during negotiations.

HEADLINE: Obama Goes Local in Round of Interviews

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: The president stuck to familiar themes in interviews with local television reporters from nine cities 

 BODY:
With his re-election campaign now in full swing, President Obama has been visiting swing states and attending fund-raisers almost every week. Unfortunately, this week he's obligated to travel to a place with no electoral votes: Cannes, France, for the Group of 20 economic summit.
But that doesn't mean the president can't still show up in the local markets of politically important states. To that end, Mr. Obama spent Tuesday morning giving interviews to local television reporters from nine cities -- Denver; Houston; Minneapolis; Omaha; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Portland, Ore.; Portsmouth, Va.; and Tampa, Fla.
The president struck familiar themes in his interviews with the local stations. Mr. Obama promoted his jobs proposal to FOX 13 of Tampa, and said that even if Congress won't pass it, he's moving ahead to take other steps to address housing concerns. "This past week, we went ahead and said we're going to help families refinance their homes that could save thousands of dollars for homeowners, keep people in their homes that might be worried about making mortgage payments," he said.
Though the sit-downs are designed to allow the president to speak directly to local audiences, without the filter of the national news media, they don't always come off without a hitch. In a round of interviews earlier this year, Mr. Obama had a testy exchange with a reporter from a Dallas station that might have clouded the president's message.

HEADLINE: Occupy Protesters Focus on Iowa Caucuses

BYLINE: GERRY MULLANY


HIGHLIGHT: A warning about protests spreading to the first nominating state for the voting. 

 BODY:
A group called Occupy Iowa is urging like-minded protesters from across the country to descend on the Iowa headquarters of the presidential candidates the week before the caucuses, which will be held Jan. 3.
The group invited Occupiers to Iowa in a series of Twitter posts early Tuesday: "From Oakland to Wall Street, let's hit em hard," said one. 
Organizers said they plan to occupy the headquarters of President Barack Obama as well as those of the Republicans seeking their party's nomination: "No party but the people's party. No platform but the people's platform," another post declared.
"You go inside or if they won't let you in, you shut 'em down. You sit in front of their doors," Frank Cordaro, an organizer and former lawmaker in Des Moines, told the Des Moines Register.
Mr. Cordaro, who said he is an independent voter, said that the group welcomed protesters to hold demonstrations throughout December, until candidates began addressing "the issues affecting everyday people and stop siding with the corporate elites."
As they have across the country, Occupy groups have formed in several Iowa cities, protesting corporate greed and the nation's yawning income disparity.
On Oct. 22, nearly 100 people marched on the Des Moines headquarters of the Obama campaign, protesting what they called his failure to protect Americans hurt by home foreclosures and the rising cost of health and education, the Register reported. Another group of Occupiers amassed outside a meeting of conservatives where several Republican candidates appeared on the same day.
It's unclear how responsive Republicans will be to the Occupy demands, though several candidates have criticized their tactics and anti-corporate message.
And many conservatives and Republicans have mocked the Occupy demonstrators, characterizing them as unemployed slobs or shills for unions, seeking to turn the nation into a giant people's collective.
Matt Strawn, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, characterized the Occupy idea as "a publicity stunt" in an interview with the Register, saying that the volunteers who staff the campaign offices, by contrast, were the nation's true grassroots.
Democrats, meanwhile, have viewed the movement somewhat warily, as some city officials across the country have complained that the protests are disruptive. But they are also hoping that organizers can transform protests into political power and become the progressive equivalent of the Tea Party, which essentially occupied congressional town halls to protest pending health care legislation in the summer of 2009, and then turned voters out in force to drive Republican victories in the midterm elections last November.

Regulators Investigating MF Global for Missing Money | Federal regulators have discovered that hundreds of millions of dollars in customer money has gone missing from MF Global in recent days, prompting an investigation into the brokerage firm, which is run by Jon S. Corzine, a former New Jersey governor and United States senator, several people briefed on the matter said on Monday.
The recognition that money was missing scuttled at an 11th-hour agreement to sell a major part of MF Global to another brokerage firm. MF Global, based in New York, had staked its survival on completing the deal. Instead, it filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday.
Regulators are examining whether MF Global diverted some customer money to support its own trades as the firm teetered on the brink of collapse.

MF Global Bankruptcy Rattles Wall St. Firms | With MF Global filing for bankruptcy on Monday, investors pummeled many financial stocks, fearful that problems were lurking on the books of other Wall Street firms.

Halloween Is Once Again Meredith Whitney's Day | Donning a black hat and cape to compliment a tacked-on tail and ears, Meredith Whitney, one of Wall Street's most prominent research analysts, came to her annual office Halloween costume competition on Monday dressed as Puss in Boots.
The Halloween competition, now in its third year, is one of the oddities on Wall Street. Rounding out your outfit with anything but a Hermes tie or scarf is generally discouraged at most big banks. But Ms. Whitney, who came as Paris Hilton and Sal the Office Accountant in years past, believes the gang at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase might even benefit from a little levity. "It's a bash - and then some," she said.

HEADLINE: Judge Scuttles H&R Block Deal

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: A federal judge has ruled that H&#038;R Block's $287.5 million acquisition of 2SS Holdings, the maker of TaxACT software, would undermine competition. 

 BODY:
H&R Block's $287.5 million acquisition of a rival tax preparation company has been blocked after a federal judge ruled that the deal would undermine competition.
On Monday, Judge Beryl A. Howell of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a permanent injunction to stop H&R Block's bid for 2SS Holdings, the maker of TaxACT software, according to court filings. Judge Howell sided with the Justice Department, which filed in May to block the acquisition.
Judge Howell's decision in the case is still sealed, giving the two companies time to redact confidential business information before it is publicly disclosed. In a two-page filing on Monday, the judge ordered that H&R Block take "any and all necessary steps to prevent" the deal, which was announced last year.
 "We are disappointed with the decision and continue to believe this was in the best interest of consumers," Gene King, an H&R Block spokesman, said in an e-mail statement. "We are taking time to analyze the verdict to determine our immediate next steps."
The merger would have combined H&R Block, the second-largest maker of do-it-yourself tax preparation software, with TaxACT, the third-largest player, according to the Justice Department's filing. The department had argued that combining two leading tax-preparation businesses would stifle competition in the sector.
"By ending the head-to-head competition between TaxACT and H&R Block, American taxpayers would be left with only two major digital do-it-yourself tax preparation providers," the department said in May. "This would lead to higher prices, lower quality and reduced innovation."
The decision comes as the government has moved to thwart AT&T's $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA.
The ruling could be a bad omen for AT&T. The Justice Department filed a federal antitrust lawsuit to block the acquisition of T-Mobile USA on similar grounds. The trial in that case is scheduled for February.

HEADLINE: Soul-Searching at Nomura

BYLINE: By JOHN FOLEY and EDWARD HADAS

 BODY:
Western banks in Japan often complain that Nomura's long-term dominance means they cannot get a look in. It turns out that works both ways. Tough markets have hit Nomura's operations in the United States and Europe harder than most, driving the Japanese investment bank to a $589 million loss in the latest quarter. With far bigger rivals also set on shrinking, it is hard to see how Nomura's global ambitions will survive.
On the face of it, Nomura did no worse than the herd. Fees from the advisory business fell 40 percent compared with the previous quarter. Equity trading fell by the same amount, and fixed income fared slightly better with a 32 percent decline. But Japan, where Nomura rules the roost, flattered the numbers. Strip that the company's performance there, and its revenue fell 62 percent. Deduct the gain on Nomura's own debt, and its overall loss widens to $741 million. 
Nomura has some factors in its favor relative to its bigger peers. The group, led by Kenichi Watanabe, lacks the rogue trading problems of UBS, the domestic retail challenges of Bank of America and the exposure to euro zone periphery debt like French banks. Because of being Japanese, the cost to finance its business is relatively low. Moreover, the domestic stronghold should get stronger as Japan moves on from March's earthquake.
But that is where the optimism ends. Whereas the likes of Credit Suisse and UBS are cutting visible fat, Nomura was already underweight. Consider a back-of-envelope example. The two Swiss banks are cutting 3,500 jobs each to save around $2.5 billion. If Nomura, which hopes to save half as much as the Swiss banks, cut 1,750 jobs, it would equate to 13 percent of its non-Japanese work force.
The soul-searching will be more urgent if tough markets persist. A lightweight investment bank will struggle to draw the best talent, and Nomura is unlikely to get bigger if overall capacity in the industry is crunched. Financially, the case is no more compelling. Even if Nomura had already delivered those $1.2 billion of savings, its annualized return on equity would be just 8 percent. That is not enough to justify hanging on.
Financial Folly
It may just be an unhappy coincidence. Still, there was a common theme to three pieces of bad news from different parts of the financial world on Tuesday. Monuments of financial folly are falling apart, and the debris is hazardous.
Start with Greece. The decision to hold a referendum on the latest bailout plan makes a disorderly sovereign default more likely. How did the country get into this mess? Domestic and euro zone politicians bear much of the blame, but if lenders had not been so willingly blind, the country would not have been able to borrow mountains of debt and Greeks would not have become accustomed to an unaffordable lifestyle. For two decades, though, the accepted financial wisdom was that the euro zone made that a safe bet. Just like United States mortgages before them.
As for investment banking, Credit Suisse is cutting its risk-weighted assets in the fixed-income business, while losses at Nomura may mean it has to reconsider its global expansion. Most investment banks expanded because their managers shared the boom-time belief that financial intermediaries could earn high returns with low risk by trading at the expense of clients. Clients still seem pretty complacent, but now that regulators are imposing more reasonable capital requirements, the approach seems to be coming apart.
Capitalism's third big hit of the day brought private equity into the equation. The sector's principal competitive advantage has always been the tax deductibility of debt. That is effectively a subsidy from taxpayers to speculators. These investors are still taking -- and underestimating -- risks.
One of the risks, illiquidity, just hit the owners of ISS, a Danish services provider. The company has done well during its six years of private ownership, but a public offering was withdrawn this year, and a takeover offer collapsed this week.
The crisis of finance is now well into its fourth year, with no end in sight, and the risks to the real economy are increasing by the day. Financial exuberance, like other sorts of addictive behavior, is fun while it lasts. But it eventually brings far more pain than joy.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Reach an 8-Month High, Helped by Stable Gas Prices

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Consumers took advantage of stable gas prices and bought more trucks and sport utility vehicles, which helped push up the sales of new automobiles in the United States to an eight-month high in October.
Automakers said Tuesday that the annual selling rate for the month was slightly above 13.2 million vehicles, the best performance by the industry since February.
A big contributing factor was a surge in sales of pickup trucks at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. The auto companies also reported strong sales of traditional S.U.V.'s and crossover models. 
Over all, the industry sold about one million vehicles in the month, a 7.5 percent increase from October 2010.
Besides the relative stability of fuel prices, analysts attributed the strength of the truck and S.U.V. market to a need for consumers and corporate fleets to begin replacing older vehicles.
''There are a growing number of consumers for whom a new vehicle is becoming a necessity,'' said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with Edmunds.com, an auto research Web site.
Sales of pickup trucks rose about 9 percent in October over the same month year ago, and S.U.V. sales climbed about 8 percent, according to the Autodata Corporation, a research firm.
About 53 percent of all vehicles sold during October were trucks and S.U.V.'s. Auto executives said part of the demand was seasonal, as consumers bought more rugged products in anticipation of winter driving conditions.
But the across-the-board rise in sales also showed that consumers were becoming less fearful of spikes in gas prices, and in many cases were choosing the utility of trucks and S.U.V.'s over the higher fuel economy provided by small cars.
''Historically, we have seen that consumers change their buying habits for three to four months when fuel prices are up,'' said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with the research firm IHS Automotive. ''There's still an awareness of gas prices, but at the end of the day consumers are proving that small cars aren't for everybody.''
Chrysler reported the biggest gains of the Detroit automakers during the month, with a 27 percent increase over the same period a year ago.
The increase was partly a result of new car models like the Chrysler 200 midsize sedan and the tiny Fiat 500 subcompact. But Chrysler also reported a 21 percent increase in sales of Ram pickups, as well as robust sales for S.U.V.'s ranging from the compact Jeep Compass to the seven-passenger Dodge Durango.
By comparison, sales rose about 6 percent at Ford and 2 percent at G.M. Both companies reported increases in full-size pickup sales, which can be interpreted as a positive sign for the overall economy because those models are frequently purchased by contractors and builders.
Ford also said its S.U.V. sales climbed 38 percent during October from a year ago, led by big increases in purchases of the compact Escape model and the midsize Explorer.
Foreign automakers had mixed results during the month. Volkswagen led with a 40 percent increase, followed by Hyundai with a 23 percent gain and Nissan with an 18 percent improvement. Honda sales were flat, and Toyota said its sales declined nearly 8 percent.
Many Japanese models were in short supply during the summer because of production disruptions related to the earthquake and tsunami in March. Inventory levels have recently improved, and some shoppers who put off purchases are now returning to showrooms, analysts said.
The industry's positive showing could carry over through the end of the year, particularly as consumers continue to replace older-model vehicles.
''The relatively strong selling rate seen in October suggests that the fourth quarter may close stronger than previously expected,'' said Jeff Schuster, head of forecasting at J.D. Power & Associates.
Auto sales have been steadily rising since the spring, despite continued high unemployment and low levels of consumer confidence. Many Americans are now replacing their vehicles.
In 2007, the average age of vehicles nationwide was 9.8 years. But that figure has now climbed to 10.7 years, according to Edmunds.com.
''We're entering a period now where vehicles need to be replaced because they are just getting too old,'' Ms. Lindland said. ''Replacement demand will be a key to ending the year on a strong note.''
The industry continues to be a bright spot in an otherwise uncertain economic picture nationally, analysts said. October was the eighth consecutive month in which auto sales topped one million.
''That's pretty resilient when you consider the onslaught of negative news,'' said Peter Nesvold, an analyst with Jefferies & Company. ''This is not a $500 iPhone. This is a big-ticket, consumer discretionary purchase.''
While G.M.'s overall sales were somewhat below expectations, October turned out to be the best month yet for the Chevrolet Volt, the company's plug-in hybrid electric car. G.M. said it sold 1,100 Volts during the month, compared with its chief competition, the all-electric Nissan Leaf, which had 849 sales.

HEADLINE: Artists File Lawsuits, Seeking Royalties

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
When the taxi baron Robert Scull sold part of his art collection in a 1973 auction that helped inaugurate today's money-soused contemporary-art market, several artists watched the proceedings from a standing-room-only section in the back. There, Robert Rauschenberg saw his 1958 painting ''Thaw,'' originally sold to Scull for $900, bring down the gavel at $85,000. At the end of the Sotheby Parke Bernet sale in New York, Rauschenberg shoved Scull and yelled that he didn't work so hard ''just for you to make that profit.''
The uproar that followed in part inspired the California Resale Royalties Act, requiring anyone reselling a piece of fine art who lives in the state, or who sells the art there for $1,000 or more, to pay the artist 5 percent of the resale price.
That law is now at the center of three class-action suits brought this month by artists who include Chuck Close and Laddie John Dill and the estate of the sculptor Robert Graham. They have filed suit against the auction powerhouses Sotheby's and Christie's and the online auction site eBay for failure to pay royalties. 
''It's a question of basic fairness,'' Mr. Close said recently in an interview. When purchasers are getting extraordinary returns on their investment, he said, a royalty resale law allows the artist to share, at least in a small way, in the increase in value. (Under the California law, no payment is due if the price drops.)
The suits do not specify damages, nor do they list particular sales of art by California residents. Rather, as Eric George, the lawyer who filed them, explained, the complaints seek to force the auction houses to reveal the identities or locations of sellers, information that is often kept secret.
''What's so perverse,'' Mr. George said, is that the houses conceal ''the very information necessary to know whether a royalty is due.''
The California law, which applies to living artists and those who have died in the past 20 years, states that if the seller is not able to locate the artist within 90 days, he or she is required to send the payment to the California Arts Council, a state agency charged with locating the creators.
Sotheby's responded to the suit with a terse statement: ''We believe the claim is meritless, and it will be vigorously defended.'' Christie's said that it ''views the California Resale Royalties Act as subject to serious legal challenges'' and that it ''looks forward to addressing these issues in court.'' The law has so far survived two legal challenges, and experts in art law are divided about whether it might be vulnerable on constitutional grounds.
The larger issue of whether visual artists should receive a cut of future sales remains a subject of vigorous debate. Dozens of countries already have a version of a resale royalties law, generally referred to by the French phrase droit de suite. Starting in 2012, Britain and other members of the European Union will adhere to a uniform standard that applies to both living artists and those who have died within the past 70 years. Indeed, Christie's, on its Web site, informs prospective clients that it collects the royalty mandated in Europe at the time of the sale.
For many visual artists, the issue is clear. ''We need legislation to enact the right to royalties,'' said Frank Stella, the president of the International Council of Creators of Graphic, Plastic and Photographic Arts, ''and we need to align it with what goes on in Britain and the E.U.'' Literature, music, film, computer programming and patents all have better intellectual-property protection than American visual art, Mr. Stella added. The Visual Artists and Galleries Association, a nonprofit group that seeks to protect the intellectual-property rights of artists, also supports a national law.
The idea has never really caught on in the United States, though, and California remains the only state that requires royalties when a painting is resold. In 1986 Senator Edward M. Kennedy was unsuccessful in efforts to include a similar provision in the national Visual Artists Rights Act. A study by the Copyright Office in 1992 concluded that it was ''not persuaded that sufficient economic and copyright policy justification exists to establish droit de suite in the United States.''
In the 34 years that the California law has been in effect, about 400 artists have received a total of $328,000, said Patty Milich, the resale royalty act coordinator at the California Arts Council. That list includes the estates of the Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia (who made drawings), Jean-Michel Basquiat, Albert Hirschfeld and Larry Rivers.
Most artists and galleries either don't know about the law or ignore it, several art lawyers in California said. People often don't realize, for example, that if a California hotel with paintings on the walls changes ownership, or if a donated sculpture sells for more than its original price at a fundraising auction, a royalty may be due.
Sellers, museums and galleries generally dislike the idea, which they view as an added tax that raises the cost of doing business and cuts into profits. They contend that the law's main beneficiaries are artists who need it the least: those, like Mr. Close or Mr. Stella, whose work is famous enough to sell again and again.
Opponents add that resale royalties can hurt new artists selling their work for the first time -- on what is known as the primary market -- by reducing future resale value.
Some artists agree. In 2006, when Britain agreed to adhere to the European Union's policy on resale royalties, David Hockney argued: ''The arrival of this levy will do little or nothing for the vast majority of British artists. It will undoubtedly envelop the market, on which we as artists depend, in red tape, and it will discourage art dealers from buying particularly the work of emerging artists.''
According to one study of the droit de suite in France, approximately 70 percent of the royalty payments went to the estates of a handful of famous 20th-century artists, like Picasso. Still, in California, Ms. Milich said that while it was easier for well-known artists to track resales, ''I have contacted artists with a $2,000 royalty, and they were really happy to get it; one was living on Social Security.''
John Henry Merryman, a law professor at Stanford University and an expert on art and cultural-property law, said that advocates of the droit de suite ignore how the art market operates. The increased price for Rauschenberg's ''Thaw'' at the Scull auction was due not only to the artist's continuing creative efforts, he said, but also to the dealers, collectors, auction houses and critics who took a risk in supporting and buying Rauschenberg's work before he was famous. He noted that the increased price for a single painting simultaneously raises the value of all the artist's work.
Mr. Merryman dismissed the argument that the droit de suite was analogous to music or literary royalties. ''The idea that somehow artists are hurt because they don't have copyright is nonsense,'' he said. Artists retain copyright and must be compensated if their work is reproduced. The difference, he explained, is that ''the realization of a work of art is in exhibition, not in duplication.''
The Whitney Museum of American Art at one time compensated artists for exhibiting their work. Mr. Merryman said the idea never caught on, but that it made more sense.

HEADLINE: A Fateful Stop for Candy For a Helper to So Many

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS; Reporting was contributed by Jenny Anderson, Alain Delaqueriere, Daniel Krieger and Patrick Wall.

 BODY:
There have never been enough causes for Marion Salmon Hedges, but always enough time.
Whether creating havens for battered women, taking meals to the terminally ill, painting park benches, attending her children's school events or caring for her sister who was left incapacitated by a car accident, Ms. Hedges has been a volunteer force in Manhattan, forging extra hours in her day to improve the lives of others.
Now she is fighting for her own. 
On Sunday night, Ms. Hedges was with her 13-year-old son, Dayton, at a Costco store in East Harlem, buying several hundred dollars in Halloween candy, which the family planned to distribute to children from less-privileged neighborhoods who make the annual pilgrimage to their Upper West Side block of brownstones.
Suddenly, she was crushed by a shopping cart, which was dropped from four floors above, the police said, by two boys from a walkway connecting a parking garage to the shopping center that houses the Costco and a Target store.
Ms. Hedges, 47, was unconscious and sedated Tuesday in the intensive care unit at Harlem Hospital Center, according to her husband, Michael Hedges Jr., who rushed back from Madrid, where he works in finance.
''She is the kind of woman,'' Mr. Hedges said, ''who gives her life to her family and the people around her.''
The police said the two suspects, both 12 years old, were charged with felony assault. They appeared at a hearing on Monday in Family Court in Manhattan and are in the custody of the Administration for Children's Services. Because of the boys' age, their names were not released. The police are continuing to investigate with the help of surveillance video.
On Tuesday, friends and family members grappled with the unthinkable: that a woman so selfless, volunteering at organizations as varied as the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center, the New York Junior League and the Brick Presbyterian Church, could now be so helpless.
''She's very effervescent, just high-energy and motivated, and that made everybody feel motivated,'' said Wanda Wooten, the executive director of the Isaacs center. ''I've been in touch with the other board members, and we're all rallying around the family to be supportive.''
In a telephone interview on Tuesday night, Mr. Hedges, 49, spoke of how his wife took in her sister, Fiona, after a car accident 10 years ago left her brain-damaged and unable to live alone. He said that his wife's father just had heart surgery.
The economy, he said, forced him to work abroad to support his family. Now Mr. Hedges is struggling with the possibility that he could have three physically incapacitated people living in his in-laws' house in Manhattan, with his teenage son and daughter, Elizabeth.
Ms. Hedges, who graduated from the Spence School and Barnard College, has always made philanthropy a priority. She joined the Junior League in 1993 and received an award in 2006 as an outstanding volunteer. From 2007 to 2008 she served as a vice president for development, and was recently training new members, said Lisa Hathaway Stella, the president of the New York Junior League.
Fourteen years ago, Ms. Hedges was a co-chairwoman of the Junior League's spring ball, when she went into labor on the day of the event. Hours before giving birth to Elizabeth, she wrote copious notes for the heads of various committees.
Mr. Hedges said he wondered if there had been enough recreation programs available for the two young suspects, that perhaps they would have had a different outlet for playing than the parking garage walkway. ''If there were more of these programs, then perhaps those kids would not have been on the bridge,'' he said.
In her work at the Isaacs center, a full-service community center at the Isaacs housing project on First Avenue between 93rd and 95th Streets, Ms. Hedges had recently become interested in helping to develop a college scholarship program for ''disconnected'' youths, Ms. Wooten said.
In addition to volunteering, Ms. Hedges has worked for the last five years as a broker for Prudential Douglas Elliman, specializing in town house sales, earning a top company honor for her performance in 2010.
''I always said, 'I don't know how you do it all,' '' Ms. Wooten said. ''She'd just laugh, and say, 'Oh, when it's important, you find a way.' ''

HEADLINE: Spurring Growth on Boston's Waterfront

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE

 BODY:
BOSTON -- When Vertex Pharmaceuticals agreed this year to move into an as-yet-unbuilt waterfront office complex, it made history as the city's largest commercial lease at 1.1 million square feet, with a rent of $72.5 million a year. But more important for the city over all, the huge deal has spurred growth and eased the way for financing other projects.
The Fallon Company is developing the $900 million office and laboratory complex for Vertex on Fan Pier, across Fort Point Channel a few blocks from downtown. Vertex, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., also has leased 60,000 square feet in One Marina Park Drive, an office building completed by Fallon a year ago, and has an option on a possible 300,000-square-foot building, also on Fan Pier.
Vertex's plan to fill the complex, now under construction, with some 1,800 highly paid workers may inject new economic vitality into the 1,000-acre waterfront. Since the 1980s, billions have been invested in public infrastructure and planning, and in other scattered commercial developments in the area. 
''The momentum for economic growth has been building for some time,'' said Mary A. Burke, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, ''and Vertex could give it a big push.''
She said more growth could follow once Vertex occupied the two-building complex, much as has been the case with the expanding life science industry in the Kendall Square area of Cambridge, where restaurants, stores, hotels and housing have accompanied new labs and offices. For example, Fallon plans to build a 150-unit luxury high-rise condominium at Fan Pier next fall.
Developers with a financial stake in the waterfront said the Vertex deal would help with leasing retail, office and residential space, and securing financing.
''The Vertex project is an incentive for everyone to get moving,'' said Stephen R. Karp, the chairman and chief executive of New England Development. After 10 years of planning and waiting, Mr. Karp and the Hanover Group last month won a financial commitment from a real estate investment trust and will start construction this spring on a 21-story, 356-unit rental apartment building on Pier 4, adjacent to Fan Pier.
Mr. Karp is considering building a hotel on the parcel, which has permits for one million square feet of mixed-use development, he said. ''Finally, the waterfront is really happening,'' he said.
The Vertex start is a tipping point that makes the waterfront a viable location for commercial development, said John Fowler, the managing director of HFF, a commercial mortgage brokerage that secured $355 million in financing for the life science project, which is a joint venture between Fallon and Mass Mutual Financial Group, a partnership that invested $450 million in equity.
It is also good news for John P. Buza, a managing director of Morgan Stanley, which with Boston Global Investors is developing Seaport Square, a 6.3-million-square foot, 23-block mixed-use project across the street from the Vertex site. The partnership is selling land to WS Development Associates for 1.2 million square feet of retail space and to AvalonBay Communities for some 700 rental apartments, both of which plan to start construction in the spring, he said.
''Vertex shows our retail and multifamily investors that there will be tenants down there,'' Mr. Buza said.
Huge infrastructure projects have made waterfront development more viable. Since the 1990s, about $4 billion in public money went to clean Boston Harbor and $16 billion for the Big Dig, which demolished an elevated highway separating downtown from the waterfront and installed new highways, tunnels, bridges and roads downtown and through the waterfront.
Two years ago, to attract new businesses and younger residents, Mayor Thomas M. Menino branded the waterfront as the Innovation District. Previously, his administration rezoned the area to require a mix of development uses, open space and corridors with clear views of the water. The city has negotiated incentives to attract business. For Vertex, Mr. Menino helped secure $12 million in tax relief and $50 million in infrastructure financing backed by the city and state.
''Seven years ago, we could have developed the area with offices, residential towers and a little retail, but the waterfront is special,'' he said. Now, these development sites call for public green space, access to the waterfront, incubator space for start-ups or affordable housing. ''In the past 18 months, we've attracted 90 new businesses with 2,300 jobs,'' Mr. Menino said.
Some of the new restaurants moved into Liberty Wharf, developed by the Cresset Group, which opened last spring and has been packed since.
''There's terrific buzz and activity at the waterfront,'' said Andrew Hoar, the president of CB Richard Ellis New England, who noted that much of the downtown leasing last quarter was around the harbor. He predicted it would be the fastest-growing downtown submarket in the next three years, drawing tenants from other downtown locations and neighboring communities like Cambridge, Watertown and Somerville.
Even so, it is unlikely that the waterfront will displace Cambridge as the area center for life sciences, said Mats Johansson, the president of Skanska USA Commercial Development, which has started construction on a $70 million lab in East Cambridge without a tenant.
With Harvard and M.I.T. there, Mr. Johansson said, ''Cambridge is a brainpower market with a mix of biotech, finance and academia; sectors that will drive the U.S. economy back on track.''
Biogen Idec, a biotech company that seven months ago moved 700 of its employees to a new 356,000-square-foot campus in suburban Weston, Mass., is now having two buildings developed near Kendall Square; one by Boston Properties, the other by Alexandria Real Estate Equities.
Ground was broken last week on the buildings, which will reunite the 700 business employees with 1,300 research and production workers who stayed in Cambridge.
''We need the close collaboration to make decisions quickly,'' said George A. Scangos, the chief executive of Biogen. ''Vertex moving out will be a ripple for Cambridge, where there's the world's biggest concentration of life science companies, the universities and where big pharma like Novartis, Sanofi Aventis, Merck and Amgen continue to expand.''
Joseph F. Fallon, the chief executive and president of the Fallon Company, who has also developed two hotels and a multifamily building on the waterfront, was able to keep the Vertex deal alive after 2008 when the financing, through Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs, vanished. Then last spring Vertex won Food and Drug Administration approval for a hepatitis C treatment called telaprevir, and expanded its commitment to two buildings from one.
Mr. Fallon said he has a waiting list of 50 buyers for his new condominium project. It has been several years since the last waterfront luxury condominium opened, he said, and he can offer unimpeded water views, on three sides, in a newly vibrant neighborhood.
''When Vertex moves in,'' he said, ''we'll have more buyers.''

HEADLINE: To Survive, Medical Companies in New Jersey Are Building New Hospitals

BYLINE: By RONDA KAYSEN

 BODY:
HOPEWELL, N.J. -- The dazzling new hospital that will open here on Sunday looks more like a five-star resort than a medical center. It may also be the best hope for survival of its corporate parent, Capital Health, a nonprofit company that operates three health care facilities in New Jersey.
The $540 million hospital is set on a pastoral campus with a weeping fieldstone wall fountain, all private rooms, an Italian limestone staircase and amenities like a spa for cancer patients. It will replace Capital Health's Mercer campus, a 19th-century medical center in nearby Trenton that has dingy, crowded waiting rooms and triaged gurneys lining the emergency department hallways.
Hospital administrators say they hope the new facility will better position the company to attract insured patients from the area's wealthy Philadelphia suburbs and lure top physicians with advanced technologies. In the intensive care unit, for example, equipment can attach to columns suspended from the ceiling and move freely around the room. 
Administrators invested in a costly new hospital because they worried that their organization, which today is in sound financial condition, would have eventually been dragged down by the burden of sustaining an aging, outdated building in a community that does not have enough paying patients to support it.
In-patient volume at Mercer has dropped by 30 percent since the company acquired it in a 1997 merger. Hospital administrators attribute the decline to Trenton's own falling population, which is now about 85,000 people.
''It was a matter of survival,'' said Al Maghazehe, the chief executive of Capital Health. ''It was either this or we would have had to close down one of our hospitals. We would have been basically out of luck.''
He expects the new medical center to bring 8,000 more hospital admissions a year, increase emergency department and outpatient visits by 30 percent, and deliver $130 million in additional revenue. The patients who relied on Mercer will most likely turn to one of the two remaining Trenton hospitals.
Central New Jersey is seeing something of a hospital building boom. Less than half an hour to the east in Plainsboro, a $523 million hospital is to open next spring, replacing the University Medical Center at Princeton, which was built in 1919. An hour south in Voorhees, Virtua replaced its 38-year-old hospital with a $463 million facility that opened in May.
''We're playing catch-up,'' said Elizabeth A. Ryan, the president of the New Jersey Hospital Association. ''There's a pent-up need to invest in new physical plants, because we've just not been able to keep up.''
New Jersey has the oldest hospitals in the country, according to the association. In 2005, the average age for a hospital here was 13.4 years, a full 30 percent higher than the national average of 10.2 years, according to a 2008 report by the state.
And there are too many of them. In the last 20 years, 25 hospitals have closed in the state, 11 of them since 2007. In the last four years alone, six hospitals have filed for bankruptcy. (The new hospitals do not add a significant number of beds to the existing stock because they are each taking an old hospital out of commission.)
Because hospital revenue is generally based on the number of patient visits, the new facilities all invested heavily in creature comforts to attract insured patients who have time to shop around. Typical amenities include private rooms, rooftop gardens and comfortable waiting areas.
But all these hospitals are making a risky investment, banking on an increase in patient volume at a time when people are delaying hospital visits, a trend that is expected to continue in the weak economy.
''They are trying to position themselves in a market where you're offering the shiny new store down the street,'' said Farzan Bharucha, a health care specialist with Kurt Salmon, a consulting firm. ''You're offering patients a new experience.''
Virtua, which delivers 5,600 babies a year at Voorhees, invested heavily in its maternity department, building a neonatal intensive care unit with private rooms for newborns and a separate entrance for labor and delivery. The 680,000-square-foot hospital is on a 125-acre campus with features like healing gardens, walking paths and meditation spaces.
''We had a crowded situation at our old Voorhees in labor and delivery and we needed more space,'' said Richard P. Miller, the chief executive of Virtua, a nonprofit company. The new hospital delivered 45 babies in its first two weeks in operation and was full by July, months ahead of schedule.
The arrival of three new hospitals is a coincidence of timing. All have been in the works for years, but their parent corporations were facing a similar choice: invest heavily in new infrastructure in a difficult economic climate or risk failure.
New Jersey's hospitals have an operating margin of just 1.7 percent, ranking 43rd in the country in 2009, well behind the national average of 4.4 percent, according to the American Hospital Association.
The hospitals struggle here because they must keep up with costly technological advances at a time when patients spend less time in hospitals than they used to. Their facilities are aging and regularly need costly improvements, draining limited resources. The ranks of the uninsured are leaving bills unpaid, and in New Jersey Medicaid reimbursements are among the lowest in the country, according to the New Jersey Hospital Association. Ambulatory care facilities compete for paying patients, and the state requires that hospitals provide complete care to all patients. So, if a patient is admitted to a hospital and needs major surgery, the hospital must provide it, regardless of his ability to pay.
''It's a very tough environment and hospitals are fighting to survive by investing in their facilities,'' said Ms. Ryan of the state hospital association.
Princeton HealthCare is moving from a 92-year-old hospital in a residential Princeton neighborhood to a 171-acre campus less than three miles away along Route 1 in Plainsboro. The 630,000-square-foot building will have computers in every treatment and patient room, the latest radiation therapy equipment and 600-square-foot operating suites with technologies like robotics.
''If we had not built this hospital, at some point in the future we would have had to close,'' said Barry Rabner, the chief executive of Princeton HealthCare System, a nonprofit company. ''If we were not able to keep up with changes in technology, people would not have continued to come here.''
Despite Mr. Rabner's concerns about his company's financial health, Princeton HealthCare is currently in good financial shape, with an operating margin of 4.3 percent last year. Capital Health and Virtua also turned a healthy profit last year, with operating margins of 4.4 percent and 5.6 percent respectively.
But all three companies saw their aging facilities as liabilities that could eventually undermine their long-term stability. Unlike their competitors in worse financial shape, they were in a position to attract investors and raise capital.
The federal government underwrote Capital Health's mortgage, which was then sold to investors. Virtua turned to the bond market to finance its project and recouped the $100 million it put up in capital. And Princeton HealthCare drew on its pool of wealthy donors, so far raising $133 million from philanthropy.
''Princeton is unique in that there are a significant number of people with wealth in the area who are very generous,'' Mr. Rabner said. ''I don't know if we would have been as successful if we were somewhere else.''
Location is a prime reason that hospitals like Princeton's and Virtua's have been so successful. Their local clientele tends to be privately insured -- so-called commercial patients -- and the population is growing. By moving just seven miles, Capital Health is now also poised to reach a desirable, privately insured market.
''They're all making plays to reach more commercial patients by building new facilities,'' said Mr. Bharucha of Kurt Salmon. ''But the financials only work if you can grow more volume and specifically more commercial patient volume.''

HEADLINE: For Whistle-Blower in Medicaid Suit, Finding Guidance in Parents and Capra

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS; Jack Begg contributed research.

 BODY:
It has not always been a wonderful life for Dr. Gabriel Ethan Feldman. He has been bankrupt, unemployed and penniless. He has been forced to move back to his mother's house. At this very moment, he lives in a 275-square-foot rent-stabilized studio apartment in a frumpy building on the Upper West Side.
But Dr. Feldman has always had a strong sense of right and wrong, inculcated in him by his father, Irwin, a conservative rabbi; his mother, Bernice, the daughter of a doctor who made $2 house calls; and Frank Capra movies. 
His determination to do the right thing paid off on Monday, when he was awarded $14.7 million from a $70 million settlement in a Medicaid fraud case against New York City. When his mother heard about the award, she said: ''Good. Now I hope you'll get married,'' Dr. Feldman, 50, said Tuesday.
For his part, Dr. Feldman, a squarely built man with black-framed glasses, seemed shell-shocked by his newfound wealth. He had brought the case against the city under the federal whistle-blower law, which usually entitles whistle-blowers to 15 percent to 25 percent of the ill-gotten gains that the government recovers. He got 21 percent.
After taxes and fees to his lawyers, Alan J. Konigsberg and Theresa A. Vitello, he will get to keep about $4.9 million, he said. He was not certain what he would do with the money. Life in New York is expensive, he said. Maybe he will just take care of his widowed mother, a former Hebrew school teacher who lives in Riverdale, he said. ''But as my lawyer said, 'Hey, I'm not turning down the money either,' '' he added.
Dr. Feldman said he planned to stay in his apartment and to keep showing up for his job every day, in a cubicle in an office building on 125th Street in Harlem. The job -- reviewing what kind of care to give to the elderly and disabled for an agency that has a contract with the city -- pays about $105,000 a year.
''Everybody has to decide what they get up for in the morning,'' he said. ''I like this job.''
In his lawsuit, filed in 2009, Dr. Feldman contended that the city was giving people services that squandered taxpayer money. Often, he said Tuesday, people got 24-hour services that included dressing, bathing and feeding, from shifts of workers that cost $150,000 a year, when much the same care could be had from one worker sleeping over for $75,000 a year.
''Movies like 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' made a very big impact on me,'' Dr. Feldman said. ''That's why I came forward.''
He is a longtime do-gooder. As an undergraduate at Brandeis University, he handed out antismoking kits at parties. He attended the Tel Aviv University Sackler School of Medicine.
He began reviewing Medicaid cases in New York in 1990, and first tried to blow the whistle on the city's program in 1993, when he testified before the City Council. But, he said, nobody seemed to care.
Feeling ostracized, he said, he went to work battling tuberculosis for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, then moved to Atlanta, where he became director of colon cancer prevention and education for the American Cancer Society.
In 1998, he opened a kosher barbecue restaurant in Decatur, Ga., called 12 Oaks, after a plantation in ''Gone With the Wind.'' Despite its focus on healthy, noncarcinogenic meat (no charring), it went under, and Dr. Feldman went bankrupt.
In 2006, he returned to his New York City job, and took up the cudgel against Medicaid fraud once again, this time getting the attention of the Justice Department, which joined his case. The city, before agreeing to the settlement, accused him of being, well, Mr. Potter-like with his decisions, denying care to people who, the city thought, needed it.
''It's painful,'' he said. ''It's hurtful to me, because I have a mom.''
In the settlement, the city admitted to procedural mistakes.
As the middle of three sons, he said, he had often been in the shadows. ''I am a Gemini,'' he said, ''painfully shy half the time and painfully aggressive half the time.''
He turned to public health because bedside manners were not his strong suit. ''I think it would be better to have mastered the world of emotional intelligence,'' he said, ''which I'm still working on.''
The $70 million settlement is one of the largest whistle-blower awards the city has paid. In a case against the city and New York State that was settled in 2009, the whistle-blower, a speech therapist, was awarded $10 million.
Dr. Feldman's mother, Bernice Pohl Feldman, said she was proud of her son. ''He is just a wonderful person,'' Mrs. Feldman said. ''My three sons, they are the soul of integrity.''
But she could not resist adding her hopes for her now richer son: ''I hope he can find a Jewish wife who is caring and wonderful and observes Passover. If she observes Passover, then I don't have to ask any other questions.''

HEADLINE: Seeing Social Graces as Waning in the South

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- One August night, two men walked into a popular restaurant attached to this city's fanciest shopping mall. They sat at the bar, ordered drinks and pondered the menu. Two women stood behind them.
A bartender asked if they would mind offering their seats to the ladies. Yes, they would mind. Very much.
Angry words came next, then a federal court date and a claim for more than $3 million in damages.
The men, a former professional basketball player and a lawyer, also happen to be black. The women are white. The men's lawyers argued that the Tavern at Phipps used a policy wrapped in chivalry as a cloak for discriminatory racial practices. 
After a week's worth of testimony in September, a jury decided in favor of the bar.
Certainly, the owners conceded, filling the bar with women offers an economic advantage because it attracts more men. But in the South, they said, giving up a seat to a lady is also part of a culture of civility.
At least, it used to be. The Tavern at Phipps case, and a growing portfolio of examples of personal and political behavior that belies a traditional code of gentility, have scholars of Southern culture and Southerners themselves wondering if civility in the South is dead, or at least wounded.
''Manners are one of many things that are central to a Southerner's identity, but they are not primary anymore. Things have eroded,'' said Charles Reagan Wilson, a professor of history and Southern culture at the University of Mississippi.
To be sure, strict rules regarding courtesy and deference to others have historically been used as a way to enforce a social order in which women and blacks were considered less than full citizens.
In the Jim Crow era, blacks and whites lived with a code of hyper-politeness as a way to smooth the edges of a harsh racial system and, of course, keep it in place, scholars of Southern culture say.
As those issues faded, proper manners remained an important cultural marker that Southerners have worked to maintain. Since the Civil War, any decline in Southern civility has largely been blamed on those damn Yankees.
Newcomers still get much of the blame. In the past decade, the South has seen an unprecedented influx of immigrants from other states and countries. The population in the South grew by 14.3 percent from 2000 to 2010, making it the fastest-growing region in the country.
But there is more behind the social shift, scholars say. Digital communication and globalization have conspired to make many parts of the South less insular. Couple that with a political climate as contentious as anyone can remember and a wave of economic insecurity rolling across the region, and you have a situation where saying ''thank you, ma'am'' isn't good enough anymore.
''There are just so many more complexities,'' Professor Wilson said. ''Manners and a code of civility can't help you negotiate everything.''
Some say the South's great cities seem to be losing civility faster than country communities, where stopping to ask for directions can still end in an invitation to supper.
Too many outsiders trying to escape the pressures of life in bigger cities have migrated to Atlanta and Birmingham, said Saahara Glaude, a media specialist whose clients include some members of the Martin Luther King Jr. family.
As a result, reliable affinities once based on race or religion are gone. ''It used to be that an African-American could trust an African-American down here,'' she said. ''Those days are long gone.''
Dana Mason, who teaches second grade in Birmingham, says manners have been at the lowest level she has seen in her 36 years in the classroom. Parents who move South tell her they don't want their children to learn to say ''yes, sir'' or ''yes, ma'am.'' Too demeaning, they say.
But she and others point out that manners are on the slide everywhere. Mrs. Mason blames a faster pace of life and the demise of the home-cooked family meal.
''You don't need to know all your social graces to sit down at McDonald's and eat a burger and fries,'' she said.
Civility is also waning at that most civil of events, the Southern wedding. How comfortable a bride made guests feel was once the mark of a successful event. Now, weddings are more selfish affairs, said Barbara S. Clark, the owner of An Elegant Affair in Raleigh, N.C., and a graduate of the Emily Post Institute.
''It's more about the bride and groom and what are we going to get out of it,'' she said.
The ability to pour Southern charm over the political process has served many politicians well as they rose to national prominence, among them Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton and, more recently, the presidential hopeful Herman Cain, said Todd Shields, director of the Diane D. Blair Center of Southern Politics and Society at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.
Manners also helped create the South's famous ''bless your heart'' culture -- a powerful way of seeming to be polite without being genuine.
''Manners are often a way of distancing and maintaining space,'' said William Ferris, a University of North Carolina folklorist who edited the Encyclopedia of Southern Culture with Professor Wilson. ''If someone is polite, you better be careful and consider what that politeness veils.''
But it is no longer as effective as it once was, he said. The nation's political discourse has become more aggressive. When played out in the South, it just seems more shocking.
In the South Carolina Statehouse, Gov. Nikki R. Haley has been regularly criticized for not offering long-established lawmakers the deference they have come to expect.
The governor kept 10 state lawmakers whom she perceived as political enemies off the guest list for an end-of-session cookout, and senior legislators have grumbled privately that members of her young staff don't stand up when one of them enters a meeting.
Of course, many believe that busting through a system that has been used to keep power in the hands of a few and limit public debate is not necessarily a bad thing.
''We are not as oblique as we used to be and perhaps that was interpreted as civility,'' said Nathalie Dupree, the Southern cooking expert who last year waged a fanciful campaign against Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, with the slogan ''Cream DeMint.''
''As a whole, we are now more willing to say what we think,'' she said. ''And that is a good thing for the South.''
The country will have a chance to see Southern civility on display next September, when Charlotte, N.C., hosts the Democratic National Convention.
Life in Charlotte is not as pleasant as it once was. Like many other American cities, it has its share of road rage and rudeness. And although crime rates have dropped, in May the city called out its Civil Emergency Unit and arrested 70 people who rioted two hours after the end of a Nascar event.
But in the best of Southern tradition, the city will try to lead with its manners come September.
''It'll be all sweet tea and hush puppies,'' says Michaele Ballard, a writer and lifelong Southerner.
Keepers of Southern civility maintain that manners will always be a defining characteristic of the region.
One of them is Dorothy McLeod, 70, of Augusta, Ga., who has spent decades teaching thousands of children ballroom dance and etiquette through her program, Social Inc.
Mrs. McLeod attributes the slide of civility on the stress of families with two working parents and children who have not been held accountable for their actions.
But she is undaunted.
''I will not give up,'' she said, firm in her belief that Southerners still want to raise children who are kind and well-mannered.
''They must,'' she said, ''or my classes wouldn't be full.''

HEADLINE: Credit Suisse Misses Forecast And Plans 1,500 New Layoffs

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
6:28 p.m. Updated
LONDON - Credit Suisse, the second-largest Swiss bank after UBS, said on Tuesday that its third-quarter profit rose 12 percent, to 683 million Swiss francs, even as the bank announced a further 1,500 job cuts as a result of the weak global economy and continued volatility in the financial markets.
The results missed market expectations. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had predicted a profit of 1.1 billion francs (about $1.3 billion). 
Earnings were bolstered by an accounting gain of 1.3 billion francs on Credit Suisse's own debt, which helped offset falling returns from its investment banking, asset management and private banking operations.
Credit Suisse had already announced plans in July to eliminate 2,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting effort. The new layoffs are expected to contribute to a one-time overall cost savings of 2 billion francs by the end of 2013, the bank said.
''During the third quarter we experienced a challenging environment with a high degree of uncertainty, low levels of client activity across businesses and extreme market volatility,'' Credit Suisse's chief executive, Brady W. Dougan, said in a statement. ''We believe subdued economic growth and the low-interest-rate environment and increased regulation that we are seeing may persist for an extended period.''
Mr. Dougan said the additional job cuts were a result of a reorganization of the bank's operations, including a reduction in its investment banking operations and an expansion of its wealth management business.
The markets reacted negatively to the company's earnings announcement. The bank's share price dropped almost 8 percent, to $26.71, in New York on Tuesday.
Credit Suisse is the latest European bank to report less-than-impressive earnings linked to the Continent's sovereign debt crisis.
Last week, Banco Santander of Spain reported a 13 percent drop in nine-month net profit, and UBS said earnings fell 39 percent in the third quarter from the period a year earlier, weighed down by a trading scandal that cost the bank $2.3 billion.
Other banks have fared slightly better. On Monday, Barclays of Britain said its profit rose 5 percent in the third quarter, helped by lower provisions for bad loans.
And Deutsche Bank of Germany reported a quarterly profit last Tuesday that exceeded analysts' expectations, though it warned of future job reductions in its investment banking unit after a drop in trading revenue.
Credit Suisse's investment banking division is expected to shrink after the bank announced a 50 percent reduction in its risk-weighted fixed-income assets by 2014. The move comes as the division reported a 190 million franc loss in the third quarter. That contrasts with a 394 million franc gain in the period a year earlier.
''The results are disappointing, but almost all the disappointment comes from investment banking,'' analysts at J.P. Morgan Cazenove said in a report issued Tuesday.
The bank also said it had set aside 478 million francs in its private banking operations to offset legal costs related to tax evasion charges in both the United States and Germany. Third-quarter net profit in Credit Suisse's private banking division dropped 78 percent, to 183 million francs, from the period a year earlier.
Mr. Dougan said the bank was focusing on new markets, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, to expand its private banking business. Credit Suisse plans to increase revenue from emerging markets to 25 percent of the bank's total by 2014. That compares with just 15 percent from countries like China, India and Brazil this year.
Like the rest of the European banking sector, Credit Suisse has been hit by volatility in the Continent's financial markets and continuing uncertainty related to the sovereign debt crisis.
The bank's core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of the bank's ability to withstand financial shocks, was 10 percent at the end of September. Banks in the euro zone are being required to raise their ratio to 9 percent to protect against exposure to the debt of countries at risk.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Dismal Tale Of an Arrest For the Tiniest Of Crimes

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com; Twitter: @jimdwyernyt

 BODY:
The arresting officer came by the cell, Samantha Zucker said, to make snide remarks about finding her with a friend in Riverside Park after its 1 a.m. closing.
For instance:
''He was telling me that I needed to get a new boyfriend, that I should get a guy who takes me out to dinner,'' Ms. Zucker said. ''He mocked me for being from Westchester.''
Early in the morning on Oct. 22, a Saturday, Ms. Zucker, 21, and her friend Alex Fischer, also 21, were stopped by the police in Riverside Park and given tickets for trespassing. Mr. Fischer was permitted to leave after he produced his driver's license. But Ms. Zucker, on a visit to New York City with a group of Carnegie Mellon University seniors looking for jobs in design industries, had left her wallet in a hotel two blocks away. 
She was handcuffed. For the next 36 hours, she was moved from a cell in the 26th Precinct station house on West 126th Street to central booking in Lower Manhattan and then -- because one of the officers was ending his shift before Ms. Zucker could be photographed for her court appearance, and you didn't think he was going to take the subway uptown while his partner stayed with her at booking, did you? -- she was brought back to Harlem.
There she waited in a cell until a pair of fresh police officers were rustled up to bring her back downtown for booking, where she spent a second night in custody.
The judge proceeded to dismiss the ticket in less than a minute.
News about the Police Department lately could run under the headline of the daily Dismal Development, starting with a judge declaring Tuesday that an officer was guilty of planting drugs on entirely innocent people and continuing back a few days to gun-smuggling, pepper-spraying and ticket-fixing.
Here, in the pointless arrest of Ms. Zucker, is a crime that is not even on the books: the staggering waste of spirit, the squandering of public resources, the follies disguised as crime-fighting. About 40,000 people a year -- the vast majority of them young black and Latino men -- are fed like widgets onto a conveyor belt of arrest, booking and court, after being told to empty their pockets and thus commit the misdemeanor of ''open display'' of marijuana.
Such arrests are a drain on the human economy.
Ms. Zucker said that throughout her stay in police station cells, other officers were shocked that she had not been given a chance to have a friend fetch her ID. ''The female officers were gossiping that the officer who arrested me had an incredibly short fuse,'' she said.
We are instructed by the mayor that the garish crimes of police gun-running and fake arrests are the work of rogues, not the daily toil of honest police officers. A fair point -- but no more than Ms. Zucker's observations of spiritual corruption.
''While it may have been one out-of-control officer that began the process,'' she said, ''no other officer had the courage to stand up against what they knew was a poor decision.''
After two days of storming design firms around the city with about 80 classmates, Ms. Zucker stopped at the hotel near West 103rd Street where the group was staying so she could drop off the bag she had been schlepping. Then she got Mr. Fischer -- a classmate, not a boyfriend, the leering remark of the police officer to the contrary -- to walk with her a few blocks to the park, at about 3 a.m. They wanted to see the Hudson River, which runs past her hometown of Ardsley, N.Y.
''We're there five minutes when a police car came up and told us we had to leave because the park was closed,'' Mr. Fischer said. ''We said, 'O.K., we didn't know,' and turned around to leave. Almost immediately, a second police car pulls up.''
Its driver said they would get tickets for trespassing and demanded their IDs. Ms. Zucker suggested that someone could bring her papers from the hotel. ''He said it was too late for that, I should have thought of it earlier,'' she said.
Asked about the policy, the Police Department's chief spokesman, Paul J. Browne, said officers can allow a friend or relative to retrieve ID. He did not say if a supervisor approved the arrest of Ms. Zucker, which was attributed in court papers to a Police Officer Durrell of the 26th Precinct.
Twice, she said, the officer told her not to call him by a specific foul term.
''I said, 'Sir, I never used that word.' ''
No doubt he was hearing things: the unspoken truth about his unspeakable actions.

HEADLINE: Voter Rage Has Lawmakers Worried About Job Security: Their Own

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- One of the immutable laws of American politics has been that while voters typically loathe Congress, they tend to tolerate their own lawmaker. Now, with ratings for that institution in the root cellar and approval of individual lawmakers heading there, members of Congress and analysts are beginning to wonder if that law could be repealed next year.
According to a New York Times/CBS News poll in September, only 33 percent of registered voters believe their own member deserves to be re-elected, and a mere 6 percent said the same about most members of Congress, both the lowest figures since The Times started asking this question in the early 1990s. 
Along with the dismal poll ratings, two special elections in New York this year have vividly illustrated what an angry electorate is capable of. In one, a Democrat captured a Republican stronghold; in the other, a Tea Party-leaning Republican won in a traditionally Democratic district.
As those results suggest, most operatives and analysts do not expect the 2012 election to be the kind of mainly partisan wave that flipped control of the House in 2006 and again last year. Instead, they believe that Republicans are more likely than not to hold their majority in the House and mount a strong challenge for control of the Senate, where Democrats now hold a narrow majority. Along the way, many incumbents -- from both parties -- could face difficult campaigns.
Even newcomers swept into office in 2010 on an antigovernment tide worry that they could be just as easily swept out after only a two-year stay since they have become part of the government that much of the public seems to abhor.
''If you're here, you're going be a target,'' said Representative Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, a Republican freshman. ''I think you're going to see a lot of challenges within our own party. I am assuming I will.''
Members of both parties also worry because voter rage for the last few years has been directed more at institutions and power structures than parties. Two grass-roots political movements, the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street, are ostensibly right- and left-leaning respectively, but express ire with both parties.
Voters ''are painting with a pretty broad brush,'' said Representative John Carney of Delaware, a freshman Democrat. ''I think it cuts both ways, and that's why I argue with my members that we have to find a way to work together.''
Republicans, while hopeful that most of the bad outcome will be for President Obama, largely concur. ''I think that there is a palpable dissatisfaction and frustration with all of us,'' said Shelley Moore Capito, a veteran Republican from West Virginia.
The poll numbers for Congress lag far behind those of Mr. Obama, who was at 46 percent approval in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, in October, while only 9 percent of respondents approved of the way Congress was doing its job. Yet there is a big difference between Mr. Obama's ratings and those of Congress: the president, not Congress, tends to dominate the political debate, and the party in charge tends to take the heat.
This is something many House Republicans are clinging to. ''People are really frustrated by the lack of any optimism,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader. But he blames Mr. Obama, saying, ''That's why people's anger continues to grow, because they don't see the leadership on his part.''
Some lawmakers wonder if members of Congress have even single-digit approval from the public. ''I'd like to meet the 6 percent who approve of Congress,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who has often voted in ways that help hold up legislation, because he is seeking deep cuts in spending. ''I just don't know who they are.''
In public forums, polls and interviews, voters have expressed disgust and frustration with the divided Congress in which so little legislative progress is made that the government nearly shut down recently over a disagreement between Republicans and Democrats over how to pay for disaster aid. The nation's stubbornly high unemployment rate has begotten a sense of desperation among voters that seems to stretch far beyond the normal pro forma disgust with Congress.
''This election cycle is somewhat unprecedented because of these historically low approval ratings,'' said Nathan L. Gonzales, an editor at The Rothenberg Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter that rates 77 House races as competitive so far, a relatively low figure compared with 2010. ''But because of redistricting, in the ways that these districts are drawn, it insulates a majority of the body from being thrown out.''
One potential result is unlikely to soothe the public. Consider the prospect that a Democratic gain of a few seats in the House or a Republican takeover of the Senate that leaves them well shy of a 60-vote majority could result in even more entrenched gridlock, not less.
''It is plausible that Republicans lose seats in the House and gain them in the Senate,'' said John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University. ''Republicans would still be able to pass stuff in the House, but it would just be harder. Where they would lose seats would be in moderate districts, which would leave the conservative faction of the House gaining more power. You could get tenuous control of the Senate by Republicans, but maybe not with a 60-vote majority. So those things are just a recipe for even more challenges going forward.''

HEADLINE: Volunteering Rises on the Resume

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
LYNN DOWLING BRUNO had never heard of the Wren's Nest, a nonprofit organization that preserves the home of the writer Joel Chandler Harris. Ms. Bruno, 49, lives in Northern California. Wren's Nest is in Atlanta. But when the opportunity arose to do volunteer work for the nonprofit this year, helping it raise its Internet profile, she jumped at it.
Ms. Bruno had enjoyed Harris's tales of Br'er Rabbit as a child, she said. But she had more practical motives as well.
Ms. Bruno, who works in the specialized field of search marketing, was in a professional rut. She had been laid off from her job managing a $2.5 million search marketing campaign for a health care provider in California. And though she had been in the field since 2003, she had never qualified for a certification that Google offers to search marketers because she did not have enough hands-on experience. Without this credential, she felt, her options were limited. 
She did what anyone would do: she took to the Internet, where she found a new organization called Media Cause, started by a former Google executive to pair search marketers with nonprofit organizations that needed their skills. Ms. Bruno had done lots of volunteering in the past, but almost always for organizations that simply needed a body. ''My kid's school wanted me to laminate and stuff envelopes,'' she said.
Through Media Cause, she was able to do for Wren's Nest what she could not do at her previous job -- run a hands-on campaign with little corporate oversight and near total autonomy. Though she was not paid for her work, which she said took a total of 50 to 60 hours, she was looking for tangible financial benefits.
''I had no problem doing it for free,'' she said. ''I was partly using it as a learning thing. Also I was very aware that I could get a good recommendation if I performed well. So I gave as good an effort as I would if I was getting top dollar.''
Looking back, she views the project as a total success. The museum vastly increased its Web traffic. Ms. Bruno got her certificate, which helped her land three paid consulting jobs.
''I added a whole bunch of people to my network, got a great recommendation from Wren's Nest on LinkedIn and got blogged about on Media Cause,'' she said. ''You can put that on your resume. It absolutely paid off. And it was fun, too.''
Volunteer experience has long been a secondary consideration in people's career portfolios. It was seen as good for the soul, maybe, beneficial to a cause, but not something that led to a better job. Recent graduates might seek unpaid internships to get a leg up, but skilled professionals largely expected to burnish their resumes on the job. Volunteer work got a line at the bottom of a resume, near hobbies.
That has started to change, with more nonprofit organizations trying to take better advantage of skilled volunteers, and more employers saying they look at volunteer work in evaluating job candidates.
In September, LinkedIn, the professional networking site, added a field for members to list their volunteer work in their profiles, after a survey found that 41 percent of employers said they considered volunteer work as important as paid work, and that 20 percent said they had made a hiring decision based on volunteer work.
''It was the most requested field,'' said Krista Canfield, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn. ''People realize that one way to nudge ahead of the competition is through volunteer work. In this economy, you don't have to sit on the couch. Go find a nonprofit that needs help and build a skill set while doing good.''
Volunteering can also lead directly to paid work: in 2009, nonprofits accounted for 9 percent of jobs and 5.4 percent of the gross domestic product, according to the National Center for Charitable Statistics.
This potential payoff for volunteers has not been lost on organizations that rely on them. Catchafire, a New York-based organization that matches volunteers with nonprofits, spells out the professional benefits in its pitch: ''Advance Your Career -- Build your professional experience, expand your network and explore new career paths. A Catchafire project is a great addition to your resume.''
The company, started by a former investment banker, charges membership fees to nonprofits for its services.
Joe Ladd, an advertising account director, turned to Catchafire when he was between jobs this summer. Mr. Ladd, 29, moved to New York in June after nearly 10 years in the advertising business in England. He was not looking to add new skills to his arsenal. But he was entering a new market, and he faced a period of downtime while he waited for his work visa.
Through Catchafire he signed up for short-term projects with four charities, based on his areas of interest: Susan G. Komen for the Cure, a breast cancer charity; and three organizations involved with Africa. Over a two-month period he worked for about an hour a day, as he hunted for a paying job.
Working for nonprofits, where budgets are tight, ''made me look at strategy from a different perspective,'' he said. ''It took the big money and the noise out of the equation.''
More than that, though, the projects helped him on his job interviews in two ways, he said. ''One, when I was in the interview they could see that I haven't been sitting there on the sofa, I've been keeping my ear to the ground working. And two, they saw I could basically be my own advertising agency. It showed a bit of entrepreneurship. It shows them that they don't have to have someone on my shoulder.''
He credited the work with helping him land a job as an account director at McGarryBowen, where he is directing a campaign for Marriott. But he has continued the volunteer work and plans to ask Catchafire for more projects.
''When you do advertising, you think you're just helping big global companies turn a profit,'' he said. ''But here you're meeting people who have a passion for what they do, and that trickles down to you, and makes you feel you're helping make a change. I don't feel bad not getting paid because it's been really exciting work.''
He added, ''It was kind of selfish, but I wasn't doing it for gain.''
Some professions lend themselves particularly well to advancement through volunteer work, said Greg Baldwin, president of the online service VolunteerMatch. People working in technology, marketing, design, communications, event planning and various forms of consultant work can reap concrete career benefits from volunteering, Mr. Baldwin said. But he cautioned against nonprofits' promising too much and involvement by volunteers for purely careerist reasons.
''From what we see, the motivation to volunteer is very seldom to get ahead,'' he said. ''The motivation is the desire to give back, make a meaningful contribution. If people come and they're just looking for the benefits, I think they'll be disappointed and frustrated.''
Kami Griffiths, who runs a nonprofit computer literacy organization called the Community Technology Network in San Francisco, said she relied on skilled volunteers and emphasized the opportunity to build skills as a reason to sign on.
''Maybe they're new to the city or lacking a skill set and can't get that by getting paid for it,'' she said.
But she said this expectation posed a challenge for nonprofits -- how to use a constantly changing work force in a way that makes people feel appreciated, uses their skills and meets their career needs. ''I don't think nonprofits take that seriously enough,'' she said. ''You need to give people an opportunity to give their time and help make a difference. I'd rather stuff envelopes than have some of my skilled volunteers do that.''
One of her volunteers, Hanna Lu, 47, works in tech support at the University of San Francisco School of Law, but she has always been interested in education and technology, in which she recently earned a master's degree. Her work gave her no opportunities to use her skills.
''We have a staff to do that at the school,'' she said. ''But I have a creative side, and want to create lesson plans.''
At the Community Technology Network she devised a lesson plan to train volunteer teachers. Her volunteer work will stand out on her resume, she said, even if she remains in tech support. ''But if I can use this skill in work in the future, that'd be great,'' she said. ''Maybe as a consultant.''
For skilled volunteers, commitments can be very short term: instead of once a week at a soup kitchen, they might sign on for a single project. The Web site Sparked, which calls itself ''the world's first Microvolunteering network,'' seeks commitments of as little as 10 minutes.
For Liz Healy, an accountant who left the business to open a restaurant, taking on volunteer projects was a way to get back into accounting and to figure out what she wanted to do next. She had an idea to sell home products online.
She took on a volunteer project setting up an accounting system for the African Rainforest Conservancy, then had a request from another charity, Humanitarian Notes, to do the same. But she realized that Humanitarian Notes, which was just getting started, needed more: help with grant-writing, assembling a board, fund-raising. She dived in.
The time commitment was still manageable, she said, and ''it's a fantastic learning experience because now I'm seeing the development of an organization in New York from its infancy.''
Ms. Healy, 50, still does not know what career path she wants to pursue, but she knows one thing: ''All contacts are good contacts,'' she said. ''Networking on any level always tends to lead to someone else who may have a contact that leads to someone else. Anyone who supports a fund-raising effort is potentially someone you can approach about another business.''
And if her work does not lead directly to a new career, Ms. Healy said she had benefited in the traditional way of volunteers, by the passion in the organization, which uses music to raise awareness of H.I.V. and AIDS in Africa.
''It's really refreshing in this economy to see someone motivated by something other than dollars and cents,'' she said. ''I've gotten as much as I've given. It's a cliche, but it's a win-win.''

HEADLINE: Olympus Scandal Shows How Little Has Changed in Japan

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer, is a professor at the Michael E. Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
If there were any doubt remaining, the scandal surrounding the Olympus Corporation of Japan has proved Michael Crichton wrong. What does the late Mr. Crichton, the author of ''Jurassic Park'' among other books, have to do with this, you may be asking?
Mr. Crichton was responsible for ''Rising Sun,'' the popular book and movie that appeared in the early 1990s when Japan was today's China, about to dominate the world. In ''Rising Sun,'' Japanese businessmen were portrayed as crafty, willing to do anything to succeed against the bumbling Americans. Japanese were even stealing our women, arranging for them to serve as sushi platters at their decadent parties (you have to see the movie to believe this one) . ''Rising Sun'' and movies like ''Gung Ho,'' which starred Michael Keaton and involved the Japanese takeover of an American auto plant, created a perception that Japanese businesses were going to dominate the world. The Japanese were consensus driven and without the fractious disputes of American capitalism.
Behind this model were the keiretsu, in which Japanese corporations had cross-shareholdings in one another and cooperated to aid one another. Further support came from the Japanese government, which appeared to direct their overall strategies and investments. Against these forces, Mr. Crichton pointed to American doom. 
Flash forward to 2011 and it all seems laughable. The Japanese economy cratered almost immediately after ''Rising Sun'' appeared, and has been in recession for almost two decades.
It is here that Olympus, the camera maker and medical imaging company, and its scandal are relevant. It brings to light the severe failings of Japanese businesses, failures that were papered over by the 1980s boom years.
The Olympus case is disturbing. It appears that Olympus paid $687 million in advisory fees to an unknown group of people for the $1.9 billion purchase of the Gyrus Group of Britain.
Takeover advisory fees are typically around 1 to 2 percent of the transaction value, but this fee was about 36 percent of the entire purchase. Moreover, the money went to a small, little-known brokerage firm named Axes America, which then transferred some of the fee to a newly created Cayman Island company.
Both firms were shut down not long after the payments were made. In three other acquisitions, Olympus paid $773 million for companies that appeared to have little strategic value, and wrote down their value by 76 percent only a year later.
When the newly appointed chief executive of Olympus, Michael C. Woodford, a Briton, demanded an investigation, he was abruptly terminated by a unanimous vote of the Olympus board. Mr. Woodford went public in airing his concerns over these payments. In the wake of this disclosure, Olympus stock has fallen by half before recovering somewhat. United States authorities are investigating.
The Olympus scandal exposes the all-too-cozy nature of Japanese business that was subject to so much praise in the 1980s. Japanese corporations are dominated by insiders, and companies are often run for the benefit of these insiders rather than shareholder interests. Because of the keiretsu and cross-holdings, shareholder pressure and oversight have traditionally been minimal. Hostile takeovers are almost nonexistent, as is shareholder activism.
Though there has been increased government scrutiny of business practices, Japanese regulators have been slow to force changes. Boards were recently required to have at least one independent director or an independent auditor. The result is that Japanese companies have on average about one independent director, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Independence, however, has been loosely defined, and management too often still appoints related parties. There is also a systematic failure of Japanese boards to question management. The Olympus board ostensibly had three independent directors, yet none appeared to question Mr. Woodford's firing.
This operational style - consensus driven, government supported and rife with cronyism - benefited Japan in the years after World War II. Japan was one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The Japanese model worked well in a rising tide as Japanese businesses took advantage of their low-cost base and globalization to reap easy gains against way too comfortable American corporations. Japanese companies were given an able assist by Japanese protectionism, which provided a stable home market.
But Japanese business and its economy have not made the adjustment to the globalized world. The keiretsu have loosened ties during the Japanese recession, but the cronyism has remained. American businesses, under much more capitalistic and shareholder pressure, also adapted and became more competitive.
I would add that we might want to pause and reflect on the value of corporate governance that is too often criticized in the United States as meaningless and burdensome. The active takeover market and corporate governance movement hastened changes in the United States.
There are two important lessons here. First, it remains to be seen if the Olympus case becomes the shock that stirs Japanese business to change. Only last week, Daio Paper, the country's largest maker of tissue products, announced that it would file a criminal complaint against its former chairman, accusing him of illegally siphoning off $140 million, some of it to his own account and some to a Japanese subsidiary of the Las Vegas Sands.
While Daio Paper is taking an active stand, the fact that United States authorities rather than Japanese regulators appear to be taking the lead in investigating the Olympus transactions speaks volumes. Without strong leadership at the top or an inquisitorial prosecutor like an Eliot Spitzer, or a Ferdinand Pecora in the 1930s, meaningful reform is likely to elude Japan.
The men leading Japan do not appear to appreciate the problem. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda told The Financial Times in an interview that ''what worries me is that it will be a problem if people take the events at this one Japanese company and generalize from that to say Japan is a country that [does not follow] the rules of capitalism.''
The second lesson is one of familiarity. Right now, the discourse is about Chinese domination. The Chinese economy is what economists term command and control. The state directs industry and has profited greatly by doing so. In the United States, meanwhile, there is an outcry over a relatively small loan guarantee to Solyndra, the solar company.
China has clearly benefited from its cheap labor and huge investment. But it also has cronyism, state protectionism and hidden debts at the local level. This sounds like Japan in the 1980s.
It may be that the Chinese economy is different and the government will be able to more actively steer its businesses to change. Or it may just eventually become another Japan, stuck with businesses that do not adapt and do not discard cronyism in order to become more open and competitive.
In retrospect, Mr. Crichton's 1980s view failed to grasp an increasingly competitive and global world economy. Mr. Crichton saw the tide coming in but never looked to see what was below the sea line. After all, it appears to be one of those bumbling Western businessmen who opened the window on Olympus's very odd doings.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: California: Price for High-Speed Rail Doubles

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A business plan that was released Tuesday projects that the cost to link the state's major cities by high-speed rail has ballooned to nearly $100 billion over 20 years, accounting for inflation. The plan comes after Gov. Jerry Brown appointed two new members to California's high-speed rail commission and asked them to assess the proposal's viability. They concluded that the project was doable, if built in phases, but that the cost would be more than double the original projection. The report shows the estimated cost at $98.5 billion if the route between San Francisco and Anaheim is completed in 2033. The initial estimate to build the system when voters approved bond financing for it in 2008 was $43 billion. In non-adjusted, 2010 dollars, that amount is now $65.4 billion. The plan calls for retaining the most controversial aspect: starting construction in the Central Valley. Critics want to start in more populated areas of Southern or Northern California in case money runs out before the full system is finished. But $3.5 billion in federal money is contingent upon the Central Valley route, and construction must begin before October 2012.

HEADLINE: Degas Ballerina Among the Works Unsold at Christie's

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Against a backdrop of reeling financial markets and nervous collectors, paintings and sculptures by Degas and Picasso, Matisse and Giacometti went unsold at Christie's on Tuesday night.
It was the start of the big auction season and Christie's Rockefeller Center salesroom was packed with collectors and dealers from around the world who were hoping for the best but expecting little. The poor results were not helped by a sale that was too big with estimates that were too high.
The auction house managed to sell $140.7 million worth of art, but that was way below the sale's $211.9 million to $304.3 million estimate. Of the 82 works on offer, 31 did not sell. 
Early on, the auction's star work, Degas's ''Young Dancer at 14'' -- a bronze ballerina with a muslin tutu and satin hair ribbon that was executed in wax around 1879 to 1881 and cast posthumously -- failed to sell. At least eight such sculptures have been on the market over the past 15 years, and this one (which made $11.5 million at Sotheby's in London 11 years ago) had been for sale privately for the last year. Christie's aggressive marketing did no good; neither did its aggressive $25 million to $35 million estimate. There were no bids.
One of Giacometti's ''Femme de Venise'' sculptures, this one conceived in 1956 and cast a year later, was another casualty. It too had been on the market recently. It was estimated to bring $10 million to $15 million but no one wanted to take it home.
Surrealist art is where taste is right now, and the evening's top seller was Max Ernst's ''The Stolen Mirror,'' painted (or at least completed) in the United States in 1941, shortly after Ernst's escape from Vichy-controlled France. A fantastical fairy tale landscape that was expected to bring $4 million to $6 million, it ended up selling to a telephone bidder identified by Christie's only as a European collector for $16.3 million, a record price for the artist at auction. (Final prices include the buyer's commission to Christie's: 25 percent of the first $50,000; 20 percent of the next $50,000 to $1 million and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
It wasn't the only Surrealist work that brought a respectable price. The Museum of Modern Art was selling ''Les Mains,'' a painting by Delvaux made the same year as ''The Stolen Mirror'' that depicts a bizarre scene inside a building's courtyard, with topless and naked women and men in bowler hats. Another telephone bidder paid $5.8 million for the painting, or $6.5 million with fees. It had been expected to fetch $6 million to $9 million. (Sotheby's also has its share of Surrealist paintings for sale on Wednesday night.)
The Christie's sale also included a group of paintings by Magritte, but only some sold, and not for high prices. Among the best of them was ''Les Vacances de Hegel,'' a 1958 canvas of a glass balancing on an open umbrella, which went for $9 million, or $10.1 million with fees, just at its low $9 million estimate.
Even the magic of Picasso could not tempt collectors. ''Tete de Femme au Chapeau Mauve,'' a 1939 painting of a wide-eyed Dora Maar, the artist's mistress of the time, which had been expected to fetch $12 million to $18 million, failed to sell. So did a portrait of another of the artist's lovers, ''Femme Endormie'' from 1935, depicting a sleeping Marie-Therese Walter. It had been estimated to fetch $12 million to $18 million. But a print, called ''La Femme qui Pleure,'' from 1938, was snapped up by a telephone bidder for $4.7 million or $5.1 million with fees, nearly twice its high $2.5 million estimate.
One rare bright spot in the evening came when Larry Gagosian, the Manhattan dealer, and Sandra Nedvetskaia, a Christie's representative who deals with Russian clients and was bidding on behalf of a client on the telephone, competed for Brancusi's 1917 polished bronze child's head, ''Le Premier Cri.'' The sculpture was expected to bring $8 million to $10 million but went for $14.8 million, to the telephone bidder.
The evening's results came as no surprise to seasoned dealers. ''It was a big sale for the market to digest,'' James Roundell, a London dealer, said. ''The uncertain economy certainly had an effect.''

HEADLINE: A Mobile Oasis In a 'Food Desert'

BYLINE: By JOHN HANC

 BODY:
BY 8:30 on a chilly late October morning, a crowd of almost 200 has formed outside the Germantown Neighborhood Center in Quincy, Mass.
The blocklong line is a mosaic of Germantown, a working-class part of Quincy, about 11 miles south of Boston. The neighborhood takes its name from the German immigrants who arrived here in the 1800s to work in the now-vanished shipyards. But today, elderly Chinese and Russian-speaking women are lined up next to young Caucasian mothers and African-American men. Children scurry about; teenagers stand with hoodies pulled tight. There are people in wheelchairs, and people pushing shopping carts. Two police officers stand by, although the mood of this crowd is not hostile.
These people are hungry.
A few minutes after 8:30, Jimmy Sambataro, a driver for the Greater Boston Food Bank, maneuvers his truck around the corner of Palmer Street and into the center's parking lot. The 26-foot, 10-wheel rig is loaded with nearly 14,000 pounds of produce, juice, chicken, meat and dairy products. Seeing him, the crowd cheers and Mr. Sambataro -- a former United Parcel Service driver -- responds with a friendly toot of his horn. 
Here, in what researchers call a ''food desert,'' the camel has arrived.
Food deserts, communities lacking access to supermarkets or other sources of fresh, healthful food, are typically thought of as being in isolated, rural areas. But as the shock waves of the recession reverberate across society, food deserts have engulfed places like Germantown. The number of children here at or below the poverty level is now four times as great as in Quincy over all.
The community's economic woes are compounded by geography. On a peninsula jutting into Quincy Bay, Germantown is about eight miles from the nearest supermarket. That is a long bus ride for many, and carrying groceries is particularly difficult for older residents or those without cars and with children. To supplement the regular offerings of the local food pantry, the Greater Boston Food Bank began a pilot program in August called the Mobile Pantry.
It is based on a simple idea: If Germantown cannot get to the food, the Mobile Pantry will get the food to Germantown.
''It's definitely a creative solution,'' said Shelly Ver Ploeg, an economist at the United States Agriculture Department who studies food deserts. ''For communities that don't have a supermarket, this might be a way to go.''
The truck -- donated by Citizens Bank -- is loaded at the food bank's headquarters in an industrial section of Boston.
The food, which is bought by the food bank or donated, is unloaded by volunteers and staff members who spring into action as soon as Mr. Sambataro arrives.
Metal tables are unfolded, signs posted, boxes sliced open. It looks in some ways like the finish line of a local marathon, food-laden tables ready to welcome the tired finishers. Indeed, many of those in the crowd that begins to file by at 9 a.m. look as if they have endured a great deal.
The food is free and no proof of need is required. This is the third time in three months the Mobile Pantry has come to Germantown, and Joan Sartori, who lives near the Germantown Neighborhood Center in a housing development for the elderly, has been there each time. ''It's stuff you wouldn't normally buy for yourself,'' says Mrs. Sartori, who said she lived on her monthly Social Security check. She has stood outside several hours for the opportunity to receive a seven-ounce package of lettuce, a bag of pears, sweet potatoes, apples, two containers of cottage cheese, a four-pack of yogurt, a half-gallon of orange juice and a choice of a seven-pound bag of either chicken, red meat or pork.
''It's worth the wait,'' says Mrs. Sartori, who says that what she collected will last her many days. ''I raised five children,'' she says with a wry smile. ''I know how to make food last.''
Others still have children in the house. One recipient, or ''client'' as the food bank would call him, is a middle-aged man with three children. ''I've been out of work for about a year and a half, and my wife's ill,'' said the man, who would identify himself only as Sam. ''This is awesome. It really helps us stretch out the food budget.''
''I think it's wonderful,'' said another elderly client, who gave her name as Florence. ''It's like a farmer's market. But it's sad that America has come to this point.''
According to the 2010 Hunger Study produced by the relief group Feeding America, the number of hungry people in the Greater Boston area grew 23 percent from 2005 through 2009. According to the same study, the number of people fed at pantries and shelters nationwide rose 46 percent, to an estimated 37 million different people annually for the same period. The food bank estimates it feeds as many as 545,000 annually.
Many of the faces in the line for the Mobile Pantry reflect this reality. Some are gaunt and drawn with anxiety, and yet a sense of good cheer pervades the crowd. However hard their lives have become, these people are happy to get this food. However difficult it is to see hunger firsthand, the volunteers and staff members seem happy to provide the food.
''This woke me up,'' says Mr. Sambataro, a married father of three sons who lives in Salem, N.H. ''It made me appreciate what I have. I'm working, I'm helping people, and it's a great feeling.''
Some light exchanges leaven the otherwise serious business of helping to keep people alive. Despite Chinese translations in the signs posted with each offering, an older Asian man with a Nike baseball cap seems uncertain about what is being served on the last table.
''It's chicken,'' says Jan O'Neill, a volunteer from nearby Hull. The man shakes his head, still not understanding. ''Chicken...,'' O'Neill repeats, searching for a way to explain. ''You know....'' she then imitates the clucking of a hen. ''Buck...buck...buck...''
The man laughs heartily. ''Ah, yes, yes! Thank you, thank you!'' he says, accepting the package.
The nearby alternatives for most of these people are a pizzeria, Dunkin' Donuts and a convenience store. For the food bank, it is not a question of just getting food to the desert; it is the quality of food. ''We used to talk about the amount of calories,'' says Catherine D'Amato, the food bank's chief executive. ''Now it's the nutritional value of those calories.''
By 11:30 a.m. the crowd -- and most of the food -- is gone. A total of 571 people have been served. It has been another successful delivery for the program, which Ms. Amato says her organization hopes to expand to several more Boston-area food deserts in the next fiscal year.
''People really need it,'' says an unemployed resident of Germantown named Blake, toting shopping bags full of produce, fresh from the Mobile Pantry. ''I can tell you this,'' he adds with a smile. ''I'm going to enjoy my food.''

HEADLINE: Philanthropist Takes Hands-On Approach to Giving

BYLINE: By HILARY HOWARD

 BODY:
WHEN Leon Levine, the founder of Family Dollar Stores, a chain of neighborhood discount retail stores based outside Charlotte, N.C., was running his company, he took what he called a ''hands-on approach.''
Sometimes that meant shoplifting.
''I would check stores,'' he said in a Southern drawl. ''In one store I bought this 20-gallon trash can for $1, and I just filled it up with stuff and put the top on it. The next day at a meeting, I said, 'Look what I got for a buck!' '' And he dumped the contents out on the conference room table.
Then there was the time he and his brother Sherman stole a cash register after walking into a store and learning that all of the employees were in the stockroom. After stashing it in their car, the brothers came back into the store, all smiles amid panicked employees, and said, ''How y'all doing?''
''They started to discuss putting a 'Wanted: If this man is caught shoplifting, call the police' picture of me up in all the stores,'' recalled Mr. Levine, 74. 
''Those are good lessons that you teach people,'' added his wife, Sandra, 69, in defense of her prankster husband, as they sat side by side in their den one recent fall afternoon. ''You've worked hard for what you're given, and you want to make sure other people are working equally as hard for it.''
Since he retired from Family Dollar in 2003, Leon Levine has transferred his man-on-the-scene approach in business to the foundation that bears his name.
''Leon's gone after philanthropy in much the same way as he did making money,'' said Hugh L. McColl Jr., former chief executive of Bank of America, which is based in Charlotte. ''He sees donations as investments in worthwhile projects, he does a lot of due diligence when looking at potential recipients, and he's diligent about holding their feet to the fire about doing what the money is supposed to do.''
So it came as no surprise when Mr. McColl, after soliciting Mr. Levine to participate in an arts campaign in 2010, was presented with a counteroffer, a quid pro quo. Mr. Levine would make a sizable donation to the arts campaign if Mr. McColl would help raise funds for an antipoverty initiative. ''Typical Leon negotiating tactics,'' Mr. McColl said.
Those tactics have been a boon for Charlotte during a difficult time. The $83 million arts campaign was a success, resulting in the renaming of a prominent new museum and theater complex as the Levine Center for the Arts. And the poverty initiative raised millions during a recession that had rocked the Southeastern banking capital especially hard.
''I don't know anybody who's stepped forward more,'' Mr. McColl said, adding that the Levines had stepped ''into the vacuum created by banks having problems and led the philanthropic community.''
Emily Zimmern, president and chief executive of the Levine Museum of the New South, which provides an interactive history of the South since the Civil War, explained it further. ''I've lived here for almost 30 years, and corporate was always in the lead for most big initiatives in Charlotte,'' she said. ''In the last three years, during the financial meltdown, the Levines and other family foundations have stepped up in a major way.''
''We didn't necessarily plan on the recession of '08,'' Mr. Levine said. He explained that the foundation had been ''gearing up to give'' starting around 2006, regardless of how the local economy would be doing in the future. ''I had more money coming in, and instead of taking it in personally, I put it into the foundation,'' he said. ''We also made a decision around that time that we were going to make bigger grants, things that we wanted to do, so we could enjoy the benefits of seeing the projects grow.''
The Leon Levine Foundation has an endowment of more than $300 million, and has subsidized organizations as diverse as a technical school, a children's hospital and Shalom Park -- a 54-acre campus with a Jewish community center, as well as Jewish schools, temples and cultural organizations -- where Mr. Levine cut his teeth as a local philanthropic leader in the 1980s.
''I continually am surprised by the range of things either named for them, or when I go somewhere I see an unobtrusive little plaque where I've seen they've made a donation,'' said Dr. Derek Raghavan, president of the Levine Cancer Institute, the recipient of the foundation's largest gift, $20 million.
Mr. Levine's emergence as Charlotte's charitable kingpin echoes somewhat his rise as an executive. Both ascents involved a somewhat obsessive work ethic and an ego notably without superficial trappings.
''I opened my first store with $6,000,'' Mr. Levine said. ''For 10 years I didn't come up for air; I had no idea how much money I had.'' When a New York brokerage company approached him about going public in 1970, he said, he was shocked.
Lori Sklut, Mr. Levine's daughter, said ''everything was normal'' growing up. She spoke of summer trips to Myrtle Beach, where the family would rent a house. ''I never really knew he was a wealthy man,'' she said, adding that she did not realize how much he had accomplished until she was away at college. ''Our house in Charlotte was like every other house in the neighborhood.''
The Levine house continues to blend into its south Charlotte neighborhood today and is easily dwarfed by several ostentatious, castlelike homes nearby. Inside, the den is full of bric-a-brac, family photographs and eclectic furniture. It will probably not be featured in Architectural Digest anytime soon. But then, that's not the goal.
So what is?
Richard T. Williams, known as Stick, the president of the Duke Energy Foundation, has an idea. ''He seems to be really touched by the fact that his company was successful by providing access to goods to low-income people,'' he said. ''That seems to have seared something in his mind such that he wants to be constantly giving back -- giving back to those people who bought his goods.''
Examples of giving back to Family Dollar's customer base abound. Take the Levines' core involvement in Project L.I.F.T., a $55 million, five-year educational initiative. The project aims to improve the alarming 54 percent graduation rate of West Charlotte High School, along with closing the achievement gap present in its feeder schools.
''It seems like every time Charlotte needs a pick-me-up, the Levines are there,'' said Anthony Foxx, the mayor of Charlotte and a 1989 graduate of West Charlotte High.
The foundation also came to the rescue of the local United Way after controversy over its former director's compensation drove donors away. By 2009, beneficiary agencies like a women's shelter had experienced a 35 percent decline in aid. ''It was the worst kind of storm,'' said Jane McIntyre, who had recently arrived as the organization's executive director.
The Levines proposed a $1 million challenge grant and pledged an additional $100,000 to start the campaign. ''It was a real testimonial and support that we badly needed,'' Ms. McIntyre said, describing the couple as ''knights in shining armor.'' Their challenge inspired Bank of America to donate $500,000 toward the end of the campaign. This put the match over the top.
The United Way campaign emphasizes how passionate the Levines are about rallying others around a cause. Many of their gifts are challenge grants for a reason. ''We want to get people off the sidelines,'' Mr. Levine explained.
Ms. Levine added: ''There are a lot of people who have the ability to do something, but they've never, for whatever reason, been encouraged to do so. So if you can show them how much of a difference they can make regardless of what amount of money is involved, if they do it just one time, they tend to continue.''
The Levines are also doing their part to cultivate a new generation of givers. Two years ago they introduced a merit-based scholarship program at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, modeled after the prestigious Morehead-Cain scholarship at the Chapel Hill campus. The program offers students full tuition in addition to subsidized travel and internships. ''But we put a little extra spice in ours,'' Mr. Levine said.
The Levine scholars, as they are known, serve as interns at nonprofits for one summer, and are also given seed money of $8,000 to start their own charitable projects. ''So the exciting thing,'' explained Ms. Levine, particularly bright-eyed at this prospect, ''is that by the time they graduate, we will have the potential of keeping them in Charlotte. That could be a bonus for the entire community.''
A bonus for the Levines is that they truly enjoy what they do. ''For us, we're able, before we die, to do things we get pleasure out of and to see the results,'' Ms. Levine said.
Being recognized and thanked is appreciated, too. Ms. Levine was recently having lunch at a local restaurant, and when she went to pay her bill, she found out someone had already taken care of it. When she asked the restaurant manager for the person's information so she could write a thank-you note, she was told that the bill had been paid anonymously, and in cash.
Mr. Levine sometimes gets the best of both worlds when it comes to gratitude. ''I've had a lot of people come up to me and tell me how much they've appreciated my help -- 'and I shop your store!' ''

HEADLINE: The World of Hunger Has a New Language

BYLINE: By JOHN HANC

 BODY:
THE terms food desert and food insecurity are part of the new language of hunger.
The former refers to a low-income area in which a significant number of residents lack access to supermarkets or other sources of healthful food. 
According to federal Agriculture Department studies, about 10 percent of the 65,000 census tracts in the United States qualify as food deserts. Shelly Ver Ploeg, an economist who studies food deserts for the department, says she is not a fan of the term.
'' 'Desert' conjures up images of rural areas,'' she says, noting that many food deserts are in poor urban areas. As is the case with places like the Germantown section of Quincy, Mass., they are starting to appear in suburban areas hit by the recession, as well.
Although long used in the parlance of international aid, food insecurity is an even slipperier concept. Some define the food insecure as people who do not meet the requirements for government assistance, but are still not able to adequately feed their families.
Mark Nord, who studies food insecurity for the Agriculture Department, uses a slightly different definition, suggesting that it is a more fluid condition.
''Food-insecure households are not able to put adequate food on the table at various times during the year,'' he says.
''For most households, it's not chronic, although it's also not just one episode, either.'' JOHN HANC

PATRICK MARTINS summed it up in a single slab: pork belly. ''That's the cut that people ask for the most,'' he said. ''Evidently they can't find it in their supermarkets.''
No, they cannot. And that is just one reason why Mr. Martins opened a real butcher shop on the Lower East Side last month.
He's not the only one. Butcher shops, once a vestige, are opening in many New York neighborhoods where buying meat has often been reduced to staring down a sea of plastic-wrapped foam trays. These new stores offer much more. To make the most of them, though, a basic understanding of the butcher's craft is essential.
Buying some pork or most other meats is not as simple or as cheap as picking out an apple. Do not tweet your friends for advice; consult the butcher. 
''Here, you can have a conversation with a human being, and I can tell you that every transaction is different,'' said Brent Young, one of the butchers at the Meat Hook in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. This no-frills workroom in the shadowy rumble of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway goes a long way to dispel the notion that a dedicated butcher shop is an elitist venue for those times you want a prime T-bone to impress the in-laws.
How you plan to cook the meat determines the cut. And the quantity for a serving will be based how it will be trimmed, and what else you are serving. If the meat you think you want is not available or too expensive, the butcher can offer alternatives.
''We can offer cuts you never see in a supermarket,'' Mr. Young said. ''Cheap cuts. Customers on a budget come in asking for ideas, they want other options.'' To make the most of the animals, the Meat Hook's butchers went to France for two weeks last spring to learn how butchering is done there, and discovered little portions of succulence that could be ferreted out of parts of a steer, like the merlot steak and the oyster steak. (Remember that it was the French who popularized the hanger steak, which now is sometimes sold in better supermarkets.)
For those whose appetites stray beyond steak, a culinary adventure in the way of oxtails, marrow bones, kidneys, pig's ears and trotters starts with the butcher, usually after a phone call in advance. You also need a butcher for some less exotic items like brisket that is fattier and juicier than the more easily found lean first cut.
''Our restaurant features nose-to-tail dining so we break down whole animals,'' said Christian Pappanicholas, an owner of Cannibal, the new butcher attached to Resto, a meat-centric restaurant in Murray Hill, in Manhattan. ''And if a customer wants to buy certain cuts they've had here to cook at home, like lamb neck, we can sell it.''
It's a major turnaround in the way meat has been bought and sold. Some 40 or so years ago, beef was shipped to New York's meatpacking district in the form of whole carcasses, or ''rail beef.'' Then the big Midwestern packing houses started shipping what was called ''boxed beef,'' primal cuts packed in Cryovac. Now, butchers like those at Cannibal are carving whole animals again, and not just for beef.
Joshua and Jessica Applestone founded Fleisher's in Kingston, N.Y., and even taught butchering to chefs and customers. They just opened a branch in Park Slope, Brooklyn, for their growing roster of New York City customers.
There are others: Dickson's Farmstand Meats, previously available only online, with a shop in the Chelsea Market; Marlow & Daughters, a spin-off of the Marlow & Sons restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; Tiberio Custom Meats, which has a shop at Sauce, a new restaurant on the Lower East Side, and plans to open in Brooklyn; and Japan Premium Beef on Bond Street in NoHo, specializing in ultra-tender wagyu, cut for Asian recipes.
This phenomenon is not limited to New York City. In other cities, butchers are also opening, including Barbara Lynch's Butcher Shop in Boston, the Local Butcher Shop in Berkeley, Calif., Smoking Goose Meatery in Indianapolis, and Chop Butchery and Charcuterie in Portland, Ore.
DeBragga, once strictly a wholesaler in the meatpacking district, now has a retail store online as well as a new service feature, a telephone hot line for customers so they can discuss the meat before they click the mouse. There are also butchers at some Greenmarkets now, selling meat and poultry from farms in the region.
And it's not just for the fresh pork belly, suddenly in demand thanks to cookbooks, chefs and television. It is also for other cuts of meat like crown roasts of lamb, whole veal shanks, pork cheeks, cross-rib roasts, lamb riblets, beef ribs for the barbecue, sweetbreads, lamb tongues, pork livers and even goat or rabbit that tempt home cooks but are too specialized or unusual for supermarkets.
There's a fresh-meat counter at Eataly, where an order for a whole boned pig for porchetta or a proper Florentine tagliata steak is not an impossible request.
At his new Heritage Meat Shop, Mr. Martins can sell pork belly because his company, Heritage Foods USA, buys whole animals and uses everything. ''We're about nose-to-tail,'' he said. ''We buy 200 pigs each week and we sell a lot of it to chefs, but there are cuts they don't particularly buy so we have to make the most of them. Smoked porterhouse pork chops is one of them.'' Cue the choucroute recipe.
Heritage Meat Shop is one of several latter-day butchers that seek out breeds of cattle or hogs other than those favored by industrial meat packers. Berkshire pork, for instance, has more fat but more flavor, and the butcher will also have fatback to sell you to line a rich terrine, or skin to fry for cracklings to whet appetites with the margaritas.
These days, veal that is rosy, not ivory, because it comes from pastured animals and not young calves chained in a box is increasingly appreciated. The DeBragga Web site describes where and how the veal was raised.
''We've just started selling veal,'' said Jake Dickson of Dickson's Farmstand Meats. ''Ethics and quality were the issues. Our veal is more like young beef than old-fashioned veal.''
Once you accept humanely raised veal, it's time to consider a number of options that have been largely off some tables for many years. If a solid veal rump roast is going to break the budget, consider a plump, well-trimmed veal neck roast. Or a handsome whole veal shank, a succulent joint of meat that's usually sliced up for osso buco but makes for a presentation worthy of Henry VIII. Try veal ''oxtails'' or brisket, which are more tender and cook faster than beef.
Or use the breast, and make sure you ask the butcher to bone it for you. Some new customers who have never bought meat where that kind of service is included in the (typically higher) price can discover other benefits. They can arrange to bring in their own herbed bread crumb and garlic mixture, and the butcher will stuff, roll and tie the roast. How many home cooks can handle a length of butcher's string as deftly, quickly and neatly as the person behind the meat counter?
Getting to know a bona-fide butcher at a bigger food market like Eataly or Fairway may wind up saving you money. Not only can you explore cheaper but worthwhile cuts, you will get just the amount of meat you need, trimmed just so, instead of settling for some packaged quantity with the attractive pieces layered on top.
Even at Lobel's, a carriage trade butcher that has been on Madison Avenue on the Upper East Side for 60 years, customer tastes are changing. ''With the struggling economy, people want different options,'' said Evan Lobel, the fifth-generation butcher who now runs the company. ''They want more braising cuts like lamb breast, veal breast and lamb riblets.''
A butcher like Lobel's, which prides itself on customer service, will ask how you want your short ribs. There are several options: in chunks across the bone as for flanken, or with longer bones, English-style, which are also good for Texas barbecue and some Korean recipes.
Boning short ribs for stew is a tricky job that you can leave to the butcher, who would also be able to slice some beef for Korean bulgogi, paper-thin. For the Argentine stuffed steak, matambre, you need a pocket cut in a whole flank steak. Will your knives and skills take you that far?
When you deal with a butcher, asking for center cut, a particular thickness in something as simple as filet mignon, the amount of fat on a steak, lamb chops to be Frenched and taking home the trimmings to use in some recipe is routine. And unless you happen to own a bandsaw, so is slicing off the chine bone, part of the backbone that's attached to the ribs.
Perhaps you would like some of the silver skin peeled off that leg of lamb or whole filet or beef, or your rib roast or rack of veal boned but tied back onto the bones for flavor. A butcher will comply but also advise if you are in doubt. Take in your recipe and go over it with the butcher -- just not at 5 p.m. on a Friday when there's a line out the door.
While the best way to buy fish is to see what looks good in the market that day, it pays to call the butcher at least a day ahead to find out whether a particular cut is available, to ask what else might be suitable and perhaps to place an order.
''We're finding that one of the things we have to do is retrain the customer on how to shop,'' Mr. Fox said. Merely setting foot in a store like Fleisher's as you provision for dinner is a first step.
Recipe: Grilled Pork Belly With Soy-Mirin Glaze
Adapted from ''Seoultown Kitchen'' by Debbie Lee (Kyle Books, 2011)
Time: 11/2 hours, plus marinating
1 pound skinless pork belly
1 cup soy sauce
1 cup mirin
Sea salt and white pepper
1 cup beef stock
2 dried shiitake mushrooms
1/4 cup honey
3 tablespoons Asian sesame oil
1 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in 2 tablespoons cold water
Vegetable oil for coating grill or pan
1 small kabocha squash, seeded, in 1/2-inch thick slices with skin
2 tablespoons chopped scallions
2 tablespoons roasted, salted sesame seeds.
1. Cut pork belly into pieces about 3-inches square. Thinly slice each piece into squares no more than 1/4-inch thick. (Partly freezing the pork belly will make it easier to slice.)
2. Combine soy sauce, mirin, salt and pepper to taste in a bowl. Place pork in the bowl, cover and refrigerate 30 minutes but preferably overnight.
3. In a small saucepan, bring stock to a simmer. Add mushrooms, turn off heat and steep 30 minutes. Strain out mushrooms, and save for other use. Add honey and 1 tablespoon sesame oil to the stock. Simmer 10 to 15 minutes, until reduced by half. Whisk in cornstarch mixture and cook a few minutes longer, until thickened. Remove from heat, transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
4. Remove pork from refrigerator. Heat a grill or grill pan and brush with vegetable oil. Place pork slices on grill and cook, turning every 4 minutes or so, until well seared and caramelized at the edges, about 20 minutes' total cooking time. Add remaining sesame oil to the marinade, add the squash, set aside 5 minutes, then place on the grill, turning, until cooked through, about 15 minutes.
5. Arrange pork and squash on a platter. Heat glaze and brush on pork and squash. Sprinkle with scallions and sesame seeds and serve.
Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
Recipe: Veal Shank With Shallots and Chanterelles
Time: About 3 hours
1 whole veal shank, 4 to 4 1/2 pounds
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 pound large shallots, about 12, peeled
3 tablespoons flour
4 large cloves garlic, sliced
12 ounces fresh chanterelles, or other mushrooms, trimmed
1 1/2 cups cider, sweet or hard
1/2 cup veal or beef stock
6 sprigs fresh thyme
1 tablespoon lemon juice
Salt and ground black pepper.
1. Peel at least one layer of membrane from the veal shank. Heat butter in an ovenproof casserole or Dutch oven large enough to hold the veal. Add shallots and brown over medium-high heat. Remove and reserve. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Dust veal with flour and add to casserole. Lightly brown on all sides. Add garlic, mushrooms, cider, stock and thyme. Bring to a simmer, cover and place in oven for 1 hour.
2. Turn veal, add shallots and continue cooking, covered, until veal is tender, another hour or so. Transfer veal to a deep serving platter. Put casserole on the stove over medium heat and add lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Spoon shallots, mushrooms and sauce around meat. Carve veal, slicing more or less parallel to the bone, and serve with sauce and vegetables.
Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
Recipe: Lamb Necks Braised in Wine With Peppers
Time: 3 hours, plus marinating
2 lamb necks, about 4 1/2 pounds, each in 4 slices
2 1/2 cups dry red wine
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
4 tablespoons red wine vinegar
3 sprigs fresh rosemary
4 cloves garlic, smashed
Salt and black pepper
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper (hot paprika can be substituted)
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
2 red bell peppers, cored, seeded, in 1/2-inch slices
2 green bell peppers, cored, seeded, in 1/2-inch slices
1 teaspoon honey
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves.
1. Place lamb in a heavy sealable plastic bag. Combine wine, 1 tablespoon oil, 2 tablespoons vinegar, rosemary, garlic and salt and pepper to taste in a bowl and add to bag. Seal and refrigerate 3 to 4 hours. (Lamb can be marinated in a bowl, but more wine might be needed.) Remove lamb from marinade. Strain marinade, separately reserving the garlic and rosemary, and the marinade.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a heavy casserole large enough to hold lamb. Add onion, saute on low until softened, and stir in Aleppo pepper, cumin and cinnamon. Add garlic and rosemary leaves (no stems) from the marinade. Add 1 1/2 cups of the marinade and boil down until nearly evaporated.
3. Heat oven to 300 degrees. Place lamb in casserole. Add remaining marinade. Cover and cook 2 hours, until tender. Meanwhile, heat remaining oil in a skillet. Add pepper strips and cook, stirring, on high heat until soft and lightly seared. Lower heat, stir in remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar and the honey. Season with salt and pepper, remove from heat and set aside.
4. When lamb is tender, transfer it to a serving platter. Heat sauce on top of stove, stir in tomato paste and season as needed with salt and pepper. Spoon around meat, scatter pepper strips on top and scatter on parsley.
Yield: 4 servings.

HEADLINE: Dance Devotee Stays in Motion

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
GIVEN that she is 77 years old and has been on the board of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater for 17 years, 11 as chairwoman, Joan H. Weill clearly does not need to serve any longer. She could simply be enjoying time with her husband, Sanford I. Weill, who recently retired as the head of Citigroup. They could be relaxing at their home in California's wine country or spending more time with their four grandchildren.
But Ms. Weill still has goals to accomplish, including providing housing for Ailey students, given how hard it is for dancers to afford to live in New York. And she is eager to see what Ailey's new artistic director, Robert Battle, who succeeded Judith Jamison in June, will bring as he begins his first season this month.
In turn, the dance company cannot imagine Ailey without Ms. Weill. ''When Joan does something, it's with every fiber of her being,'' said Sharon Gersten Luckman, the executive director of the Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation, the company's umbrella organization. ''So if she left, it would feel like we'd lose our balance. She's that connected. She's that integral to what we do.'' 
Ms. Weill has been crucial to keeping the organization on stable financial footing throughout her tenure, despite challenging economic times. She has contributed large sums of her own money and raised large sums from her friends. She donated $18.4 million toward Ailey's $54 million new home on West 55th Street at Ninth Avenue, called the Joan Weill Center for Dance, which opened in 2005 and is thought to be the largest dance complex in New York City.
She has turned Ailey's annual gala from a relatively modest affair into a sprawling celebration at Hilton New York's Grand Ballroom, where people dance until the wee hours. Last year it raised $2.7 million while honoring Ms. Weill for her decade of service as board chairwoman.
In the three years after Ms. Weill became a co-chairwoman of the gala in 1996, the event tripled in size and revenue. This season's gala, on Nov. 30, features Michelle Obama and the model Iman as honorary chairwomen.
Ms. Weill has gone around the world with the dance company, helping to organize tours to Beijing, Shanghai and St. Petersburg, Russia. She has also made many visits to Ailey camps for disadvantaged preadolescents.
She and her husband were the lead supporters of Ailey's 2008 endowment campaign -- which raised $50 million as part of the 50th anniversary celebration -- and received the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Award in 2009.
And she has become friends with the people who work at Ailey, entertaining the dancers in her home, making sure she knows everyone by name. ''Joan has become over the years a real confidante,'' said Ms. Jamison, now chairwoman emeritus.
Ms. Weill has grown evangelical about Ailey. She gives tickets to her hairdressers and housekeepers as holiday presents. She invites friends to performances and persuades them to buy tables at the Ailey gala.
''A lot of people, including my husband, had no idea what this was about, so you have to take them,'' she said. ''A lot of my friends, frankly, I literally dragged here, especially the guys. And now they all come back.''
Ms. Weill was first exposed to Ailey as a teenager, when her family moved from California to New York City and lived at the Wellington Hotel near City Center on West 55th Street, where the company has long performed.
Years later, friends invited Ms. Weill and her husband -- the longtime chairman of Carnegie Hall -- to see Ailey in Harlem. Ms. Weill was smitten with the dancers and with Ms. Jamison: ''She was such a role model and such a presence.''
Before joining Ailey's board, Ms. Weill served on the board of Women in Need, a charity for homeless women and their families. ''My husband used to kid me that he took care of culture and I took care of the streets,'' she said. ''I realized that Ailey brought them together.''
''Mr. Ailey always said the dance comes from the people, and therefore it should be brought back to the people.''
Ms. Weill joined the board in 1994 and became chairwoman six years later. She and her husband have become Ailey's biggest financial supporters, though Ms. Weill declined to be specific about their total contributions.
''She has a lot,'' Mr. Battle said of Ms. Weill, ''but she does a lot and she gives a lot.''
Ailey is not Ms. Weill's only cause. She is co-chairwoman of the advisory committee of the Weill Music Institute at Carnegie Hall; chairwoman emeritus of Paul Smith's College, The College of the Adirondacks; and co-chairwoman of the NewYork Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center's Women's Health Symposium. But Ms. Weill said Ailey was her ''No. 1'' priority.
Her husband said so, too. ''She doesn't fake it; this is real,'' he said. ''She's there all the time.''
While Ms. Weill devotes a good part of every week to Ailey matters, she said she also tries to stay out of the way. ''I also don't want to micromanage.'' she said.
Ms. Luckman said Ms. Weill has carved out a role that is helpful without being intrusive. ''She's not a chairman that meddles with the day-to-day operations,'' Ms. Luckman said. ''She's a great strategist.''
Eventually, Ms. Weill said, she will step down. ''I never want to hold this organization back,'' she said. ''They need to grow.''
For now, Ms. Weill said she continues to enjoy being part of what she calls the Ailey family. ''When you get to know the dancers and you see them on the stage, it's just so much more meaningful,'' she said.
Born in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, Ms. Weill moved with her family to the San Fernando Valley because of her father's work as a press agent. ''I'm an original Valley Girl,'' she said.
The family returned to New York City when Ms. Weill was a teenager, and she graduated from Brooklyn College, where she majored in education and psychology. She and Mr. Weill met on April Fool's Day in 1954, when Ms. Weill was 19. They were married a year later.
After living in East Rockaway, N.Y., the Weills moved to Long Island before settling on the Upper East Side, where they raised their two children. They now live on the Upper West Side.
Ms. Weill said her husband has been a tireless supporter of her commitment to Ailey. There was a time when he grew tired of ''Revelations,'' the spirited piece that has become a crowd-pleasing staple of Ailey's repertoire. But he quickly saw the error of his ways. ''I decided being tired of it is not a good thing,'' he joked. ''So I'm not tired of it anymore.''
Ms. Weill, on the other hand, said she continues to discover new things in ''Revelations,'' year after year. ''It's different every time,'' she said. ''It's uplifting.''

HEADLINE: When Needs Hit Home

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
FOR 11 nights last month, several dozen homeless people slept on plastic sheeting and soiled blankets outside the gleaming new $500 million headquarters of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle. Their objective was a $30,000 grant to help reopen shelters that had been closed by cuts in government funds.
The demonstration outside the foundation, the wealthiest in the world with $37 billion under its control, illustrated the gap between those who say charitable giving should be directed at individuals in need -- a street-level approach, sometimes disdainfully called checkbook philanthropy -- and those whose generosity runs toward big-ticket items like experimental programs, cutting-edge university science labs or what Doris Buffett, Warren E. Buffett's older sister, calls ''S.O.B. gifts'' -- donations that support symphonies, opera and ballet.
As America's needs grow, philanthropy and how it is carried out are being questioned more closely. 
Eventually, the government relented and reversed the cuts in Seattle, and the protest ended. Meanwhile, the Gates Foundation noted that it had spent $47 million on transitional housing and homeless families in the Pacific Northwest and had committed $67 million more to the issue.
''We're trying to move upstream to a systems level to either prevent family homelessness before it happens or to end it as soon as possible after it happens,'' said Melissa Milburn, a spokeswoman for the foundation.
As the ranks of the needy grow, so does the need for charities that put food on a poor family's table, a roof over a homeless man's head or a coat on the back of a child whose mother is in prison, or for the charities that provide dental work for a woman without health insurance.
The number of Americans living below the poverty line -- 46.2 million -- is the highest it has been since the Census Bureau began collecting such data. Median incomes are declining, and college graduates can't find jobs. The gap between the haves and have-nots has widened sharply.
Yet for the last three years, state and local governments have slashed budgets that address homelessness, school nutrition, substance abuse and a range of other social services. In some cases, money is cut outright; in others, governments defer payments for months. Still others have been asking pointed questions about what their residents receive in return for the exemptions from property and sales taxes granted to nonprofits.
While many Americans have always given generously to help people, many others -- including individuals with the deepest pockets and foundations with billions in assets -- make donations of a different sort: building museums to house their art collections; underwriting new wings in hospitals or halls named for them at their alma maters; using their money and influence to sway public policy and influence political campaigns; or seeking to solve problems in distant lands rather than in their own backyards.
While charitable giving rose slightly over all in 2010, gifts to organizations that address basic human needs fell 6.6 percent, according to Giving USA. And the middle class, which has traditionally given more to address those needs, is feeling the bite of the economic malaise.
''At a time when America is having a debate about the social contract, philanthropy is silent,'' said Emmett D. Carson, chief executive of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which has assets of $2 billion. ''We are silent about the depths of the problems of homelessness, joblessness, foreclosure, hunger, and people are starting to believe that philanthropy is irrelevant to the core needs of their communities.''
As an example, he cites various proposals by the Obama administration to reduce the tax deductions for charitable giving -- like reducing that benefit for the wealthy. ''Because of our silence, we now have a president, a former community organizer, who does not value the charitable deduction,'' Mr. Carson said. ''What he's saying is that, left to its own devices, government can spend those dollars better than philanthropists.''
Mr. Carson, one of the most prominent African-Americans in institutional philanthropy, has long been known as a sort of Diogenes, unafraid to debunk the mythology that cloaks philanthropic institutions. ''As an industry, we prefer to be bystanders,'' he said of institutional philanthropists. ''We are afraid of controversy, and we don't like to explain why we make the choices we make as grant makers.''
An alumnus of the Ford Foundation, Mr. Carson came to Silicon Valley to oversee the merger of two community foundations in Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties, home to some of the world's wealthiest people, and he subsequently ruffled more than a few feathers there. The merged Silicon Valley Community Foundation's first project took aim at foreclosure. ''I got asked at least a million times, why are you working on foreclosure, what does that have to do with these counties?'' Mr. Carson said.
His staff had been conducting public meetings, he said, where they heard over and over that people were struggling with mortgage payments. ''It was the tale of two valleys,'' he said. ''One is very well known, filled with high-tech and social media moguls that can find enough people with the talent and skills their companies need. And then there's the other Silicon Valley, the one that has some of the highest unemployment rates, the highest foreclosure rates, the highest dropout rates -- and the highest cost of living.''
In addition to foreclosure, the foundation took on payday lending and financial literacy and set up a ''community opportunity fund'' that pays for food for the hungry and shelter for those losing their homes.
As a result, more than $6 million has been distributed to food pantries and shelters since 2008.
''We can't expect philanthropy to fill in all the gaps,'' Mr. Carson said. ''But we can't be ostriches, either.''
But not all philanthropists want to work on this level, and many of the generous have their own specific crusades. On the same day the Census Bureau announced its poverty statistics, the Found Animals Foundation, which works to help stray and abandoned animals, announced it would award a $25 million prize to any scientist who finds a nonsurgical method for spaying and neutering animals.
Dr. Gary Michelson, the billionaire orthopedic surgeon behind the foundation and the prize, also put up an additional $50 million to support the research needed to reach that goal -- and said he would provide more, if needed. ''If the first 50 goes, I'll put in another 50,'' he said. ''I intend to finish this.''
Echoing many big donors, Dr. Michelson said that passive donation of money does not lead to the sort of fundamental structural changes that he seeks to spark. ''Early on what I learned was that, yes, you can write checks and mail them off -- just don't expect a lot for that,'' Dr. Michelson said.
A few years ago, for example, he read about a group of professors from a community college who put up $500 in an effort to keep students from dropping out because they couldn't afford textbooks. Horrified, he contributed $50,000.
''That was the right thing to do, but all I did was the equivalent of giving a hungry person a fish,'' Dr. Michelson said. ''What I needed to do was come up with a more permanent solution.''
So he is starting a nonprofit that hopes to digitize textbooks and put them online for students to download at little or no cost. ''Of course, this is something the government should do, but my saying it won't help move the government to do it,'' he said.
Similarly, William E. Conway Jr., the billionaire co-founder of the Carlyle Group, recently told The Washington Post that he was dissatisfied with giving tens of millions of dollars to nonprofits that provide food, shelter and health care to the needy. ''So much of what I do now is stopgap,'' he told The Post. ''Somebody's hungry, we give money to the food bank. It would be far better if we had a more permanent solution.''
Mr. Conway, who declined to speak to The New York Times, told The Post that he hoped to use his philanthropy to create jobs and other more ''enduring'' things.
Mr. Buffett pledged the bulk of his fortune to the Gates Foundation but insists that his sister Doris is the ''real philanthropist'' in the family. Ms. Buffett presides over the Sunshine Lady Foundation, which does nothing but help people in need.
''Who am I to dispute what Warren says?'' she said.
She recently visited a maximum-security prison where 11 inmates were getting degrees from accredited colleges, including Cornell and Mercy College, through her philanthropy. ''The general recidivism rate is about 63 percent coast to coast,'' Ms. Buffett said. ''In our program, it's zero.''
A similar program she started works to provide education to victims of domestic violence. More than 1,600 women have graduated under it, and ''one went on to the Wharton School,'' she said.
Ms. Buffett had long been giving away money when her brother made his pledge to the Gates Foundation. So when he began getting letters from people asking for his help, he put them in a box and sent them to her, along with $10 million.
''I rounded up a bunch of ladies, and we started reading letters,'' she said. ''Some of them were nutty, but most of them were from people who were genuinely desperate and just needed a little help.''
They asked for money to put tires on their cars so they could get to work, for new glasses, for hearing aids, for custody payments and myriad other things. ''We checked out their stories,'' Ms. Buffett said. ''We never enable anyone, we empower them.''
One woman, for instance, had crippling arthritis, and her husband wasn't working. Ms. Buffett agreed to help out -- only if the husband found a job. ''I said, 'You send me a Xerox of his paycheck, and we'll match it until Christmas,' '' Ms. Buffett recalled. ''The first week, I think he got something like $75 for raking leaves or yard work, but by the second or third week, he was employed by one of those big national hardware chains. We got that fellow up out of his Barcalounger -- we empowered him.''
During more than a decade of philanthropy, Ms. Buffett has paid for tires, roofs, wheelchairs and refrigerators -- ''It doesn't have to be the swankiest one,'' she said -- and covered legal bills for custody fights and electric bills to ensure heat. Money for dental work is a common request, and on occasion she has paid for trips to the Mayo Clinic ''so they can get a proper diagnosis and some help.''
''I do consider these as investments rather than giveaways, and I'm looking for a good return on them,'' she said. ''The best return is when lives change for the better in some way, that's the commanding thought behind all I do.''
Her program to educate prisoners is an example of what many in the nonprofit world call ''impact investing,'' a catchall phrase to describe unconventional ways of getting money into nonprofit coffers and reducing the reliance on philanthropy.
In Britain, for example, Her Majesty's Prison Peterborough has long had high rates of recidivism. A new nonprofit group, Social Finance, raised money to address that problem in part through the sale of $8 million worth of ''bonds'' to foundations and wealthy individuals.
If Social Finance succeeds in reducing recidivism by 7.5 percent or more, the British government will not only repay the ''investors'' but give them a return on investment. The Rockefeller Foundation is one of the investors, and it is working to replicate the British experiment in the United States.
Antony Bugg-Levine, the newly appointed head of the Nonprofit Finance Fund and a former Rockefeller Foundation managing director who oversaw that ''investment,'' said the experiment could be the harbinger of a new way of deploying philanthropic dollars to address basic needs, pointing to the growing number of foundations and family offices that use grant money to support nonprofits through low-interest loans and bridge financing.
Still other foundations and family offices are experimenting with what is known as mission-related investments, using endowment assets to invest in mainstream companies whose business or business practices in some way produce benefits for society.
Companies, too, are finding ways to reorganize their operations so that they generate social benefits in addition to profits. The Wal-Mart Stores foundation, for instance, recently pledged to spend $100 million over the next five years to support the development of businesses owned by women and buy some $20 billion in merchandise from such enterprises.
''These are much larger pools of money that have traditionally been invested solely to achieve a financial return,'' said Mr. Bugg-Levine, co-author of ''Impact Investing: Transforming How We Make Money While Making a Difference.''
''If just a fraction of those assets gets invested in this way,'' he said, ''it can make a significant difference.''
Yet some Wal-Mart employees and others have asked why Wal-Mart did not use that money to support its employees' health care needs.
David Tovar, a company spokesman, said that Wal-Mart gave away more than $300 million in 2009 and that it addressed at least one basic need with its program to provide fresh foods from its groceries to food banks.
''Linking charitable giving and employee benefits is an apple-to-orange comparison,'' Mr. Tovar said. ''We spend several billion dollars each year providing comprehensive benefits to more than one million associates and their families.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Nov. 2, 2011, about changes in charitable giving referred imprecisely to a statement about active philanthropy by Dr. Gary Michelson, a philanthropist. Dr. Michelson's view is that active philanthropy that creates structural change provides greater long-term benefits than passive donations of money. Dr. Michelson did not describe any form of giving as not fulfilling.

HEADLINE: As Polls Slip, Perry Gets First Bounty of 'Super PAC' Ads

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
A new ''super PAC'' co-founded by Gov. Rick Perry's onetime chief of staff has begun running campaign ads in Iowa and South Carolina, marking the first advertising by a major super PAC in the Republican presidential primary and serving as a reminder of the Texas governor's formidable financial resources despite his recent slide in the polls.
The group, Make Us Great Again, is spending roughly $200,000 in each state over the next 10 days. While that amount is enough for a large initial advertising buy, it is sure to be only the first trickle in the total spent by candidate-focused super PACs in the coming months. 
Make Us Great Again initially planned to raise and spend as much as $55 million through next April, though an official of the group later said that information was outdated, and it was not clear how much the group had raised. Some rival campaigns question whether the pro-Perry group can ever come close to reaching its initial target.
A competing super PAC, Restore Our Future, which supports Mitt Romney and is operated by his former aides, reported raising $12 million in the first half of the year. Most of these groups are not required to disclose their contributions or donors from the second half of this year until Jan. 31.
There had been expectations that super PACS would finance attack ads; historically, outside groups have run some of the harshest ads against candidates, like Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which attacked the Vietnam War record of Senator John Kerry. But the two 30-second pro-Perry spots are designed instead to build up the candidate with a narrative of his life and his accomplishments as Texas governor, echoing his message on the campaign trail.
Both advertisements, for example, mention that Mr. Perry was the son of a tenant farmer and that he served in the Air Force, and they repeat Mr. Perry's campaign message that his policies have created jobs in Texas.
The group's advertising expenditure comes one week after Mr. Perry's campaign began running its first television advertising in Iowa. A person close to Make Us Great Again declined to discuss future strategy, including whether the group might run attack ads against Mr. Romney or other Republican rivals, but said the scope of the group's efforts was expected to be comparable to the pro-Romney group.
Super PACs were made possible by the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, which allowed unlimited spending by corporations, unions and individuals through these organizations, as long as the groups do not coordinate their spending with the candidates. Most of the top Republican presidential contenders, and President Obama, now have the support of super PACs established by donors and former aides, and they are expected to play a major role in the 2012 campaign.
The pro-Perry ads feature recent video of the governor shaking hands and speaking on the campaign trail. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Make Us Great Again, said the video was taken during campaign events that had been announced and open to the public in both Iowa and South Carolina.
The ads ''are designed to promote Governor Perry's excellent record on helping to create jobs and grow the economy,'' Mr. Miller said.
The group was founded two weeks before Mr. Perry officially declared his candidacy in August by supporters and donors including Mike Toomey, a lobbyist and former chief of staff to the Texas governor. Its executive director, Scott Rials, formerly worked for the campaign of Newt Gingrich, with the two men now at the top of the Perry campaign, Dave Carney and Rob Johnson.

HEADLINE: Two Mayors Deeply Split Over Blame On Fiscal Ills

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
For Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a pragmatic alumnus of Wall Street, arguing over who is to blame for the nation's financial crisis is a waste of time.
But for his predecessor, former Mayor Edward I. Koch, looking toward the future is not enough -- someone should pay.
The two men, who generally have a cordial relationship, found themselves at odds on Tuesday morning when asked to respond to the concerns expressed by the Occupy Wall Street protesters, who have criticized the nation's largest financial institutions. 
''It's fun and it's cathartic -- it's, I don't know, it's entertaining to go and to blame people,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a breakfast to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Association for a Better New York, a business and civic group. But, he said to applause, it ''doesn't get better by complaining about it; it doesn't get better by disrupting commerce; it doesn't get better by vilifying people and scaring them away from taking risks.''
Mr. Koch took a sharply different view. ''There's something wrong with a kid who steals a bike going to jail and someone who steals millions paying a fine,'' he said, also to applause from the large audience of business leaders, elected officials and others gathered in a ballroom at the Hilton New York in Midtown Manhattan. Both men were joined on the panel by former Mayor David N. Dinkins. (Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was invited to participate but said he had to be in California.)
The exchange offered a window into competing views about the value of assigning blame and attaching consequences for a crisis that has led to widespread unemployment and loss of wealth.
Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire and political independent with deep ties to the financial industry, expressed more unambiguously than ever before his view that Congress, rather than the banks, was responsible for the mortgage crisis.
''It was not the banks that created the mortgage crisis,'' the mayor said. ''It was, plain and simple, Congress who forced everybody to go and to give mortgages to people who were on the cusp.'' It was Congress, he continued, that ''pushed Fannie and Freddie to make a bunch of loans that were imprudent; they were the ones that pushed the banks to loan to everybody.''
And now, Mr. Bloomberg added, ''we want to go vilify the banks, because it's one target.''
''It's easy to blame them, and Congress certainly isn't going to blame themselves.''
The view Mr. Bloomberg articulated -- the mainstream Republican explanation for the subprime mortgage crisis -- is disputed by Democrats and many economists. They argue that even if federal policy may have partly contributed to the crisis by lowering standards for some mortgages, Wall Street broadened and exacerbated it by bundling high-risk loans and labeling them safe investments, thus spreading the financial danger throughout the global financial system.
Mr. Bloomberg also argued that the protests were not constructive. ''I hear your complaints,'' he said, adding, ''Some of them are totally unfounded.''
Rather than complaining, he said, the protesters ''should be out there trying to change the world and make it better.''
''And that's what we're trying to do in this city,'' he continued, ''and that's what people in this room are fundamentally trying to do.''
Mr. Koch, a Democrat, praised Mr. Bloomberg's business acumen but said he differed with him on the question of the financial crisis and the protests.
''I'm Jewish, not Catholic, but I believe in punishment,'' he said.
Referring to the settlements paid by Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to resolve claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Koch said they were just ''the cost of doing business'' in the view of the banks.
''What do you think they got fined for -- schmutz on the sidewalk?'' Mr. Koch said. ''They got fined because they abused their relationship with their clientele. And I want to see somebody -- I want to see one of them, of a major corporation, punished criminally.''
Over scattered applause, he added: ''They beggared the people in this country. More than $2 trillion was lost in the great recession.''
Mr. Dinkins, a Democrat, declined to engage in the debate. ''I have to tell you that constantly I read diverse opinions about fiscal matters, and I say to myself: 'Now, they all went to Harvard or Wharton or wherever -- the same schools, read the same books, listened to the same lecturers, and their opinions diverge. So what the hell do I know?' ''

HEADLINE: Leaders Reflect On Highs and Lows

 BODY:
Michael R. Bloomberg, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins spoke Tuesday at a breakfast event in Midtown Manhattan. Here are some highlights:
Accomplishments
MR. KOCH ''Having rallied the people of the city of New York during the transit strike.''
MR. DINKINS Preserving six-day-a-week library service; Nelson Mandela's 1990 visit to the city; the ''Safe Streets, Safe Cities'' policing program; the National Tennis Center. 
MR. BLOOMBERG ''The school system is better than it ever was''; ''increasing life expectancy''; ''diversification of our economy.''
Regrets
MR. DINKINS ''The all-time biggie, of course, is Crown Heights. ... If I had it to do over again, I would have said maybe 24 hours earlier to the police, 'What you're doing isn't working,' which I finally said.''
MR. KOCH Closing Sydenham Hospital in Harlem. ''It had nothing to do with medical service; it had to do with history, which I didn't understand at the time, but do today. And their history was it was the first hospital to admit black doctors, which other hospitals wouldn't do. So psychologically it was an extraordinary place for that community, and I didn't appreciate that.''
MR. BLOOMBERG ''Far and away it is not getting congestion pricing done.''
Observations
MR. KOCH (On the school system) ''Before me, the union picked the chancellor. They told the mayor. In fact, Al Shanker came in and told me who the next chancellor would be, and I said -- to myself, I didn't say it to him -- 'Over my dead body.' ''
MR. DINKINS (On being mayor) The mayor ''is treated like a head of state outside of the city. Not within the city, but outside the city.''
MR. BLOOMBERG (On an element of the National Tennis Center being named for Mr. Dinkins) ''I can't believe people who put their names on things.''
--
Edward I. Koch
On the 1980 transit strike
''I ran over to the Brooklyn Bridge ... and it was like a dybbuk had taken over my body. And as I got on the bridge I began to yell, 'Walk over the bridge, walk over the bridge, we're not going to let these bastards bring us to our knees!' And people began to applaud. I knew I was onto something. And I went to the bridge, the walking bridges, every morning about 6 o'clock for an hour or so, and every evening around 5 o'clock for about an hour and a half to encourage people to walk over the bridges. And they did for 11 days, and we broke the strike.''
David N. Dinkins
On the 1991 Crown Heights riots
''The thing that hurt the most, I suppose, was to be accused by some of permitting -- holding the police back -- and permitting young blacks to attack Jews, and that we did this, that I personally or my top command did this. And this was untrue, inaccurate and not so, and that's kind of painful. But if I had it to do over again, I would have said maybe 24 hours earlier to the police, 'What you're doing isn't working,' which I finally said.''
Michael R. Bloomberg
On being criticized
''Does the criticism hurt? Of course it hurts. If the criticism didn't hurt you should see a psychiatrist.''

HEADLINE: Iowa Governor Notes 2 Absences at Forum

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.

 BODY:
PELLA, Iowa -- Mitt Romney wasn't there. Nor was Herman Cain. But for the five Republican presidential candidates who did appear, Terry E. Branstad, the Republican governor of Iowa, offered encouraging words, as they all gathered on Tuesday at a National Association of Manufacturers forum.
The five candidates are trailing in the polls. But with two months to go, the race for the Iowa caucuses is still wide open, Mr. Branstad said, and past campaigns have shown that front-runners can fade. 
Mr. Branstad, who is popular with Iowa Republicans, said he wasn't close to endorsing anyone yet. But he said it was ''unfortunate'' that Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, and Mr. Cain, the business executive, who are leading recent polls in the state, did not attend the forum.
''They missed a great opportunity,'' Mr. Branstad said. Their campaigns did not respond to a question about why they did not attend.
The candidates who did make it agreed on a lot: Cut regulations. Cut spending. Lower taxes. Repeal ''Obamacare.'' For that matter, get rid of almost any policy connected with President Obama, who they depicted as determined to put people out of work and even drive some industries out of business.
The current government ''is maniacally anti-jobs,'' Newt Gingrich said. ''Obama is a left-wing radical who believes in class warfare.''
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said the president ''is at war against the coal industry.''
Rick Santorum struck a conciliatory note with Occupy Wall Street demonstrators -- ''they are concerned that middle America is being hollowed out'' -- but he said Mr. Obama is ''going around the country beating up on businesses.''
Ron Paul added his own hope that Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, would quit, and ''throw in the towel and say, 'I'm very sorry, Keynesian economics' '' doesn't work.
(Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for the Obama re-election campaign, said what the Republican candidates really favored was a return ''to the policies that led to our challenges, letting Wall Street write its own rules and more tax cuts for large corporations, millionaires and billionaires that shift a greater share of the tax burden onto the middle class.'')
Asked about federal benefits for ethanol and wind energy, which are both important in Iowa, most candidates agreed, as Mr. Perry said, that the federal government shouldn't be ''in the business of picking winners and losers'' in the industry.
Mr. Gingrich, though, said he supported wind energy tax credits, and he later told reporters he also supported helping oil, ethanol and other forms of energy as well.
Mr. Perry highlighted his claim in Texas that a college education should cost no more than $10,000. ''It is costing way too much money for a young person to go through college,'' he said.
He also made a pitch for his recent proposal for an optional flat tax. And Mr. Perry, who has enjoyed close ties with a number of lobbyists in Austin, said, Washington corporate lobbyists are going to hate me as president of the United States.''
Mr. Gingrich offered an education-and-employment proposal: ''Attach a mandatory training requirement to all unemployment compensation,'' he told the forum. In 99 weeks of benefits, he said, almost anyone could be trained to do a job.
He also complained about Europeans who, without the know-how and energy to compete fair and square, find ways to ''scheme'' to beat American industry.
No fan of plaintiffs' lawyers, Mr. Gingrich nevertheless said he would appoint ''the toughest, most energetic trial lawyer'' as the United States trade representative with instructions to ''kick-in doors'' every day during negotiations.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Deficit Panel Is Warned That It Must Not Fail and Is Urged to Compromise

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A co-chairman of President Obama's fiscal commission told members of a powerful Congressional panel on deficit reduction Tuesday that he feared they would fail, and he said the consequences of such failure could be calamitous.
Four experts on fiscal policy -- two Democrats and two Republicans -- told the panel that Congress should reduce the budget deficit by adopting spending cuts and increases in tax revenues. 
One co-chairman of the president's fiscal commission, Erskine B. Bowles, said he had great respect for each member of the committee, but added, ''I am worried you're going to fail -- fail the country.''
Former Senator Alan K. Simpson, the other co-chairman of the commission, denounced Grover G. Norquist, the conservative antitax advocate, and AARP, the lobby for older Americans, saying both were obstructing efforts to reduce the deficit.
Mr. Simpson, a Wyoming Republican, said that Mr. Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, a taxpayer advocacy group, had people ''in thrall'' to him.
The group says that 41 senators and more than 235 House members have pledged in writing to oppose all tax increases.
In addition, Mr. Simpson said that AARP was blocking needed changes in Medicare and Social Security. He described a recent AARP advertisement as ''the most disgusting ad I've ever seen.''
If Congress buckles to pressure from Mr. Norquist and AARP, Mr. Simpson said, ''we haven't got a prayer, and neither have you.''
The other witnesses at a Congressional hearing on Tuesday -- former Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and Alice M. Rivlin, the first director of the Congressional Budget Office -- said Congress must rein in the growth of entitlement programs, especially Medicare, and find additional tax revenues.
Those who would cut the deficit exclusively by one means or the other, Mr. Domenici said, are ''complicit in letting America destroy itself, letting this great democracy destroy itself.''
The hearing was held amid doubts about whether the 12-member Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction would meet a statutory deadline of Nov. 23 for recommending ways to reduce deficits by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years.
After the hearing ended, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and co-chairman of the select committee, sounded as skeptical as ever about Democrats' demands for additional tax revenues.
''The focus on revenues is a diversion from the real source of the problem, and that is health care spending,'' Mr. Hensarling said. ''Unless we fundamentally, structurally reform our health care programs, everything else we do is tinkering around the edges.''
Mr. Bowles, speaking for himself and Mr. Simpson, outlined a package that he said could reduce deficits by $2.6 trillion over 10 years. The package includes $800 billion of new revenue, $300 billion in savings from annual appropriations known as discretionary spending, $600 billion from health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid, $300 billion from other entitlement programs and $200 billion from use of a less generous formula to calculate cost-of-living adjustments in Social Security and other benefits.
If Congress made these changes, Mr. Bowles said, the government would not need to borrow as much, so projected interest payments on the debt would be reduced by $400 billion.
Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and co-chairwoman of the select Congressional committee, said the panel was ''entering the critical final phase'' of its work.
''Now is the time when everyone needs to be putting some real skin in the game and offering serious compromises,'' Mrs. Murray said. ''Democrats have made clear we are prepared to do that. We've said we are very open to painful concessions and compromises if Republicans are as well, and we have put forward serious ideas that reflect this.''
Ms. Rivlin and Mr. Domenici, the co-chairmen of a study group formed by the private Bipartisan Policy Center, proposed a major change: The traditional government-run Medicare program would compete directly with private health plans. The government would make a fixed payment on behalf of each beneficiary. The federal contribution would be tied to the cost of traditional Medicare or the second-cheapest private health plan in area, whichever was lower.
Mr. Bowles, who was chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, said Tuesday that Congress should run an experiment testing the feasibility of converting Medicaid to a lump-sum block grant in 10 states. The program is now an open-ended entitlement, with the federal government generally paying a share of whatever states spend on services for low-income people.
All four witnesses said Congress should devise a ''grand bargain'' involving tax and entitlement changes to reduce deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years.
Of this amount, Mr. Bowles suggested, $1 trillion should be additional revenue. Mr. Bowles said the committee could not rewrite the tax code or overhaul entitlement programs in three weeks. The panel, he said, should delegate the work to the tax-writing committees of Congress.
All the witnesses said they favored requiring higher-income Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for their health insurance.
Affluent beneficiaries are already required to pay higher premiums, exceeding $300 a month in some cases.
Mr. Simpson said co-payments charged to beneficiaries would ''have to go up.''
In addition, Mr. Bowles said, ''I could support raising the eligibility age for Medicare, since we have other coverage available through the Affordable Care Act'' of 2010.

KABUL, Afghanistan -- President Hamid Karzai's plan to disband private security companies that protect billions of dollars worth of aid projects and replace them with government forces is fraught with problems and unlikely to meet the president's March deadline to complete the transition, according to a six-month assessment of the program.
The assessment, conducted by NATO and the Afghan Interior Ministry, outlines dozens of issues that have slowed the development of the new security force and raises questions about the government's capacity to carry out and sustain the program and others as international aid and military support dwindle in coming years.
The report, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, comes as international development companies are becoming increasingly worried about the security of their workers, many of whom are Afghans. 
Mr. Karzai has said that replacing the private companies with his country's forces is an important step toward Afghan sovereignty. Gen. John R. Allen, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, has also made it a central issue, according to a Western official.
''It's become a top priority because if it doesn't work, everything grinds to a halt,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with diplomatic protocol. ''If it isn't sorted out, everyone will pull out because they don't want some fly-by-night security protecting them.''
NATO, the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development are setting up a task force that could grow to more than 170 people to advise and help train the guard force, according to a senior American official and a senior NATO official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Pentagon will also be asking Congress to appropriate $35 million to $40 million in new and reallocated money to pay for the task force, a senior NATO official said.
The assessment makes it clear that much work needs to be done. Of 166 ''essential'' criteria to determine if the government was able to recruit, train and sustain the guard force, less than a third could be fully met, the assessment found. Sixty-three of the measurements could not be met at all.
Among the shortfalls: the program, which is overseen by the Interior Ministry, ''has no money available to procure necessary supplies and equipment''; its training center is not teaching leadership skills and cannot generate enough guards to meet the forecasted demand; and the ministry has failed to provide the seed money -- about $10 million -- to prop up a state-owned business to run the program.
The program has already failed to supply personnel and equipment for some of its contracts, the report said. Its authors concluded that the police protection force ''is not on track'' to assume the responsibilities of the private security companies by March.
The Pentagon referred to the assessment in its latest report to Congress on Afghanistan, saying that in addition to other problems, it found the Interior Ministry to be ''inadequate and unresponsive'' in sustaining a guard training center. ''Examples of this include a lack of authorized or requested equipment, medical supplies, fuel and ammunition,'' the report said.
The Interior Ministry, in answers to written questions, insisted that the program had not been slow to develop, adding that the ministry's efforts so far had been focused on disbanding a wide range of private security companies. ''All preparations are under way for A.P.P.F. to be ready by March,'' the ministry said, referring to the Afghan Public Protection Force.
Despite the problems cited in the assessment, Mr. Karzai has not wavered in his determination to complete the transition by spring, said several officials. The senior NATO official said the coalition was ''absolutely'' committed to helping him do it. But many in the development industry are doubtful.
''There has to be very serious discussion, taking this report into account, whether that transition date is still viable,'' said Stan Soloway, president of the Professional Services Council, a trade group in Arlington, Va., that represents government contractors. ''From this report, it doesn't appear to be, so we don't have a lot of time to come to deal with the implications of this report.''
NATO and diplomatic missions, along with their development partners, employ about 34,000 security guards supplied by private security companies, the Pentagon report to Congress said. About 93 percent of all private security guards are Afghans, more than half of whom are employed by NATO, the report said. The president's plan includes exceptions for embassies and diplomatic missions and limited exceptions for some NATO bases.
Private security companies have long been a source of tension in the country. Some Afghan companies operated as private militias for warlords and many, along with some American companies, have been plagued by accusations of corruption, illegal use of weapons and reckless use of force resulting in civilian deaths and injuries.
Trying to rein in the companies, Mr. Karzai issued a decree last year ordering most of the guards supplied by private security companies to be replaced by government forces by December 2010, an unlikely goal that he amended in March, setting a 12-month time period for the transition.
But concern over whether that deadline can be met, and to what standard, is causing uncertainty among development organizations. Some development professionals say they may be forced to sever their contracts if they do not have some clarity on the security issue by the end of the year. The timing is important because it can take two months or more to close down a contract, several development professionals said. They are also concerned about the quality and loyalty of the guards they will get, many of whom will make half what the development organizations pay their Afghan guards now.
Asked if he would be forced to end contracts if the situation was not resolved, one development company official said, ''Absolutely.''
''We apply what we call the son and daughter standard,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid alienating American and Afghan officials. ''Would we send our sons and daughters out there to do this work, and the answer is no.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about delays in a program to disband private security companies in Afghanistan and replace them with government forces paraphrased incorrectly from a statement about the plan by the Afghan Interior Ministry. The ministry said it was focused on disbanding a wide range of private security companies, not just those with ties to government officials. The article also misstated the source of $35 million to $40 million that a NATO official said would finance a task force to aid the effort. The Pentagon will ask Congress to reallocate all of it from funds already designated for security in Afghanistan; the program will not use a mix of new and reallocated money.

HEADLINE: A Silver Lining to America's Waning Influence

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Hu Jintao of China will arrive in Cannes, France, this week pondering a plea from Europe for tens of billions of dollars to help the continent get out of its debt crisis. And President Obama will arrive with a smile, some hearty handshakes, and his own plea: that Greece get its act together and that Europe fix its economic ills, which he has called one of the biggest drags on the United States' own ailing economy.
The two contrasting appearances at the Group of 20 economic meeting are a stark example of waning American influence. Without the spare cash that Mr. Hu has at his disposal -- and the power that can come with it -- Mr. Obama has struggled to cajole his own allies into taking the steps he believes are necessary to lift the global economy. 
Yet the relative decline of the United States as an international force also comes with a silver lining. For decades, the United States has been the global rescuer of last resort. It is a role that has brought significant costs, both financial and human.
The last few months may well end up being an inflection point, in which the United States, though easily still the world's leading power, no longer has quite the responsibility or the burden it once did. The pattern has been evident in the Arab Spring, with the American military playing mostly a supporting role in Libya, and now in the European financial crisis, with Asian money coming to aid the Europeans.
''Why would the United States want to have influence over a train wreck?'' said George Friedman, the chief executive of Stratfor, a geopolitical risk analysis company. ''If the Chinese want to provide $150 billion bailing out European banks, more power to them.''
In many ways, the situation is a natural evolution of the campaign promises made by Mr. Obama in 2008, when he vowed to turn away from the Bush administration's more unilateral approach.
As president, Mr. Obama is now overseeing the withdrawal of all troops from Iraq and has emphasized multilateral diplomacy in all its messy forms. He refused to consider American intervention in Libya until the United Nations approved a resolution supporting it, and then he stepped back and allowed France and Britain to take the lead though American military help remained essential.
Mr. Obama's critics have decried the decline in American clout and said his approach exacerbated it, by forfeiting claims on American exceptionalism. Mr. Obama's backers say that he is simply acknowledging reality and developing a clear-eyed strategy for what the United States can and cannot do and that he ultimately may prove right in diagnosing Europe's economic problems and its need to take difficult steps to fix them.
''Obama has clearly made a premeditated move away from the unilateralism of the Bush years, and he's done it because it's the right way to conduct foreign policy, but has also done it because America's leverage has been diminished,'' said David J. Rothkopf, a Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration and the author of ''Running the World,'' a book about the National Security Council. ''We can't write checks the way that we once could; we can't deploy troops in the way that we once did.''
But, Mr. Rothkopf argues, ''we are in this situation of feeling overexposed and overburdened precisely because we had such an appetite before for unilateralism and triumphalism.''
For instance, he said, the staggering costs of the war in Iraq -- which the United States largely bore alone -- contributed to the very same national debt and budget deficit that now prevent the United States from stepping in financially to help Europe.
Of course, in an election year, the last thing that Mr. Obama wants to be seen as doing is putting forward the idea that the United States is no longer influential, or that there is no longer any such thing as American exceptionalism.
''This is a place that parents all over the world want to send their kids to university,'' said Michael Froman, the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, during a briefing with reporters at the White House on Monday. ''We're the center of innovation. We have a great network of alliances around the world that no other country has. I'm struck, in the G20 and the other forums that we're involved in, I'm struck by the degree which other countries very much look to the U.S. for leadership, thought leadership and leadership on action, to ensure a way to resolve global problems.''
Arriving in Cannes on Thursday, Mr. Obama will be trying to balance providing that leadership while not taking on any of the additional burden -- particularly financial -- that such leadership often requires.
Whatever Democrats and Republicans may say about the United States' role in the world, it is clearly changing.
Over the last two days, American officials have watched, largely powerless, as the Greek government has threatened to undo the Europe-designed, Asia-financed deal to restructure Greece's debts.
On Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, all but shrugged when reporters asked him what the United States planned to do about the call by the Greek prime minister's surprise call for a popular referendum on a new debt deal with his country's foreign lenders, a referendum that could throw Europe into even deeper turmoil.
''It is a European problem that needs to be addressed,'' Mr. Carney said, ''and they have the capacity to do it.''
The breakdown is a clear contrast to the 1990s, when the United States pushed through multibillion-dollar rescue packages for both Mexico and Asia, let alone the period after World War II, when the United States instituted the Marshall Plan.
But for all the acceptance that the United States will no longer be the world's policeman and financier, the emerging strategy carries risks.
China, for instance, is bound to try to extract concessions from Europe for any aid, and the United States could end up losing Europe as an ally in pressuring China to take important economic steps of its own, like allowing its currency to float on the open market, which both European and American policy makers want.
And while the political appetite for myriad military adventures overseas might be on the wane in Washington, the American military remains the world's most formidable, and the most likely to be called on to back American allies like Israel, Japan and South Korea.

HEADLINE: Investors At Paulson Stick With It

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED and JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
John A. Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager who made his fortune betting against subprime mortgages, has been fodder for Wall Street gossip as rivals wondered whether investors would bolt after suffering staggering losses this year.
At least for now, pensions, endowments and wealthy individuals are standing by their money manager. Redemption requests, which were due by Oct. 31, totaled less than 8 percent of assets, or roughly $2.4 billion, according to a letter that Mr. Paulson sent to investors on Tuesday.
It's a rare feat for a hedge fund. When returns sink by as much as 50 percent - as one portfolio did at Paulson & Company - investors typically flee at the first opportunity. 
But Mr. Paulson has built a reservoir of credibility, largely through past performance and marketing efforts.
Longtime clients are still giddy from 2007, when one credit-focused fund gained 600 percent amid the broader market downturn. Newer institutional investors that have lost millions, like public pensions in New Mexico and Missouri, figure returns will bounce back. Some are even pouring additional money into its funds in anticipation of a turnaround, money that will help offset some of the withdrawals.
''We still have a very high conviction that long-term Paulson is a very good investor,'' said Jon Sundt, the chief executive of Altegris in La Jolla, Calif., an investment manager that oversees $3 billion. ''We have had some investors who have been adding to their investments in Paulson.''
Still, Mr. Paulson, who is set to report positive monthly returns in a few days, is in a precarious spot. Since employees account for half of the fund's overall assets, the recent withdrawals amount to nearly 16 percent of the outside capital. And the firm is also attracting new money mainly by offering a break on fees to existing investors, rather than by cultivating new clients.
Should returns remain in the doldrums, some big clients have indicated they will withdraw their money. The next deadline to withdraw from most funds will be next year.
Mr. Paulson's spectacular fall has been watched as closely as his impressive rise.
The soft-spoken son of a corporate finance executive, Mr. Paulson, a former investment banker, ventured out on his own in 1994. Over the years, he produced steady gains, returning an average 16 percent a year in his oldest fund through 2006. He entered the big leagues in 2007, earnings billions of dollars betting against subprime mortgages.
Since then, investors have plowed money into his firm, encouraged by consultants like Cliffwater Associates and banks like Morgan Stanley and Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. At the start of the year, Paulson & Company oversaw $38 billion compared to just $4 billion in 2007.
Some industry players have complained that Mr. Paulson has shown little restraint in his fund-raising efforts, amassing assets at the expense of performance. His marketing team boasts a staff of more than two dozen professionals, higher than many large hedge funds. And he also has separate teams devoted to different types of investors, including endowments, foundations and pension funds.
The firm started to show cracks this year. Mr. Paulson lost $500 million on Sino-Forest, a Chinese timber company accused by an analyst of running a vast Ponzi scheme. His stakes in Bank of America, Citigroup and Hewlett Packard - part of a bullish call on the economy - have also withered.
He conceded to investors in October that he ''made a mistake.'' The Advantage Plus fund is off 47 percent through September. To climb out of that hole and start charging lucrative performance fees, the fund will need to post least 100 percent. Other funds like Advantage and Recovery will have to notch returns of at least 60 percent to get above water. The losses are so significant that some competitors joke Mr. Paulson would need to pull off a Hail Mary, with returns on par with the subprime play.
Investors who have recently met with the money manager say his usual swagger has diminished, and he appears worn. Last month, protesters at Occupy Wall Street focused on his Upper East Side townhouse. He responded in a statement, that ''instead of vilifying our most successful businesses, we should be supporting them.''
Despite the reversal, investors are largely remaining patient. Some are loath to sell their positions in Mr. Paulson's funds at their low point. Other big institutions are willing to stick by the money manager given the proven team and strong record.
''With a fund of our size, we are going to constantly have investments that do very well and those that don't,'' said M. Steve Yoakum, executive director of the $30 billion Public School & Education Employee Retirement System of Missouri, which has $118 million with Mr. Paulson. ''One of the biggest differences between institutions and private investors is the tendency to sell when things are bad.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bank of America Drops Plan for Debit Card Fee

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Bank of America blinked on Tuesday.
The bank, the nation's second-largest, said it was abandoning its plan to charge customers a $5 fee to use their debit cards for purchases. Only a month earlier, the bank had announced the new charge, immediately setting off a huge uproar from consumers.
Despite an outpouring of complaints online and at branch offices, the bank had remained steadfast in its plans until last Friday, according to a person briefed on the situation, planning to ease just some of the conditions for avoiding the fee. But over the weekend, after two major competitors -- Wells Fargo and the nation's largest bank, JPMorgan Chase -- said they were backing away from their plans to levy similar charges, two high-ranking Bank of America officers recommended to Brian Moynihan, the bank's chief executive, that the bank simply drop the fee. 
Then, on Monday morning, when SunTrust, a regional bank in Atlanta, said that it, too, would abandon its $5 charge, Bank of America was left standing alone, the last major bank planning the fee. The announcement came on Tuesday.
''We have listened to our customers very closely over the last few weeks and recognize their concern with our proposed debit usage fee,'' David Darnell, co-chief operating officer at Bank of America, said in a statement. ''As a result, we are not currently charging the fee and will not be moving forward with any additional plans to do so.''
The revenue the bank expected to raise from the debit fee was not worth the damage to its reputation, the person briefed on the matter said.
The bank never disclosed how many of its customers would have been affected by the fee. It also declined on Tuesday to comment on how many had closed their accounts after the original announcement, but sources close to the bank said that account closures were higher than usual. And smaller institutions like PerkStreet said that their account acquisition rate had spiked in the days afterward.
Besides Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and SunTrust, Regions Financial has also said it would roll back its debit fee as of Tuesday and reimburse customers for any charges incurred.
All along, though, Bank of America took the brunt of the criticism, and apparently, it was not just the debit fee that caused consumers to lash out. For Grace Anderson, of Madison, Wis., the bank's recent decision to cut 30,000 job positions had prompted her to close a checking account. ''I cannot in good conscience invite them into my house and my life,'' she said, adding that she had moved her account to USAA, a federal savings bank.
The new fees were part of an effort by the banks to raise revenue lost elsewhere. On Oct. 1, a new federal rule went into effect that limits the fees banks can levy on merchants every time a consumer swipes a debit card to make a purchase. The new limit is expected to cost the banks about $6.6 billion in revenue a year, beginning in 2012, according to Javelin Strategy and Research. That comes on top of another loss, of $5.6 billion, from new rules restricting overdraft fees, which were widely seen as onerous and went into effect in July 2010.
Now that all the large banks have decided not to impose the debit fee, experts said, they will find other ways to fill the hole. ''Those revenues paid for a lot of things,'' said Joe Gillen, chief executive of Pinnacle Financial Strategies, a bank consultant in Houston.
Now, he said, consumers can expect more fees over time. ''It will be slow and gradual, but they will bring those revenues back,'' Mr. Gillen said.
What he said was most frustrating, however, was that the banks were penalized for their openness. The fees the banks were trying to replace -- the so-called swipe fees -- were not readily apparent, even though all consumers were ultimately paying them in higher costs at the cash register. Now, Mr. Gillen said, the banks ''are going to have to hide the fees and the customers will still have to pay them.''
But those customers may have found their voice, which has been amplified by social media. ''People can now use tools like Change.org, Facebook and Twitter to rapidly organize and collectively act to influence the policies of even the largest companies,'' said Ben Rattray, founder of Change.org, which allows consumers to start grass-roots campaigns using its online platform.
He pointed to Molly Katchpole, a 22-year-old woman from Washington who collected more than 300,000 signatures opposing the fee by using his company's platform. And then there is the grass-roots effort that is calling for this coming Saturday to be ''Bank Transfer Day,'' where customers of big banks move their accounts to community banks and credit unions.
Mr. Rattray and other consumer advocates said the outcry was about much more than fees. ''Bank of America's new debit card fee was the last straw for many consumers who are tired of banks that got bailed out that are now turning around and hiking fees,'' said Norma Garcia, manager of Consumer Union's financial services program. ''There was this phenomenon with banks and others confusing passivity with loyalty. And consumers are saying, 'You can't take us for granted anymore.' ''
Lawmakers also openly criticized Bank of America's planned fee. Days after the bank announced that it would charge the fee, President Obama said customers should not be ''mistreated'' in pursuit of profit, while Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the move ''incredibly tone deaf.'' And Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, spoke out on the Senate floor, urging consumers to vote with their feet. He had sponsored the rule, known as the Durbin amendment, that limited the amount banks could charge for debit card transactions.
On Tuesday, he took to the floor again. ''What we have at work here is a very fundamental principle of our economy, the free market economy, transparency,'' he said. ''So people know what they are being charged. So they have a choice.''
Online Correction: November 1, 2011, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Bank of America as the nation's largest bank. JPMorgan Chase has overtaken Bank of America in assets, according to third-quarter results released in October.

HEADLINE: How to Prop Up the Euro

BYLINE: STEVEN RATTNER


HIGHLIGHT: Steven Rattner is a contributing writer to Op-Ed and a former counselor to the Treasury secretary and lead auto adviser. He is a longtime Wall Street executive.

 BODY:
Here's the critical takeaway from last week's European rescue plan: Nothing in it addresses the endemic economic weaknesses that nearly propelled the euro zone into a meltdown.
However successful the package may prove in quelling turbulent markets (a questionable assumption, particularly after Greece's decision to submit its latest rescue plan to a referendum), the members of the common currency still face the more daunting challenge of how to restructure their Rube Goldberg contraption so that such turmoil doesn't recur.
The initial misstep by European leaders, of course, was lashing their nations to a common currency without integrating other critical policies, such as government borrowing and regulation. 
That allowed differences in growth rates among the countries to persist -- and even expand -- during the boom-bust cycle of the past half-decade.
Visit Germany and be struck by the palpable energy and drive within the business community. In part because of a ''grand bargain'' nearly seven years ago that blended deregulation, job security and wage restraint, German productivity and economic output both grew by almost 10 percent between 2000 and 2010.
Contrast that with Italy, where Sergio Marchionne, the exceptional chairman of both Fiat and Chrysler, has lambasted worker efficiency, even threatening to quit the country. In 2009, each worker at Fiat's Italian factories assembled an average of 30 cars per year, compared with nearly 100 per year in Poland, while being paid more than three times Polish wages.
Italy was the only major European country in which productivity stagnated in the last decade. Its economy barely grew.
Italy is not alone in its difficulties. Spain is digging out of the wreckage of a euro-fueled borrowing and construction boom, with unemployment stuck above 20 percent thanks to its rigid labor market. Like Greece, Portugal is struggling with an uncompetitive economy and bloated government payrolls. Of the weaker countries, Ireland has made perhaps the most progress in adjusting to the hangover from a real-estate-fueled splurge.
By having a single fiscal policy and regulatory framework, the United States has experienced far fewer internal stresses and strains. Our federal budget includes ''automatic stabilizers'' that, without further congressional action, shuttle money to hard-hit areas.
For example, the federal government reimburses individual states for half the cost of extended unemployment insurance. In Europe, these programs, known as ''transfer payments,'' evoke strong negative emotions in wealthy countries -- and not just Germany.
Similarly, regional differences in unemployment in the United States are mitigated by the propensity of Americans to move in search of work, as they have done in leaving cities like Detroit for fast-growing Sun Belt locales. Impeded by language, cultural traditions and other barriers, Europeans don't relocate as readily.
To date, European leaders have focused on treating the symptoms of what ails the common currency, rather than the disease itself. Assembling enormous pools of capital and creating lenders of last resort does nothing to resolve the inherent tensions among countries growing at such disparate rates.
Already, the markets are signaling skepticism: The interest rate on Italy's debt has breached 6 percent, three times what Germany pays to borrow money.
Absent a fresh approach, prospects for the weaker economies are grim -- a grinding down of government budgets and private-sector wages in a perhaps vain effort to become competitive with Germany (what the Europeans euphemistically call ''internal devaluations''). None of these countries has yet demonstrated the fortitude to navigate this difficult route to competitiveness. And at every sign that efforts are flagging, bond market vigilantes remain ready to pounce.
What are the alternatives to just muddling through? The 17 euro nations could decide to abandon the common currency, allowing the weaker countries to deploy the more conventional approach of devaluation. Such a reversal would entail unimaginable complexity and bring its own form of chaos.
Instead -- and ideally -- Europe should move forward with much greater speed toward true integration. To be sure, greater flexibility in labor markets cannot be achieved by mandates.
However, nothing prevents the adoption of a single fiscal policy (including transfer payments) and a harmonized approach to competitiveness except the tortuous politics of national pride and a fear of German domination.
Both are certainly understandable. But if the euro members remain committed to the vision of an integrated continent spawned in the post-World War II ashes, they need to think as Europeans.
Otherwise, European policy makers won't be able to restrain the markets, any more than King Canute could hold back the sea.

HEADLINE: Aftershocks for Athens and Wall Street: European Debt Crisis Tightens Its Chokehold on Global Markets

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The European debt crisis demonstrated again on Tuesday the chokehold it maintains on investors worldwide, as a surprise move by Greece to put the terms of its planned bailout to a public referendum battered global financial markets.
Meanwhile, the bankruptcy of the brokerage firm MF Global sent some ripples through the markets, reducing trading volumes as its traders were barred from commodity exchange floors in Chicago and New York, but analysts and traders said its effects were minor compared with the actions in Greece.
Declines that started in Asia accelerated in Europe -- where the major indexes slumped 5 percent. Bank stocks led the sell-offs, and the broad United States stock market slid nearly 3 percent. In the credit markets, crucial stress gauges moved toward recent highs, while rising interest rates on Italian debt underscored investors' growing doubts about that highly indebted country, which has become the new focus of concern in the euro zone. 
''It is all Europe right now,'' said Eric Green, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Greek referendum threatened to undo the work of the summit meeting last week in Brussels, where leaders outlined a rescue plan that cheered markets and contributed to the biggest monthly United States stock market rally in October since 1982.
''The markets don't know which way to look,'' said Andrew Wilkinson, an economist at Miller Tabak & Company.
''This has absolutely blindsided markets.''
The declines in Europe wiped out the exuberant gains of last week after the Brussels deal, which initially led some investors to believe Europe was addressing the Greek problem. The reversal in Greek markets included insurance contracts on bonds pricing in a higher likelihood of default.
Even last week doubts grew that the grand European plan would be enough to stop the crisis from spreading to Italy, a much bigger economy that has to refinance billions of euros of debt in the coming year.
Italy has a small budget deficit of about 3 percent of its gross domestic product, which means it has a relatively small amount of net new borrowing to do, although this percentage may be revised upward if growth slows next year as expected.
The much bigger problem is its mountain of existing debt that must be rolled over as it matures -- about 52 billion euros this year and 307 billion more next year, according to Tobias Blattner, an economist at Daiwa Securities in London.
As Italy's borrowing costs shoot up -- the 10-year government bond yield jumped to a record 6.33 percent on Tuesday -- investors are concerned that too much of its strained budget will be consumed by the costs of its enormous debt.
In signs of a reappearance of stress in the European credit markets, the rates that banks charge to lend euros to one another rose, and the costs to banks of swapping euros for dollars in the open foreign exchange market -- the three-month euro-dollar cross-currency basis swap -- also increased sharply.
The cost of insuring the debt of a basket of European banks against default rose to the highest level since Oct. 5. It now costs $261,000 to insure $10 million of bank debt annually for five years, compared with $207,000 at the end of last week, according to the data provider Markit.
Analysts said European leaders had so far failed to come up with a clear solution to cope with a problem on the scale of Italy's debt.
Officials had proposed maximizing the European bailout fund, though they did not offer details, and in particular had not defined a role for the European Central Bank, analysts said.
The central bank was buying bonds to support the Italian bond market on a large scale on Tuesday, traders said. But many analysts say it is inevitable that the central bank will have to act much more aggressively, in effect printing money by buying hundreds of billions of euros of bonds from peripheral countries like Italy.
Such an action, however, is politically poisonous in countries like Germany where the public fears inflation. It would be a big test for Mario Draghi, the new president of the European Central Bank, whose first day in office was Tuesday.
''We are going to have an escalation of the crisis until the E.C.B. steps in,'' said Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg Bank. ''It will have to signal very clearly that it will not let a solvent sovereign go.''
Following the bankruptcy of MF Global, the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday delisted its stock from trading.
Mike Zarembski of OptionsXpress said the bankruptcy of the firm, a large player in the commodities markets, had temporarily reduced volumes in those markets in Chicago and New York. Floor brokers and traders who cleared their trades through MF Global on Monday were barred from the trading floors.
In New York, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.79 percent, or 35.02 points, to 1,218.28, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.48 percent, or nearly 300 points, to 11,657.96. The Nasdaq composite index was down about 2.9 percent at 2,606.96.
In Europe, the sentiment had been even more negative.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index closed down 5.3 percent, the German DAX down 5 percent and the French CAC 40 down 5.4 percent. In Britain, which is not a member of the euro zone but trades heavily with its Continental neighbors, the FTSE 100 index was down 2.2 percent.
As they have repeatedly in recent months, bank stocks led the broader markets sharply lower. Financial stocks fell 4.7 percent in the United States, and nearly twice that in Europe.
The benchmark 10-year United States note yield dipped to 1.97 percent, from 2.12 percent, on Monday.
The euro fluctuated during the day amid uncertainty over how the developments in Greece would affect the latest debt deal. The euro, which started the day at nearly $1.39, declined to $1.36 before rising again to nearly $1.37 in the late afternoon.
''When they called for the referendum, that weighed on the euro,'' Eric Viloria, senior market strategist for Forex.com.
''We have already bounced back up because it has been rumored that the referendum is already dead,'' he said, referring to news reports that the government might fall.

HEADLINE: MF Global Inquiry Escalates

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Federal officials are escalating an investigation into MF Global, the bankrupt brokerage firm run by Jon S. Corzine, as the search continues for roughly $600 million in missing customer money.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which first detected the missing money last week, decided to issue subpoenas to MF Global and demanded that the firm retain any documents that may be related to the investigation, according to people briefed on the situation.
The trading commission along with the Securities and Exchange Commission and exchanges like the CME Group are examining whether MF Global diverted customer money in recent days to support its own trades in a last-ditch effort to save itself - a serious violation of federal rules. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also joined the inquiry, according to a person with knowledge of the case. The F.B.I. has only started its review of the matter, and there is still no indication that criminal laws were violated. An F.B.I. spokesman declined to comment.
Neither MF Global nor Mr. Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey and once a top executive at Goldman Sachs, has been accused of any wrongdoing.
In Federal Bankruptcy Court in downtown Manhattan on Tuesday, MF Global's lawyers played down the missing money. Ken Ziman, one of the lawyers, said in the firm's first hearing that banks or clearinghouses had been slow to produce the money.
''To the best knowledge of management, there is no shortfall,'' Mr. Ziman said.
But regulators on Tuesday still could not locate the customer money, and the firm had not accounted for it. The downfall of MF Global, and the growing federal investigation into the missing money, threaten to bruise Mr. Corzine's reputation. After losing his bid for re-election as New Jersey's governor in 2009, ending a decade-long run in politics, Mr. Corzine returned to Wall Street, landing at MF Global in March 2010.
In his new role, Mr. Corzine sought to transform MF Global from a sleepy brokerage firm into a high-flying Wall Street presence reminiscent of his former employer, Goldman Sachs. He started buying debt from Italy, Ireland and other troubled European nations at a discount.
Amid the continuing sovereign debt crisis, the holdings alarmed investors and led to widespread concerns about the health of MF Global. By the last week of October, the stock was in free fall and Mr. Corzine moved to strike a deal to sell off all or part of the firm.
Early Monday, MF Global disclosed to regulators that it had failed to segregate clients' accounts, breaking fundamental Wall Street rules. The revelation of missing money dashed a potential deal and propelled the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
While it is unclear where the money went, some of the money is expected to turn up as MF Global sorts through the bankruptcy process.Little, if any, money trickled in on Tuesday, however, according to two people briefed on the matter, and roughly $600 million in unaccounted assets remained.
As of Tuesday night, regulators were still at MF Global's headquarters poring over the firm's books, according to people briefed on the matter. They are, in part, examining whether MF Global used customer money to satisfy demands from trading partners that the firm produce more cash to meet its financial obligations.
Exchanges, too, are increasing the pressure on MF Global to come up with the assets.
CME, the giant exchange where MF Global conducted business until Monday, said it was investigating the missing money. With special permission from regulators, CME was planning to take the unusual step of transferring MF Global's customer accounts to other brokerages, potentially without all of the money, according to a person briefed on the matter.
''While we are unable to determine the precise scope of the firm's violation at this time, we are investigating the circumstances of the firm's failure,'' Craig Donohue, CME's chief executive, said during the exchange's earnings call on Tuesday.
''We recognize that yesterday was a very difficult day for all concerned,'' Mr. Donohue added. ''As is nearly always the case in matters like this, this is a very fluid situation involving complex legal, regulatory and bankruptcy related issues.''
To keep the firm running during the Chapter 11 proceedings, lawyers for MF Global sought approval for several initial motions in bankruptcy court on Tuesday. The presiding judge, Martin Glenn, agreed to let MF Global use $8 million of its remaining $26 million in cash for essential operations, like salary for a skeleton staff. MF Global can use the funds until Nov. 14, at which point the firm would need additional approval.
MF Global said it would try to find extra cash in its operations and raise money by liquidating assets. Mr. Ziman said that the firm was also searching for a lender to provide bankruptcy financing.
As part of the hearing, MF Global also reached an agreement with JPMorgan Chase, the firm's chief unsecured creditor, which had laid claim to most of the firm's $26 million in cash. By letting MF Global use some of the money, JPMorgan argued, it was being pressed into providing an involuntary bankruptcy loan.
To assuage those fears, MF Global agreed to cover some of JPMorgan's legal fees.
''This is a lifeline for the enterprise,'' Mr. Ziman said at the hearing.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Mr. Corzine's Big Bet

 BODY:
Why did Jon S. Corzine make the risky bets that have now plunged MF Global Holdings into bankruptcy court? We don't know, but the likely explanations are disturbing. 
Over the past year, most investors have been fleeing the sovereign debt of Spain, Italy and other euro-zone basket cases. Not Mr. Corzine. The onetime chief executive of Goldman Sachs and former New Jersey senator and governor who has run MF Global since early 2010, was all in, buying up $6.3 billion worth of discounted euro-zone debt.
As Azam Ahmed reported in The Times on Tuesday, Mr. Corzine appeared to be wagering that the European Union would come to the rescue of Europe's troubled economies, averting a default. In other words, Mr. Corzine was betting on a bailout.
A euro-zone bailout may well come, but not in time for Mr. Corzine and MF Global. Concerns about Mr. Corzine's big bet led two ratings agencies to downgrade the firm to junk last week, draining investor confidence -- and cash -- from the firm, and sending it spiraling into bankruptcy proceedings. The fact that Mr. Corzine built a strategy betting on a government (in this case, European) rescue should be a chilling reminder of how far the world has not come since the darkest days of the financial crisis. Europe is trying to bail out Greece, in part, to protect its big banks.
In fact, the financial system, on both sides of the Atlantic, is still dominated by too-big-to-fail banks and regulations intended to ensure that their collapse won't bring down the financial system are still a work in progress.
It is progress that in Europe, at least, creditors are being asked to bear some of the burden. But the need for bailouts is clearly still very much with us.
Another reason that Mr. Corzine's bets may have gone so wrong -- and another echo of the financial crisis -- is that American regulators did not rein in the firm. MF Global was highly leveraged, with liabilities at the end of June of $44.4 billion and equity of only $1.4 billion.
In a research note published on Tuesday, Steve Blitz, a senior economist with ITG Investment Research, pointed out that MF Global was one of the firms designated by the Federal Reserve as a primary dealer in United States Treasuries. After the havoc of high leverage in the financial crisis, how is it possible that the Fed allowed MF Global to operate with so much leverage? Are the Fed, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other relevant regulators fully monitoring the risks at other broker dealers?
Meanwhile, self-regulation is clearly not the answer. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a self-regulatory agency for brokerages, recently warned MF Global to shore up its capital to cushion against its increasingly risky positions. Whatever the firm did, if anything, clearly wasn't enough.
In the end, the American people are lucky that MF Global was small enough to fail, its riskiness and recklessness absorbed by the bankruptcy process. But with the devastating damage from the crisis still hobbling the economy, relying on luck is not enough.
MF Global is a warning that the system is still far too vulnerable and the work of regulatory reform far from finished.

HEADLINE: More on Energy and Climate Paths for California and Beyond

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Bright and downbeat views of next steps on energy and climate. 

 BODY:
Building on my weekend "Reality Check on Ambitious Climate Targets," here are two "Your Dot" views of energy and climate paths for California and the rest of the planet, one offered by Alan Nogee, an energy consultant who was until recently the leader of the Clean Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, and Thomas Crowley of the University of Edinburgh, a veteran of decades of climate research who here writes primarily as a resident of a place, Scotland, where energy prices are very high.
There's more amplification coming soon from me, Nate Lewis, Jane Long and others on the California energy post, and on Joe Romm's "CharlieSheen" charge Monday night related to that post (I'm still hampered by what's now a four-day power and Web disruption from the clash of late foliage and early snow on Saturday).
After reading the piece, Crowley sent a note under the title "Tales of Brave Ulysses" (as per Cream), alluding in part to an essay he wrote for The Guardian in 2007: "In the short term, there'll be no major action against climate change; to tackle global warming we need a shift in attitudes unprecedented in peace time." Here's his new, and downbeat, line of thinking: 
The Guardian put words in my mouth with respect to the title of my piece. I did not argue for a wartime effort; I simply stated that such emergency efforts only occur in wartime. While I am still comfortable with my argument that 'human inertia' is the prime explanation for a long response time for doing anything about greenhouse gas emissions, I am very wary of efforts by California and the U.K. to stick their necks out on carbon reductions. The costs are extremely burdensome; I have come to appreciate that far more after living in Scotland for four years, and experiencing the onerous levels of taxation (it recently cost me $140 for 16 gallons of fuel for my auto).
In these difficult economic times it almost seems foolish to single-handedly undertake such vast changes when the rest of the world is ignoring the problem. Justifications about being a leader are dubious - don't forget the lemming leading the pack over the hill is the first one to realize there is a long drop in front of him.
I have also become pessimistic about a number of proposed solutions. Carbon capture and storage appears to be gigantically expensive. Windmills help, but in some places they really do stick out too much - in the wide open spaces of west Texas they are fine, on a wee Scottish hill much less fine.
There is also a long cost recovery time for solar panels that make it impractical for all but prosperous homeowners. Government cost-sharing actually goes mainly to the better off, because less-well off people simply cannot afford it, so it becomes a case of reverse subsidizing.
With the advent of fracking, the chances for renewables being cost-competitive becomes greatly reduced.
I used to think massive investment in basic science might be our only way out, but when I read about the real cost for producing electric cars (ex., greenhouse gases used to make batteries), subsidized solar companies going under because they cannot compete with China (which doesn't care about labor needs or pollution), etc., then I wonder about that too.
I have also increasingly become wary of a certain "do gooder" tendency among some climate scientists and others. There seems to be this alluring tendency to dress oneself in the garb of humanism (a mirror image of those dressing themselves up as so-called "skeptics") so that one can think better of oneself, while at the same time seeming to do something that is objectively good.
Others argue that we have to do this, so let's get started. Oh really? If this is to prevent human suffering than why haven't we done something about the Congo, where at least a million people have already died? These are not the unborn of 2070 - they were actually living, and yet we didn't do something because in fact it seemed impossible to do anything.
On the other hand, I detest even more the distortions of the right on this entire issue.
What we need is a modern Ulysses to steer us between a new Scylla and Charybidis, without ending up being lured by the Sirens on the other end!
Alan Nogee posted a comment, republished here, expanding on his view that there was mainly good news in the report on California's choices in meeting its requirement to deeply cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050:
I do think the point that California is actually a worst-case, not a best-case, is quite important.... In coal-dependent regions that have the highest CO2 emissions, existing wind and gas technology work very well together to displace lots of emissions. In California's relatively clean system, new zero-emission load balancing technologies are needed much sooner to achieve the same percentage emission reductions.
While I wish Joe Romm would tone down his thetoric, I really have to agree with him and comment 44... that the analysis provides strong support for "deploy, deploy, deploy" being the top priority, since it shows we can get 3/4 of the way to the 80% reduction targets with existing technology, even in the challenging California case. Even in ideal conditions, it will take decades to deploy that much new technology, even as it improves through industry learning and innovation.
That is not to say that innovation and R&D isn't also important. Clearly it is, and the study also shows that, and provides helpful guidance on the areas where it is most needed over the long-term: fuels and load-balancing. It also shows that long-term thinking and planning is important. Short-term market-driven choices, even with a carbon price, may lead to more stranded investment than necessary.
The study also provides a basis for optimism about new technology directions. In a scenario where most light vehicles and heat is from electric power, there will be tremendous load-balancing opportunities through vehicle-to-grid technology, used vehicle batteries, and heat storage. The innovations needed to realize these opportunities are already well underway.

HEADLINE: American Students Gaze Across the Atlantic and See College

BYLINE: REBECCA R. RUIZ


HIGHLIGHT: For those who don't mind being far from family and friends, a dorm room in Paris or Switzerland beckons, sometimes at a fraction of the price of Pomona or Syracuse. 

 BODY:
To a packed room at the Peninsula Hotel in New York City last month, Isabelle Dufault, admissions officer at the Ecole HoteliereinLausanne, Switzerland, outlined her institution's undergraduate application process. The rapt audience of prospective students and their parents scribbled down notes on essays, deadlines and tuition. Nearly all were residents of the New York area.
At a time when more international students are choosing to study in the United States, a separate phenomenon is on the rise: that of American students choosing to spend their entire college experience abroad. Some international institutions have noted American students' increased willingness to travel farther from home, which has prompted the schools to bolster their outreach efforts.
What's the allure for American students? While cost appears to be a factor (a year's tuition in Madrid or Athens could be as little as $15,000, far lower than the price of an American college), some students also seem intent on retracing their families' roots.
"Two years ago, we would spend three weeks recruiting in North America," Ms. Dufault said at the recent information session. "This year, it's three months."
Ecole Hoteliere, a hospitality management school whose primary language of instruction is English, has seen its American undergraduate applications swell to 84 from 3 in the last five years, growth that has far outstripped its broader application increase.
The University College of London, the University of Oxford, the University of Edinburgh and the American College of Greece have also reported steady double- and triple-digit percentage rises in their undergraduate American applications over the last decade. In most cases, those jumps have outpaced overall rises in total applications.
The Institute of International Higher Education reported that over 42,000 students from the United States pursued degrees abroad last year. That tally was the first of its kind by the organization, allowing for no comparative data. But the institute called it "a large number" and emphasized that overall global student mobility is on the rise.
David Horner, president of the American College of Greece, said that at his institution recruitment of American students had been a conscious goal. "It's a centerpiece of our strategy," he said, citing the college's enhanced marketing, including specific outreach to Americans with Greek surnames.
The college's efforts have proven successful, with a 130 percent rise in undergraduate applications from American students from 2009 to 2010. "In spite of the negative publicity about Greece," he said, "we've been seeing significantly boosted interest."
At other colleges, increases in American applications have come more organically, with little additional institutional outreach of note.
St. Louis University, an American Jesuit institution, has a campus in Madrid that has conferred four-year degrees since 2003. According to Maria-Jose Morell, director of enrollment management at that campus, applications from U.S. students have markedly increased in the past three years - by more than 20 percent from 2009 to 2010.
Ms. Morell suggested that fundamental economic incentives were motivating American applicants to explore extended study abroad. "With the rising costs of university education in the U.S., European-based campuses are attractive, affordable alternatives," she said.
Indeed, for 2011-2012, tuition at St. Louis University's Madrid campus is listed at roughly $10,000 less than tuition at the school's home campus in Missouri.
But while economics may favor the trend, Celeste Schenck, president of the American University of Paris, thinks a larger force is at work. She attributed the increased American interest in international schooling to modern-day intercultural connectedness. "Today's students increasingly think of themselves as citizens of the world," she said. "They're what some call 'third culture kids'."
Sean Goldberg, a third year student at the University College of London from New York City, agreed. While he was raised in the United States, his parents were first-generation immigrants from Israel and Lithuania, and he grew up with an international identity.
"I'd been exposed to a multiplicity of different cultures," he said. "And in college, I wanted to experience diversity on a larger scale."
Ms. Schenck stressed the uniqueness of pursuing a full degree in a foreign country, warning against the "trench mentality" students from the same home country might adopt when studying abroad for only a semester.
"It's special when you get beyond that, when you're not part of individual national cohorts," she said.
Stephen Hillier, vice principal at the University of Edinburgh, called the increases in American students abroad - and non-American students in the United States - a positive cross-pollination.
"It's one of the benefits of globalization," he said. "We celebrate our links with the States. We're hardwired into the hearts and minds of Americans. And they should all come here."

HEADLINE: Do You Have Good Manners?

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Student Opinion | Tell us how you'd define "good manners," and whether or not you think you have them. Is our society in general becoming less civil? 

 BODY:
In "A Last Bastion of Civility, the South, Sees Manners Decline," Kim Severson writes:
Since the Civil War, any decline in Southern civility has largely been blamed on those damn Yankees.
Newcomers still get much of the blame. In the past decade the South has seen an unprecedented influx of immigrants from both other states and other countries. The population in the south grew by 14.3 percent from 2000 to 2010, making it the fastest growing region in the country.
But there is more behind the social shift, scholars say. Digital communication and globalization have conspired to make many parts of the South less insular. Couple that with a political climate as contentious as anyone can remember and a wave of economic insecurity rolling across the region, and you've got a situation where saying "thank you, ma'am" isn't good enough anymore.
... Dana Mason, who teaches second grade in Birmingham, says manners have been at the lowest level she has seen in her 36 years in the classroom. Parents who move South tell her they don't want their children to learn to say "yes, sir" or "yes, ma'am." Too demeaning, they say.
But she and others point out that manners are on the slide everywhere. Mrs. Mason blames a faster pace of life and the demise of the home-cooked family meal.
Students: Tell us how you'd define "good manners." Is it knowing proper etiquette when you're in a restaurant? Saying "please" and "thank you"? Being kind and thoughtful of others? Do you think having good manners is important? How would you rate your own manners? Do you think our society in general is becoming less civil and more rude? Why or why not?

HEADLINE: Poster Boys

BYLINE: MARIA BUSTILLOS


HIGHLIGHT: The people behind the ubiquitous movie posters plastered on buses, buildings, and seemingly on the inside of your skull. 

 BODY:
Hollywood is full of weird little jobs. You see some of them on the credits at the end of the movie: Gaffer, Best Boy. In a lot of cases, the people in those mysterious-sounding occupations seem to get there by mistake, side-tracked en route to some other career. In fact, Los Angeles is chockablock with talented people who wound up in an entirely different profession from the one they'd originally started out in. I know painters who became art directors and set designers, a singer who started life as an actress and screenwriter. Two would-be novelists who both ended up film editors, though one of them eventually quit to become a yoga teacher. 
I've been through a number of incarnations myself; I was private secretary to a screenwriter, and then to a celebrity gynecologist. I co-founded a tchotchke business in the '80s, acting variously as designer, product developer, bookkeeper, general dogsbody, and, in frequent dashes to New York, marketer and party planner. In the '90s, I sold that business and rode the entrepreneurial roller coaster that was the Internet 1.0. After the first dot-com bubble burst, I revived the ambition of my youth and became a writer.
I've sometimes wondered whether the peripatetic career path common in Los Angeles might be partly responsible for the high quality of the entertainment produced here. This city is full of people who have been around the tree; they're skilled improvisers, quick studies, curious, game for anything. 
One of the best examples of this phenomenon I know is Richard Goldman. He writes taglines for a living, those evocative, compact phrases that appear on movie and TV posters. For example, from "Closer": "If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking." 
Richard, a wry East Coast transplant, is an old friend. Our kids went to school together. His first love was music; he's a talented songwriter who still performs at local clubs now and then. Back when I worked in design, he was writing game shows and TV scripts. On many a balmy evening, while the kids played Ping-Pong in the backyard, Richard would be springing ridiculous puns on us grown-ups over cocktails. The moment I learned he had a new gig copywriting I knew he'd be a perfect fit for it; his conversation consists primarily of bons mots to begin with. 
A movie is commonly associated with a single visual image for marketing purposes, and that image is called key art. It's what you see on DVD or CD cases, the sides of buildings and bus stops and seemingly on the inner walls of your own skull, for those few weeks before the film opens. An enormous amount of talent goes into making this image, and into writing the copy that goes with it.
This kind of copywriting is a whole job on its own; technically Richard is a "theatrical print copywriter," and a highly regarded one. He was nominated for a Key Art Award, the Oscar of the Hollywood print world, for that "Closer" line. 
I've always wanted to learn more about Richard's job, so we arranged to repair to Culver City one warm, breezy afternoon to have coffee and talk with his fellow copywriter, David Saltzman. The two became friends over a tag line. The subject was "Surf's Up," an animated movie featuring penguins; the client wanted the word "ocean" in the line. Both Richard and David came up independently with the line that would eventually appear on the poster: "A Major Ocean Picture." 
Many of these copywriters work at home, they told me. They sign all these nondisclosure agreements, and then they are given a script, or a TV show or movie to watch. Sometimes a courier delivers the DVD and then picks it up as soon as the copywriter is done watching. Then they go into the office or hop onto a conference call for a kickoff meeting. 
"The A.E., the account executive, is the person who is on the phone with the client, the studio marketing executive," David explained. "The A.E. tells us what we're doing, maybe explains a bit of the strategy, the creative direction. With TV especially, a big part of it is considering the brand, which is to say the channel. An ad for ABC Family is going to have a different tone from an ad for AMC or Bravo."
For one prominent cable network, Richard told me, you can have no more than three words in the tagline. "If you go four or five words, that's like a novel."
"One word would be preferable," David added. "Or no words."
The studio or TV network may have in-house staff working on the project, but it will also hire outside agencies to compete for the print work. If you win, part of the prize is financial. The other is "cachet, esteem," David said, "the thrill of seeing your work in public," on posters, billboards, buses. 
Key art has a strange significance, even to a civilian. You're living with these images the way you live with the songs on the radio; they form part of the texture of your daily life. Great key art can come to symbolize not just a movie but a time and place, a cultural mood: think of "Jaws," "Silence of the Lambs," "Gone With the Wind," "Titanic," "Pulp Fiction," "American Beauty," "West Side Story." Chances are you're picturing the poster image - the minnow-like swimmer above the shark's teeth, the scarlet rose against a bare, equally velvety stomach. 
Long after a movie opens and closes, the key art remains. Every time I've ever been in the office of a producer, director or actor, I've seen these images, lining a corridor or on a wall behind a desk. These people will have been two or three years making a project; it's been such a big part of their lives for so long. And then it goes away and it's not in their daily lives, and what is left is the poster. In this way, the image is like a trophy. 
Richard brought what's called "a copy exploration" to show me, from an early season of a popular cooking show. It's a long, long list of lines. David, who has been Richard's copy editor on and off for almost four years, began a critique.
"This is a perfect Richard line: 'America's Greatest Chefs: Haute and Heavy.' I would say probably too inside, probably a little too smart. Too clever." He moved down the list. "'There is Accounting For Taste.' See, Richard's very smart it's a great line, I like the line, I would submit the line they might not use the line." 
"I might not put it on the first page," Richard said. "Accounting is not a good word, it's a little lengthy." 
 David continued. "'The All-Stars Are Heating Up.' There's a sort of word-mining that I think we do, see, this is a cooking show. So you've got to get all your saute, mix, burn, heat, flame, gas. 'Now They Want the Whole Enchilada.'" We all laugh (and wince, a little bit) at that one. 
 "It's never not fun to read Richard's copy," David said.
I asked them, of all the lines they've written, which is their favorite. 
"Little Miss Sunshine," David said. "I wrote the line that ended up on the poster. It was, 'A Family on the Verge of a Breakdown.' I didn't know they were going to have the van on there, for the double meaning, I had written that line and it ended up being a nice part of the poster, it was very sweet and it had a good feel to it."
Richard's favorite was one he worked on with David for an ESPN documentary called "The Streak." It was about a wrestling team that had never lost a match; it had "the longest running winning streak in the history of high school sports." But "the tension was so unbelievable. If they lost they would be disgracing their grandparents. So my line was, 'The more you win the more you have to lose.'" 
I asked why that was his favorite.
"Because it's NOT clever." 
David and I both tell him well, yes, it is clever.
"No, it's truth! It's true."
"So truth trumps cleverness?"
"Absolutely."
The apparent shallowness and glitz of Hollywood are often mocked, but it has always seemed to me that there is a ton of intelligence and passion that goes into making every bit of a Hollywood movie or TV show. Not just careerist passion but true, artistic passion. "Sometimes you feel you are writing an aphorism. Something that will last forever," Richard told me. And I think that must be true. 
My own favorite Hollywood line is one from "The Matrix": "Reality is a thing of the past." I've always been a hopeless science fiction geek, and I stood in line for ages to be among the first to see this movie. Like all the best taglines, it is surprisingly subtle for such a brief, seemingly glib remark. I'm not even sure whether the writer intended the meaning I've always attributed to it, namely, that reality can only be created from the materials of the past. It's evocative of the changes in my own life, and in some ways, it's a very Los Angeles message - simultaneously suggestive of impermanence and nostalgia, uncertainty and hope.
Oh and by the way, Richard supplied the title for this piece. "You had to expect I would go there," he wrote. David and I chose it from a list that included:

HEADLINE: Concerns About Labor Dispute Prompt Increased Security at Sotheby's

BYLINE: RANDY KENNEDY


HIGHLIGHT: Sotheby's continuing contract dispute with its unionized art handlers - who have been locked out for three months and staging increasingly publicized demonstrations - has prompted it to institute much stricter security measures surrounding its fall auction of Impressionist and modern art on Wednesday night. 

 BODY:
With the world economy in such an uncertain state, Sotheby's fall auction of Impressionist and modern art Wednesday night was bound to be tense anyway. But the auction house's continuing contract dispute with its unionized art handlers - who have been locked out for three months and have been staging increasingly publicized demonstrations - recently prompted it to institute much stricter security measures surrounding the fall sale. 
The new precautions come after an incident in September in which members of the Occupy Wall Street movement, who have declared solidarity with the 43 locked-out art handlers, disrupted a sale by standing up and making statements condemning the auction house's dealings with the workers, who are represented by Teamsters Local 814. The handlers' contract expired in July and non-union workers have been performing their jobs since then.
The 10th-floor galleries of the auction house's Upper East Side building are normally open to the public in the days leading up to an auction. But Sotheby's has now restricted access to the art on display there to accredited members of the media and to Sotheby's account holders. Anyone else wanting to see the works must first become an account holder, which requires leaving a $5,000 refundable deposit, said Diana Phillips, a Sotheby's spokeswoman. "It is very unfortunate," Ms. Phillips added, "but protecting people and art must be our first priority and virtually everyone seems to understand."

HEADLINE: Climate Change and the Developing World

BYLINE: RACHEL NUWER


HIGHLIGHT: The United Nations Development Program says the progress of the poorest countries will be halted or even reversed if bold steps are not taken. 

 BODY:
The United Nations Development Program delivered some dire news Wednesday in its annual Human Development Report. By midcentury, it said, the development progress of the poorest countries will be halted or even reversed if bold steps are not taken to forestall the effects of climate change. 
"The poorest countries' really remarkable and often overlooked progress in recent decades now faces this calamity down the road," said William Orme, a spokesman for the agency. "If their progress is stopped because we developed countries didn't do things that we could have, it adds a huge moral imperative to take action sooner rather than later on climate change." 
The study tracks 187 countries and territories in the U.N.'s human development index, which is based on composite measurements of health, education and income, and has tracked global living standards since 1990. 
From 1970 to 2010, countries in the lowest 25 percent of the rankings improved their scores by a striking 82 percent, twice the global average. If this pace of improvement continues over the next 40 years, the report says, most of these countries would achieve standards equal to or better than those now enjoyed by the top 25 percent. 
But models of future scenarios cast doubt that this progress will come to pass.

Factoring in the effects of global warming on weather, food production and pollution, the index's average score drops 8 percent worldwide from what would otherwise be predicted (and it drops by 12 percent in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia). In the more adverse "disaster" scenario - which entails vast deforestation, dramatic biodiversity declines and increasing extreme weather - the global index falls by 15 percent, with the deepest losses felt in poor regions. 
Providing electricity to the 1.5 billion people - 45 percent of them in Africa - who currently live without it would be a step in the right direction, Mr. Orme says. Electricity means children can study at night, electric stoves can be used instead of pollution-emitting coal, and people can have access to a wider community through television or radio. "We can do this without increasing global CO2 by even 1 percent," he says. 
The agency proposes an international tax on foreign exchange trading to raise $40 billion toward that goal. And it says reducing carbon-dioxide emissions in developed nations - Denmark, for example, has pledged to cut emissions by 40 percent within the decade - can be achieved without lowering living conditions.
As for the United States, it ranked fourth over all in the development index. But when the rankings were adjusted for "internal inequalities," the United States fell to 23rd, from 13th last year, mainly because of inequalities in income and health care, the report says.

HEADLINE: College Majors Matter

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Alex Tabarrok argues that Americans should focus less on going to college and more on having the right college degree -- that is, a degree in a marketable field. And a smaller share of college grads are chooses majors employers want. 

 BODY:
We write a lot on Economix about whether college is worth it. In a piece in Investor's Business Daily, Alex Tabarrok, an economics professor at George Mason University, suggests that Americans are focusing on the wrong question. They shouldn't be debating whether college in general is "worth it"; they should instead be thinking about whether the specific college degree they're considering is marketable.
A smaller share of students are choosing majors that are in demand, he writes:
Over the past 25 years the total number of students in college has increased by about 50 percent. But the number of students graduating with degrees in science, technology, engineering and math (the so-called STEM fields) has been flat...
If students aren't studying science, technology, engineering and math, what are they studying? In 2009 the United States graduated 89,140 students in the visual and performing arts, more than in computer science, math and chemical engineering combined and more than double the number of visual and performing arts graduates in 1985.
Dr. Tabarrok notes STEM majors are more likely to find work and also to find high-paying work. Then he emphasizes that the choice of concentration not only matters for a worker's earnings but for the entire economy. His conclusion:
Economic growth is not a magic totem to which all else must bow, but it is one of the main reasons we subsidize higher education.
The potential wage gains for college graduates go to the graduates - that's reason enough for students to pursue a college education. We add subsidies to the mix, however, because we believe education has positive spillover benefits that flow to society. One of the biggest of these benefits is the increase in innovation that highly educated workers bring to the economy.
As a result, an argument can be made for subsidizing students in fields with potentially large spillovers, such as microbiology, chemical engineering, nuclear physics and computer science. There is little justification for subsidizing majors in the visual arts, psychology and journalism.
What do you think of this argument, readers? How would you measure the gains -- economic or otherwise -- that come from different college majors?

HEADLINE: Could 'Smart' Textiles Prove Toxic?

BYLINE: DYLAN WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: Researchers argue that solutions for safe disposal of electronic textiles, which carry harmful metals and rare earths, should be found now, when the field is young. 

 BODY:
The growing practice of weaving electronics into the fiber of clothing could add to the already monumental challenge of e-waste disposal. Some fifty million tons of electronic waste already accumulate annually in "soaring mountains" of refuse, the United Nations says.
As a Science Times article on wired textiles recently noted, electronic or "smart" textiles have electronics in the very weave of their fabric, enabling clothing to respond in various ways to the environment and to function as electronic devices, like mobile phones or heart-rate monitors.
With their social and commercial promise, e-textiles, also known as smart textiles, are the focus of intense laboratory development and testing. Few laboratories, however, have designed prototypes with an eye toward safe disposal once the products have reached the end of their life cycle.

A recent study published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology undertook the first analysis of the implications of e-textile manufacture on a large scale. "I wanted to conduct a basic disposal assessment," Andreas Kohler, the article's lead author, said in an interview. 
He said he wondered what would happen if electronic components that include copper, gold, silver and other rare earth metals ended up in the waste stream as part of textiles. 
Interviewing designers, engineers and policy makers about e-textile disposal, Mr. Kohler found that those involved in the field readily agreed to the importance of the question but were not looking for answers themselves. 
"Everybody says: 'Oh yes! That's interesting. We should think about that. But, you know, we're not responsible,'" he said.
I reached out to others by e-mail to pose the same question. Asked about approaches to e-textile recycling, John Volakis, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University who is designing a wearable antenna, said, "I have no idea, not my expertise at all." 
Asked about the potential recycling of AT&T's "bio-tracking clothes," a company spokeswoman, Dawn Benton, wrote, "At this point in time we don't have a comment or insight on this topic."
A mass consumer market for e-textiles without an integrated understanding of safe disposal methods raises serious questions about the depletion of resources and effects on human human health, Mr. Kohler suggests, especially for vulnerable populations in developing countries where such clothing is sent or dumped.
Many e-textiles use silver-coated yarn for its conductivity value. Because of the relative scarcity of silver, Mr. Kohler estimates that demand for an e-textile product on the mass market could eventually require 12 percent of the global silver supply. 
The metal's low concentration in e-textiles and the widespread dispersal of products among consumers could make recovery and recycling prohibitively expensive in Europe or the United States, raising the likelihood that e-textiles would join the broad stream of e-waste flowing to dump sites in developing countries.
While the economic incentive does not exist for developed countries to recover metals in low concentrations, the monetary returns prove worthwhile in many developing ones.
As a result, a profusion of informal e-waste salvage sites have sprung up where laborers, often children, burn electronic components to recover trace amounts of valuable metals. This process exposes workers to highly toxic fumes.
Often the workers use hazardous materials like acid and mercury to extract gold from discarded electronics.
Although exports of e-waste from the United States are illegal, some 50 to 80 percent of "recycled" electronics are in fact shipped from developed to developing countries, according to the Basel Action Network, a nongovernmental organization that works to prevent toxic trade.
In the six years that he has studied e-waste, Mr. Kohler said, the proliferation of personal electronic devices and their rapid rate of turnover have only abetted "a very nasty business."
The obsolescence of e-textiles may only accelerate as manufacturers and marketers respond to both rapid technological change and seasonal fashion.
Recent research from the United Nations University on so-called "backyard recycling" at a dump site in Agbogbloshie, Ghana,found potent lead and cadmium contamination in a nearby school and marketplace. Workers at the dump were as young as 6 years old.
Mr. Kohler argues that disposal solutions should be sought now, when e-textile development is in its early stages. That will require coordinated design and policy measures that focus on the product's end-of-life. 
One basic suggestion is designing e-textiles with as few toxic materials as possible and with ease of disassembly in mind. Currently, appropriate recycling technology does not exist. When e-textiles are sent to electronics recyclers, the fabrics jam shredders; when they are sent to fabric recyclers, the interwoven electronics contaminate fiber reprocessing.
Meanwhile, he warned, there is the impact overseas "The kids of Agbogbloshie won't run out of waste to burn," he said.

HEADLINE: Tenant Is Suing to Stay Off List of Tenants Who Get Sued

BYLINE: ELIZABETH A. HARRIS


HIGHLIGHT: A lawsuit filed on Monday challenges a list that circulates among landlords with the names of tenants who have been sued for eviction in housing court, whether the proceedings led to eviction or not. The names are collected and sold by the state court system. 

 BODY:
James Whelan has a little piece of every New York tenant's dream: a rent stabilized apartment. It's a quiet one-bedroom on the Upper East Side where he has lived for 17 years, and it costs him less than $1,500 a month.
But Mr. Whelan's landlord, a limited liability company, says that it needs the apartment for a relative of one of the principals, and it is trying to get him out. And if the landlord takes Mr. Whelan to court, Mr. Whelan may end up on a list of troublesome tenants who have been sued for eviction. Even if he wins the case.
So on Monday, Mr. Whelan pre-emptively filed a suit (see also below) in state court to keep his name off those tenant screening lists. If he wins, the practice of collecting and selling those names in New York may have to be halted entirely, his lawyer said. 
The New York State Office of Court Administration sells to private companies the names of everyone who is sued in housing court for eviction on the very day the case is put on the calendar. Those companies then compile the information and sell it to landlords looking to avoid difficult or irresponsible tenants.
But those screening lists do not make a distinction between renters who ultimately win their cases (perhaps they withheld rent because they had no heat) and those who lose (say, they bought some nice jewelry instead of paying their landlord what they owed).
Mr. Whelan's lawyer, James B. Fishman, says this practice has a chilling effect on tenants' rights, as some people opt to move out rather than face their landlord in court and risk being blacklisted for years. (Companies that curate these lists are supposed to purge names after seven years, but some are notoriously sloppy.)
"The only way that Mr. Whelan can challenge the good faith intentions of his landlord is to challenge a lawsuit," Mr. Fishman said. "But you don't ever reach the good faith issue until you're sued. It's a Catch-22."
On Monday, Justice Eileen A. Rakower of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan temporarily blocked the distribution of Mr. Whelan's information, pending the next court date in a few weeks.
The housing court calendar information is one of several kinds of data sold by the state court system, including city- and state-level civil court information. The names of tenants sued by landlords are contained in a "data dump" of all housing court information that sells for $20,000 for the first download and $350 for weekly updates.
"There's a lot of public information out there that when people want it in this form, there's a fee to cover costs," said David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the state Office of Court Administration. Mr. Bookstaver said he could not comment on Mr. Whelan's suit because it is pending litigation.
Joseph Strasburg, the president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a trade group representing landlords, said that it might make sense to modify the tenant data that is sold so that it notes whether the tenant won the case.
"I don't have a problem with providing more information as to the disposition of a case," Mr. Strasburg said. "I do have a problem with precluding using it as a tool."
He said that the tenant data was important in helping landlords avoid what he called "professional tenants" - those who immediately stop paying rent after they move in and just wait to be evicted, a process that takes months.
If Mr. Whelan's landlord does take him to court, Mr. Fishman said, it may find the case quickly dismissed because private companies cannot reclaim a stabilized apartment for family members the way an individual can. But just being sued is enough to make the future difficult.
"They'll put me on a blacklist," said Mr. Whelan, 52, a limousine driver who has worked as a real estate broker. "If you're renting an apartment, they check that out. And if you've been to housing court, you're not going to get the apartment."
His lawyer, Mr. Fishman, said: "The state gives tenants lots of rights, but then the state participates in a process that takes away all those rights. If you can't assert those rights, you might as well not have them."

HEADLINE: Wall St. Protest Is Hurting Area's Families, Bloomberg Says

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: The mayor said he had become more concerned about the effects of the encampment in Zuccotti Park on residential and commercial life in Lower Manhattan. 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has defended the free speech rights of Occupy Wall Street protesters while objecting to their message, said on Wednesday that he had become more concerned about how the Occupy Wall Street encampment in Zuccotti Park was affecting residential and commercial life in Lower Manhattan.
"You know, I think increasingly you're seeing that the community, businesses and residents in Lower Manhattan feel that they are the ones that are being occupied," the mayor told reporters at an event in Central Park promoting the New York City Marathon.
"This isn't an occupation of Wall Street,'' he said. "It's an occupation of a growing, vibrant residential neighborhood in Lower Manhattan, and it's really hurting small businesses and families." 
While saying the city had worked hard to protect the protesters' First Amendment rights, the mayor continued, "Other people have rights, too, and I am very concerned about the other people's rights as well as those of the protesters."
He added, "We are constantly monitoring the situation to preserve public safety and to guarantee the rights of all people in this city, and no one should think that we won't take actions that we think are appropriate when we think they are appropriate."
The mayor was responding to a letter sent to him earlier this week by four elected officials who represent Lower Manhattan: Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly; Daniel L. Squadron, a state senator; Jerrold Nadler, a congressman; and Margaret Chin, a city councilwoman. The officials expressed sympathy with the message of Occupy Wall Street, but said that the protests had created "serious quality-of-life concerns" for residents of the area. They asked that the city enforce laws prohibiting excessive noise and public urination, and also remove what they described as excessive police barricades that impede movement through the area.

HEADLINE: A Look at How Brooklyn Nannies Are Paid

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The group Park Slope Parents released its third annual Nanny Compensation Survey on Wednesday, gathering responses from more than 1,000 Brooklyn families. 

 BODY:
The going rate for nannies in brownstone Brooklyn in 2011: $15 an hour.
The percentage of nannies' employers answering a survey who said they paid completely on the books: 15 percent.
Percentage who say they pay their nannies overtime: 27 percent (notwithstanding New York's new Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights).
Percentage who are "not O.K." with the nanny napping while the child naps: 31 percent.
These findings and many more are in the Park Slope Parents
 third annual Nanny Compensation Survey, released on Wednesday and available for inspection in its 68-slide PowerPoint glory online. 
The survey compiled responses by more than 1,000 Brooklyn families (44 percent of them in Park Slope and the rest scattered across the western half of Brooklyn). It is hard to compare this year's answers with previous years', as some categories have changed and the older surveys included parents from Manhattan, so here are a few more statistical tidbits from this year's survey:

        
Average number of paid vacation days: 11
        
Fiftieth-percentile hourly salary for all nannies, as well as for those caring for one child: $15
        
For nannies caring for two children: $15.59
        
Caring for three children: $16.72
        
Nannies working for a year or more who have been given a raise: 64 percent.
        
Employers "O.K." with their nanny using her cellphone as much as she wants while watching the children: 29 percent
        
Households with an "open kitchen" policy for their nannies: 86 percent
        
Employers who paid their nannies completely off the books: 63 percent (The rest either paid partly on the books, completely on the books or did not answer.)
 In the 2010 survey, 58 percent of respondents who paid off the books said they did so at the nanny's request. By law, people who pay a domestic worker more than $1,700 a year are required to pay employment taxes that amount to about 10 percent of the worker's salary. The nanny, too, is legally required to report her wages and pay tax on them.
"The situation is complex," Park Slope Parents' founder, Susan Fox, said in a release. "Paying on the books is more costly and more complicated than paying off the books. On top of that, many nannies are not legally able to work on the books. However, the best thing to do for all parties is to pay your nanny on the books (and it's the law)."
Park Slope Parents has not yet conducted a survey of nannies themselves, but they are working on one, Ms. Fox said. The survey is slated to go out early next year.

HEADLINE: Och-Ziff Profit Falls 4% on Market Turbulence

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: Distributable earnings at Och-Ziff Capital Management, the hedge fund firm run by Daniel S. Och, dropped to $49.9 million in the third quarter. 

 BODY:
Och-Ziff Capital Management, the hedge fund firm run by Daniel S. Och, reported on Wednesday that profit fell 4 percent in the third quarter as a result of market turbulence and higher expenses.
Profit dropped to $49.9 million, or 12 cents a share, from $52.1 million, or 13 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The results failed to meet analysts' forecasts of nearly 16 cents a share, according to Bloomberg data. The firm reports profit as distributable earnings, which excludes the charges related to its initial public offering. 
On the basis of generally accepted accounting principles, however, the company lost $93 million, or almost a dollar a share, a slight improvement from a $93.5 million loss in the period a year earlier.
 "During the third quarter of 2011, the global financial markets experienced significant turbulence in response to the European sovereign debt crisis and weaker macroeconomic conditions," Mr. Och, the chief executive, said in a statement. "Against this backdrop, we protected investor capital through our consistent and disciplined investment and risk management processes." 
One of the few publicly traded hedge funds in the United States, Och-Ziff has gotten hit by market turmoil like other money managers. The firm reported $28.5 billion in assets under management at the end quarter. Although that was a 3 percent increase from a year earlier, it was less than the $29.3 billion reported in July.
Performance has been mixed. While a number of hedge funds have seen returns drop, Och-Ziff, founded 15 years ago, is roughly flat in its main fund through October. The firm's Europe-focused fund did not fare as well, falling 3.3 percent through October. The Asia fund was off about 1.4 percent. An opportunistic fund, the firm's smallest portfolio, had a gain of about 3.1 percent.
"Institutional investors continue to demonstrate a high level of interest in alternative strategies, although their decision processes are affected by both market conditions and longer internal decision making processes," Mr. Och said. "However, we are of the view that now, more than ever, investors will actively seek access to absolute strategies and investment managers that have consistently protected capital."

HEADLINE: Strike at US Foods Takes Aim at Private Equity

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A small strike at a plant in Illinois has spread to other cities in recent days, threatening to disrupt business at the food distribution company owned by K.K.R. and Clayton, Dubilier &#038; Rice. 

 BODY:
7:00 p.m. | Updated 
The relationship between labor unions and private equity, which has always been chilly, has just gotten more so. 
A small strike that began on Sunday at a US Foods plant in Streator, Ill., has spread to other cities in recent days, causing disruptions at the food distribution giant, which is owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.
A pair of sanitation workers in Streator affiliated with the Teamsters union went on strike after the company refused to bargain in good faith, the union said. On Monday morning, drivers and warehouse employees at the plant, which employs about 100 workers, elected not to cross a picket line at US Foods, but they later went back to work in the afternoon. 
"We believe the illegal conduct of US Foods in Streator is part of a broader war the company is waging against its workers," the Teamsters said in a statement posted on a Web site that was created expressly for the dispute. 
"After its purchase by private equity investment firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, U.S. Foods began a systematic campaign of harassment and intimidation against both its union and nonunion workers," the statement said.
In May 2007, at the zenith of the leveraged buyout boom, K.K.R. and Clayton, Dubilier acquired U.S. Foodservice from the Dutch food giant Ahold for $7.1 billion. The company, which is based in Rosemont, Ill., and employs about 25,000, recently rebranded itself as US Foods. 
Representatives for K.K.R. and Clayton, Dubilier declined to comment. 
Christina Koliopoulos, a spokeswoman for US Foods, defended the company's conduct and said she was confident it would reach a contract with the sanitation workers. She said in a statement that the company was pro-employee and was bargaining in good faith. 
"Like many towns across America, Streator has been hit hard by the recession," Ms. Koliopoulos said. 
"Business revenues are down and unemployment is up," she added. "US Foods has been part of the Streator community for 81 years, providing 300 well-paid, stable jobs. Like any responsible company, we have an obligation to make smart business decisions for our employees, customers and community."
Meanwhile, roving picketers have spread to US Foods facilities in Buffalo and Indianapolis in recent days. And on Wednesday, striking workers showed up at the US Foods plant in Minneapolis that employs about 300, causing work interruptions. 
"The overwhelming majority of the plant has supported the picket line and the warehouse is shut down," said Brian Rademacher, the recording secretary of Teamsters Local 120 in Minneapolis. 
Ms. Koliopoulos disputed that, saying the Minneapolis plant did not shut down and that there had been minimal disruptions. 
In rallying its members around the striking workers, the Teamsters have taken direct aim at K.K.R. and Clayton, Dubilier. On the Web site set up for the strike -- www.usfoodsworkers.org -- they listed what they described as the owners' hostility toward its employees, including the closure this year of a Boston factory that employed 114 union workers. 
A Twitter feed -- @usfoodsworkers -- is giving updates on the progress of the picketers. 
"This #USFoods strike is about illegal practices, 2 20+yr employees vs a $20 billion dollar company, 99% vs 1%," read one post. 
"@USFoods is a different company since KKR and CD&R took over. They'll stoop to anything #privateequity," read another. 
Unions and private equity have a long history of troubled relations. Several years ago, the Service Employees International Union staged a battle with the Carlyle Group over the private equity firm's buyout of Manor Care. Yet there have been relatively few labor strikes pitting unions against private equity firms. 
In 2009, there was a prominent labor dispute involving workers at a biscuit factory in New York for Stella D'oro, which was owned by the buyout shop Brynwood Partners. 
And last year, Hugo Boss reversed a decision to close a factory in Ohio after succumbing to an aggressive union-led campaign against the German fashion house and Permira, its private equity owner. 
On Wednesday, Steve Mongan, president of Teamsters Local 772 in Streator, issued a statement about the US Foods strike. 
"The workers at US Foods care about this company and its customers," Mr. Mongan said. "They don't want to strike, but like the rest of the 99 percent in America, they are tired of being disrespected and having their rights under federal labor law violated while the private equity firms in the top 1 percent destroy their livelihood."
Ms. Koliopoulos, the US Foods spokeswoman, said the company was "disappointed the Teamsters have chosen a course that attempts to undermine our efforts to serve customers, grow the company and create jobs."

HEADLINE: Opinion Report: Debris, Drugs and Debt

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A summary of what's on today's editorial page. 

 BODY:
Debris from Japan's Tsunami is looping around the northern Pacific and could make its first landfall this winter in Midway Island. It's expected to hit Hawaii in 2012, and the West Coast in 2013.
Federal prisoners can sue for money damages from prison employees who abuse their constitutional rights. The Supreme Court should allow prisoners in privately-operated facilities to do the same.
Jon S. Corzine's risky investments into euro-zone debt have plunged MF Global Holdings into bankruptcy court. This raises the question, are the Fed, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators fully monitoring the risks at other broken dealers?
Vital drugs are in short supply, disrupting patient care and driving up the cost of treatment. Congress must do more to address this problem. It must past long-stalled legislation requiring (not just asking) all manufacturers to give six month advance notice of potential shortages, punishable by civil fines for noncompliance.
The Washington Post, The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal all address Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou's pledge to hold a referendum on the latest EU-IMF bailout package.
The FT says the "referendum is a mistake" since "in a democracy, policy questions are best decided by elected representatives."
The Post also considers Mr. Papandreou's proposal a "terrible blunder," and says it will undermine all the other European governments.
But The Journal suggests an alternative view: That Mr. Papandreou has done "all Europeans a considerable favor." If the Greeks vote Yes, Mr. Papandreou's "hand will be strengthened." If they vote No and trigger a default, that will "provide a lesson in what happens to countries that can't live within their means."

HEADLINE: The G-20 Blues

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The best we can hope for the G-20 summit this week is that it won't make a terrible situation worse. 

 BODY:
There was a time - wasn't there? - when meetings like this Thursday's summit of the countries known as the G-20 might have generated talk about the world's biggest economies getting together to come up with bold ideas. There was even a notion that the richest might find ways to help the poorest prosper.
Now, the richer countries piously deliver lectures about "living within your means," rather conveniently ignoring that the banks made piles of money off the spending binges of the last few decades. And they demand that struggling countries impose austerity measures that will make the struggling go on pretty much indefinitely. About the best we can hope for is that the G-20 won't do anything to make a terrible situation worse.
Let's dwell on that terrible situation for a moment, starting with Greece. I asked David Unger, who writes for the editorial board about the European crisis, whether it was a good idea for Greek President George Papandreou to call a referendum on the new bailout deal. We don't like referendums, since they are undemocratic - complicated issues, subjected to election-day demagoguery, voted on by a minuscule slice of the public.
David said Mr. Papandreou didn't really have a choice. If he hadn't called a national vote, his government would have fallen, and the rightist opposition party, which thinks Greece can just ignore its crisis state, would have taken over. Actually, his government might fall even with the referendum, but that's the fun of a parliamentary system.
The Greeks got themselves into this, in large measure, by failing to reform a system that allowed the infinite expansion of public payrolls to reward political allies. The rest of Europe was right to demand reforms. But Europe has been dead wrong to demand that Greece impose steep new taxes and deep social spending cuts guaranteed to prolong and worsen an already severe recession. That will make it impossible for Greece to earn its way out of debt.
By the way, this is not an argument against raising taxes generally. Tax increases are needed in the United States to avoid another painful recession. But the taxes that Europeans are demanding for Greece are just too high - unlike what President Obama has proposed. And the spending cuts are too deep - just like the what the Republicans are proposing.
Moving onto more depressing news: An OECD report concludes that the rich nations - like ours, Canada, Australia, Korea, Britain, France, Germany - will grow by a measly 1.5 percent his year and next. Unemployment may start rising again, reaching 8.2 percent in 2012.
Eduardo Porter, our expert on the global economy, says those projections are actually a bit too rosy. They presume there will be no adverse "event" that would make things worse. Like, oh, say, draconian cuts to the U.S. budget. Or a Greek default.
Getting back to the G-20 summit, what should they do this week? Eduardo says the big countries should agree to an international system to take over big banks that are going bust, which would be good since banks don't see international borders anymore. That might actually happen, but it won't be enough.
The summit's members should also stop pulling in their own directions. The Japanese, for example, ought to stop unilaterally dumping yen. The big surplus countries, like China and Germany, should spend more and stimulate demand. China ought to agree to faster currency appreciation.
It's more likely, however, that China and the United States will argue over currency and monetary policy, like they did last year. And the Europeans, once again, won't agree to save themselves.
At least the people who attend the summit will have to sit face to face, and maybe make a little eye contact. That's something, isn't it?

HEADLINE: Nov. 2, 1976 | Carter Defeats Ford in Presidential Election

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On Nov. 2, 1976, Jimmy Carter defeated the Republican incumbent Gerald R. Ford, becoming the first United States president from the Deep South since the Civil War. 

 BODY:
On Nov. 2, 1976, Jimmy Carter defeated the Republican incumbent Gerald R. Ford, becoming the first United States president from the Deep South since the Civil War.
Mr. Carter, a Democrat and former Georgia governor who had served just one term, and a peanut farmer from a small town, was an unlikely candidate. The Nov. 3 New York Times reported that his aspiration to become president was initially "dismissed as an absurdity by the elders of his party."
He began "as a lonely campaigner, short on money, staff and national recognition. But he was relentless in his early effort, meeting voters in two's and three's, and it slowly began to pay off" and he won a surprise victory in the primaries.

Mr. Ford was the only president never to be elected president or vice president by the Electoral College. While serving as House minority leader, he was appointed vice president after Spiro Agnew's resignation. Mr. Ford then became president after President Richard M. Nixon's resignation. According to The Times coverage of the 1976 presidential election, President Ford "lacked the strong hold on voters' emotions that most incumbents have." In fact, he nearly lost the Republican nomination to Gov. Ronald Reagan of California.
Mr. Carter's image of a Washington outsider appealed to Americans disillusioned with the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal. However, he made several missteps during the general election, including an interview with magazine in which he admitted to having committed "adultery in my heart." Mr. Ford also committed campaign gaffes, particularly when he said that the Soviet Union did not have dominance over Eastern Europe.
The election was close. Mr. Carter swept the South and won narrow victories in northern states like New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio, enough to give him 297 electoral votes to Ford's 240.
Many characterize Mr. Carter's presidency as mostly unsuccessful. The overview on the Times Topic page about Mr. Carter explains: "Lack of Washington connections helped his candidacy but not his presidency, as Congress ignored Mr. Carter's pleas for tax reform and a long-range energy policy. When oil prices doubled, most Americans blamed Mr. Carter for runaway inflation; this, combined with the Iran hostage crisis, led to his landslide defeat in the 1980 election" (to Mr. Reagan).
Connect to Today:
Although his term of office may have been relegated to the "dark dungeon of presidential history," Jimmy Carter has devoted his post-presidency life to working for humanitarian causes and taken part in conflict resolution around the world. In 2002, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for "his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development."

HEADLINE: Nobel Winner Joins Hedge Fund

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: Thomas J. Sargent of New York University, this year's co-recipient of the Nobel in economic science, has signed on as a consultant for Hutchin Hill, a multistrategy hedge fund with $1.5 billion in assets under management. 

 BODY:
Hedge funds have a reputation for attracting the best and brightest on Wall Street, but the industry has a knack for pulling heavyweights from academia, too.
The latest is Thomas J. Sargent of New York University, this year's co-recipient of the Nobel in economic science, who recently signed on as a consultant for Hutchin Hill, a multistrategy hedge fund with $1.5 billion in assets under management. 
"We believe working with Professor Sargent will be of significant value in developing a deeper understanding of the macroeconomic background that has had such a large impact on risk sentiment and asset prices, especially during the past three years," the firm wrote in its September letter to investors.
 He joins a long line of economists who have plunged into the hedge fund industry. The list includes a former presidential chief economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, who consulted for D.E. Shaw, and another Nobel winner, Myron Scholes, an economist who was present during the blow-up at Long-Term Capital Management. Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, is a board member at Paulson & Company.
Mr. Sargent is credited with changing the field of macroeconomics. Much of his research focused on the relationship between economic policy and macroeconomic variables like gross domestic product or employment, specifically how people and institutions change their expectations in response to policy changes. He developed quantitative methods to evaluate the effect of these policy prescriptions on households and firms.
While some of that research is pretty lofty, the rationale for hiring someone like Mr. Sargent is simple -- that he can help the hedge fund figure out the effect of policy changes on people's thinking, a critical element when judging how an economy will fare.
"At Hutchin Hill, we find tremendous edge in understanding the impact of fiscal and monetary policy alternatives on global growth, risk appetite and asset prices," the letter said. "This understanding has informed our major decisions in capital allocation and risk management over the life of the fund."
Hutchin Hill operates a number of strategies, but its founder, Neil A. Chriss, is most well-known as a "quant," or mathematician capable of writing complex computer algorithms that execute trades electronically. He worked at Morgan Stanley in its institutional equities division before joining Goldman Sachs in its quantitative strategies group, a quant fund that helped launch the career of a number of famous hedge fund managers, including Clifford S. Asness of AQR Capital Management.
Eventually, Mr. Chriss joined SAC Capital Management, the hedge fund giant founded by Steven A. Cohen, to help start its quantitative trading strategy. In 2007, he left the firm, and a short while later he founded Hutchin Hill.
In 2008, Hutchin Hill returned about 13 percent, a significant achievement in the broader market chaos. In 2009, a banner year for hedge funds, it had a relatively modest 17.16 percent return. Last year, the firm earned 6.9 percent, and this year it is down about 0.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Many Alarms Rang Before MF Global Crashed

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG, BEN PROTESS and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Regulators issued warnings for more than four months, telling MF Global that it needed to raise more capital. But the firm's chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, is said to have resisted. 

 BODY:
A little before 2 a.m. on Monday, Jon S. Corzine was in MF Global's offices in Midtown Manhattan, scrambling to cut a deal to save his firm. Haggard from too little sleep, at times pacing the hallways, he at least had a handshake agreement with one suitor for the firm.
Then the chief executive was interrupted to handle a brief conversation that would stop the deal talks cold: hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds, he was told, could not be located.
 Three hours later, the board of MF Global, with no bidders or options left, voted to file for bankruptcy, the largest failure on Wall Street since Lehman Brothers in 2008.
While the commodities and derivatives brokerage firm fell apart with ferocious speed, the collapse came after regulators raised warning flags for more than four months. They told MF Global it needed to raise more capital, and they asked about risky transactions involving European debt.
Yet Mr. Corzine resisted, lobbying to persuade regulators that the firm did not need to raise capital, according to people briefed on the discussions. MF Global did improve its capital position, but it was not enough to save the firm.
The details that have emerged about MF Global's final 72 hours - drawn from dozens of interviews with people who participated in the weekend discussions or were directly briefed by people who did - illustrate that three years after the financial crisis, Wall Street executives are still fighting regulators' demands.
It also shows that even when the watchdogs sound the alarm, it is not necessarily enough to save a firm. Now, multiple regulators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are examining the firm's collapse, trying to determine what went wrong and where the missing money, now suspected to be roughly $630 million, went.
The CME Group, a major exchange where MF Global traded until this week, said on Wednesday that Mr. Corzine's firm had appeared to transfer client money sometime last week "in a manner that may have been designed to avoid detection," a serious violation of Wall Street regulations. MF Global did not disclose the shortfall in client money to CME or to regulators until early Monday morning, shortly before the firm filed for bankruptcy.
A person close to the company said it was not aware of any audit by the CME Group. Neither Mr. Corzine nor MF Global have been accused of any wrongdoing.
One of the first signs of trouble for MF Global came in June, when regulators reviewed its recent financial statements, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. In a footnote, MF Global disclosed that it had bought debt from Italy, Ireland and other troubled European nations.
The disclosure alarmed the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-regulator, which worried that MF Global lacked enough capital to support the trades.
Finra called MF Global, pushing it to raise its capital levels, but Mr. Corzine fought back, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Frustrated, Mr. Corzine decided to go over Finra's head to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the person said. In July, Mr. Corzine traveled to Washington to state his case to S.E.C. officials at their offices near Union Station in Washington. Mr. Corzine chalked up their concerns to undue jitters over Europe's ballooning debt crisis, the person said. The S.E.C. and Finra wouldn't bend, and in August, the firm increased its capital cushion.
MF Global declined to comment; Mr. Corzine did not respond to a request for comment.
The move offered only short-term relief. By mid-October, MF Global's European gamble was being widely discussed on a nervous Wall Street. Rumors spread that Moody's Investors Service was considering a cut to MF Global's credit rating. Finra resumed regular talks with the firm, questioning whether anxious customers, investors and trading partners would drain the firm's liquidity.
Late on Oct. 24, Moody's did move to cut its rating on the firm, to just one notch above junk status, citing in part the European bond holdings.
That proved to be a watershed moment: the downgrade led MF Global's trading partners to demand extra collateral, draining the firm's cash supply. 
Under mounting pressure from Washington and Wall Street, MF Global moved up its scheduled quarterly earnings announcement by two days, reporting on Oct. 25 that it had recorded a $186 million loss, its fourth loss in six quarters. The share price of MF Global went into free fall, tumbling 67 percent over the course of that week. The firm also started drawing on its credit lines.
Mr. Corzine quickly hired the investment bank Evercore Partners to help him find a buyer for part or of all of the firm. MF Global also contacted BlackRock, the giant asset manager, to help it wind down its balance sheet - including efforts to sell its holdings of European debt. Eventually, MF Global brought bankruptcy lawyers on board to prepare for the worst.
Mr. Corzine had other fires to put out.
Last Thursday, regulators from several agencies arrived at MF Global's offices in New York and Chicago. What they saw over the course of the next few days troubled them, according to people knowledgeable about the matter who spoke only on condition of anonymity. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, led by Gary Gensler, became concerned that MF Global had not kept customer money separate from company funds, a fundamental rule on Wall Street.
MF Global assured regulators at the time that the money was in order, these people say.
On Saturday, Mr. Gensler reached out to H. Rodgin Cohen, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell who has long served as Wall Street's go-to lawyer in a crisis. During the tumultuous days of 2008, Mr. Cohen advised a number of embattled Wall Street executives, including Richard S. Fuld Jr. of Lehman Brothers. He now found himself counseling Mr. Corzine.
"We need more documents," Mr. Gensler told the lawyer, according to people briefed on the conversation. The call set off a scramble at MF Global as employees tried to locate the documents regulators were demanding.
Other issues about the quality of the firm's bookkeeping were being spotted by employees from BlackRock, who had arrived to value the MF Global portfolio, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Yet even as questions about MF Global's records were beginning to surface, talks on a possible sale were getting under way. Two main bidders quickly emerged - the Interactive Brokers Group and Jefferies Group. Jefferies, a brokerage house based in New York, has a futures trading business and the idea of expanding it is said to have appealed to its chief executive, Richard Handler. A small team of Jefferies executives arrived at MF Global on Friday and were escorted into a windowless conference room. The executives returned the next day as well.
They sorted through stacks of information about MF Global's operations. While they didn't notice anything out of order with MF Global's books, they left that Saturday without making a bid. Jefferies, a person with knowledge of the matter said, concluded it simply needed more time to complete such a complicated acquisition - time MF Global didn't have.
That left Interactive Brokers. The Connecticut brokerage firm was also huddled in a separate windowless conference room not far from where the Jefferies team was holed up. 
Mr. Corzine, who ran Goldman Sachs in the 1990s before serving as a Democratic senator from New Jersey and then New Jersey governor, was the lead negotiator for MF Global. One person who saw him Saturday said he looked "pained" at the events unfolding around him.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday, Mr. Corzine and an Evercore banker, Jane Gladstone, were able to call regulators and brief them on the sale talks. They sounded optimistic, saying that they were confident a deal would get done.
That hope grew into the evening,
As Interactive Brokers continued its dive into MF Global's books, signs of exhaustion among the participants grew. J. Christopher Flowers, the MF Global investor and former Goldman executive, was spotted at the talks on Sunday wearing mismatched shoes.
Just before 1:45 a.m., Mr. Corzine received the information telling him that customer funds were missing. That alarmed Interactive Brokers, and the firm walked away from the bargaining table.
An MF Global executive then notified the regulators, who were still camped in the firm's Manhattan offices. Commodity Futures Trading Commission officials called Mr. Gensler, waking him around 2:30 a.m. to join a conference call with MF Global and other regulators.
MF Global executives could not stay on the phone for long - they needed to convene the board and prepare for a bankruptcy filing.
But the phone line remained open for several hours, as regulators discussed how to handle the first major financial failure of the postcrisis era.

HEADLINE: Will Bernanke Take Aim at G.D.P.?

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: At the chairman's news conference after a Fed policy report today, the idea of setting targets for growth -- not just inflation -- is a likely topic. 

 BODY:
It's a safe bet that the hottest topic in monetary policy is going to be raised when the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, takes questions from reporters Wednesday afternoon.
That would be nominal G.D.P. targeting, a concept lately endorsed elsewhere on this very Web site by the liberal economists Christina Romer and Paul Krugman (separately, and with very different degrees of enthusiasm) and long embraced by a diverse group of other economic thinkers.
It's actually a pretty simple idea. The Fed has developed a policy of seeking to maintain inflation -- the growth of prices and wages -- at an annual rate of roughly 2 percent as the best way to meet its legal objectives of maintaining stable prices and maximizing employment. Proponents of G.D.P. targeting argue that the central bank instead should seek to maintain a steady rate of increase in the dollar value of the nation's economic output, the nominal gross domestic product, an alternative measure that combines the rate of inflation and the rate of economic growth.
The Fed's current policy, they argue, has failed to stimulate growth sufficiently, leaving more than 25 million Americans unable to find full-time work. A G.D.P. target, by contrast, would require the Fed to take more aggressive steps, like another round of asset purchases.

"It would work like this," wrote Ms. Romer, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who was chairwoman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. "The Fed would start from some normal year - like 2007 - and say that nominal G.D.P. should have grown at 4 1/2 percent annually since then, and should keep growing at that pace. Because of the recession and the unusually low inflation in 2009 and 2010, nominal G.D.P. today is about 10 percent below that path. Adopting nominal G.D.P. targeting commits the Fed to eliminating this gap."
As I wrote in Monday's paper, this idea has garnered little apparent support inside the Fed.
One fundamental reason is that Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials believe that the current system is working pretty well. Not well enough to heal the economy, of course, but in their view that is beyond the Fed's power.
"My guess is that the current framework for monetary policy -- with innovations, no doubt, to further improve the ability of central banks to communicate with the public -- will remain the standard approach, as its benefits in terms of macroeconomic stabilization have been demonstrated," Mr. Bernanke told a Boston audience in October.
The focus of that policy, which Mr. Bernanke described as "flexible inflation targeting," is the Fed's commitment to maintain inflation at about 2 percent a year. The Fed views the public belief that it will do so as perhaps its most valuable asset because it creates a stable environment for sustainable economic growth.
A switch to G.D.P. targeting would amount to a declaration of comfort with higher levels of inflation.
Many proponents regard this as the basic point of the proposal, arguing that the Fed has become overly fixated on the rate of inflation when it should be focused on the health of the economy, and that allowing -- indeed, encouraging -- a higher rate of inflation in the short term would help to stimulate growth.
Calling for a G.D.P. target rather than simply proposing an increase in the Fed's inflation target, as some other economists have done, amounts in this sense to a marketing device, a piece of packaging.
"As far as I can see, the underlying economics is about expected inflation," Mr. Krugman wrote in a mid-October blog post, "but stating the goal in terms of nominal G.D.P. may nonetheless be a good idea, largely as a selling point, since it (a) is easier to make the case that we've fallen far below where we should be and (b) doesn't sound so scary and antisocial."
So far, that sales pitch has failed to budge the Fed.

HIGHLIGHT: A survey of mostly junk opinion polls. 

 BODY:
Americans must be the most polled people in the world. Every morning's news brings at least half a dozen headlines purporting to tell me how the public feels about their government, or other people's governments, or maybe other people's pets. My favorites, for sheer entertainment, are the ones that present completely hypothetical situations.
What if a generic GOP nominee were to pick Senator Marco Rubio as his running mate? Well then, according to a Suffolk University/WSVN-TV poll of 800 registered Florida voters, 46 percent of Floridians would vote Republican, while only 41 percent would vote for the Democrats. (The margin of error of the poll did not account for whether these voters would actually be able to read, understand and correctly fill out their ballots.)
But what if President Obama dumped Vice President Biden and put Hillary Clinton on the ticket? That would change everything! In that case, 46 percent said they'd vote Obama-Clinton, and 43 percent for Generic-Rubio. This tells us nothing. Sorry, it may tell us something: Who would carry Florida in the fantasy Generic-Rubio versus Obama-Clinton election that will never happen.
Another recent supposed opinion survey, conducted by Rasmussen Reports, claims that 79 percent of Americans see political correctness as a serious problem. Not having a job, or health care, is a serious problem. Political correctness is, at most, a minor problem. Inserting loaded questions into surveys probably falls somewhere between a minor and a serious problem. Questions like: "Some people think that government officials too often override the facts and common sense in the name of political correctness. Is political correctness a problem in America today?"
Polls about perceptions can be instructive, if they're scientifically valid. A new Gallup survey finds that most Americans believe crime is getting worse, with 68 percent saying there is more crime than there was a year ago. They happen to be wrong. Violent crime rates dropped 40 percent from 2001 to 2010. Property crime fell 28 percent in the same period. This tells us that facts and public perception are not always in line.
On the other hand, one last poll I came across today seems to indicate that the people of Texas, at least, are thinking clearly. The University of Texas and the Texas Tribune found that 65 percent of those surveyed attribute Texas' economic success to natural resources and the lack of an income tax, not to Governor Rick Perry's leadership. Also, 27 percent say Mr. Perry's national campaign is hurting Texas' image outside the state.

HEADLINE: 3 Prospective 2013 Candidates Find a Stage

BYLINE: DAVID W. CHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Three men who are believed to want to succeed Michael R. Bloomberg as mayor get a chance to test out some of their would-be campaign arguments. 

 BODY:
Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, stressed the need to improve education and infrastructure while he criticized the Bloomberg administration's stop-and-frisk policing tactics and poor understanding, as he put it, of Albany.
Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, praised Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's handling of the New York City budget, but blasted his economic and housing policies as ineffective and rooted in "another time."
And while William C. Thompson Jr., the former city comptroller, did not say much directly about Mr. Bloomberg, he argued that the city was facing an affordability crisis, and that "people are again scared to come out of their homes" because of growing crime concerns.
Officially, the three men were simply addressing the topic "The Future of New York City" on a Wednesday morning panel hosted by a law firm, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. But the event drew a packed crowd in part because it offered a possible preview of the 2013 mayoral campaign, in which all three men are expected to be among the candidates in a wide-open Democratic primary. Not in attendance Wednesday were three other possible contenders: John C. Liu, the current comptroller; Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker; and Tom Allon, a newspaper publisher.
Inevitably, much of the hourlong conversation turned into a discussion of how each man viewed Mr. Bloomberg, who was first elected in 2001. 
Mr. Thompson, who once led the Board of Education and in 2009 lost a race for mayor against Mr. Bloomberg, warned that the city's economy was so precarious that "the next two years are the two years that will determine who stays in New York." He also said the city's schools were too focused on testing, and needed to put more emphasis on comprehension and critical thinking.
Mr. de Blasio said that while Mr. Bloomberg had done some good things, he had also made some "big mistakes." Mr. de Blasio talked mostly about jobs and contended that the mayor had lost an opportunity, for instance, to create more jobs with the Taxi of Tomorrow competition.
Mr. Stringer, meanwhile, said "every rooftop" could lead to food development and manufacturing jobs. He also received the biggest laugh, joking that by 2025, Mr. Bloomberg might not seek re-election, and later, describing the delicacy of negotiating New York University's expansion plans as the "Israeli-Palestinian moment in my life."
There were no barbed moments, or even instances of disagreement. All criticized Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey for killing the ARC tunnel project for the Hudson River. They also all voiced support for a commuter tax.
Mr. Bloomberg's spokesman, Stu Loeser, defended the mayor's record.
"These sound like career politicians who have never created a single job and offer finger pointing rather than solutions,'' Mr. Loeser said in an e-mail. "Does anyone really think Bill de Blasio knows more about jobs creation than Mike Bloomberg? Does anyone really think Scott Stringer knows more about cutting crime than Ray Kelly? Does anyone really think the schools under Bill Thompson's leaership didn't fail our kids?"
The panel was moderated by two prominent Democrats associated with Stroock: Jerry H. Goldfeder, a special counsel at the firm who has represented Mr. Thompson and Mr. Stringer and given money to Mr. de Blasio; and Robert Abrams, a firm partner and former state attorney general who has has been retained by Mr. Liu to review his campaign finances in light of questions raised about the legitimacy of some of his contributions in an article last month in The New York Times.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
The National Restaurant Association paid $35,000- a year's salary - as severance to a female staff member in the late 1990's after an encounter with Herman Cain left her uncomfortable working there, Jim Rutenberg, Jeff Zeleny and Mike McIntire report. Mr. Cain's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination came under new pressure Tuesday, as his own accounts of past accusations of sexual harassment evolved over a second day on Tuesday and new details raised questions over exactly what took place at the association.

        
A co-chairman of President Obama's fiscal commission is concerned that members of a Congressional panel on deficit reduction will fail, Robert Pear reports. A bipartisan group of four fiscal policy experts told the panel that Congress should reduce the budget by adopting spending cuts and increasing tax revenues, even though 41 senators and more than 235 House members have pledged in writing to oppose all tax increases.

        
Only 6 percent of registered voters believe the majority of Congress should be re-elected, causing newcomers from both parties -- who were swept into office on an antigovernment tide -- to worry that they could be swept out just as easily since they have become part of the government that much of the public seems to abhor, Jennifer Steinhauer writes.

        
The House voted on a resolution Tuesday "'In God We Trust' as the official motto of the United States," Ms. Steinhauer reports. The measure seeks to clear up any confusion over the motto's official status and to encourage public institutions to display it.

        
A new super PAC backing Gov. Rick Perry has begun running campaign ads in Iowa and South Carolina, serving as a reminder of the Texas governor's formidable financial resources, despite his recent slide in the polls, Richard A. Oppel Jr. reports. The group is spending $200,000 in each state over the next 10 days, with Iowa and South Carolina marking the first advertising by a major super PAC in the Republican presidential primary.

        
Proposed changes to the federally financed school lunch program are meant to reduce rising childhood obesity, but a complicated battle involving farm-state legislators, low-income urban areas that rely on the program and the food companies that have spent more than $5.6 million so far lobbying against the proposed rules, Ron Nixon reports.
Happenings in Washington

        
President Obama will speak this morning at the Georgetown Waterfront Park, in front of the Key Bridge, urging Congress to pass the infrastructure portion of his jobs bill.
        
Federal Reserve officials will issue new economic projections at the end of their two-day policy-making meeting this afternoon.
        
First Lady Michelle Obama will host the National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards at the White House in an effort to highlight the need for after-school programs.
        
Congressional leaders will honor Japanese-American veterans of the 100th Infantry Battalion, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the Military Intelligence Service for their service during World War II.

HEADLINE: New Video Attacks Romney

BYLINE: JIM RUTENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Priorities USA Action, the pro-Obama super PAC, is marking the start of the yearlong countdown to Election Day 2012 by releasing a video entirely devoted to attacking Mitt Romney, painting him as a cold-hearted businessman. 

 BODY:
Priorities USA Action, the pro-Obama super PAC, is marking the start of the yearlong countdown to Election Day 2012 by releasing a video entirely devoted to attacking former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, painting him as a cold-hearted businessman disconnected from the pain of ordinary Americans.
The video is clearly intended to rile up the deflated Democratic base of liberal voters and activists, waving the equivalent of a red cape before their eyes: the Republican strategist Karl Rove, the Fox News Channel and Tea Party protesters all make appearances. But it specifically rips Mr. Romney, including video from his statement that "corporations are people,'' that the government should not "try and stop the foreclosure process - let it hit the bottom'' and that it should "let Detroit go bankrupt."
Priorities USA Action was co-founded by the former White House deputy press secretary Bill Burton and Sean Sweeney, the former aide to the former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel. It was formed with the explicit purpose of helping President Obama with unlimited donations from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals. As such, it is prohibited from coordinating with his campaign, which cannot accept such donations.
With many big liberal donors reluctant to give in any big way at this point, the pro-Obama group is facing an uphill climb against its extraordinarily well-financed Republican rival, American Crossroads, which was founded with help from Mr. Rove and the former Republican National Committee chair Ed Gillespie. But the video shows that Priorities USA Action sees an opening to at least get liberals angry enough to engage in what is expected to be a close election next fall.
The ad is to be accompanied with a new Web site, Facebook push and $100,000 in Internet advertisements aimed at giving the group a major presence online, said Mr. Burton.
Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, called the ad a "false and negative attack."
"More middle class Americans have lost their jobs under President Obama than any president in modern history," she said in a statement. "While Mitt Romney is focused on his jobs and economic plan, which will provide relief for the middle-income taxpayers, President Obama and his cronies are worried about their own jobs."
Mr. Romney's tax plan eliminates taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains for people with annual salaries of $200,000 and less.
Mr. Romney's aides have aggressively sought to counter the notion that he would only favor the rich, noting that a regular part of his stump speech is the line, "What I want to do immediately is help the people who've been hurt most by the Obama economy, and that's the middle class."

HEADLINE: Obama Taunts House for Ignoring Jobs Bill

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: The president taunts the House for voting to reaffirm the national motto, 'In God We Trust," instead of on measures aimed at "putting people back to work!" 

 BODY:
 President Obama on Wednesday visited another bridge in need of repair - this one somewhat closer to home, between Washington and Virginia -- to promote his job-creation proposals as the Senate began the latest partisan debate over his plans.
 But in pressing for approval of $60 billion in infrastructure spending, Mr. Obama took his biggest shot not at the measure's Republican opponents in the Senate, but at those in the House. He tweaked House Republicans for passing a resolution on Tuesday reaffirming the national motto, "In God We Trust," when they should be creating jobs.
 "I trust in God," Mr. Obama said, "but God wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work!" 
 Invoking patriotism as well as divine intervention - Mr. Obama stood against the backdrop of a giant American flag - he spoke before an audience that included unemployed construction workers, whose industry is among the hardest hit by the housing bust.
 "I'm joining many of these workers to say that it makes absolutely no sense when there's so much work to be done that they're not doing the work," Mr. Obama said to their applause. "Not when there are so many roads and bridges and runways waiting to be repaired and waiting to be rebuilt."
 The president's short trip from the White House to the event stage on the Potomac riverfront came more than a month after he began campaigning throughout the country for his jobs plan, building public pressure on Republicans but winning no votes from them. Mr. Obama singled out the Republican leaders of the House and Senate - Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader - just as he did in September when he visited an aging bridge over the Ohio River that connects their two states.
 Mr. Obama said the two leaders and other Republicans had supported public-works investments in the past. But Republicans oppose Mr. Obama's $447 billion job-creation plan, which also includes tax cuts for workers and employers and state aid to avoid layoffs of teachers, police officers and firefighters, because the package would be paid for with higher taxes on those with taxable income of more than $1 million a year.
 For the same reason, some leading business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Associated General Contractors of America, have withdrawn support for the infrastructure spending bill, though Mr. Obama cited the Chamber as a supporter in his remarks.
 The House has declined to take up Mr. Obama's jobs package, while Senate Democrats could not muster the 60 votes needed to block a Republican filibuster against either the full $447 billion package or a $35 billion piece providing state aid, mostly for teachers' pay. With White House support, Senate Democrats have broken the measure into its main parts to force Republicans to take a series of tough votes on proposals, each of which has broad public support, according to polls. 
 "The American people are with me with this," Mr. Obama said. "And it's time for folks running around spending all their time talking about what's wrong with America to spend some time rolling up their sleeves to help us make it right. There's nothing wrong in this country that we can't fix."
 The outcome in the Senate on the infrastructure spending provision, however, is not expected to be any different from the previous two votes. 
 Mr. Obama's transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, a former Republican congressman from Illinois, appeared with him at the Key Bridge and then went to the Capitol to meet with lawmakers.
 In response to Mr. Obama, House Republicans said the Democratic-controlled Senate should take up some 16 House-passed measures; most would attack federal regulations or spending and would have long-term impact, analysts say, but they would not spur job creation in the coming year or two.
 Mr. Boehner facetiously said that Mr. Obama, as a former Democratic senator, could help: "I'm sure he has great influence over there in terms of getting them to take up these bills that really will help put the American people back to work."

 BODY:
Federal Inquiry of MF Global Escalates | Federal officials are stepping up an investigation of MF Global, the bankrupt brokerage firm run by Jon S. Corzine, as the search continues for about $600 million in missing customer money.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which first detected the missing money last week, decided to issue subpoenas to MF Global and demanded that the firm retain any documents that might be related to the investigation, according to people briefed on the situation.
The trading commission, along with the Securities and Exchange Commission and exchanges like the CME Group, are examining whether MF Global diverted customer money in recent days to support its own trades in a last-ditch effort to save the firm -- a serious violation of federal rules.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also joined the inquiry, according to a person with knowledge of the case.

In Corzine Comeback, Big Risks and Steep Fall | The fall of MF Global, and the discovery that hundreds of millions of dollars were missing from the firm's customer accounts, have cast a dark cloud over Jon S. Corzine. MF Global was supposed to be Mr. Corzine's comeback vehicle after New Jersey voters turned him out of the governor's office in 2009. Instead, the collapse of the firm appears to be a humiliating coda to the career of a one-time titan of Wall Street.

Mayor vs. Mayor | Michael R. Bloomberg and Edward I. Koch betrayed differing interpretations of the financial crisis during a panel discussion on Tuesday, The New York Times reports.
Mr. Bloomberg, expressing a Republican view, argued that Congress had caused the mortgage crisis, while the Mr. Koch, a Democrat and former New York mayor, laid blame squarely on Wall Street.
"What do you think they got fined for -- schmutz on the sidewalk?" Mr. Koch said, referring to settlements with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. "They got fined because they abused their relationship with their clientele. And I want to see somebody -- I want to see one of them, of a major corporation, punished criminally."

HEADLINE: Sheep Lawn Mowers, And Other Go-Getters

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
OBERLIN, Ohio
IN this verdant lawn-filled college town, most people keep their lawn mowers tuned up by oiling the motor and sharpening the blades. Eddie Miller keeps his in shape with salt licks and shearing scissors.
Mr. Miller, 23, is the founder of Heritage Lawn Mowing, a company that rents out sheep -- yes, sheep -- as a landscaping aid. For a small fee, Mr. Miller, whose official job title is ''shepherd,'' brings his ovine squad to the yards of area homeowners, where the sheep spend anywhere from three hours to several days grazing on grass, weeds and dandelions.
The results, he said, are a win-win: the sheep eat free, saving him hundreds of dollars a month in food costs, and his clients get a freshly cut lawn, with none of the carbon emissions of a conventional gas-powered mower. (There are, of course, other emissions, which Mr. Miller said make for ''all-natural fertilizer.'')
''They countrify a city,'' Mr. Miller said of his four-legged staff. ''And they lend a lot of awareness about how people lived in the past.'' 
As an uncertain economy and a stagnant hiring climate continue to freeze people out of the traditional job market, a number of entrepreneurs like Mr. Miller, many of them in their 20s and 30s, are heading back to the land, starting small agricultural businesses. And in the process, they are discovering that modern homesteading offers more rewarding work, and possibly more security, than entering the white-collar fray.
Mr. Miller, a 2010 graduate of Boston University, started his business last year, when several post-college grant applications fell through and no other job opportunities presented themselves. He moved back home and acquired two Jacob sheep, a small, sturdy breed that dates to biblical times. Recently, he added two more to his flock, which he keeps in a pen in the backyard when not in service.
Customers pay $1 per sheep per day, but Mr. Miller also accepts barter payments, which have so far included karate lessons, jugs of maple syrup and the use of one homeowner's truck. He has done around 20 homes so far, and has so many requests he can't keep up with them.
Mr. Miller, who supplements his income by working on a local farm, has resisted raising his prices because he wants his services to be available to all. And while Heritage Lawn Mowing is not yet in the black, he says he has found a better way of life.
''It's a gateway to that whole rural dream,'' he said. ''And with the type of recession we're having, there's stability in it.''
Other yeoman start-ups are charting a more traditional path to profits.
Carrie Ferrence, 33, and Jacqueline Gjurgevich, 32, were in business school at Bainbridge Graduate Institute in Washington State when they noticed that many local neighborhoods were ''food deserts,'' without easy access to fresh local produce and other grocery staples.
Their answer was StockBox Grocers, a company that repurposes old shipping containers as small grocery stores. The company won $12,500 in a local business plan competition and raised more than $20,000 online in a Kickstarter campaign to finance its first store, which opened in the Delridge neighborhood of Seattle in September.
''It's a tough job market, and you have really few instances in your life to do something that you really love,'' Ms. Ferrence said. ''It's not that this is the alternative. It's the new plan A.''
In terms of social cachet, agricultural start-ups are a long way from Silicon Valley. But the phenomenon seems to be gaining steam.
Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms, a nonprofit that matches willing farmhands with organic farms seeking temporary help, has become, for the 4-H crowd, what Stanford's computer science department has been for Silicon Valley. In the last three years, membership in the group's United States branch has quadrupled, and among a certain set of college-age agriculturalists, the organization has become a verb (as in ''Did you WWOOF last summer?'').
The agricultural start-up world has also benefited from the growth of the sustainable business community. There are now business school programs in sustainable entrepreneurship, sustainable start-up conferences and venture capital firms that invest solely in green businesses. Even Nike has gotten into the game, with a new sustainable venture fund that will allow it to ''thrive in a sustainable economy, one where people, planet and profit are in balance,'' according to the company's Web site.
OF course, the mainstreaming of farm life has inspired a certain amount of skepticism among those with more agricultural experience.
Jason Stroud, 44, of Red Hook, Brooklyn, has been raising chickens since he was 19. He said he thinks many newcomers to the sustainable agriculture world are making a high-tech mountain out of a Bronze Age molehill.
''It's simpler than one would think,'' he said of modern-day homesteading. ''Peasants with zero education were doing this hundreds of years ago.''
After his regular work, restoring high-end antiques, dried up earlier this year, Mr. Stroud began advertising his farm skills to fad-chasing urbanites: for a price, he would build them backyard chicken coops and teach them to care for the birds.
The offer was so well received that Mr. Stroud estimates that nearly half of his income now comes from chicken consulting. He dispenses advice on a Web site called Red Hook Chicken Guy, where he lists the benefits of chicken farming in Brooklyn. (Reason No. 10: ''It's just a cool thing to do.'')
''It's a good opportunity for kids who have gone to college with degrees in Hungarian literature that they owe $300,000 on,'' he said, chuckling.
Mr. Stroud's wife, Susan Gregory Thomas, 42, began growing food for their family when her freelance writing failed to pay the grocery bills.
The economic downturn, she said, has widened the interest in farming beyond the bio-dilettantes and the merely curious: ''It's not a movement that's going to go away. This economy has been so devastating to so many people that this idea of doing for one's self, which is very much an American idea, is taking hold.''
But being an agricultural entrepreneur is not without its risks.
Richard Charles, a Wall Street technology manager, decided to become an urban farmer after he was laid off twice, first by Citigroup, in 2008, and then by Goldman Sachs, in 2009. He and a former colleague from Citigroup, David Lowe, started EcoVeggies, a company that uses aeroponic technology to grow plants without soil. Their plan is to convert abandoned buildings in Newark into high-tech urban farms that will supply produce to local restaurants and schools.
The reward ''is the immense satisfaction of starting from a dream and doing something,'' said Mr. Charles, 44.
Still, he and Mr. Lowe used personal savings to finance their EgoVeggies project, and so far have failed to turn a profit. Mr. Charles, who has a day job at a renewal energy consulting firm, said he now works harder, and makes less, than he did on Wall Street.
Likewise, Ms. Ferrence of StockBox Grocers said that although she has gotten interest from investors, the first store is still in the red, and the low margins of the grocery business mean it will probably never generate huge profits.
As Mr. Charles put it, ''Entrepreneurship is a great idea, but it's not for everyone.''
Those who can either spare the money and the time or do without both, however, may find that going back to the land offers an appealing challenge.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Miller took his flock of sheep to the home of a new client, where he tied them to two stakes in the backyard and watched as they began to eat.
Jacob sheep, he said, go first for broad-leaf plants, then for dandelions and clovers, and then for grass. They generally avoid flowers and other decorative growth, he added, and seem drawn to intruders like buckthorn plants.
''They have a built-in weed whacker,'' he said, stroking the fleece of a sheep that goes by the name of Princess.
Mr. Miller has had his setbacks. He lost one lamb to bloating earlier this year, another to parasites and a third when he gave an underperforming animal to a friend who wanted a lamb roast (''Layoffs,'' he said with a deadpan expression). Then there was the time his sheep escaped from their pen and were found hours later on a nearby street, and he was fined $50 by the police.
And now, with winter coming, snow will probably put a crimp in his profits.
But after seeing the results of his urban farming experiment, he said he wouldn't have done it any other way.
''Building a new America will require an understanding of farming,'' he said. ''We have to look to the past to see the future.''
Mr. Miller would like to go to graduate school to study sustainable development, and eventually wants to be the chief executive of an organic farm company. For now, though, he is looking to expand Heritage Lawn Mowing into neighboring towns, and increase the size of his flock so he can take on larger projects.
Highways, he has been thinking, are a good place to start.
''There's so much grass in the median strips,'' he said. ''You could feed a lot of sheep with those.''

HEADLINE: Syms and Filene's Basement File for Bankruptcy Protection

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The discount retailer Syms and its subsidiary Filene's Basement have filed for bankruptcy protection and plan to close all 46 of their stores. 
Syms acquired Filene's Basement, also a discount retailer, out of bankruptcy protection in the spring of 2009 for $62.4 million, but it struggled to turn the retailer around. This is the third bankruptcy protection involving the Filene's Basement chain.
Syms and Filene's Basement stores are mostly in the Eastern United States and employ about 2,450 people, Syms said. The company struggled to stay afloat amid tough competition and consumers who have slowed their spending.
Marcy Syms, the company's chief executive, said in statement that the two discount chains were burdened by increasing competition from department stores offering the same brands at similar discounts and by a rising number of private label discounters. She also said there was less overstock for her company to buy as businesses managed their inventory carefully because of the sluggish economy.
Ms. Syms said the bankruptcy filings capped ''a process that has taken place for several months.''
The company, based in Secaucus, N.J., announced in May that it was exploring strategic options, including a potential sale.
Sy Syms started the company in 1959, buying excess merchandise directly from manufacturers at a discount.
Filene's Basement was started in 1909 in Boston by William Filene, initially as a place for the Filene's department store to sell excess merchandise.
The liquidation is expected to run through about January. Syms and Filene's will be jointly administered during the bankruptcy. The companies are seeking court approval to hire someone to handle the merchandise liquidation and conduct sales.

HEADLINE: Is SoHo Cool Again?

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN

 BODY:
SOHO is dead. Long live SoHo.
In early 2010, the celebrated and cerebral Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto quietly closed his New York store, on the corner of Mercer and Grand Streets in the southern reaches of SoHo, without so much as a press release. To anyone who saw the bleak brown-papered windows, the closing felt like a sign of the times -- not of the economic boom going bust, but of SoHo's once-titanic cool quotient finally going ''pfffft.''
But grief over a fashion moment's passing was short-lived. Almost overnight, the bright corner space was snapped up by fashion's hottest young star, the 27-year-old Alexander Wang, whose offices were already just a couple of blocks away on Broadway and who had been looking for a spot to open his first store.
And a year later, in February 2011, open it he did, to great fanfare during Fashion Week. And he is scarcely alone. In 2010 and 2011, a healthy clutch of fashion and design boutiques have opened nearby, shaking up the sleepy streets of South SoHo. There may not be much of a change in the tourist-packed tar pit of central SoHo, but in SoSoHo, as this southerly fashion microclimate is now slangily denoted, it seems there is cool life yet. 
Asked if he had contemplated opening a store in one of downtown's more popular shopping areas, Mr. Wang was unequivocal.
''No,'' he said flatly. ''When we were looking, I said: 'I am not going to the meatpacking district, I'm not going to Bleecker Street. Not for us.' Grand Street just felt more intimate.''
Besides Mr. Wang's store on the corner, this southernmost block of Mercer Street has, in the last week, added two new shops: Orla Kiely, the first boutique in this country for that popular Irish designer; and, just when you thought jeans couldn't get any more rarefied, the custom denim boutique 3 x 1, which offers more than 100 kinds of denim and chambray in weights that range approximately from chiffon to plywood. The trendy French label Surface to Air opened on the block in September.
The block was already playing host to VPL, the designer Victoria Bartlett's boutique, and the custom-kicks Nike iD shop. Agnes B., the French casual-chic clothier, which for years was on Prince Street (in SoHo central), has moved around the corner to Howard Street. Add the fact that the corner of Mercer and Howard has been taken over by VFiles, the new cyberspace companion of Visionaire and V, the relentlessly fashionable downtown culture magazines, the offices of which have had their headquarters across the street since 1999, and you've got quite a little scene cooking. (Attention, Google Earth, which still shows Mr. Yamamoto's store in place: time for a drive-by.)
''Our neighborhood has been sleepy for so long,'' said Cecilia Dean, the editor of Visionaire. ''Finally things are starting to wake up. And what's great is that South SoHo seems to be getting new up-and-comers like Alexander, so that's exciting, too. It feels a little more underground, if anything still can be underground.''
That scene is mirrored across Broadway, along Howard Street and up Crosby Street, where a rash of boutiques has similarly cropped up. Newcomers include Dunderdon, a men's clothier from Sweden with an ardent logger vibe, and Saturdays Surf NYC, a men's clothier with an ardent surfer vibe. Aesa & Electric Feathers, with fluttery frocks and one-of-a-kind jewelry, opened in the summer. The lobby of the Mondrian SoHo, which opened early this year, has become something of a scene, even if its restaurant has received mixed reviews. (No matter -- the cocktails appear to be doing the trick.)
Old-timers include Vespa, the storied Italian scooter maker; De Vera, a storied boutique for exquisite trifles and oddities; and BDDW, a high-end design store that was one of the first shops in the area.
Later this month, to address the scarcity of fast and stylish food in the area, Matt Kliegman and Carlos Quirarte, the owners of the Smile, the restaurant on Bond Street, as well as outposts at the Jane and Westway (which, around these parts, you have to at least pretend you've been to), are opening the Smile to Go, a cafe on Crosby that will offer takeout food, a few seats and, Mr. Kliegman said, ''a very serious espresso program.''
''There's an energy down there that's definitely different from what has become of SoHo in its current commercialized state,'' Mr. Kliegman said, likening it to other byways where he and his partner have opened up shop. ''I've lived on Prince Street for eight years, and I avoid SoHo like the plague on weekends -- and even nonweekends too. But you come down here to this little nook, walking down Crosby, and it's totally different.''
One thing that makes South SoHo different from many neighborhoods is how different the stores can be. On Grand Street, for instance, DQM, nee Dave's Quality Meats, hangout of skateboarders and sneaker heads, rubs elbows with Team Gallery, one of SoHo's few holdouts of contemporary-art hip, and Flair, a midcentury-chic decor shop (from which Mr. Wang said he had furnished half his apartment). No word on where he buys his skateboards.
THE area's first fashion, or at least fashion-adjacent, merchant was E. Vogel, the 122-year-old custom boot maker, which moved to Howard Street, somewhat ahead of the curve, in 1969. Jack Lynch, a great-grandson of the founder, Egidius Vogel, said that the evolution since he began working at the business in the mid-1980s had been remarkable.
''When my uncles bought this building in 1969, they called it Little Italy,'' he said. ''Then it became Chinatown. But in the 1980s, this was not considered a good area. I remember when our UPS man was stabbed on Crosby Street. I talked to him afterward, and he said: 'Crosby is not a good street. It's too quiet.' ''
The street became safer in the '90s, and in the last decade, the change has been marked. ''We're not the kind of business that really gets foot traffic,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''Our customers really had to seek us out. But now we get people walking in, wanting to know more about what we do, and even ordering shoes.''
As most people do, Mr. Lynch gives his neighbor, Opening Ceremony, the lion's share of the credit for the area's vogue.
The achingly hip fashion store founded by Humberto Leon and Carol Lim, Opening Ceremony had its debut in 2002 with a defiantly unglamorous, unrenovated look that frankly resembled one of Chinatown's myriad cheap-wares surplus shops, like Pearl River around the corner. Its self-conscious take on merchandising, coupled with an aggressive program of fashion collaborations with in-crowders like Chloe Sevigny, struck a nerve among the young and style-conscious, and last year, Opening Ceremony annexed a space next door.
Last month, the store grew again, taking over the loft apartment above the shop, and turned it into a brand-new floor, giving more space (and grace) to the higher-end labels it carries: Proenza Schouler, Christopher Kane and others.
The Opening Ceremony mystique aside, other factors have helped South SoHo come alive. Its central location is walking distance from several downtown neighborhoods with their own burgeoning cultures: publishing in West SoHo, the Lower East Side art scene and other hipster hangouts, like Santos Party House in Chinatown and Red Egg in Little Italy. And the fact that it is still part of SoHo puts it in the context of a familiar neighborhood that still has a certain desirability. (Mallified or not, SoHo is not yet the Sherman Oaks Galleria.)
One thing that has kept SoSoHo from becoming overly gentrified is its proximity to the mass wares and cheap fashion knock-offs sold just a block away, on Canal Street. This has kept rents down, nearly a quarter of what they are farther north in central SoHo, said Joshua Lewin, a broker with Isaacs and Company, a real estate firm that specializes in high-end retail spaces, who also found Mr. Wang his spot.
Mr. Lewin also stressed how the area's curious geography helped maintain its integrity. That going south, Crosby dead-ends into Howard at its south end, and Howard in turn dead-ends into Mercer Street, creating a pleasant meandering flow for foot traffic, which is amplified by a sense of intimacy brought about by the lack of through traffic.
It is tempting to imagine that South SoHo will stay as charming as it is at the moment. But as Mr. Lewin noted, other big-name fashion brands are coming to SoHo -- YSL, Balenciaga and Stella McCartney -- albeit to its central shopping area, not its southern reaches. The temporary move of SoHo's Apple store to Greene Street between Spring and Broome will bring more foot traffic. It also bears recalling the fates of some of Manhattan's other formerly low-key shopping areas, like NoLIta, Bleecker Street and the meatpacking district. And, of course, SoHo itself.
Ms. Dean, the Visionaire editor, was happy to have an infusion of new blood on her block, and noted that not all of the changes augured well. ''I already miss all the rap videos that were always being shot on the corner across the street because it had the most amazing graffiti wall,'' she said. ''Now it's a branch of Citibank.''

HEADLINE: Two French Singers With Mixed Languages and Gender Roles

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

 BODY:
Triumphal regular visits from William Christie and his exceptional French ensemble Les Arts Florissants have proved time and again that New Yorkers show a passion for relatively obscure French operas of the Baroque and Classical periods, as long as they are handled with the regal pomp for which they were designed. 
At least one other company has found success on similar terrain: Opera Lafayette, based in Washington, has built a sterling reputation through specializing in rarities by Gluck, Gretry and the like.
Even in semistaged productions such undertakings don't come cheap, which probably accounts for why Opera Lafayette presents just one major event in New York each season. (Its next production, Monsigny's ''Roi et le Fermier,'' arrives at the Rose Theater in January.) But on Sunday evening the company mounted an economical event with oversize appeal: a concert featuring the French singers Jean-Paul Fouchecourt and Gaele Le Roi in a mix of French and Italian works at Weill Recital Hall.
Mr. Fouchecourt, a noble veteran of the Baroque performance-practice revival, was presumably the chief draw. New York audiences have delighted at his flamboyant turns as Rameau's Platee in Mark Morris's gleefully garish City Opera staging. Though his light, dry voice can constrict on high, so potently does the diminutive Mr. Fouchecourt project character that he stood out even against elephantine Franco Zeffirelli sets playing Remendado in a 2008 Metropolitan Opera ''Carmen.''
Performing here with a quintet of two violins, cello, harpsichord and alternately theorbo or Baroque guitar, Mr. Fouchecourt was wonderfully expressive in a series of airs de cour by Michel Lambert: the last a seemingly prescient lament concerning a shepherdess too consumed by work to return a paramour's affection in equal measure. Mr. Fouchecourt's knack for comedy showed as he sang the part of the sly old nurse Berenice (a female role) in passages from Cavalli's ''Ipermestra.'' He was well matched by Ms. Le Roi, whose lively international career has included too little employment in New York, to judge by the quality and appeal of her work here. She was agile and fresh in passages from ''Ipermestra'' and from Vittori's ''Galatea,'' and achingly potent in a scene from ''L'Empio Punito'' by Melani.
Together Mr. Fouchecourt and Ms. Le Roi made a striking pair, their ranges converging and crossing in selections from Lully's ''Atys'' and Charpentier's ''Circe.'' They concluded the concert with a scene from Monteverdi's ''Incoronazione di Poppea,'' then returned to offer the splendid final duet from that opera, ''Pur ti miro,'' as an encore.
Opera Lafayette performs next on Jan. 26 at the Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway; (800) 494-8497, boxofficetickets.com.

HEADLINE: Global Markets Rally, Despite Concern Over Europe

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris, Kevin Drew from Hong Kong and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
Stocks pushed higher Wednesday as investors weathered continued uncertainty over the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and a lowered growth forecast for the United States.
Global equities markets plummeted on Tuesday after the surprise announcement that Greece was planning a referendum on its latest bailout package. But on Wednesday, even as the tremors from Europe continued, they rose more than 1 percent.
''It is still a mess but there is no 'new' news today of really anything,'' said Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. ''It is the absence of a negative catalyst.'' 
Still, analysts noted that it was too early to declare that a recovery was in the works for the financial markets. The main bailout fund of the 17 members of the European Union that use the euro, the European Financial Stability Facility, halted an expected issuance of 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion) of 10-year bonds to help finance Ireland's bail-out because of a lack of buyers.
That delay caused an early rally in European stocks to fizzle and kept up pressure on the debt of some countries with weaker economies, according to strategists at Brown Brothers Harriman. Italian 10-year bond yields were stuck above 6 percent, for example, highlighting concern about that highly indebted country.
An emergency cabinet meeting convened by the Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, ended early Wednesday with unanimous support for the government but also with the opposition and some members of Mr. Papandreou's own party calling for new elections immediately.
Meanwhile, European officials were holding economic talks on the eve of a Group of 20 nations summit meeting in Cannes, France.
In the United States, the Federal Reserve said ''strains'' in global financial markets were among the significant risks to the nation's economic outlook, but the Fed announced no new measures to stimulate growth.
The Fed significantly reduced its forecast of economic growth and predicted that the rate of unemployment would remain relatively high for the next two years. Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said the Fed forecasts were still above the consensus.
''The Fed is saying they are worried about Europe but continuing with current policy,'' Ms. Warne said. ''If the Fed thinks things are progressing in a way where they don't have to take additional action, that is considered good news on the economy.''
Stocks held tight to their gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 1.6 percent, or 19.62 points, at 1,237.90, after dropping 2.8 percent on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.5 percent, or 178.08 points, at 11,836.04, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.2 percent to 2,639.98.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 1/32, to 101 7/32, and the yield was unchanged at 1.99 percent.
In equities, energy and financial indexes fared the best, rising nearly 3 percent.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of European blue chips, closed up 1.4 percent, while the F.T.S.E. 100 index in London rose 1.15 percent. The German Dax was up 2.25 percent and the CAC 40 in Paris rose almost 1.4 percent.
The currency market is most likely to remain jumpy, analysts at Credit Agricole wrote, as worries over Mr. Papandreou's proposed referendum persist.
The euro was up to $1.3733 from $1.3692 on Tuesday. Asian shares were mixed. The Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 2.2 percent. The Sydney market index S.& P./ASX 200 fell 1.1 percent. In Shanghai, the composite index rose 1.4 percent, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong closed 1.9 percent higher.

HEADLINE: Rent Deal Aids Ailing East Village Bookstore

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
A deal has been reached to reduce the rent for St. Mark's Bookshop, an East Village institution whose problems over the past year prompted an outpouring of support from neighbors and literary figures. 
The deal came after months in which the store's owners said they would be forced to close unless their landlord, the Cooper Union, cut their rent.
''I really thought there wasn't going to be a deal and that we couldn't afford to stay here,'' said Bob Contant, an owner.
As recently as last week, after he and his business partner, Terry McCoy, met with college officials, they were not expecting a deal to be achieved, Mr. Contant said.
That changed on Tuesday, said the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, who met with both parties to work out an agreement. At a meeting in Mr. Stringer's office, the college agreed to reduce the store's rent to about $17,500 a month from about $20,000 for one year, and to forgive $7,000 in debt. The school will also provide student help with revising the store's business plan.
The store owners previously said they needed a monthly reduction of $5,000 to remain in business.
''I tried to split the difference,'' Mr. Stringer said, adding that he intervened because the store, open since 1977, was important to the neighborhood's cultural life. ''When an independent bookstore goes out of business, a part of us goes with it. In my neighborhood, on the Upper West Side, when Shakespeare and Company went out of business, West Siders lost something that they couldn't get back.''
The Cooper Union, which gives every student a full scholarship, has its own financial problems and announced on Monday that it might begin charging tuition.
''Despite our constraints, we felt it was important to help them because of what their presence means to our community,'' said the college's president, Jamshed Bharucha, who took over in July. ''The relief that we're providing is so that the bookstore can come up with a viable and sustainable business plan not dependent on further subsidies. That's the key piece there.''
In the past year, the bookstore's owners have reduced their staff through layoffs and have cut their own salaries in half, but it was not enough to offset losses from the poor economy and the rise in sales of electronic books. Mr. Contant said August was the store's worst month in memory.
But since then, as the store owners went public with their losses, the neighborhood rallied in response. A group called the Cooper Square Committee started a petition to save the store, attracting 40,000 signatures. Business picked up by about 25 percent in September and October, Mr. McCoy said, leading him and Mr. Contant to believe they could continue with a smaller reduction in rent.
The owners have no plans to rehire staff. The store's finances remain fragile, especially as the current sales levels recede, Mr. Contant said.
''The outpouring of support for us was just incredible,'' he said. ''But you never know what the deal is going to be. We have to make people realize it's not over as such just because we're out of the woods for now.''

HEADLINE: Private Employers Added More Jobs Than Expected in October

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Private employers added more jobs than expected last month and planned layoffs dropped sharply, underscoring the view that the economy is on a path of slow growth.
The ADP National Employment Report, released Wednesday, showed that the economy's private sector added 110,000 jobs in October, topping economists' expectations for a gain of 101,000 jobs. ADP also increased September's job growth to a gain of 116,000 from the previously reported 91,000. The payroll company ADP sponsors the report, which is prepared by Macroeconomic Advisers. 
While the data was encouraging, economists said it pointed to a sluggish recovery in the labor market rather than robust growth.
''It portrays a job market that's improved a bit since earlier in the summer. But we're still not generating the kind of job growth that's going to be enough to bring down the unemployment rate quickly,'' said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities in New York.
Release of the government's much more comprehensive labor market report is scheduled for Friday. That report, which includes both public and private sector employment, is expected to show a rise in overall nonfarm payrolls of 95,000 last month, based on a Reuters poll of analysts, and a rise in private payrolls of 120,000. The unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 9.1 percent.
Economists often refer to the ADP report to fine-tune their expectations for the payrolls numbers, though it is not always accurate in predicting the outcome.
Fears that the American economy could be heading for another recession have ebbed in recent months, and growth accelerated in the third quarter after a weak first-half performance.
The gains in the ADP report came from small and medium-size businesses, which added 58,000 and 53,000 jobs, respectively.
Earlier Wednesday, a separate report from the consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed the number of planned layoffs at American companies dropped in October after hitting the highest point in more than two years the month before.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''It's Consumer Spending, Stupid,'' by James Livingston (Op-Ed, Oct. 26): 
Sure, consumer spending and debt are driving economic growth. They are also driving us off an ecological cliff.
So even if one wanted a consumer debt-fueled economy indefinitely, the physical limits of the planet preclude it. We're consuming more stuff than the planet can replenish each year and creating more waste than it can assimilate.
Globally, we're now consuming 1.5 planet's worth of resources a year. And it is not just the planet's capacity but also the acquiescence of the overstretched, credit-card-debt-burdened American households that is running out.
Just because something has been true in the past doesn't mean that continuing it is desirable or possible. We can do better. In these resource-constrained, debt-laden times, we must choose something more sustainable, more healthy and ultimately more fulfilling to base our economy on than continuing to shop beyond our -- and the planet's -- means.

HEADLINE: Flooding, Strong Yen and Poor Sales Lead Sony to Predict a Loss

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- A strong yen, flooding in Thailand and tepid sales in the United States and Europe all conspired to knock Sony to a net loss for the latest quarter, putting the company on course for a fourth unprofitable year in a row.
The Japanese electronics and entertainment giant said Wednesday that it expected to post a net loss for the financial year ending next March of <5>90 billion, or $1.2 billion, compared with a previous forecast of <5>60 billion in net profit. Sony booked a net loss of <5>27 billion for the quarter through September, compared with a profit of <5>31.1 billion a year earlier. Sales in the quarter fell 9 percent from a year earlier to <5>1.58 trillion. 
The somber numbers put pressure on Howard Stringer, the Welsh-born American chief executive who is in his seventh year at Sony's helm, to take more drastic measures to turn around the manufacturer or hand over the reins to someone who can.
Mr. Stringer, 69, had suggested that he would lay the foundations for a strong recovery at Sony, equipping it to put up a better fight against rivals like Apple and Samsung before leaving the company in the hands of a younger successor. But with its bottom line decimated by the global financial crisis and then more recent problems, the handover could be a messier affair.
Sony has, in fact, been making progress in restructuring its sprawling empire, shuttering some factories and paring down its supply chain. It said last week that it would spend 1.05 billion, or $1.5 billion, to take full control of its struggling cellphone venture with Ericsson of Sweden, and announced plans to realign its money-losing television business.
Kazuo Hirai, an executive vice president considered to be a strong contender to succeed Mr. Stringer, offered more details Wednesday of Sony's plan to turn around its television operations, saying it would incur costs of <5>50 billion to streamline production and other fixed costs. Sony will also reduce the number of television models it offers, said Mr. Hirai, who leads the company's consumer electronics business.
''The entire Sony management feels a grave sense of crisis that we have continued to post losses in TVs,'' Mr. Hirai, 50, said at a news conference. ''We urgently want to escape this chronic loss-making state,'' he said.
But 2011 has been a painful year for Sony, with much of its troubles caused by misfortune. It was forced to halt production at 10 factories in the aftermath of Japan's earthquake and tsunami in March, including a Blu-ray disc plant completely overrun by waves. A few weeks later, a massive computer hacking attack that compromised more than 100 million accounts on the PlayStation Network exposed embarrassing weaknesses in the company's online defenses, forcing the company to shutter the popular video game service for more than a month.
In August, rioters in Britain set fire to a north London warehouse containing CDs and DVDs, burning it to the ground. More recently, devastating floods in Thailand submerged a digital camera factory and forced Sony to halt production at a semiconductor plant because of supply shortages.
All the while, the punishing strength of the yen against the dollar and euro has weighed on Sony's earnings, making its products less competitive globally and eroding its overseas earnings. The yen soared to a post-World War II record earlier this week, prompting the Japanese government to intervene in currency markets to try to tame its rise.
Sony has also long had its hands tied in trimming its global work force of almost 170,000. A third of those employees are in Japan, where large-scale layoffs by top companies are highly controversial.
''We are fighting against strong headwinds,'' said Masaru Kato, the chief financial officer of Sony.
Those woes have hindered what Mr. Stringer has called Sony's ''four-screen strategy,'' centered on its smartphones, tablet computers, personal computers and televisions. The idea, according to Mr. Stringer, is to bring content from Sony's music and movie companies exclusively to those gadgets, spurring both hardware and software sales.
Helping to marry the two sides of the strategy would be Sony's online content delivery platforms, like the PlayStation Network, which has more than 90 million accounts and is perhaps the world's only serious rival to Apple's iTunes.
But Sony has been late to the market with tablets, having finally introduced one in September, a full year and a half after the arrival of Apple's top-selling iPad. In the smartphone market, Sony has also struggled to keep up with the Apple iPhone, although its Xperia phones, fitted with Google's Android platform, have found some success.
Its four-screen strategy appears to leave out its video game business, which has been showing signs of a comeback after years of trailing Sony's archrival in the sector, Nintendo. Sony plans to release a much-anticipated handheld game console, the PlayStation Vita, next month in Japan, and in February in the United States and Europe.
But Sony's biggest headache is its television business, which has lost money for seven years in a row amid tough competition from Samsung Electronics of South Korea.
Mr. Hirai, the consumer electronics chief, said Wednesday that Sony would cut its annual sales forecast for liquid-crystal display TVs by 9 percent, to 20 million units. He said the company would focus less on increasing unit sales and more on coming up with the right mix of models to improve profitability.
Sony is not alone in losing money on televisions. Panasonic, the world's biggest maker of plasma TVs, said this week that it expected a full-year net loss of <5>420 billion, the company's biggest deficit in a decade, largely because of an expensive streamlining of its television and chip-making operations.
Panasonic has said it intends to suspend two Japanese TV display factories.
But Mr. Hirai rebuffed suggestions that Sony's insistence on making many of its own televisions and other gadgets, instead of outsourcing to less-expensive manufacturers, was a strategy the company could now ill afford. Sony still makes some televisions in high-cost Japan.
''TVs remain a core Sony business, and their manufacture continues to require high-level technological expertise,'' Mr. Hirai said.
''It is Sony's DNA,'' he said. ''If we outsource everything overseas, we will lose that.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Deficit Committee Could Seek More Time, a Top Democrat Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A top House Democrat said Wednesday that a bipartisan committee seeking ways to slash the budget deficit could seek an extension if it was unable to meet its deadline, just three weeks away.
With no visible signs of progress, 6 of the 12 committee members have begun meeting privately in hopes of overcoming what appears to be the biggest obstacle to agreement: a deadlock over whether tax increases should be part of a deficit-reduction deal.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, said in response to a question that members of the committee could not unilaterally extend the Nov. 23 deadline for their final recommendations, but could ask the Congress to do so. 
''They are a supercommittee, and they have been given some extraordinary powers,'' Mr. Hoyer said. ''They can issue a document that is not subject to amendment and must be considered within a certain time frame and can be passed by 51 senators.'' But, Mr. Hoyer said, the committee ''is not the Congress, and it can't extend its deadline itself.''
In a rare bipartisan appeal, 40 House Republicans and 60 House Democrats said Wednesday that the committee should consider additional revenue along with spending cuts as part of a deal to reduce deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years.
The bipartisan group, led by Representatives Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho, and Heath Shuler, Democrat of North Carolina, sent a letter to the committee that said, ''To succeed, all options for mandatory and discretionary spending and revenues must be on the table.'' The group did not recommend specific ways to change the tax code or reduce spending.
When Congress established procedures to increase the federal debt ceiling in August, it set up the joint committee to identify ways of reducing federal deficits by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years. Both houses of Congress are supposed to vote on the recommendations by Dec. 23. If legislation to save at least $1.2 trillion is not enacted, the president in January 2013 is supposed to make up the difference by imposing across-the-board cuts in most military and civilian programs.
In seeking an extension of the deadline, the panel, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, would not have to admit failure, but could tell Congressional leaders that it was making progress and needed more time. The prospect of progress could avert the consequences of a failure, which could include a further downgrade of the United States government's credit rating.
To date, Democrats said, progress has been negligible because Republicans have been intransigent. A Democratic aide close to the discussions said: ''It is very disheartening. There is no sense so far that Republicans have been flexible on revenues.''
Given this difficulty, the aide said, an extension of the Nov. 23 deadline would not help because ''time is not the enemy here.''
Subgroups of the committee have tried to generate momentum. One group consists of three Republicans -- Representatives Dave Camp and Fred Upton of Michigan and Senator Rob Portman of Ohio -- and three Democrats -- Senators Max Baucus of Montana and John Kerry of Massachusetts and Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.
''These members really want a deal, really want to find common ground,'' said a Congressional aide. ''They are the pragmatists.''
Maneuvering in the committee came as Senate Democrats tried Wednesday, for the third time in a month, to pass a jobs bill financed with an additional tax on income exceeding $1 million a year.
The latest version of the jobs bill would provide $60 billion, including $50 billion for highways, bridges, railroads, airports and other transportation projects. The bill -- a component of President Obama's $447 billion jobs package -- would also provide $10 billion in loans and loan guarantees for transportation projects, water and sewer systems and other infrastructure.
Mr. Obama put pressure on Congress in a speech Wednesday in front of Key Bridge, which connects Washington and Virginia.
''The truth is the only way we can attack our economic challenges on the scale that's needed is with bold action by Congress,'' the president said. ''They hold the purse strings. It's the only way we're going to put hundreds of thousands of people back to work right now. Not five years from now, not 10 years from now, but right now.''
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said, ''The quickest way to get Americans back to work is to pass the American Jobs Act,'' with $60 billion for transportation.
But the Congressional Budget Office said the bill might not deliver a quick jolt to the economy because the transportation money would be disbursed gradually, with less than 10 percent being spent in the first year and more than 30 percent from 2016 to 2021.
''Historically,'' the budget office said in an analysis of Mr. Obama's proposal, ''money appropriated for highway and transit projects is spent at a slow rate in the first year and has a long spending 'tail'; funds provided in a particular year are usually spent over a period of six to eight years.''

HEADLINE: Cutting the Defense Budget

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Bombs, Bridges and Jobs'' (column, Oct. 31), Paul Krugman uses the ramifications of deep defense cuts to paint me as a Keynesian. 
To be clear, as a fiscal conservative I have never supported policies that advance government expenditure for the express purpose of job creation. Indeed, I believe that the private sector is far better equipped to promote lasting jobs growth than Washington will ever be.
The defense industry is unique. It relies entirely on federal government dollars. Unlike other sectors of the economy, there are no private sector resources that can rush in to fill the void left by a reduction in federal spending. In that void, hundreds of thousands of jobs will be lost by those who wear the uniform and those who support them.
Congress is charged by the Constitution with providing for the common defense by raising and supporting our armed forces. We don't spend tax dollars to protect American jobs, but to protect American lives. As such, it is accurate to point out that cuts in defense spending will cripple a critical industry, result in huge job losses and erode our ability to provide for the common defense.

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Slashes Outlook For U.S. Growth

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve significantly reduced its forecast of economic growth through 2013, acknowledging that it had once again overestimated the nation's recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.
Despite the bleak forecast, however, the Fed said that its policy-making committee had decided against taking new measures to stimulate growth at a two-day meeting that concluded Wednesday. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said that the central bank already was pushing hard to spur growth and create jobs.
''We have taken a lot of actions,'' Mr. Bernanke said at a news conference after the announcement. He added that Congress, by contrast, was not doing enough to pull the levers of fiscal policy. Lawmakers are gridlocked over a new jobs proposal from the White House, and a special bipartisan committee charged with reducing the deficit is struggling to reach agreement by Thanksgiving.
''I think it would be helpful if we could get assistance from other parts of the government to help create more jobs,'' Mr. Bernanke said. 
The central bank predicted that the economy would expand 2.5 percent to 2.9 percent in 2012, well below its June projection of 3.3 percent to 3.7 percent. For the following year, 2013, the Fed predicted growth of 3 percent to 3.5 percent, down from a range of 3.5 percent to 4.2 percent.
The unemployment rate, it predicted, would still be at least 8.5 percent at the end of 2012, at least 7.8 percent at the end of 2013 and at least 6.8 percent at the end of 2014. Such reductions probably would come in part from people abandoning the search for work, rather than those finding new jobs.
The unemployment rate was 9.1 percent in September. The government will release October figures on Friday.
This is a difficult time for the Fed and its chairman. Republicans charge that the central bank's existing efforts have gone too far, sowing future inflation. Democrats say that in hesitating to do more, the Fed is ignoring the plight of more than 25 million Americans who cannot find full-time work. And the sluggish pace of growth, which continues to fall short of the Fed's predictions, is a bright marker of its failure to stimulate a recovery.
Mr. Bernanke on Wednesday sought to argue that the Fed was trying to get things just right in maintaining a delicate but necessary balance between competing concerns about inflation and unemployment. He said that Republican critics were ignoring the Fed's record. Five years into the crisis, there is no sign of inflation.
''The area where we have fallen short obviously is on the unemployment side,'' he said. ''So I think that criticisms based on the concern about inflation have so far at least not proved to be very valid.''
But Mr. Bernanke also gave little satisfaction to liberal critics. This meeting tested what the Fed was willing to do when the economy was merely muddling along, and the answer that came back: Nothing new. Asked several times why the Fed had paused if jobs are a problem and inflation is not, Mr. Bernanke offered a description but not an explanation: The Fed is willing and able to do more, he said, just not right now.
The Fed's economic forecasts do not have a particularly good track record, but since they are based on individual forecasts submitted by the 17 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making board, the numbers do offer a window into the state of their minds. In a word: glum.
The Fed's assessment of the economy was slightly brighter than after the last meeting in September. The committee's statement noted that growth has ''strengthened somewhat'' since summer thanks in part to increased consumer spending. But there is still a hole in the economy where housing used to be, and the unfolding financial crisis in Europe continues to shadow the domestic economy. The statement again noted ''significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets.''
Still, the decision to pause won the support of nine of the 10 voting members of the committee. The one dissent came from Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, whose vote echoed his recent speeches in which he has criticized the Fed for caring more about inflation than unemployment. It was the first time since 2007 that a board member had dissented in favor of doing more.
The limiting factor appears to be inflation. The Fed projects -- as do financial markets -- that prices and wages will rise about 2 percent a year, the level that the Fed considers healthy. Mr. Evans and outside critics want the Fed to trade a higher rate of inflation for reductions in unemployment. But Mr. Bernanke and a majority of his colleagues believe that this would unsettle the dearly bought belief that the Fed will keep inflation slow and steady.
The pressure to reconsider that stance has been eased by recent data, including the estimate that growth rose to an annual pace of 2.5 percent in the third quarter. There is also the question of what Congress will do: Further cuts in spending, or a decision to end the payroll tax holiday, would strengthen the case for the Fed to start new aid programs. A plan to pay down the debt would have the opposite effect.
These considerations have suspended for now any movement toward a new round of stimulus, like the proposal by the Fed Governor Daniel K. Tarullo that the Fed should resume buying large quantities of mortgage-backed securities to reduce the cost of mortgage loans, increasing demand for housing.
''While I do not shirk the responsibility of the Fed having to do what it can to meet its mandate, obviously a broad range of policies can affect growth and employment,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''I hope that there will be a range of actions that will complement and supplement the Federal Reserve's efforts.''
Mr. Bernanke indicated that the Fed does plan to expand in the near future the information that it provides about its outlook and policies. Such information can increase the power of those policies. For example, convincing investors that the Fed intends to maintain interest rates near zero for a longer period will tend to drive down rates on long-term loans -- which are set in large part based on expectations about future short-term rates -- thereby reducing the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers.
A simple change would involve publishing the Fed's predictions for the future level of the short-term interest rates, which it controls directly and has already said that it plans to hold near zero through mid-2013.
Diane Swonk, an economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, said the Fed could show greater concern for job creation by tying such a forecast to the unemployment rate, announcing that it would keep short-term rates near zero until unemployment dropped below 7 percent, provided that inflation remained under control.
''This is how you would move toward it,'' Ms. Swonk said, referring to Mr. Bernanke's mention of the issue during his news conference. ''And I think that that is exactly where they are heading.''

HEADLINE: Whistling in Cannes

 BODY:
The European debt crisis is not the only threat to the global economy, which is already slowing perilously. When leaders of the world's 20 big emerging economies meet in Cannes, France, on Thursday and Friday, they should agree on an agenda to boost growth. We don't hold out much hope. 
There are no mysteries here. Big countries with trade surpluses and the financial wherewithal -- notably China, but also Germany and Japan -- need to boost their consumption of the world's goods. China, in particular, should allow its exchange rate to rise much faster. Others, including the United States, Britain and France, should make growth a priority -- while committing to wrestling down their deficits once their economies bounce back.
Instead of rallying together, all the players seem determined to pull their own way, no matter the consequences. Germany -- which controls the purse strings of Europe -- isn't even willing to finance the bailout fund that is needed to prevent a meltdown in its own backyard. Japan, desperately trying to stimulate its economy, on Monday sold trillions of yen for dollars, sparking concern that competitive devaluations could spread.
Britain is still wedded to fiscal austerity despite ample evidence of the disastrous consequences. In the United States, Republicans in Congress have vowed to block President Obama's modest attempts at economic stimulus, while demanding deeper cuts certain to produce another recession.
While he is unlikely to make much progress, President Obama should still use the summit meeting to keep pressing the others to stimulate growth -- and send a message back home of the cost of failure. The president should also push China to let the renminbi rise and cut its trade surplus and keep pressing the Europeans to come up with a solution for their financial mess that lasts for more than a few days. We don't expect a breakthrough, but more denial and inaction is a sure recipe for disaster.
Some modest good may still come out of Cannes. Leaders could endorse the rule agreed to by banking regulators in Basel, Switzerland, earlier this year to require the world's biggest banks to keep larger reserves to cushion against losses on their investments. They should move to establish rules on how to take over big global financial institutions on the verge of collapse.
They also need to agree on a way to get out from under the corpse of the so-called Doha round of trade negotiations, which is blocking any other negotiations to advance trade rules at the World Trade Organization. Considering the scale of the challenge, these are very slim pickings. But they are better than nothing.

HEADLINE: Who Speaks for the Silent Majority?

BYLINE: By MATTHEW D. LASSITER. 
Matthew D. Lassiter, an associate professor of history at the University of Michigan, is the author of ''The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt South.''

 BODY:
Ann Arbor, Mich.
AMERICAN politics might appear polarized along a red-blue divide, but the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements are claiming to do the same thing: defend the real majority against the powerful elites and vocal interest groups that control the political system. Conservatives in the Tea Party attack big government and rally behind the slogan ''Silent Majority No More!'' Progressives in Occupy Wall Street denounce big business and embrace the manifesto ''We Are the 99 Percent.''
On both the right and the left, strategists want to mobilize the elusive group of voters that Richard M. Nixon first labeled the ''great silent majority'' during a speech about the Vietnam War on Nov. 3, 1969. With one rhetorical stroke, Nixon identified a new populist category that redefined how political groups strive for influence. 
At the time, polls revealed that two-thirds of Americans hoped the conflict would end quickly but simultaneously opposed antiwar demonstrations. Nixon called for unity on the home front and asked patriotic Americans to speak out against efforts by a ''vocal minority'' to defeat the United States. Tens of thousands of letters from self-identified members of the silent majority poured into the White House.
Nixon's conservative populism attempted to obscure the differences between working-class and affluent voters by portraying the silent majority as both heroes and victims of this tumultuous period. In the 1968 campaign, Nixon praised the ''forgotten Americans, the nonshouters, the nondemonstrators'' -- hard-working, tax-paying Americans whose values were under siege by antiwar protesters, urban rioters, criminals and antipoverty liberals.
In 1970, Nixon's chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, asked the president's political team to develop ''a plan to mobilize the Silent Majority.'' The White House operative Charles Colson incorporated ''Silent Majority Inc.'' in all 50 states and organized rallies through fake grass-roots organizations like Americans for Winning the Peace and the Honor America Committee. The administration worked on an internal ''blue-collar strategy'' to finesse the economic liberalism and cultural conservatism of white working-class Democrats viewed as potential Republican voters. The White House even orchestrated the formation of a National Black Silent Majority Committee to represent African-Americans being ''shouted down by a handful of militants.''
Nixon was always careful to say that black Americans were part of the silent majority, but his populist agenda targeted white voters who believed that the civil rights and antiwar movements had gone too far. ''Enough Is Enough,'' a manifesto circulated by conservative groups in the late 1960s, spoke for the Americans who ''pay taxes to provide schools for sit-ins, books for burning, rallying points for off-campus riots and study courses in anarchism.'' During the 1972 campaign, Nixon invited ''those millions who have been driven out of their home in the Democratic party ... to join us as members of a new American majority.''
Nixon's landslide reelection obscured the class and ideological divisions within his fabled silent majority. Faced with a weakening economy, Nixon portrayed Democrats as the party of racial quotas, busing, urban welfare and weakness on foreign policy. After the election, internal memos circulated by Nixon's political team acknowledged that he had won by mobilizing a ''nonpartisan'' majority against liberalism rather than by creating a cohesive Republican coalition. The point person for the blue-collar strategy even warned of a fierce reaction if the administration betrayed middle-income voters by returning to ''big-business-dominated Republicanism.''
The legacies of Nixon's pursuit of the silent majority can be found across the political spectrum. In 1972, the community organizer Saul Alinsky portrayed the silent majority as ''up for grabs'' and promised to ''show the middle class their real enemies: the corporate power elite that runs and ruins the country.'' In 1980, the Religious Right televangelist Jerry Falwell proclaimed that ''God is calling millions of Americans in the so-often silent majority to join in the moral-majority crusade to turn America around.'' In his 1981 inaugural, Ronald Reagan updated Nixon's formula by informing the ''heroes'' of America -- an allegedly classless majority made up of factory workers and entrepreneurs -- that ''government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.''
The Democrats regained the White House only by combining Nixon's populist outreach to the silent majority with assurances that government intervention could address economic malaise. Bill Clinton promised to listen to the ''quiet, troubled voice of the forgotten middle class,'' while Barack Obama said that they had ''a right to be frustrated because they've been ignored.''
Mr. Obama's challenge in 2012 is not the ideological fervor of Tea Party conservatives, but rather the recognition by many working-class and middle-class voters that both parties favor Wall Street over Main Street. While activist groups on the right and left compete to portray big government or big business as the enemy, the silent majority is still out there in the volatile political center, up for grabs.

HEADLINE: 280 Big Public Firms Paid Little U.S. Tax, Study Says

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett, take note. It is not just a few wealthy individuals paying unusually low taxes to the federal government. Corporate America is not far behind.
A comprehensive study released on Thursday found that 280 of the biggest publicly traded American companies faced federal income tax bills equal to 18.5 percent of their profits during the last three years -- little more than half the official corporate rate of 35 percent and lower than their competitors in many industrialized countries.
Mr. Buffett, the billionaire investor, has said that the tax code is unfair, allowing him to pay just 17 percent in federal taxes last year, about half the percentage his secretary paid. 
The corporate study, prepared by the left-leaning advocacy group Citizens for Tax Justice, examined the regulatory filings of the companies to compute each year's current federal taxes. Some of the companies disputed the findings, saying that the study understated their tax payments by omitting deferred taxes that they may pay in future years.
Using information from the companies' own corporate filings, however, the study concluded that a quarter of the 280 corporations owed less than 10 percent of profits in federal income taxes and 30 companies had no federal tax liability for the entire three-year period.
The report is being released as corporations are pushing for a cut in their official tax rate, saying the current system puts American companies at a disadvantage with competitors abroad and encourages them to shift jobs and investments overseas.
The Congressional supercommittee charged with cutting the budget deficit is also considering proposals to revamp the tax system, simplifying the corporate structure and possibly lowering corporate rates.
The study said that the shelters and loopholes in the current tax system rewarded companies that aggressively avoided taxes at the expense of those that did not. A quarter of the companies in the study had a federal tax bill of 35 percent of their profits, while a similar number had an effective rate of less than 10 percent.
''Companies that are paying their fair share ought to demand that the tax-dodging companies pay their fair share too,'' said Robert S. McIntyre, the author of study. ''So should the public, which is subsidizing them in terms of increased federal debt.''
The report is based on data gleaned from the companies' regulatory filings, which can be different from their corporate tax returns. Even in a year when a company claims an overall tax benefit, it may pay some cash taxes while accumulating credits that can be redeemed in future years. But because most corporations do not release their tax returns, these corporate regulatory filings offer the best publicly available gauge of what companies pay and what strategies they use to reduce their tax bills.
Among the companies that the study said escaped a liability for all three years were Boeing and Ryder System, whose chief financial officer, Art A. Garcia, said the company had benefited from the additional depreciation intended to stimulate the economy.
Boeing officials said they, too, had paid some federal taxes, but would not say how much. They said they had lowered their rate by taking advantage of tax breaks intended to encourage hiring. Chaz Bickers, a company spokesman, said Boeing hired 9,000 American workers this year
Also on the list was General Electric, which has come under close scrutiny since The New York Times reported earlier this year that the company had recorded $5.1 billion in American profits in 2010, but claimed a federal income tax benefit of $3.2 billion in its regulatory filing.
''The report is inaccurate and distorted,'' said Kenneth Juarez, a G.E. spokesman. He said G.E. paid ''billions of dollars in taxes in the United States over the last decade,'' but would not say what part was federal income taxes.
The company that recorded the biggest reduction in taxes was Wells Fargo Bank, which is a large holding of Mr. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway. The banking company reported a total of $49 billion in profits in 2008 through 2010, yet received a tax benefit of $651 million. Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said much of the tax savings came from write-offs obtained after its 2008 purchase of Wachovia, which incurred big losses during the financial crisis.
American corporations are paying a smaller share of taxes than in previous decades. They paid a total of $191 billion in federal income taxes in 2010, the Internal Revenue Service said, representing about 1.3 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. That is down from about 6 percent during the 1950s (although some of the decline is because a smaller percentage of businesses now file as corporations).
Despite the decline in corporate tax rates since then, business advocates say the nation needs to lower its top rate further to encourage hiring and investment. Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, said that the United States system was not competitive because it taxed income earned around the world, instead of just in this country.
''There are still Bolsheviks who recognize that we need to bring the rates down,'' he said.
But the Citizens for Tax Justice study found that two-thirds of the American companies with significant profits overseas actually paid more in taxes to foreign governments than they did in the United States. Rather than lowering the corporate rate more, the study said, the federal government should end the subsidies and shelters that favor companies that game the system.
''Closing the loopholes will have real benefits, including a fairer tax system, reduced federal budget deficits and more resources to improve our roads, bridges and school -- things that are really important for economic development here in the United States,'' the report said.

HEADLINE: A Collapse in Spite of Regulators

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG, BEN PROTESS and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED; Azam Ahmed contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A little before 2 a.m. on Monday, Jon S. Corzine was in MF Global's offices in Midtown Manhattan, scrambling to cut a deal to save his firm. Haggard from too little sleep, at times pacing the hallways, he at least had a handshake agreement with one suitor for the firm.
Then the chief executive was interrupted to handle a brief conversation that would stop the deal talks cold: hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds, he was told, could not be located.
Three hours later, the board of MF Global, with no bidders or options left, voted to file for bankruptcy, the largest failure on Wall Street since Lehman Brothers in 2008. 
While the commodities and derivatives brokerage firm fell apart with ferocious speed, the collapse came after regulators raised warning flags for more than four months. They told MF Global it needed to raise more capital, and they asked about risky transactions involving European debt.
Yet Mr. Corzine resisted, lobbying to persuade regulators that the firm did not need to raise capital, according to people briefed on the discussions. MF Global did improve its capital position, but it was not enough to save the firm.
The details that have emerged about MF Global's final 72 hours - drawn from dozens of interviews with people who participated in the weekend discussions or were directly briefed by people who did - illustrate that three years after the financial crisis, Wall Street executives are still fighting regulators' demands.
It also shows that even when the watchdogs sound the alarm, it is not necessarily enough to save a firm. Now, multiple regulators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are examining the firm's collapse, trying to determine what went wrong and where the missing money, now suspected to be roughly $630 million, went.
The CME Group, a major exchange where MF Global traded until this week, said on Wednesday that Mr. Corzine's firm had appeared to transfer client money sometime last week ''in a manner that may have been designed to avoid detection,'' a serious violation of Wall Street regulations. MF Global did not disclose the shortfall in client money to CME or to regulators until early Monday morning, shortly before the firm filed for bankruptcy.
A person close to the company said it was not aware of any audit by the CME Group. Neither Mr. Corzine nor MF Global have been accused of any wrongdoing.
One of the first signs of trouble for MF Global came in June, when regulators reviewed its recent financial statements, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. In a footnote, MF Global disclosed that it had bought debt from Italy, Ireland and other troubled European nations.
The disclosure alarmed the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-regulator, which worried that MF Global lacked enough capital to support the trades.
Finra called MF Global, pushing it to raise its capital levels, but Mr. Corzine fought back, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Frustrated, Mr. Corzine decided to go over Finra's head to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the person said. In July, Mr. Corzine traveled to Washington to state his case to S.E.C. officials at their offices near Union Station in Washington. Mr. Corzine chalked up their concerns to undue jitters over Europe's ballooning debt crisis, the person said. The S.E.C. and Finra wouldn't bend, and in August, the firm increased its capital cushion.
MF Global declined to comment; Mr. Corzine did not respond to a request for comment.
The move offered only short-term relief. By mid-October, MF Global's European gamble was being widely discussed on a nervous Wall Street. Rumors spread that Moody's Investors Service was considering a cut to MF Global's credit rating. Finra resumed regular talks with the firm, questioning whether anxious customers, investors and trading partners would drain the firm's liquidity.
Late on Oct. 24, Moody's did move to cut its rating on the firm, to just one notch above junk status, citing in part the European bond holdings.
That proved to be a watershed moment: the downgrade led MF Global's trading partners to demand extra collateral, draining the firm's cash supply.
Under mounting pressure from Washington and Wall Street, MF Global moved up its scheduled quarterly earnings announcement by two days, reporting on Oct. 25 that it had recorded a $186 million loss, its fourth loss in six quarters. The share price of MF Global went into free fall, tumbling 67 percent over the course of that week. The firm also started drawing on its credit lines.
Mr. Corzine quickly hired the investment bank Evercore Partners to help him find a buyer for part or of all of the firm. MF Global also contacted BlackRock, the giant asset manager, to help it wind down its balance sheet - including efforts to sell its holdings of European debt. Eventually, MF Global brought bankruptcy lawyers on board to prepare for the worst.
Mr. Corzine had other fires to put out.
Last Thursday, regulators from several agencies arrived at MF Global's offices in New York and Chicago. What they saw over the course of the next few days troubled them, according to people knowledgeable about the matter who spoke only on condition of anonymity. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, led by Gary Gensler, became concerned that MF Global had not kept customer money separate from company funds, a fundamental rule on Wall Street.
MF Global assured regulators at the time that the money was in order, these people say.
On Saturday, Mr. Gensler reached out to H. Rodgin Cohen, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell who has long served as Wall Street's go-to lawyer in a crisis. During the tumultuous days of 2008, Mr. Cohen advised a number of embattled Wall Street executives, including Richard S. Fuld Jr. of Lehman Brothers. He now found himself counseling Mr. Corzine.
''We need more documents,'' Mr. Gensler told the lawyer, according to people briefed on the conversation. The call set off a scramble at MF Global as employees tried to locate the documents regulators were demanding.
Other issues about the quality of the firm's bookkeeping were being spotted by employees from BlackRock, who had arrived to value the MF Global portfolio, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Yet even as questions about MF Global's records were beginning to surface, talks on a possible sale were getting under way. Two main bidders quickly emerged - the Interactive Brokers Group and Jefferies Group. Jefferies, a brokerage house based in New York, has a futures trading business and the idea of expanding it is said to have appealed to its chief executive, Richard Handler. A small team of Jefferies executives arrived at MF Global on Friday and were escorted into a windowless conference room. The executives returned the next day as well.
They sorted through stacks of information about MF Global's operations. While they didn't notice anything out of order with MF Global's books, they left that Saturday without making a bid. Jefferies, a person with knowledge of the matter said, concluded it simply needed more time to complete such a complicated acquisition - time MF Global didn't have.
That left Interactive Brokers. The Connecticut brokerage firm was also huddled in a separate windowless conference room not far from where the Jefferies team was holed up.
Mr. Corzine, who ran Goldman Sachs in the 1990s before serving as a Democratic senator from New Jersey and then New Jersey governor, was the lead negotiator for MF Global. One person who saw him Saturday said he looked ''pained'' at the events unfolding around him.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday, Mr. Corzine and an Evercore banker, Jane Gladstone, were able to call regulators and brief them on the sale talks. They sounded optimistic, saying that they were confident a deal would get done.
That hope grew into the evening,
As Interactive Brokers continued its dive into MF Global's books, signs of exhaustion among the participants grew. J. Christopher Flowers, the MF Global investor and former Goldman executive, was spotted at the talks on Sunday wearing mismatched shoes.
Just before 1:45 a.m., Mr. Corzine received the information telling him that customer funds were missing. That alarmed Interactive Brokers, and the firm walked away from the bargaining table.
An MF Global executive then notified the regulators, who were still camped in the firm's Manhattan offices. Commodity Futures Trading Commission officials called Mr. Gensler, waking him around 2:30 a.m. to join a conference call with MF Global and other regulators.
MF Global executives could not stay on the phone for long - they needed to convene the board and prepare for a bankruptcy filing.
But the phone line remained open for several hours, as regulators discussed how to handle the first major financial failure of the postcrisis era.

HEADLINE: Euro Crisis Shifts Mood For G-20

BYLINE: By JACK EWING AND STEVEN ERLANGER; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Steven Erlanger from Cannes, France. Rachel Donadio contributed reporting from Athens.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- The Group of 20 summit meeting in Cannes was supposed to be a chance for Europe and the event's host, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, to shine. Instead, the two-day meeting is coming at an extraordinarily dark time for the Continent, with Europe in political disarray, its economy tipping into recession and the future of the euro zone in doubt.
If anyone can afford to strut on the beaches of the Cote d'Azur during the meeting on Thursday and Friday, it should be the fast-growing developing countries, especially China, but also India, Russia and Brazil. The balance of power has shifted so rapidly that Europe is now asking them for money, and they are in a stronger position to push their views on trade rules and other issues.
But the leaders of the big emerging economic powers of the world are not likely to be crowing. Not only do they face vulnerabilities of their own, like worrisome levels of inflation in China, but they also do not want to see their best customers struggle economically, especially when another crucial outlet for their exports -- the United States -- is also suffering. 
''China is going to be in a pretty good position,'' said Uri Dadush, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ''But don't interpret that to mean that China is happy with all this. China is part of the world economy.''
That was the sentiment that President Hu Jintao of China expressed in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro this week. ''China sincerely wishes to see stability in the euro zone and the euro,'' he said.
Typically, Group of 20 summit meetings are an occasion for the host leader to appear statesmanlike and push pet issues. Mr. Sarkozy had originally intended the Cannes meeting to focus on his call for changes to the international monetary system, in a bid to reduce exchange rate fluctuations and give the euro and other currencies more status compared with the dollar.
In character for the frenetic French president, the agenda also contains an ambitious list of other goals, including changing bank regulation, as well as dealing with unemployment, corruption, tax evasion, food security and global warming. Mr. Sarkozy's schedule even includes a meeting on Thursday morning with Bill Gates of Microsoft to discuss development financing.
There will undoubtedly be pronouncements on many of these issues. Most of the work on such questions is done in advance by lower-level officials. The summit meeting, which begins with a working lunch Thursday, is to a large extent a photo opportunity at which leaders issue communiques that were agreed upon well ahead of time.
But events this week have forced Mr. Sarkozy and Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, to become mired in Greek politics when they would rather that their constituencies see them appearing on the global stage with President Obama or Mr. Hu.
Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel met in an emergency session Wednesday afternoon with the heads of European Union institutions and the International Monetary Fund to discuss the Greek situation. In the evening, they met with President George A. Papandreou of Greece, who had declared Tuesday that he would let his people decide in a referendum whether they supported his tough-minded, often painful efforts to keep Greece afloat. The proposal, which could lead to Greece's withdrawal from the euro zone, upset financial markets and undermined the latest European rescue plan.
With the Greek government struggling to stay in power, it is not clear what answers Mr. Papandreou can offer before the referendum, even if he survives a confidence vote in Parliament scheduled for Friday night. He pledged to hold the referendum by Dec. 4 or 5.
Officials said that until Greece's commitment to the plan to fix its budget overruns is clear again, the country is unlikely to receive an 8 billion euro ($11 billion) aid installment, due this month, which is needed before the end of the year to pay bills and salaries.
A spokesman for the German finance ministry said Greece apparently has enough money to keep running until mid-December, when it has to redeem more than 6 billion euros in debt.
Meanwhile, the relentless flow of negative economic news continued. A survey of managers in manufacturing, published Wednesday, pointed to a decline in European output during the last three months of 2011. The biggest drop in sentiment came in Italy, further heightening fears that a combination of slow growth and political paralysis could make it impossible for that country to continue to service its debt.
While markets recovered some of the ground they lost earlier in the week, investors' unease was apparent when the European Financial Stability Facility pulled back from a planned 3 billion euro deal to issue 10-year bonds to help finance Ireland's bailout because of a lack of buyers.
As part of the overall European effort to maintain stability in the euro zone, the facility is to be enlarged from 440 billion euros to 1 trillion euros and provide ''risk insurance'' to new bonds issued by struggling euro zone countries.
The last-minute cancellation of the small and normally routine operation is ''indicative that there is a huge amount of uncertainty out there which hasn't been helped by the Greek decision,'' said Nick Matthews, senior European economist at Royal Bank of Scotland. ''A week ago we thought we had a grand plan.''
Contributing to the spirit of turmoil, the Occupy Wall Street movement is expected to inspire a robust turnout for protests against the Group of 20 in nearby Nice.
''The timing is not good for the French president,'' said Gregory Chin, a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Ontario. The agenda ''raised too many expectations instead of delivering on the core issue of global growth,'' Mr. Chin said by telephone from Cannes.
With the advanced industrial countries weakened, they will be in less of a position to pressure China on perennial issues like its undervalued currency or the need to increase domestic consumption and reduce its trade surplus. China will be in a better position to promote the issues it cares about, like a greater voice in the I.M.F.
But China will face restraints in deploying its power. For one thing, to do so would mean accepting more global responsibility. ''They'll keep trying to free-ride as much as possible to focus on their internal challenges,'' said David Shorr, a policy analyst at the Stanley Foundation, an organization in Muscatine, Iowa, that promotes international cooperation. ''The U.S. will keep nudging them to shoulder more responsibilities as a rising power.''
Despite its growth, China has serious internal problems, including credit and housing bubbles in some regions, overindebted local governments and rising wages that make it harder to compete with nations like Indonesia or Vietnam.
''They come across as cocky sometimes,'' said Mr. Dadush of the Carnegie Institute. ''But they are very aware they don't want to push their weight around. They have their own issues to deal with.''
There are few expectations for any serious breakthroughs. But investors in markets will be watching the sessions in Cannes closely anyway, putting leaders under pressure to offer a stronger response to the European debt crisis even though that issue is not formally on the agenda. German officials, who could not be quoted because of the delicacy of the matter, insisted they would not use the summit meeting to beg China or other countries like Russia and China to contribute to the European rescue fund.
Klaus Regling, the chief executive of the stability fund, was in China and Japan this week trying to attract investors for the fund.
Many analysts are skeptical that the G-20 leaders, who will be together hardly more than 24 hours, will be able to deliver anything but a bland assurance that Europe will do whatever it takes to contain the crisis.
''I think we will get a disappointing comment from them on this,'' said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. ''They have said over and over that the governments of Europe will do whatever has to be done.''

HEADLINE: What Causes Should Philanthropic Groups Finance?

BYLINE: HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Which charities and causes should foundations and families give their money to? 

 BODY:
In the article "Donors Weigh the Ideals of Meaningful Giving," Stephanie Strom identifies a gap between need and giving: 
As the ranks of the needy grow, so does the need for charities that put food on a poor family's table, a roof over a homeless man's head or a coat on the back of a child whose mother is in prison, or for the charities that provide dental work for a woman without health insurance.
The number of Americans living below the poverty line - 46.2 million - is the highest it has been since the Census Bureau began collecting such data. Median incomes are declining, and college graduates can't find jobs. The gap between the haves and have-nots has widened sharply.
Yet for the last three years, state and local governments have slashed budgets that address homelessness, school nutrition, substance abuse and a range of other social services. In some cases, money is cut outright; in others, governments defer payments for months. Still others have been asking pointed questions about what their residents receive in return for the exemptions from property and sales taxes granted to nonprofits.
While many Americans have always given generously to help people, many others - including individuals with the deepest pockets and foundations with billions in assets - make donations of a different sort: building museums to house their art collections; underwriting new wings in hospitals or halls named for them at their alma maters; using their money and influence to sway public policy and influence political campaigns; or seeking to solve problems in distant lands rather than in their own backyards.
While charitable giving rose slightly over all in 2010, gifts to organizations that address basic human needs fell 6.6 percent, according to Giving USA. And the middle class, which has traditionally given more to address those needs, is feeling the bite of the economic malaise.
"At a time when America is having a debate about the social contract, philanthropy is silent," said Emmett D. Carson, chief executive of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which has assets of $2 billion. "We are silent about the depths of the problems of homelessness, joblessness, foreclosure, hunger, and people are starting to believe that philanthropy is irrelevant to the core needs of their communities." 
Students: Tell us what you think the priorities should be for philanthropic giving. Which charities and causes should foundations and families give their money to and why? What kinds of programs need and deserve to be funded?

HEADLINE: Growing Economies, Stagnant Wages

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Median pay has not grown nearly as quickly as the economy has - in the United States and in many other rich countries. 

 BODY:
In the midst of the Occupy protests, the income gains going to the top 1 percent have gotten a lot of attention. Another way to understand the economic frustrations of the Occupiers is to look at how much middle-class living standards have changed, and how much the overall economy has grown.
A new report from the Resolution Foundation, a British research organization that focuses on workers with low income, has done just that. The report covers 10 rich countries, and looks at the growth rate of median pay versus economic growth per capita from 2000 to the start of the Great Recession.
Here's the key chart showing that ratio:
A higher ratio means that the pace of growth for median pay was close to the pace of growth for output per capita. A low ratio means that median pay grew much more slowly than did the economy as a whole.

Of the 10 countries analyzed, Finland showed the closest relationship between the living standards of the typical worker and improvements in the overall economy. The United States was on the lower end. From 2000 to 2007, median pay increased at a quarter of the pace of output per capita. In other words, the typical American worker did not share much in the country's growing wealth even when the economy was good.
Still, the United States was not the worst of the bunch. In Canada, median pay didn't grow at all between 2000 and 2007.
The moral of the story is that the United States isn't the only country experiencing growing inequality. Most of the rest of the developed world is, too.

HEADLINE: Roundup: Loan Debt Grows, Majors Matter and All Those Chinese Applications

BYLINE: JACQUES STEINBERG


HIGHLIGHT: A quick scan of newly-published Times content of interest to college-going families. 

 BODY:
The Times's Web site is peppered this morning with articles and posts that should be of interest to college applicants and their parents.
Tamar Lewin, for example, takes yet another measurement of the toll of the sluggish economy on families paying tuition. She writes that "students who graduated from college in 2010 with student loans owed an average of $25,250, up 5 percent from the previous year, according to a report scheduled for release" on Thursday.
Over on the Economix blog, Catherine Rampell is seeking reader comments on an article in Investor's Business Daily by Alex Tabarrok, an economics professor at George Mason University. Ms. Rampell's summary: "Americans are focusing on the wrong question. They shouldn't be debating whether college in general is 'worth it'; they should instead be thinking about whether the specific college degree they're considering is marketable." Moreover, "a smaller share of students are choosing majors that are in demand." Here's a passage that caught Ms. Rampell's eye:
Over the past 25 years the total number of students in college has increased by about 50 percent. But the number of students graduating with degrees in science, technology, engineering and math (the so-called STEM fields) has been flat 
If students aren't studying science, technology, engineering and math, what are they studying? In 2009 the United States graduated 89,140 students in the visual and performing arts, more than in computer science, math and chemical engineering combined and more than double the number of visual and performing arts graduates in 1985.
And in an online preview of the Education Life supplement that will be published in this weekend's Times, Tom Bartlett and Karin Fischer of The Chronicle of Higher Education collaborate with The Times on an article headlined: "The China Conundrum."
What are the "nut" paragraphs, as journalists call them? The authors write that in an effort to bolster "their diversity and expand their international appeal,'' American colleges "have rushed to recruit in China, where fierce competition for seats at Chinese universities and an aggressive admissions-agent industry feed a frenzy to land spots on American campuses." But that frenzy has had a downside:
College officials and consultants say they are seeing widespread fabrication on applications, whether that means a personal essay written by an agent or an English proficiency score that doesn't jibe with a student's speaking ability. American colleges, new to the Chinese market, struggle to distinguish between good applicants and those who are too good to be true.
Once in the classroom, students with limited English labor to keep up with discussions. And though they're excelling, struggling and failing at the same rate as their American counterparts, some professors say they have had to alter how they teach.

HEADLINE: Reports of Unreported Crime at Zuccotti Park Bother Bloomberg

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: The mayor said the protesters have a duty to inform the police about crime that takes place at their encampment in Lower Manhattan. 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called on Occupy Wall Street protesters on Thursday to report crimes taking place at their encampment in Zuccotti Park, saying that any failure to do so endangers all New Yorkers.
Mr. Bloomberg, speaking the day after prosecutors charged one protester with sexually abusing another park occupant, said he was concerned by reports that protesters had been chastising perpetrators of crimes and ejecting them from the park, rather than notifying the police.
"If this is in fact happening - and it's very hard to get good information - it is despicable, and I think it is outrageous," Mr. Bloomberg said. "It really allows the criminal to strike again, making all of us less safe." 
The mayor said that the police stood ready to assist the protesters by investigating alleged criminal activity at the park, but that the protesters had a moral obligation to enlist the police's help.
When protesters "who were victims of crimes have come forward, the N.Y.P.D. has moved swiftly and made arrests," Mr. Bloomberg said.
"You just don't have a right, and it's not fair to everybody else," he added, "to not report a crime when it occurs."
Mr. Bloomberg said that the 26-year-old man who was charged with sexual abuse on Wednesday was also a suspect in a rape case at Zuccotti Park.
The mayor spoke about his crime concerns as he took questions during a global cities summit at Columbia University, organized by his administration along with Columbia and the World Bank.
He declined to say whether there would become a point at which the city would simply evict protesters from Zuccotti Park.
"It is one of these problems that there is no easy answer," he said. "But there is a right answer, and the right answer is allow people to protest but at the same time enforce public safety - provide public safety and quality of life issues, and we will continue to do that."
While defending the protesters' right to express themselves, the mayor also expressed his impatience with them.
"My personal view is, 'Why don't you get out there and try to do something about the things that you don't like - create the jobs that we are lacking, rather than just yell and scream?'" he said. "But if you want to yell and scream, we'll make sure you can do it - but you're not going to do it at the expense of others."

HEADLINE: A Bialy Shop's Unlikely (Pakistani) Saviors

BYLINE: ELISSA GOOTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: After the owner of a Coney Island bagel and bialy shop decided to close his family's 91-year-old business, two new owners stepped in: a pair of Muslims from Pakistan. 

 BODY:
When the owner of Brooklyn's oldest bialy store, Coney Island Bialys and Bagels, announced last summer that he was closing up shop, fans began mourning the impending loss of a 91-year-old piece of Jewish culinary history. 
But the shop has been saved, and from an unlikely corner - at least as far as geopolitics are concerned. The new owners? Peerzada Shah, 43, and Zafaryab Ali, 52, a pair of Muslim immigrants from Pakistan. 
The two men lived together as roommates in an apartment on Ocean Parkway for over a decade, a period that overlapped with the 11 or so years that Mr. Ali spent hand-rolling dough, and baking it, under the shop's previous owner. "I roll bagels by hand," Mr. Ali said. "No machine." He left in 2004, he said, to pursue the more lucrative profession of a taxi driver. 
Mr. Shah said that back in Pakistan, he worked building and fixing ovens for bakeries. In New York, he trained as a pastry chef and managed movie theaters. When the business that his friend Mr. Ali knew so much about was up for grabs, he said, "It was an opportunity." 
The new bialy men, whose identity was first reported by The Jewish Daily Forward's food blog, The Jew and the Carrot, began running the store in September. They are leasing the space, they said, and tweaking the name - Coney Island Bagels and Bialys, instead of Bialys and Bagels. The recipes, they vowed, will stay the same. 
The shop's longtime owner, Steve Ross, told The New York Times in August that the sagging economy and changing neighborhood had left him no choice but to close the store that his grandfather, Morris Rosenzweig, founded in 1920 as a wholesale operation in the East New York neighborhood. 
''All my family clientele are cutting back,'' he told The Times. ''Now, people make coffee at home and have a Pop-Tart.'' (As opposed to a bialy, described in a cartoon that Mr. Ross had displayed as the offspring of an onion bagel and an English muffin.)
The new shopkeepers have a sanguine approach to their possibly groundbreaking foray into cross-cultural culinary terrain. "Not too many people in this business are Pakistani," Mr. Ali said. "Just a few. So I am happy, very glad." Jews and Muslims, he said, "live together in New York. We never have a problem." 
Minutes later, Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, walked into the shop, crying, "Salaam Aleikum!" 
"Brooklyn has the largest Pakistani population in America," he told Mr. Shah and Mr. Ali. "We also have the largest Jewish population in America. So what could be a better Brooklyn story?" 
"It's a Brooklyn story of how the world can someday be at peace," Mr. Markowitz said. 
Mr. Markowitz also imparted some business advice: While bialys are traditionally flavored with onions, perhaps, he suggested, the men could cater to the neighborhood's diverse populations with bialys flavored to different tastes. Maybe mango bialys? Feta cheese bialys? Jalapeno bialys? 
"People are doing it with bagels all around," Mr. Markowitz said. "But nobody's doing it with bialys."

HEADLINE: Fewer Americans Confident About Retirement Savings, Survey Finds

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Fewer Americans are confident in the adequacy of their retirement savings, a survey finds. 

 BODY:
The sluggish economy is taking a toll on Americans' confidence in their retirement savings, a new surveyfound.
Only a quarter of working Americans are "very confident" that they will have enough money for basic living expenses in retirement, down from 42 percent last year. And two-thirds say they believe they will need to work at least three years longer than they had planned, because of the economic environment.
The findings come from the Sun Life Financial "Unretirement Index" Survey. The survey was conducted by Knowledge Networks in September, using a probability-based sample of roughly 1,500 working adults. The margin of sampling error is 3 percent.
The Unretirement Index is scored on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 reflecting highest confidence about retirement. The Index score dropped from near the middle of the range (44) in September 2010, toward the bottom third of the scale (36) in September 2011, down 18.2 percent. The survey is the fifth in a series that began in 2008,
The survey also found less faith in the durability of government benefits. Confidence in the future of Social Security benefits plunged to 9 percent today, from 22 percent in 2008. And confidence about Medicare benefits has also plummeted, to 8 percent today from from 20 percent in 2008.
How confident are you about your plans for retirement?

HEADLINE: What to Look For in Friday's Jobs Report

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The Labor Department will release its monthly jobs report on Friday, and economists are expecting that once again the news will be mediocre. 

 BODY:
The Labor Department will release its monthly jobs report on Friday morning, and economists are expecting that once again the news will be mediocre.
American companies probably added a net total of about 90,000 jobs in October, after a gain of 103,000 in September, forecasters say. (Remember, though, that the September numbers were helped by the rehiring of Verizon workers who were on strike during August.)
While job growth is, of course, better than job losses, a gain in the neighborhood of 100,000 is nothing worth celebrating. That would be just about enough to keep up with population growth, so it would not actually reduce the backlog of unemployed workers.
As a result, economists expect the unemployment rate to stay flat at 9.1 percent. If they're right, that would mean that the unemployment rate has not fallen below 9 percent in seven months.

The outlook for the coming year is not much better: On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's forecast for economic growth next year was revised downward. Fed officials expect an average unemployment rate of 8.5 to 8.7 percent in 2012.
Those figures also do not seem to have factored in whatever mayhem could result from the European debt crisis.
The fate of Greece has been up in the air for about a year and a half now, and this week talks over the conditions of a deal to ease the Greek debt burden have been particularly contentious. Economists worry that a possible Greek default could set off a domino effect that takes down Italy and other indebted countries, potentially causing another global financial crisis. And as you may recall, earlier upheaval -- the tsunami in Japan, the Arab Spring, severe winter storms, the debt ceiling debacle in Washington -- caused previous economic forecasts to look far too optimistic.
Besides the headline numbers in Friday's report, pay attention to:

        
The share of working-age people who are actively participating in the labor force, either by working or looking for work. This share has been alarmingly low in recent months, indicating that many workers are sitting on the sidelines because they find the job market so discouraging.
        
The average duration of unemployment. The average length of time workers have spent fruitlessly looking for work has reached record high after record high, climbing to 40.5 weeks in September. And that number would not even include people who have been out of work for longer but gave up their job search.
        
The length of the work week. Before employers take the plunge and hire more workers, they often work their existing employees longer. But average weekly hours for private employees have been mostly flat at about 34.3 so far this year. We'll see if hours picked up in October.

HEADLINE: Primary Election Days: Is Three a Charm?

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: If New York can't be important in presidential politics, at least it does know how to be interesting. Also, what City Room is reading in other newspapers and blogs. 

 BODY:
While much of the political world concerned itself with Herman Cain and whether he had straying eyes and hands, New Hampshire gave the presidential race definitive shape on Wednesday. It announced that its primary, traditionally the first, will be held on Jan. 10, a week after the Iowa caucuses.
Where, you may wonder, does that leave New York? As usual, on the outside looking in, nose pressed against the glass.
Our presidential primary is scheduled for April 24. By then, two dozen other states will have voted. In theory, the Republican candidates could still be clawing at one another, thus making New York a possible king- or queen-maker. But more than likely, we will once again be rendered inconsequential at the polls.
Republicans in particular have no reason to put much stock in a state where their presidential candidates have lost 10 of the last 13 general elections. Like Democrats, they are content to treat New York, especially this city, with its high concentration of 1 percenters, as possessing only one virtue: it has bundles of campaign cash just waiting to be swept up by an adroit campaign. 
 The main difference between the parties in this regard is that Republican candidates feel obliged for some incomprehensible reason to make obeisance to Donald J. Trump, and perhaps go off to eat mediocre pizza with him. You have to say this for Mr. Cain: He needs no lessons in mediocre pizza.
But if New York can't be important in presidential politics, it does know how to be interesting. Perhaps a little too much, some would say. It is possible that we will have three - count 'em, three - separate days of primary voting in 2012. Would that this were a joke.
There is the April 24 presidential primary. Separately, primaries for Congressional and state legislative races are scheduled for Sept. 11, in keeping with a longstanding practice of holding those elections on the first Tuesday after the second Monday of September. (Are you following all this?)
 The problem is that the Justice Department has taken New York to court to force it to move up the Congressional primaries to no later than mid-August. A 2009 federal law, the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act, requires that ballots be mailed to military and overseas voters at least 45 days in advance of regularly scheduled federal elections. It would be very difficult for even an efficient state holding primaries near the middle of September to get its act together to send out the ballots in time. As you may have noticed, Albany and efficiency rarely appear in the same sentence.
In 2010, the state obtained an exemption from the 45-day rule. It is seeking a similar waiver for 2012. No way, the Justice Department says - enough with the delays. In a few weeks, it will be up to a federal judge in Albany, Gary L. Sharpe, to offer his opinion.
If he refuses to grant the requested exemption, and the appellate courts uphold his ruling, the result could be three primary days - one for president in April, one for Congress in August and one for state offices in September.
Albany could make the situation less painful by moving the state elections as well to August. But Democrats and Republicans in the capital, you will absolutely not be shocked to hear, cannot agree on a date.
Then again, you never know. It's always possible that the judge will approve that exemption. In that case, "we will stick with the September primary," said Douglas A. Kellner, a co-chairman of the State Board of Elections.
But that creates yet another problem: the 9/11 factor. This is the second time since the terrorist attacks that Sept. 11 will fall on a New York primary day, as it did in 2001. The first time, in 2007, the State Legislature voted overwhelmingly to delay the balloting by a week.
It has become almost an article of faith among politicians that the one thing New Yorkers must not be allowed to do on the 9/11 anniversary is engage in the most basic function of our democracy: voting. So even if the state triumphs in federal court, lawmakers are not above shifting the primaries from Sept. 11 anyway - all the while insisting, of course, that the terrorists did not win.

HEADLINE: Readers Respond: Greece on the Brink

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Readers respond to an editorial on the Greek bailout. 

 BODY:
Today's editorial on Greece makes two basic points. 1) Although it's understandable that Prime Minister George Papandreou wants a mandate to press forward with onerous austerity reforms, political referenda are not generally a good idea "with their simplistic yes or no answers to complicated policy questions." 2) European leaders should pay more attention to the distress of ordinary Greeks, and should emphasize growth in a new bailout deal.
Some readers take issue with the board's anti-referendum stance. EMP of Washington, D.C. says Mr. Papandreou "has done exactly the right thing by giving the voters of Greece a say in the future course of their country." Peter of Kenosha, Wis., agrees: "This is an insult to direct democracy itself. Leaving matters like this to the unelected eurocrats hiding behind their closed doors in Brussels are the ones who created this mess in the first place!"
Others focus on whether Greece even belongs in the European Union. The Greeks "fudged their admission data and most of the rest of Europe knew that or turned a blind eye," writes RB of Korea. "Bring back the Drachma and let them make a go of it with their own currency." BH of the United Kingdom makes the same historical point "Greek officials hugely underreported or misrepresented, as they have admitted, their financial status in order to join the euro-zone."
Yet others feel the board is being too soft on Greece. Pierre from Paris says "no matter how you look at it, this is Greece's fault, not Germany's or France's. yes, I do feel bad for the Greeks. But I feel worse for European taxpayers."
Thanks for these comments.

HEADLINE: #OccupyWallSt Roundup, Day 48

BYLINE: JILLIAN DUNHAM


HIGHLIGHT: Protesters left Zuccotti Park on Thursday to visit neighbors, specifically Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank; The New York Post cried "Enough"; librarians get involved. 

 BODY:
It has been a noisy couple of days at the Goldman Sachs building in Lower Manhattan. After a mock trial at Zuccotti Park Thursday morning ended with the investment bank being found guilty of corruption, protesters marched to the bank's headquarters and staged a sit-in. 
On Twitter, a reporter for "Democracy Now!" said that the police had reported that more than a dozen protesters were arrested for disorderly conduct.
It was the second Occupy-related visit to Goldman Sachs in 24 hours. Hearing rumors that former President George W. Bush had made an unannounced visit to the investment bank,protesters chanted outside the bank Wednesday evening. The group did not have contact with the former president. [Politico]
After another protest in Oakland, Calif., that went into the early hours of Thursday morning, some are asking whether the protests in New York are being overshadowed by events on the West Coast. [New York Times, Atlantic Wire]
On its front page,The New York Post said "Enough" to disruption in lower Manhattan and demanded that Mayor Bloomberg put an end to the protests. [New York Post]
Hundreds of barricades were removed from Wall Street facades Wednesday for the first time in weeks, following a barrage of complaints from lawmakers, local merchants and residents. [New York magazine]
In addition to visiting Goldman Sachs, organizers of Occupy Wall Street events are also regularly visiting another bailout beneficiary, Deutsche Bank, using the atrium of its building at 60 Wall Street for meetings. [Salon]
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, said he sympathized with protesters' frustration over income inequality and the sluggish economy, but said that the movement had misconceptions about the Federal Reserve, echoing comments made on Wednesday by JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon. [The Los Angeles Times, Seattle Times]
A coloring book attempts to explain the Occupy Wall Street movement to children, presenting views from Rush Limbaugh and Rachel Maddow and including a guilt-release form for "1 percenters." [CBS St. Louis]
Many expected college campuses to be a source of support for the movement (Harvard students boycotted an economics class with a perceived conservative bias on Wednesday). But did anyone expect guerrilla librarians? Some at academic institutions and elsewhere have volunteered their services to the cause. [Harvard Crimson, Inside Higher Education]
Concerned with protecting the movement's brand, protesters decided not to spend $150,000 to buy occupy.com from domain squatters, but negotiated a purchase of occupywallstreet.net for $8,000. [Atlantic Wire]

HEADLINE: Amid Wall Street Protests, Smaller Banks Gain Favor

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Some customers angry at big banks are finding refuge in community banks and credit unions. 

 BODY:
Vince Siciliano - a Birkenstock-wearing, organic food-eating, public transportation-riding sympathizer of Occupy Wall Street who earns $240,000 a year - is far from a banking baron.
But as the chief executive of New Resource Bank in San Francisco, Mr. Siciliano has managed to pull off what his bigger rivals have not: turn a profit and stay out of the line of fire.
 "Our business has tripled this month," said Mr. Siciliano, 61, referring to October. "We have had nonstop, all day long, people moving their money."
New Resource, a small community bank that focuses on sustainable and "planet-smart" small businesses and nonprofits, is one of the many community-based lenders benefiting from the criticism of Wall Street.
In recent weeks, big banks, already barraged by flagging profits and widespread layoffs, have been a focus of global protests and disparagement over new fees. A $5 monthly debit card fee introduced by Bank of America provoked enough outrage that the company retracted its decision. An online campaign, called Bank Transfer Day, that encourages clients of the nation's largest banks to park their money elsewhere, has attracted more than 75,000 Facebook commitments from angry customers of big banks.
On the margins, customers are seeking out alternatives like community banks and credit unions. Without the obligations to generate huge returns for public shareholders, these smaller banks often can charge lower fees and pay higher interest rates than their bigger competitors. More than 650,000 people have joined credit unions since Sept. 29 - the day Bank of America announced its debit card fee - and have brought in an estimated $4.5 billion in new deposits, according to a survey conducted by the Credit Union National Association.
"I think it's a last-straw thing," said Bill Cheney, the association's chief executive. "Even though banks are backing up on some of their fees, there's a sense that if it's not this fee, its going to be something else."
In October, New Resource added 150 new accounts and $1.5 million in deposits. GreenChoice Bank, a company based in Chicago that describes itself as a "green community bank," has opened at least 100 new accounts since Occupy Wall Street began, including one for a couple who drove from Darien, Ill., 25 miles away, to move their money.
 "People vote with their deposits," said Steve Sherman, GreenChoice's chief operating officer. "It all points to a broader cultural shift in what people expect from their bank, and from the companies they're doing business with."
 Many bankers at these smaller companies come from traditional finance backgrounds. Mr. Siciliano spent 10 years at Bank of America, where he worked in Asia on corporate finance projects, before decamping to community banking. His switch to New Resource in 2009 required a major attitude shift.
 "I tell people, there's slow banking and fast banking," Mr. Siciliano said. "In fast banking, you say, how fast can I grow? How high are my prices? How high an internal rate of return can I generate? Whereas slow banking says, it's not about an exit strategy. It's about building a long-term franchise around the mission."
When Mr. Siciliano arrived at New Resource, during the financial crisis, it was in a state of disrepair. Deposits had shrunk, and federal regulators had ordered the bank to clean up its balance sheet. But after the bank began marketing itself as a green alternative to mainstream bank, and it became certified as a B-corporation - a type of corporation that encourages businesses to focus on creating environmental and social benefits as well as profits - business began to thrive. Last quarter, New Resource made a profit of $196,000, compared with a loss of $433,000 a year ago. 
"It's a good time for us," Mr. Siciliano said. "Midsized foundations and nonprofits and companies are being asked by their boards, 'Why do we bank at Wells Fargo or Bank of America?' And we're able to step in and offer an alternative."
Part of the appeal of smaller banks has always been their focus on local investments. New Resource's clientele is West Coast-centric, and includes Bay Area small businesses like San Francisco's Haight Street Market in addition to people in the area.
"It's a way to put your money in an institution that is investing in your community, and holds that as one of its core values," said Jeannine Jacokes, chief executive of the Community Development Bankers Association, a trade group.
There are drawbacks, too. Many smaller banks lack the expansive ATM networks and online banking services of larger companies. And it can take weeks to move an account and set up auto-pay bill systems and direct deposits and have checks clear.
Michael Radparvar, the co-founder of Holstee, a lifestyle goods company in New York, does the company's banking at Bank of America. He and his colleagues were contemplating switching to a smaller bank but had not decided whether the hassle would be worth it.
"The whole purpose is beautiful, and it jibes really well with our personal values," he said. "It's a matter of us finding a way to switch systems that's seamless and doesn't mess with the flow of what we're working on."
For some customers, though, feeling connected to a local bank is all that matters. David Becker, president of PhilippeBecker, a design firm in San Francisco, and a Bank of America refugee, said he had found shelter in a small local credit union, which charged him fewer fees, even though it lacked some of the conveniences of a larger bank.
"What's a pretty Web interface worth?" he said. "What are you really getting?"
Mr. Becker, who has been keeping his business accounts at the Bank of San Francisco, a small local bank, for years, said it would be difficult to go back to his impersonal, fee-laden life as a big-bank customer.
"I called my credit union up the other day, and someone answered the phone," he said. "I was like, holy smokes! I'm on a different planet!"

HEADLINE: Eat Local: A Clarification

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A few more thoughts on sustainable farming. 

 BODY:
A little elaboration on yesterday's column.
To my (mostly European) friends who've wondered about traditional American isolationism being part of my motivation in encouraging the States to grow more of our own food: First of all, I'm not arguing that we bar exports (how would we get coffee?); I'm just arguing that we support local agriculture at the expense of exporting commodities and importing foods we can grow ourselves, or out-of-season foods that we really could live without. Right now the "system" encourages growing commodities and either selling them for processing (corn and go to animal feed, or high fructose corn syrup, or oil, or filler) or exporting them - where they go for the same things. Let's encourage growing vegetables and other plants for human consumption, so we don't have to import so many of them. (And if we produce too much of those for us to eat, by all means, let's sell 'em to whoever wants to buy 'em.)
It also pays to remember that the United States is roughly the size of Europe. Shipping apples from Washington to Texas is roughly equivalent to shipping oranges from Spain to Germany, and giving some kind of preferential treatment to Washington over South African apples may be a tad nationalist but it's hardly isolationist; it's keeping our trade - and our economy, and our produce - more local, or at least regional, when possible.
More worrisome is the criticism that says that our imports aid small farmers all over the world; and to some extent that's true: We buy what others grow, and if the others are small farmers, that's a good thing. But if we were really worried about other countries' small farmers, we'd stop flooding overseas markets with corn, soy and cotton, a tactic that's put small farmers out of business in many developing countries, notably Mexico, whose corn farmers have suffered mightily since the institution of NAFTA.

HEADLINE: The European Debt Crisis and the G-20 Summit Meeting

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Is this week's summit meeting of leaders of the Group of 20 likely to stabilize the world economy? No, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The April 2009 London summit meeting of the Group of 20 is widely regarded as a great success. The world's largest economies agreed on an immediate coordinated approach to the global financial crisis then raging and promised to work together on banking reforms that would support growth. President Obama got high marks for his constructive engagement.
The G-20 heads of government have met twice a year since then, and in Cannes this week they meet again. Could this meeting help stabilize the world economy? Can President Obama again play a leading role? The answer to both questions is likely to be no.
In 2009, the primary problem was slumping economies in the United States and Western Europe. It was in the perceived individual interest of those economies to engage in some fiscal stimulus - and they were happy to present this as a joint approach. China was also willing to stimulate its economy, as its policy makers feared that slowing global trade would reduce Chinese exports. President Obama's appeal for fiscal stimulus around the world was pushing on an open door.

Now the issue is quite different. We have a sovereign debt crisis within the euro zone, in which countries that have borrowed heavily are facing the prospect of restructuring their debts. The euro zone summit meeting last week established that Greek debt would fall by about half (relative to face value), although this does not clearly put Greece onto a sustainable debt path. Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou announced a plan on Monday for a referendum on the plan, a move with the potential to build political support for the needed reforms, and on Wednesday his cabinetoffered its full support. But another outcome -- if the government does not fall in the meantime, making the referendum plan moot -- could be a Greek exit from the euro and a default on its debts in disorderly fashion, without any kind of international framework or outside financial support.
But the real issue is Italy, as it has been at leastsince the summer. The Europeans are only beginning to come to grips with the centrality of Italy in the European debt web - glance at Bill Marsh's recent graphic to get the point. Italy has more than 1.9 trillion euros in debt outstanding; this is the third-largest bond market in the world. In the aftermath of the Greek referendum announcement, the yield on Italian debt rose above 6.1 percent. The standard view is that if this reaches 6.5 percent, Italy will need to seek assistance in the form of a backstop fund to guarantee there will be no default.
But the International Monetary Fund does not have enough resources available and the existing European Financial Stability Facility is also likely to be too small. People in the know talk of the need for more than two trillion euros in a "stabilization fund," and while a lot of fuzzy math is involved in contemporary international financial rescues, the I.M.F. and the stability facility combined would be hard pressed to provide more than a third of that.
This might seem like a good time for a summit meeting - so the hat can be passed around among world leaders. And some people do hope that China can provide an enormous loan, either directly or working with the I.M.F. China, after all, has more than two trillion euros' worth of reserves (not all in euros, of course; much of this is in dollars).
But it's not clear China that wants to take the credit risk of lending directly - the Europeans might not repay, after all. And the United States is not keen to have China funnel such a large amount through the I.M.F.; this would undermine the traditional American predominance there. In today's budgetary environment, there is no way that the United States can come up with anything like matching funds at a level that would make a difference - would you like to ask the House of Representatives for $100 billion right now to help keep Silvio Berlusconi in power?
And the heart of the problem is really European, not global. Specifically, the euro zone needs to address its underlying fiscal structure, which has become severely dysfunctional. It needs a proper fiscal union, with the right to tax and to issue debt - backed ultimately by the European Central Bank. And the ability of member governments to issue debt must be severely curtailed.
The United States faced a similar problem, long ago. The original Articles of Confederation proved inadequate, largely because there was no centralized fiscal authority. The Constitutional Convention convened in 1787 in large part because the United States had defaulted on its debts, incurred during the War of Independence - and there was no way forward without a new agreement among the original 13 states and greater fiscal powers (and more) for the federal government.
Europe needs the equivalent of a constitutional convention. But today's financial markets move so much faster than 200 years ago, and the delay in Europe has already been excessive. The Europeans need to move fast. Will the Cannes summit meeting speed them up?

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said it is Congress's turn to try spurring the economy. On Wednesday, policymakers at the central bank scaled back their economic outlook. Binyamin Appelbaum reports that they also offered no new measures to spur the economy and decided to keep interest rates at rock bottom.
        
The No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, suggested that the special deficit-cutting committee has the option to request more time from Congress to reach an agreement, Robert Pear writes. Mr. Hoyer said in response to a question that members of the committee could not unilaterally extend the Nov. 23 deadline for their final recommendations, but could ask the full Congress to do so.
        
As reports surfaced that a third woman has accused Herman Cain of sexual harassment while he was the head of the National Restaurant Association, the Republican candidate's campaign sought to shift the blame to his rival, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, Jeff Zeleny, Michael D. Shear and Jim Rutenberg report.
        
The Cain campaign announced on Wednesday that an outside lawyer will review separate allegations that it received potentially illegal donations from a defunct non-profit that was led by his chief of staff, Nicholas Confessore writes.
        
Having a better week than Mr. Cain is former Senator Rick Santorum, who completed a promise on Wednesday to visit all the counties in Iowa ahead of the caucuses in January, Richard A. Oppel Jr. writes.
        
The Republican primary calendar is all set after New Hampshire claimed Jan. 10 for its nominating contest, Michael D. Shear reports. The state's early date between the Iowa caucuses and the South Carolina primary likely provides a boost for former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, The Caucus's blog post notes.
Happening in Washington:

        
Economic data scheduled for release on Thursday include weekly unemployment insurance claims (8:30 a.m.), third quarter productivity and costs (8:30), manufacturing shipments, inventories and orders (10), and weekly mortgage rates.
        
At 9, an oversight panel under the House Energy and Commerce Committee is expected to consider "a motion authorizing the issuance of subpoenas" for certain White House records related to a loan guarantee for the failed solar firm Solyndra.

HEADLINE: Gensler Testifies on MF Global's Downfall

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The top regulator tasked with overseeing the bankrupt brokerage firm MF Global said Thursday that the search continues for more than $630 million in missing customer funds, warning that the protection of client assets is essential to doing business on Wall Street. 

 BODY:
The top regulator tasked with overseeing the bankrupt brokerage firm MF Global said Thursday that the search continues for more than $630 million in missing customer funds, warning that the protection of client assets is essential to doing business on Wall Street.
Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said his agency is still investigating the firm, a powerhouse commodities brokerage run by former New Jersey governor Jon S. Corzine.
"The most troubling aspect about the MF Global situation is the shortfall of customer money at the firm. Segregation of customer funds is the core foundation of customer protection in the commodity futures and swaps markets," he said in prepared testimony. "Segregation must be maintained at all times. Simply put, that's every moment of every day, down to the nano second."
Mr. Gensler added that taxpayers aren't on the hook for MF Global's bankruptcy.
"This was an example of a financial institution having the freedom to fail," he said in response to questioning from Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. "I don't think there's any taxpayer money behind this."
A basic tenet of the brokerage business requires that money handed to the firm by one customer is not mixed with the firm's own money. MF Global filed for bankruptcy on Monday after weeks of anxiety weighed on the firms stock and liquidity. Investors were spooked by the revelation of an outsized bet Mr. Corzine had placed on European sovereign debt, a risky trade given the uncertainty clouding the continent.
The exposure prompted regulators to force MF Global to set aside more cash as a cushion in the event of losses, and ultimately helped convince Moody's rating agency to downgrade the firm. That set in motion a week of panic, where it drew down its credit line and lenders demanded extra cash to protect themselves. MF Global had hoped to orchestrate an 11th hour deal to sell a piece of itself, but those hopes were dashed when the money came up missing. It is unclear where the money went.
Mr. Gensler first spotted a potential shortfall late last week, personally calling MF Global's attorney to alert the firm. But it was not until around 2 a.m. Monday morning that the firm fully recognized the magnitude of the missing money. The disclosure sent bidders fleeing and the firm had no choice but to file for bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Gender Gap on Wages Is Slow to Close

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: A new government study shows that women's pay continues to lag behind men's, and that women continue to predominate in lower-wage jobs. 

 BODY:
First, there was the "mancession" that made the downturn much worse for men. Then, what my colleague Catherine Rampell has called the "he-recovery," which has put more men than women back to work. What has remained consistent is that women remain on the wrong side of the wage gap.
 Even with the same college and professional degrees, men earn more than women. And among so-called creative class workers like architects, teachers, artists, engineers, bankers and journalists, men earn much more than women, even though more women hold such jobs.
 It's similar at the bottom end of the scale. According to a report issued Thursday by the United States Government Accountability Office, a higher proportion of women finish high school than men, a milestone that is a minimum requirement for any job mobility. Women - especially younger women - are also completing bachelor's degrees at higher rates than men. Yet they represent a higher proportion of low-wage workers, defined in the report as those who earn hourly wage rates that put them in the bottom 20 percent of the work force.
 So although women make up 49 percent of the total work force, they represent 59 percent of low-wage workers. (That is down from 63 percent a decade ago.)

When women do not complete high school, they earn less than men who do not have a high school diploma. Undereducated women tend to congregate in occupations that pay less than those taken by men. Women are highly represented in health care and social assistance, for example, where their average wages are about $14 an hour. Men take jobs in construction, transportation or utilities, where their average wages are more than $19 an hour.
Yet such occupational variations cannot fully account for the wage gap. Neither can the fact that women are more likely to work part time than men. 
Adjusted for factors that could affect pay, like age, race, education, number of children in the household and part-time status, women earn 86 cents for every $1 earned by men. That's up from 81 cents in 2000.
But the study, based on an analysis of Labor Department data, could not determine whether other factors, like previous work experience or other choices made by women in the workplace, were keeping their wages from achieving closer parity, or whether there was still some other discriminatory effect.
Senator Robert P. Casey Jr., chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, which commissioned the G.A.O. report, said that he was surprised that despite higher levels of education, the gap between men's and women's pay hadn't narrowed much more. "I would have said we would have seen more progress," said Senator Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat. 
He said the findings made the need for Congressional action on job creation more acute. "Every week that goes by where you don't have progress on those measures is obviously going to make the situation worse for everyone," he said. "But low-wage workers are having some of the most difficult challenges, and those challenges just get more significant."

HEADLINE: Gensler Testifies on MF Global's Downfall

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The top regulator tasked with overseeing the bankrupt brokerage firm MF Global said Thursday that the search continues for more than $630 million in missing customer funds, warning that the protection of client assets is essential to doing business on Wall Street. 

 BODY:
The top regulator tasked with overseeing the bankrupt brokerage firm MF Global said Thursday that the search continues for more than $630 million in missing customer funds, warning that the protection of client assets is essential to doing business on Wall Street.
Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said his agency is still investigating the firm, a powerhouse commodities brokerage run by former New Jersey governor Jon S. Corzine.
"The most troubling aspect about the MF Global situation is the shortfall of customer money at the firm. Segregation of customer funds is the core foundation of customer protection in the commodity futures and swaps markets," he said in prepared testimony. "Segregation must be maintained at all times. Simply put, that's every moment of every day, down to the nano second."
Mr. Gensler added that taxpayers aren't on the hook for MF Global's bankruptcy.
 "This was an example of a financial institution having the freedom to fail," he said in response to questioning from Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. "I don't think there's any taxpayer money behind this."
A basic tenet of the brokerage business requires that money handed to the firm by one customer is not mixed with the firm's own money. MF Global filed for bankruptcy on Monday after weeks of anxiety weighed on the firms stock and liquidity. Investors were spooked by the revelation of an outsized bet Mr. Corzine had placed on European sovereign debt, a risky trade given the uncertainty clouding the continent.
The exposure prompted regulators to force MF Global to set aside more cash as a cushion in the event of losses, and ultimately helped convince Moody's rating agency to downgrade the firm. That set in motion a week of panic, where it drew down its credit line and lenders demanded extra cash to protect themselves. MF Global had hoped to orchestrate an 11th hour deal to sell a piece of itself, but those hopes were dashed when the money came up missing. It is unclear where the money went.
Mr. Gensler first spotted a potential shortfall late last week, personally calling MF Global's attorney to alert the firm. But it was not until around 2 a.m. Monday morning that the firm fully recognized the magnitude of the missing money. The disclosure sent bidders fleeing and the firm had no choice but to file for bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Angered by Reports of Unreported Crime at Zuccotti Park

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Bloomberg said the protesters have a duty to inform the police about crime that takes place at their encampment in Lower Manhattan. 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Thursday called on Occupy Wall Street protesters to report crimes taking place at their encampment in Zuccotti Park, saying that any failure to do so endangers all New Yorkers.
Mr. Bloomberg, speaking the day after prosecutors charged one of the protesters with sexually abusing another park occupant, said he was concerned by reports that protesters had been chastising perpetrators of crimes and ejecting them from the park, rather than notifying the police.
"If this is in fact happening-and it's very hard to get good information-it is despicable, and I think it is outrageous," Mr. Bloomberg said. "It really allows the criminal to strike again, making all of us less safe."
The mayor said that the police stand ready to assist the protesters by investigating alleged criminal activity at the park, but that the protesters had a moral obligation to enlist the police's help.
When protesters "who were victims of crimes have come forward, the N.Y.P.D. has moved swiftly and made arrests," Mr. Bloomberg said, adding: "You just don't have a right, and it's not fair to everybody else, to not report a crime when it occurs."
Mr. Bloomberg said that the 26-year-old man who was charged with sexual abuse on Wednesday was also a suspect in a rape case at Zuccotti Park.
The mayor spoke about his crime concerns as he took questions during a global cities summit at Columbia University, organized by his administration along with Columbia and the World Bank.
He declined to say whether there would become a point at which the city would simply evict protesters from Zuccotti Park.
"It is one of these problems that there is no easy answer," he said. "But there is a right answer, and the right answer is allow people to protest but at the same time enforce public safety-provide public safety and quality of life issues, and we will continue to do that."
While defending the protesters' right to express themselves, the mayor also expressed his impatience with them.
"My personal view is, 'Why don't you get out there and try to do something about the things that you don't like - create the jobs that we are lacking, rather than just yell and scream?'" he said. "But if you want to yell and scream, we'll make sure you can do it - but you're not going to do it at the expense of others."

HEADLINE: Gender Gap on Wages Is Slow to Close

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: A new government study shows that women's pay continues to lag behind men's, and that women continue to predominate in lower-wage jobs. 

 BODY:
First, there was the "mancession" that made the downturn much worse for men. Then, what my colleague Catherine Rampell has called the "he-recovery," which has put more men than women back to work. What has remained consistent is that women remain on the wrong side of the wage gap.
 Even with the same college and professional degrees, men earn more than women. And among so-called creative class workers like architects, teachers, artists, engineers, bankers and journalists, men earn much more than women, even though more women hold such jobs.
 It's similar at the bottom end of the scale.

HEADLINE: Romney Previews His Economic Speech

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney would eliminate all nonessential government programs and return many federal programs to the state level. 

 BODY:
EXETER, N.H. - Mitt Romney took on fiscal responsibility and spending cuts Thursday evening at Exeter's town hall, an old building that local residents and high school students filled to almost overflow capacity as they came out to hear Mr. Romney's thoughts on turning around the economy.
Holding up several sheets of yellow legal paper filled with scribbled longhand notes, Mr. Romney apologized if he stumbled a bit, noting that he "wrote these notes in the automobile."
Mr. Romney's speech, delivered to a packed gallery - including some students from the nearby Phillips Exeter Academy who bragged they had scammed their way out of class early to attend-offered a preview of his addressFriday in Washington, D.C. to fiscal conservatives at the Americans For Prosperity Foundation's annual summit. Mr. Romney stood in front of a large "Cut the Spending" sign, and was flanked in the background by his wife, Ann, former New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu, and former New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg.
 "The right course for us right now is to be fiscally responsible, and to recognize that deficits do matter - they matter a lot," he said. "We're a party that recognizes you don't spend what you don't have."
As he has at previous events in New Hampshire, Mr. Romney cast the choice in moral terms, placing the Republican party in the moral high ground.
"We have a moral responsibility not to spend more than we take in, we have a moral responsibility not to pass onto our kids the spending of our generation," he said. "It is a moral responsibility to believe in fiscal responsibility. We do, and I do."
He also touted his experience in the private sector, explaining that he would run government in what he said was the same fiscally responsible manner he used to grow Staples, the office supply giant. As a counterpoint, he cited Solyndra, the solar power company that received government funds and is now facing bankruptcy and embroiled in scandal.
"Their corporate headquarters looked like the Taj Mahal, they had showers that looked like spa showers," he said. "Oh, these guys were living high because it was government money. It was someone else's money. It was the taxpayer's money."
In an in USA Today, Mr. Romney wrote that he would "bring federal spending as a share of GDP down from last year's staggering 24.3% to 20% or below," which would require roughly $500 billion in spending cuts in 2016.
To do so, he explained, he would eliminate all non-essential government programs, return federal programs to the state level, and improve the productivity and efficiency of the federal government.
"Washington is full of sacred cows that supposedly can't be slaughtered and electrified third rails that allegedly can't be touched," Mr. Romney wrote. "But if we do not act now, the irresistible mathematics of debt will soon lead to unimaginable peril."
At the town hall, Mr. Romney further articulated some of the programs he would cut.
"Now there's some programs that I just don't like, which will be easy to eliminate, like Obamacare," he said, to applause, citing a savings of roughly $90 billion.
But he also cautioned that there were programs he likes, and that there would be tough choices, rattling off the questions he would ask himself when deciding whether a government program was absolutely necessary.
"Do we have to have that program?" Mr. Romney said. "Is it essential for America? Is it so essential that it's worth borrowing the money to pay for it from China, knowing that we'll never pay it back in my generation, but instead pass it onto my kids and to their kids?"
His plan, Mr. Romney said, is "the smaller, simpler, smarter approach to government."
"A world without America as a leader is a world I'm not willing to pass along to my kids and grandkids," he concluded, before turning the podium over to Mr. Sununu, who recently endorsed his presidential bid.
Mr. Sununu had some wisdom of his own.
Eyeing Mr. Romney approvingly, the former governor of New Hampshire explained: "Iowa picks corn - New Hampshire picks presidents."

HEADLINE: As Regulators Pressed Changes, Corzine Pushed Back, and Won

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Jon S. Corzine, the head of MF Global, carried significant weight in the worlds of Washington and Wall Street, and he used it to stop the plans of financial regulators. 

 BODY:
Months before MF Global teetered on the brink, federal regulators were seeking to rein in the types of risky trades that contributed to the firm's collapse. But they faced opposition from an influential opponent: Jon S. Corzine, the head of the then little-known brokerage firm.
As a former United States senator and a former governor of New Jersey, as well as the leader of Goldman Sachs in the 1990s, Mr. Corzine carried significant weight in the worlds of Washington and Wall Street. While other financial firms employed teams of lobbyists to fight the new regulation, MF Global's chief executive in meetings over the last year personally pressed regulators to halt their plans.
The agency proposing the rule, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, relented. Wall Street, which has been working to curb many financial regulations, won another battle.
 Yet with MF Global in bankruptcy and regulators scrambling to find $630 million in missing customer funds, Mr. Corzine's effort may come back to haunt him.
The proposed rule would have restricted a complicated transaction that allowed MF Global in essence to borrow money from its own customers. Brokerage firms are allowed to use customers' money to earn interest, not unlike banks, but this rule would have outlawed using customer funds for a loan to the firm itself.
While such financing is not unknown on Wall Street, it carries substantial risk. An outside lender would require a firm like MF Global to produce strict accounting for a loan. Without that oversight, regulators worried that firms could use such internal customer money inappropriately, including bolstering the business in hard times. The proposed rule would have affected several dozen other financial firms.
Regulators are now examining whether these transactions explain the missing money at MF Global, according to people briefed on the investigation.
The C.F.T.C. has issued subpoenas to MF Global's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is also conducting an inquiry. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also looking into the missing money, although there is no indication that criminal laws were broken.
Still, Mr. Corzine has hired a prominent criminal defense lawyer, Andrew J. Levander, a partner at Dechert, according to people briefed on the matter.
Mr. Levander represented a number of Wall Street executives after the financial crisis of 2008, including the independent directors of Lehman Brothers and John A. Thain, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch.
Neither Mr. Corzine nor MF Global has been accused of wrongdoing. MF Global declined to comment and Mr. Corzine did not respond to a request for comment.
Just three months ago, Mr. Corzine's firm assured regulators that the proposed rule could cripple the futures brokerage industry by hurting their profitability. In a letter, MF Global told regulators that they were trying to "fix something that is not broken," adding that the firm was not aware of any brokerage firm like itself that was unable to "provide to their customers upon request any segregated funds."
MF Global's clients, including hedge funds, individual investors and agricultural firms, now know a different reality, as the clients struggle to locate their missing funds. And regulators are pushing to again move forward on the rule. But for MF Global, the rule will come too late.
The trades at the center of MF Global's downfall - big bets on the debt of five European countries - may yet prove profitable. But they raise questions about why the firm escalated its risk-taking under Mr. Corzine, leading to a crisis of confidence among rating agencies, creditors and regulators.
As a former sovereign debt trader at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Corzine wagered that the European regulators would backstop any default. So even as dark clouds circled over Europe, he sensed an opportunity. Starting in late 2010, MF Global began to accumulate short-term sovereign debt of countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal.
MF Global financed these purchases through complex transactions known as repurchase agreements. In these, the bonds themselves were used as collateral for a loan to purchase them. The interest paid on that loan was less than the interest the bonds paid out, earning the firm a profit from the spread.
While that practice is quite common, the C.F.T.C. wanted to crack down on such lending in those instances when customer funds were used. The C.F.T.C. proposal would have also banned the use of client funds to buy foreign sovereign debt.
It is unclear whether the firm used client funds to purchase the risky bonds of Italy, Spain, and other debt-laden European nations, but experts say it is not unusual for such transactions to be paid for with customer money.
A person close to MF Global said the firm did not use client funds to finance these trades.
Leading the government's effort to curtail these arcane practices was Gary Gensler, the chairman of C.F.T.C., who had worked for Mr. Corzine at Goldman Sachs. Mr. Gensler pushed for the proposed change in October 2010, and planned to bring it to a vote this summer.
MF Global has four outside lobbyists in Washington, tiny by Wall Street standards. But it was Mr. Corzine who marshaled the firm's response to the proposal, lobbying most of the agency's five commissioners directly. One commissioner said he visited with Mr. Corzine in MF Global's headquarters, and acknowledged being impressed by the Wall Street titan, said a person with direct knowledge of the meeting who asked for anonymity because the meeting was private.
The C.F.T.C. polices the markets for futures trades. Staff members there often do not have a Wall Street pedigree.
Mr. Corzine's background in finance made him highly credible, agency officials said.
Mr. Corzine's efforts culminated on July 20, as the agency was preparing for a vote on the proposal. That day, MF Global executives were on four different calls with the agency's staff. Mr. Corzine himself was on two of those calls.
One of the calls was with Mr. Gensler. Both men are active Democrats, and served on financial panels together recently.
Shortly after the calls, Mr. Gensler, aware that he could not push the vote through, decided to delay the proposal indefinitely.
But after MF Global's blowup and the ensuing fallout from the missing funds, regulators said they were considering pushing again on the rule.
"I think it's time to move ahead - expeditiously - and make that rule tighter, cleaner, and ultimately safer, for customers," Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the C.F.T.C., said in a statement.
Mr. Chilton also wants the agency to require firms to produce detailed documentation "to ensure that the funds are really there."
Internal repurchase agreements emerged on Wall Street in 2005. At the time, the transactions were off limits to banks and brokerage firms. But at the urging of Lehman Brothers, the C.F.T.C. blessed the new approach to getting financing.
In September 2008, Lehman collapsed amid a global financial crisis. It later was disclosed that Lehman's use of another little-known repurchase agreement allowed it to temporarily obscure billions of dollars in losses.

HEADLINE: In Rick Perry's Speeches, a Growing Anti-Washington Theme

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: As the Cain controversy explodes, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is sticking to economic themes. 

 BODY:
JOHNSTON, Iowa - As controversy swirls around rival Herman Cain, the evolving strategy of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas as he readies for the Iowa caucuses in two months has become clear: To paint himself as the most anti-Washington candidate in the Republican field.
On Tuesday, he said the Internal Revenue Service had become a "taxpayer harassment agency."
And on Thursday, at a carefully choreographed appearance at a company here, he declared that "Wall Street and Washington, D.C. have been in bed together way too long."
Making anti-bailout comments, he suggested that companies should never be allowed to grow large enough that their failure would hurt the economy.
"If you are too big to fail, you are too big," Mr. Perry said. "I don't care whether you are a country or whether you are a corporation." The comments appeared to be a suggestion to either prevent companies from growing so large that failure posed a systemic risk to the economy, or to break up companies that have already grown that large. A spokesman for Mr. Perry did not respond to a request for elaboration.
Mr. Perry also stated that regulation and taxes are why corporations have moved offshore, not, as economists believe, for reasons like lower wages or because they have emerging markets for their products in foreign countries.
"They did not leave to begin with just because they could find cheap labor somewhere. That may have been part of a formula, but it is not the reason they left," he said. 
"I would suggest to you they left because they were over-regulated and the cost of that regulation and the tax structure that we have in place in this country is what drove the masses away."
Offering a different view, the World Bank has said that the United States has one of the easiest and most business-friendly regulatory systems in the world. 
Mr. Perry does not expect applause from Washington for his tax plan, which would scrap the graduated income tax and replace it with a 20 percent flat rate, cutting taxes for the wealthy. "The establishment," he said, "really doesn't like" it.

HEADLINE: The Powerless In a Power City

BYLINE: By ROB COX

 BODY:
The moneyed folk inhabiting the Connecticut environs of the hedge fund town Greenwich wield plenty of power. But many of them have lately been powerless. For the second time in barely more than two months, a huge swath of the two million captive customers of Northeast Utilities, the power company that covers territory from the Constitution State up through western Massachusetts and into New Hampshire, have spent too many days without electricity.
In an echo of the financial crisis, it turns out that better risk management and stronger regulation could have made the fallout much less bad. This raises serious questions about Northeast's competence -- and whether it should be allowed to complete a $4.7 billion takeover of a Massachusetts rival, Nstar. 
The first blow was Hurricane Irene in August. Then came a once-in-a-generation pre-Halloween snowstorm. Both were highly unlikely and unpredictable events, utilities argue, so when uprooted trees and snow-laden branches took down power lines, the responsibility lay mainly with God.
But giving Northeast, specifically its Connecticut Light and Power subsidiary, a divine pass is like absolving Lehman Brothers of any blame for its demise in 2008. Like financial firms, utilities need to manage risks. And they have it relatively easy: much of the task simply involves clearing overhanging trees and other hazards from power lines.
Yet according to regulatory filings, Connecticut Light and Power cut its maintenance spending by 26 percent, from $130 million in 2008 to $96.5 million last year. Put simply, that seems to suggest that one in every four trees that could have been trimmed was left untouched, though the company says the maintenance line was depressed by a deferral of expenses for accounting purposes.
The utility showed the same kind of tin ear as some banks, too. Even as customers still faced a week without electricity after Irene struck, the Connecticut Light and Power boss, Jeff Butler, suggested any restoration costs should be covered by increasing electricity rates -- when Connecticut's power is already the most expensive in the continental United States. Mr. Butler later backtracked. But this week he suggested the weekend snowstorm came without warning -- words he was again forced to eat.
There's even a near-perfect model of how Connecticut Light and Power could have done the job better. Norwich, Conn., a city of 40,000, has owned its own electric utility, as well as those for sewage, gas and water, for 107 years. Norwich Public Utilities' customers pay, on average, a bit less than Connecticut Light and Power's. Yet after this past weekend's snow dump, power was out for only about 450 of its 22,000 customers -- and for no more than an hour. As of Thursday morning, nearly half a million Connecticut Light and Power customers were still waiting for the lights to go on.
That's not luck, either. After Irene hit, just 13 percent of the city's customers lost their power for more than a day. Within three days, the whole of Norwich had been restored. It took more than a week for Connecticut Light and Power to fully restore power.
That makes it seem odd that Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has tended to appear alongside Connecticut Light and Power's Mr. Butler and to support the utility, even though far more customers lost power than should have and restoration proceeded too slowly. There's solid numerical evidence to justify Mr. Malloy's berating Connecticut Light and Power and calling for Mr. Butler's head on behalf of the citizens of his state.
In contrast to Connecticut Light and Power, Norwich's electric unit last year increased operations and maintenance spending by 11 percent, to $2.9 million. Put another way, in 2010 Norwich allocated about $132 a customer to this line item in its accounts. Connecticut Light and Power reported maintenance, unadjusted for deferred expenses, of $96.5 million, or around $78 per client.
It helps that the Norwich utilities are not slaves to the profit motive -- though they hand 10 percent of gross revenue to the city. Last year, before paying this slice to the city, the electricity division made just a 3.6 percent operating profit margin on its $52.3 million of revenue. The Connecticut Light and Power division of Northeast, meanwhile, booked $3 billion of revenue last year and reported an operating margin nearly five times the size of Norwich's. But it surely also helps that Norwich Public Utilities' general manager, 12 linemen and five commissioners live in the community, drive the local roads, see the overhanging branches and bump into their customers at the Norwichtown Mall. That's a rare kind of accountability.
Absent more help from the governor, the example of Norwich and similar municipally owned utilities in Groton and Wallingford, Connecticut communities fed up with the lights going out might consider emulating Boulder. Citizens of the Colorado college town this week voted to study a plan to buy back their local utility assets from a Minnesota-based mega-utility, Xcel Energy.
Meanwhile, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities should pay close attention. Northeast's purchase of Nstar has been pending approval of the department's three commissioners for a year now. If they want the residents of their state to avoid the cold and darkness experienced by hundreds of thousands of Northeast's customers next time the wind shifts, they may need to resist the persuasive powers of big business trying to get bigger still.

HEADLINE: In Surprise, A.I.G. Posts Wider Loss

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The American International Group posted a $4.1 billion quarterly loss on Thursday as a result of declines in the value of mortgage investments, charges at its aircraft leasing unit and a write-down of its stake in a former Asian subsidiary. 
The loss, which translated to $2.16 a share, was nearly double A.I.G.'s $2.52 billion loss a year earlier. The operating loss, which excludes some investment results, was $3 billion, or $1.60 a share. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a loss of 30 cents a share.
The company's chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, 67, is focusing on global property-casualty coverage and life insurance after scaling back in Asia and unwinding bets from the derivatives unit that drove A.I.G. to the brink of failure in 2008. He is asking potential investors to look beyond market fluctuations in the insurer's portfolio as he seeks private capital to replace Treasury Department bailout money.
The A.I.G. board approved the repurchase of as much as $1 billion in stock, the company said in a separate statement. The timing will hinge on ''A.I.G.'s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors,'' it said.
A.I.G.'s third-quarter results included a mark-to-market loss on A.I.A., its Asian insurance unit, of about $2.3 billion. A.I.G. retained a stake in A.I.A. after divesting itself of two-thirds of the company last year in an initial public offering. A.I.A. sank 17 percent in the third quarter amid the European debt crisis and worries over the American economy.
An agreement with underwriters prohibited A.I.G. from selling any of its remaining stake until last month. The loss at A.I.G.'s plane leasing business, International Lease Finance Corporation, widened to $1.3 billion as it incurred a noncash charge of about $1.5 billion related to aircraft impairments. The business had a loss of $218 million a year earlier.
Shares of A.I.G., which is based in New York, fell 3.17 percent, to $23.85, in after-hours trading.

HEADLINE: Nicaraguan Leader Elicits Disgust and Support, Often From the Same People

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
MANAGUA, Nicaragua -- Ivan Romero, 37, has many colorful ways of describing President Daniel Ortega: mosquito, crook, tyrant, propagandist.
Yet on Sunday, when Nicaragua holds national elections, Mr. Romero will mark his ballot not for the opposition, but for five more years of Mr. Ortega.
''I'm voting for his ideas, not for him,'' said Mr. Romero, a waiter. ''I will cover my nose and do it.''
In this country of 5.7 million people, Mr. Ortega, 65, has flourished as a paradox, a heavy-handed commander who is widely criticized for skirting the democratic process but is known on the streets as the people's president. He has found support from powerful players on all sides, lionized by the left for his focus on the poor and revered by some on the right -- including those who once condemned him -- for his hands-off approach to business. 
He has had less success wooing foreigners. The election is expected to be a major test of Mr. Ortega's relations with Western powers, namely the United States, which is still fuming about his efforts to reinterpret the Constitution to permit his re-election. Tens of millions of dollars in aid to Nicaragua from the United States and the European Union could be in jeopardy if the elections are not free from fraud, analysts contend.
Mr. Ortega, a hero of Nicaragua's revolutionary war more than three decades ago, has sought to dispel the many depictions of him as power-hungry.
In Managua, the capital, his smile beams from billboards that declare ''love, peace and life!'' Christmas tree displays stay lighted in public plazas throughout the year, a reminder that while the world reels from recession, Mr. Ortega has kept Nicaragua's economy humming.
''This democratic process is going in a good direction,'' Mr. Ortega's wife and chief spokeswoman, Rosario Murillo, told local reporters recently. ''That is a reality you feel everywhere. There is a mood of celebration.''
''Without a doubt,'' Ms. Murillo added, ''he will continue being president.''
It is a sign of his sturdy grip that so many seem poised to stand by the president and his party, the Sandinista National Liberation Front. Mr. Ortega was supported by 48 percent of those surveyed in a recent CID Gallup poll, 18 points ahead of his closest rival, Fabio Gadea, a 79-year-old radio personality.
Mr. Ortega has broadened his base of supporters through his success in rejuvenating Nicaragua's economy, most visibly through a partnership with Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela. The alliance has brought about $400 million each year in long-term loans to the $6 billion Nicaraguan economy.
While it is unclear exactly how the money is spent, Mr. Ortega regularly announces new policies aimed at the working class, including fuel subsidies for taxi drivers and land titles for lower-income families.
''He's like a pinata,'' said Carlos Reyes, 53, a farmer in northern Nicaragua who said he had received two cows and a truckload of fertilizer from the government. ''The money keeps coming.''
Mr. Ortega has also won allies in the private sector, a constituency that has long been suspicious of Sandinista candidates and of Mr. Ortega in particular. During his previous stint as president, from 1985 to 1990, Mr. Ortega's policies helped usher in a period of rampant inflation and economic anxiety.
Two decades later, to the surprise of even some in his own party, he has abandoned socialist economic doctrine for a moderate, free-market approach. Under his leadership, tourism and exports have boomed, and labor relations are tranquil.
In a sign of Mr. Ortega's close relationship with business, the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, a national coalition of business chambers, did not endorse a presidential contender this year. In previous elections, it often sided with non-Sandinista candidates.
Though the economy will be front and center on Sunday, Mr. Ortega's history of ignoring complaints about the electoral process, particularly after national and international watchdogs alleged widespread fraud by the Sandinistas in the 2008 municipal elections, has left his critics on a hair trigger.
Already, the Independent Liberal Party has accused Mr. Ortega's party of scheming to pick up votes by denying identification cards to critics of the government, while granting them to Honduran citizens working along the border. (The government disputes the allegations.)
And many still resent Mr. Ortega's political maneuvering to permit his re-election. The Nicaraguan Constitution bars leaders from serving consecutive terms and limits their total service to two terms. But Nicaragua's Supreme Court, which Mr. Ortega controls, ruled in 2009 that the limits violated human rights.
''If the candidate is in the people's interest, they will elect him, and if the candidate does not represent their wishes, they will not elect him,'' Mr. Ortega said in a rare television interview that year. ''Obstacles should not be set up to deny them that right.''
The United States cut about $62 million in aid over concerns about the 2008 elections but has otherwise largely let Mr. Ortega be, wary of provoking anti-American sentiment.
''He goes to the precipice, but he doesn't jump off,'' explained Robert J. Callahan, who stepped down as the American ambassador to Nicaragua in July. ''He does just enough to allow the community of democracies to justify staying and attempting to work with him.''
Mr. Callahan said that if there was evidence of widespread fraud in the elections, the United States should cut off future economic aid to the country, refuse to name a new ambassador and forcefully condemn Mr. Ortega. In a statement, the State Department said it remained concerned about the potential for voting irregularities.
Some Nicaraguans, even those who support Mr. Ortega, said his barbed language had isolated the country. ''He has worsened the relationship unnecessarily,'' said Alvaro Maradiaga, 20, an architecture student from Managua who hopes to spend time in the United States. Nevertheless, Mr. Maradiaga said he would vote along party lines for Mr. Ortega.
Mr. Ortega's rivals in the presidential race have seized on his unilateralist approach, warning that he may move to an extreme if he is re-elected and gains a majority in the National Assembly.
But in a crowded field, his opponents have struggled to win a significant block of voters, and many lack steady financing. They have focused their energy on recruiting young people, given that more than half of Nicaragua's population is under 30.
Mr. Gadea, the radio personality, who used his platform to back the contra rebellion against the Sandinistas in the 1980s, has built the most fervent following. During a recent campaign stop in Matagalpa, a hilly agricultural community in the north, thousands of his supporters marched through the streets downtown, some stopping to tear down Sandinista flags. On a sidewalk, schoolchildren of opposing parties spit at each other and flashed party signs -- two fingers for Mr. Ortega, three for those supporting Mr. Gadea.
''We are going to elect an honorable president, an honorable government, so that this country gets rid of the scar of corruption,'' Mr. Gadea told the crowd. ''We aren't going to ask you if you are liberal or conservative. We will build a government for all.''
For many Nicaraguans, the problems remain the same. Poverty is rampant -- much of the population lives on just a few dollars each day, according to recent estimates -- and unemployment remains high. Education levels are anemic, and violence from the regionwide drug war is beginning to tear at the country's edges.
But many say that in Mr. Ortega, they have found some stability, even if he is not perfect.
''My family can sleep peacefully at night,'' said Mr. Romero, the waiter. ''What else is there to worry about?''

'Horsedreams' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Nov. 17) Dael Orlandersmith's new play explores the breakdown of a family as the result of addiction, leaving a man to face the difficult reality of raising his son alone. Gordon Edelstein directs a cast of four that includes Ms. Orlandersmith. Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'How Much Is Enough: Our Values in Question' (in previews; opens on Nov. 13) This Foundry Theater production, written by Kirk Lynn and directed by Melanie Joseph, ponders questions large and small about our shifting priorities, as the company members seek answers from one another and from the audience in a show that changes from night to night. St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, Brooklyn, (718) 854-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Rooney)
'Hugh Jackman: Back on Broadway' (in previews; opens on Thursday) The Boy from Oz retracts his Wolverine claws and takes a break from training fight-bots to nurture his inner song-and-dance man. Backed by an 18-piece orchestra, Mr. Jackman performs standards, show tunes and pop in an act that comes from sellout runs in San Francisco and Toronto. Broadhurst Theatre, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'King Lear' (in previews: opens on Tuesday) Sam Waterston marks his 12th Shakespeare assignment for the Public by tackling the most challenging role in the canon in James Macdonald's production, with an ensemble that includes Kristen Connolly, Michael McKean, Arian Moayed, John Douglas Thompson, Frank Wood and, as the Fool, Bill Irwin. In a rare foray outside her customary musical-theater domain, Kelli O'Hara plays Regan. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Rooney)
'Private Lives' (previews start on Sunday; opens on Nov. 17) Kim Cattrall and the Canadian actor Paul Gross play the divorced couple whose romance is inconveniently rekindled in Noel Coward's diamantine 1930 comedy of manners. Richard Eyre's revival was first staged last year in the West End of London, where Ms. Cattrall has been a frequent presence since the end of her ''Sex and the City'' television commitments. This production brings her back to Broadway for the first time in almost 25 years. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Queen of the Mist' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Following ''Hello Again'' last season, the Transport Group returns to the composer Michael John LaChiusa. Directed by Jack Cummings III, this new musical, set in 1901, begins the company's 20th Century Project, comprising 10 productions that each focus on a different decade. Mary Testa brings her brassy belt to the role of Anna Edson Taylor, the first woman to attempt to shoot Niagara Falls in a barrel.

'Seminar' (in previews; opens on Nov. 20) The in-demand director Sam Gold makes his Broadway debut with this new comedy from Theresa Rebeck. Lily Rabe, Hamish Linklater, Jerry O'Connell and Hettienne Park play aspiring novelists who sign up for classes with a formidable international literary lion, endowed with the acid tongue and droll delivery of Alan Rickman.

'Standing on Ceremony: the Gay Marriage Plays' (previews start on Monday; opens on Nov. 13) An impressive roster of playwrights contributed to this lineup of short plays celebrating courage in relationships, among them Mo Gaffney, Jordan Harrison, Moises Kaufman, Neil LaBute, Paul Rudnick and Doug Wright. In a production designed to run with a rotating cast, the premiere ensemble includes Craig Bierko, Mark Consuelos, Polly Draper, Harriet Harris, Beth Leavel and Richard Thomas.

'Venus in Fur' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) There are few more overused cliches in show business than ''a star is born.'' But that was the critical consensus when Nina Arianda took charge as a wily actress manipulating her director into submission in this adaptation by David Ives of the 1870 erotic novel by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. The Manhattan Theater Club transfer of Walter Bobbie's production for Classic Stage Company gives Ms. Arianda a new sparring partner in Hugh Dancy. Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Wild Animals You Should Know' (in previews; opens on Nov. 20) A wilderness scout camp provides the setting for an erotically charged game of cat and mouse between two unlikely male friends in this new play by Thomas Higgins.

Broadway
- 'The Book of Mormon' This delightful collaboration between the creators of ''South Park'' (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) and the composer of ''Avenue Q'' (Robert Lopez) is blasphemous, scurrilous and as pure-hearted as a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. No musical has so successfully had it both ways since ''The Producers.'' Casey Nicholaw is the witty co-director (with Mr. Parker) and choreographer (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Chinglish' David Henry Hwang's sporadically funny comedy about a bewildered American businessman seeking his fortune in capitalist China is laid out with the frame-by-frame exactness of a comic strip. That means this bilingual production is easy to follow but hard to embrace with enthusiasm. Leigh Silverman directs (2:00). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Follies' The Kennedy Center's revival of James Goldman and Stephen Sondheim's musical about a reunion of Ziegfeld-style performers looks back as much in anger as in fondness, and that's what makes it so vibrant. Eric Schaeffer directs an electric cast led by Bernadette Peters, Jan Maxwell, Danny Burstein and Ron Raines (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying' Not a natural song-and-dance man, Daniel Radcliffe tries really, really hard as the amoral hero of this 1961 Frank Loesser musical about corporate ladder-climbing. Rob Ashford directed this largely charm-free revival (2:40). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Man and Boy' When Frank Langella plays good, he's fine; but when he's bad, he's a wonder. Here the actor who starred as Dracula and Nixon is charismatically amoral as a 1930s financier who wreaks havoc with other people's money. He is also the one compelling reason to see this revival of Terence Rattigan's 1963 drama, directed by Maria Aitken (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'The Mountaintop' Katori Hall's surprisingly thin new drama, which won the 2010 Olivier Award, depicts the last night in the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Samuel L. Jackson) and his encounter with a feisty motel maid (Angela Bassett). Perhaps best regarded as a comfort play, a nursery-room fable for grownups (1:40). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' The 1994 movie about Australian drag queens in the outback becomes a hyperactively splashy karaoke musical so desperate to show the audience a gaudy good time that the results are mostly enervating. Tony Sheldon brings some warmth as the transsexual Bernadette, but the show is mostly a riot of spangles, sequins and silly costumes (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Relatively Speaking' This slight but mostly enjoyable trio of short plays by Ethan Coen, Elaine May and Woody Allen won't do much to burnish their established reputations, but the show is chock full of nifty shtick. Marlo Thomas delights as a pampered princess with a dead husband in Ms. May's contribution (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Sister Act' When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the gothic rafters, led by the radiant Patina Miller, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore.

'War Horse' This imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's children's book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that's Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, (800) 432-7250, lincolncenter.org. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
- 'The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs' The accomplished monologuist Mike Daisey weaves the story of the Apple co-founder's life and vision into a darker exploration of the troubling economic disparities that underlie our technology-obsessed age. Smart, engaging and funny, but be warned that you might have second thoughts about purchasing that next shiny gadget (1:50). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)
'Asuncion' Jesse Eisenberg plays a confirmed slacker in a bromance with his former African studies professor (Justin Bartha) in this genial wisp of a comedy written by Mr. Eisenberg (1:40). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, rattlestick.org. (Isherwood)
'The Atmosphere of Memory' It's hard to decide which is more ludicrous: David Bar Katz's backstage drama about a theatrical family (mom's Ellen Burstyn, dad's John Glover) or the play within the play, a weird mashup of Greek tragedy, Strindberg and Gilbert and Sullivan (2:20). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Isherwood)
- 'Cymbeline' The Fiasco Theater's charming production brings lucidity, credibility and gentle magic to Shakespeare's bulky, convoluted tale of star-crossed lovers and schemers in old Britannia, with a multifarious cast of six on a naked stage. Directed by Noah Brody and Ben Steinfeld (2:40). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'Dancing at Lughnasa' Charlotte Moore's production falls a little short on atmosphere but works where it counts most, in the spirited performances of the five women playing the poor, unmarriageable Mundy sisters in the fictional Donegal town of Ballybeg in late summer 1936. Two decades after it was first seen, this transporting Tony-winning memory play by the Irish dramatist Brian Friel has lost none of its humanity or delicacy (2:05). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Rooney)
'The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith' Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith's songs with talk about her life, loves and career. That format seems a bit tired, but Ms. Braden gives it her all (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
- 'The Judy Show: My Life as a Sitcom' The writer and stand-up comic Judy Gold may not have realized her dream of starring in a sitcom about being a 6-foot-3 Jewish lesbian mother of two on the Upper West Side, but she has squeezed several seasons' worth of wry observations about life, career and family into this consistently funny 80-minute monologue, complete with her own droll spins on some classic television theme tunes. For anyone who misses Mary Richards, Maude, Laverne and Shirley, the Bradys, the Partridges and other familiar faces that populated small screens in decades past (primarily the 1970s, but the late '60s, the '80s and the early '90s also get a look), this will be better than an uninterrupted evening of YouTube indulgence (1:20). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
- 'The Lyons' The actress Linda Lavin and the playwright Nicky Silver slyly reinvent that creaky archetype, the smothering, belittling Jewish mother. This play, Mr. Silver's best in some years, also reinvents Mr. Silver's eternal theme of the American family as a sick joke. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes an excellent Michael Esper and Dick Latessa (2:00). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Brantley)
'Milk Like Sugar' Kirsten Greenidge's provocative play pivots on a pact among three black high school girls to get pregnant at the same time. A terrific cast led by a fierce Tonya Pinkins keeps you hooked even when the play moves into predictable moralizing mode (1:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'Rent' Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.'' The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson's watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home. It is as if they're reluctant to make this show their own (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Silence! The Musical' An ''unauthorized parody'' of the grisly movie with the Hannibal Lecter character crooning noxious songs and Jenn Harris giving a hilarious sendup of Jodie Foster's intense Clarice Starling. Not as funny as it needs to be (1:30). 9th Space Theater at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Isherwood)
'Sistas: the Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs. From ''Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do'' to ''Single Ladies,'' you could do a lot worse (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Sleep No More' Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths' career as a movable orgy. The result suggests what might have happened if Stanley Kubrick (of ''The Shining'') had designed the Haunted Mansion at Disney World (2:00). The McKittrick Hotel, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, sleepnomorenyc.com. (Brantley)
- 'Sons of the Prophet' Stephen Karam's wonderful new play is a comedy about how we endure the unendurable. Santino Fontana leads a flawless cast in a kaleidoscopic portrait of the woes that befall a family of Lebanese extraction and the people in their orbit. As smart and funny as it is deeply compassionate (1:45). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Suicide, Incorporated' Andrew Hinderaker's black comedy evolves a bit uneasily into sincere drama in telling the story of the workers at a company that ghostwrites suicide notes.(1:25). Black Box Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundaboutunderground.org. (Isherwood)
'Traces' An energizing evening of acrobatics from the Montreal troupe Seven Fingers. Think of it as cirque du cabaret, in which a group of distinctive talents get to show off the physical equivalents of individual song stylings (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Voca People' This show features space aliens, but it's really all about a cappella music. The visitors have crash-landed on Earth in a ship powered by music, and lots of singing must be done to refuel their ship. The eight singers sound pretty good, despite some overamplification. But most of the show consists of fragments of songs, which becomes annoying; only when the cast is allowed to cut loose and deliver an entire song -- the Doors' ''People Are Strange'' is a highlight -- do things reach their full potential (1:30). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Neil Genzlinger)

'The Berenstain Bears Live! in Family Matters, the Musical' The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are now onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children's book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it's rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55).

'The Greenwich Village Follies' Doug Silver and Andrew Frank's musical revue about the history of the Village is enthusiastically played and has a few nice numbers, but it feels slapdash and not nearly polished enough to pay proper tribute to its dynamic neighborhood.

'Mama, I Want to Sing' A largely new cast (seeded from the Gospel for Teens program in Harlem) gives full-throated life to this long-running gospel musical.

Last Chance
'Any Given Monday' (closes on Sunday) Bruce Graham's biting two-act comedy about the consequences of infidelity focuses on Lenny (Paul Michael Valley), who is crushed after his wife, Risa (Hillary B. Smith), leaves him for another man. Lenny's daughter, Sarah (Lauren Ashley Carter), and his best friend, Mickey (Michael Mastro), are furious at him for not being furious at Risa. Plot twists and sharp dialogue, especially Mr. Mastro's, consistently entertain before this fable reaches its cynically amusing, if wholly unrealistic, conclusion (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Daniel M. Gold)
'The Dumb Waiter' (closes on Sunday) In Harold Pinter's classic one-act, two hit men spend an evening killing time while waiting for news of their target. Meanwhile, a dumbwaiter intermittently delivers written orders for increasingly bizarre foods. While Mr. Pinter's most potent weapons should be his trademark silences, this overproduced production tries to add too many bells and whistles to cover them up (1:10). Duo Theater, 62 East Fourth Street; (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'Intringulis' Carlo Alban's engaging one-man show is a modern immigration story told by someone who lived it. (He came to the United States with his family in 1986, when he was 7.) Mr. Alban punctuates the show with Nueva Cancion songs that he performs with affection and force. They're worth the price of admission (1:30).

'Love's Labor's Lost' (closes on Sunday) Karin Coonrod's rowdy, streamlined production of this early comedy by Shakespeare runs through its paces like a body-slamming lineman. Energetic, variably funny and -- surprisingly -- at its best when it gets serious.

'The Rap Guide to Evolution' (closes on Sunday) A rapper from Canada with a master's in medieval and Renaissance English literature, Baba Brinkman has been a fixture at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in recent years with his hip-hop takes on Chaucer and on oral epics like ''Beowulf'' and ''Gilgamesh.'' In this entertaining 2009 Fringe First award-winner, he tackles Darwin with humor, sharp analytical skills and contemplative social insights, drawing parallels between natural selection and developments in rap that put a whole new spin on Mobb Deep's ''Survival of the Fittest'' (1:30).

- 'Southern Comfort' (closes on Saturday) The 2001 Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize-winning documentary was not an obvious contender for musicalization. But Julianne Wick Davis and Dan Collins have fashioned an affecting folk-bluegrass show out of the tenderly observed chronicle of a surrogate family of transgender friends in rural Georgia. As the female-to-male Robert Eads, suffering from ovarian cancer in a cruel paradox of nature, Annette O'Toole is tremendously moving, while Jeff McCarthy brings touching awkwardness to Robert's male-to-female girlfriend. The songs at times push a little hard for their emotional peaks, but the entire cast displays an affinity for the material under Thomas Caruso's sensitive direction, and the authenticity of the story elevates this unconventional, sad-sweet musical (2:15).

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: 'SOUTHERN COMFORT': (closes on Saturday) This 2001 Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize-winning documentary was not an obvious contender for musicalization.

As the female-to-male Robert Eads, suffering from ovarian cancer in a cruel paradox of nature, Annette O'Toole (above right, with Jeff McCarthy) is tremendously moving, while Mr. McCarthy brings touching awkwardness to Robert's male-to-female girlfriend. The songs at times push a little hard for their emotional peaks, but the cast displays an affinity for the material under Thomas Caruso's sensitive direction, and the authenticity of the story elevates this unconventional, sad-sweet musical (2:15).

HEADLINE: Couple Donates $150 Million to Fight Poverty in Developing Nations

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Stanford University will open an institution aimed at alleviating poverty in developing nations, using $150 million donated by a Silicon Valley investor and his wife.
''More than a billion people live on less than $1.25 a day,'' said Robert E. King, who, together with his wife, Dorothy, made the gift. ''That's just not right.''
The new Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies, which has been nicknamed SEED, will be housed in the Graduate School of Business but will draw students and faculty from around the university. 
The gift is one of the largest Stanford has received this year. The Kings said that was one reason they had decided to give the money to Stanford rather than starting a freestanding nonprofit like the Thrive Foundation for Youth, which they established to support research into programs helping young people and their parents.
''The relationships the university has in Silicon Valley, the range of expertise it has among its professors -- it can't be replicated,'' Mrs. King said. ''The university can make our money more fruitful than we could on our own.''
The institute will teach students, who it hopes will go on to create programs and businesses like the one established by Daniel Spitzer, a Stanford M.B.A. He started Mountain Hazelnut Venture Ltd., to grow hazelnut trees in Bhutan, a tiny, land-locked country wedged between China and India. The company hopes to produce some 40,000 tons of hazelnuts, giving local farmers a lucrative export product and restoring trees to mountainsides stripped by logging.
Hau Lee, a supply chain expert at the Stanford business school who will lead the new institute, estimates that Mountain Hazelnut, which has pledged a portion of profits to local communities, will end up employing 10 percent of the country's population.
''Many people are doing relief or aid operations, but at the institute, we will be asking how we can stimulate entrepreneurs and business ideas so that the people receiving aid today can became self-sufficient so they won't need aid in the future,'' Professor Lee said.
Mr. King, a Stanford business school alumnus, is largely unknown outside start-ups and venture capitalists, but has built a fortune out of R. Eliot King & Company and Peninsula Capital, which was one of the first investors in Baidu, the Chinese version of Google.
That investment came about when Xiangmin Cai, a Chinese graduate student who had lived with the Kings, introduced Mr. King to Robin Li, Baidu's founder.
''I set up an office at 3000 Sand Hill Road, where I managed money,'' Mr. King said, referring to the home of many Silicon Valley venture capital firms. ''I'd sit there, looking out at cows grazing, and people would drop in on me and we'd talk.''
The Kings demurred when Stanford offered to put their name on the new institute, and Mr. King was reluctant to talk much about the investments that had made him wealthy. ''We've had success,'' he said simply.

HEADLINE: Cuba to Allow Buying and Selling Of Property, With Few Restrictions

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Victoria Burnett contributed reporting from Havana.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Cuba announced a new property law Thursday that promises to allow citizens and permanent residents to buy and sell real estate -- the most significant market-oriented change yet approved by the government of Raul Castro, and one that will probably reshape Cuba's cities and conceptions of class.
The new rules go into effect on Nov. 10, according to Cuba's state-run newspaper, and while some of the fine print is still being written, the law published on Thursday amounts to a major break from decades of socialist housing. For the first time since the early days of the revolution, buyers and sellers will be allowed to set home prices and move when they want. Transactions of various kinds, including sales, trades and gifts to relatives by Cubans who are emigrating, will no longer be subject to government approval, the new law says.
''To say that it's huge is an understatement,'' said Pedro Freyre, an expert in Cuban-American legal relations who teaches at Columbia Law School. ''This is the foundation, this is how you build capitalism, by allowing the free trade of property.'' 
Cuban officials would disagree; they argue that they are carefully protecting socialism as they move toward economic reform, and the new law includes some provisions that seem aimed at controlling both speculation and the concentration of wealth. Owners will be limited to two homes (a residence and a vacation property) and financing must go through Cuba's Central Bank, which will charge fees, which have not been determined. And a tax of 8 percent will be split by the buyer and seller.
Nonetheless, experts and Cuban residents -- who have been expecting the law for months -- say the law's implications are likely to be far-reaching. In a country defined by limited change and pent-up demand for freedom of all kinds, they argue, the law will probably open a Pandora's box of benefits and risks.
On one hand, billions of dollars in property assets that have been essentially unvalued or undervalued and locked in place for decades would be available for sale.
Economists on the island favoring economic liberalization have said the country's other changes -- making room for small businesses, and private agriculture -- have been limited by lack of internal demand. Some experts say home sales could free up the capital needed to jumpstart the island's economy. At the very least, they argue, it will probably lead to a boom in renovation.
''With a housing market, suddenly people have some wealth and that's a stake in the economy that generates activity,'' said Ted Henken, a professor at Baruch College in New York.
Yet on the other hand, there are also significant social concerns. Mario Coyula, Havana's director of urbanism and architecture in the 1970s and '80s, said that wide-scale buying and selling would lead to a ''huge rearrangement'' in Havana and other cities as the wealthy move to better areas. He and others said it would inevitably exacerbate class conflict.
And because the island has a shortage of housing -- with many families and even divorced couples continuing to live together for lack of a better option -- critics say that any displacement could raise the prospect of homelessness. For example, if two families are sharing a home and one holds what currently amounts to Cuban title with limited rights, the new law says that the titleholder can sell and the tenant family will eventually have to move.
Many Cubans say they are afraid that the market system will leave them in the lurch.
''What happens if I sell my home and then I can't find another one to buy? Where do I sleep?'' said Felix Mendez, a 47-year-old hospital technician looking at signs for property exchanges tacked to trees on a Havana boulevard. He said he would prefer to stick with the complex bartering system currently in use. (Under the new law, that too will be subject to a tax -- 4 percent of the value of the transaction.)
One unanswered question involves the role of foreigners and Cuban exiles. The law generally requires permanent residency, but Mr. Freyre said the section of the law applying to areas of ''descanso'' or ''veraneo'' -- vacation or summer destinations -- leaves open the possibility of looser enforcement in selected places, perhaps coastal areas, Old Havana and the golf communities that are currently under development with foreign investment.
The new law does not broach the subject of property confiscated by the government in the early years of the revolution. Lawyers and experts say these claims, representing tens of billions of dollars, are still a long shot. Property law worldwide generally favors compensation, not the right of return, and Cuba has yet to show serious interest in addressing the issue. Officials have insisted that the United States must first pay restitution for the economic damage caused by the 1962 trade embargo.
Still, sanctioned or not, Cuban-Americans will undoubtedly find a way into Cuban real estate. With President Obama's 2009 decision to allow unlimited travel and remittances for Cuban-Americans, a constant flow of money and visits has become the norm. In exile communities like Miami, there are already efforts under way to funnel money to relatives so that they can buy new homes or old family homes that were nationalized.
Most experts, and Cubans on the island, expect these efforts to accelerate. Nov. 10 may be the starting gun for an indirect investment race.
''I don't know if they will control the market,'' Philip Peters, an expert at the Lexington Institute in Washington, said of Cuban-Americans. ''But it is certainly going to be the case that the market is going to settle in a way that's heavily influenced by demand from outside Cuba coming from relatives.''
Of course, even if the market is open, it may not be transparent. The culture of hiding wealth, from the government, from neighbors, is deeply engrained in Cuba, and though the new law includes the threat of prison for people caught lying about home prices, Cubans who work in real estate today expect buyers and sellers to disguise the true value of transactions.
''Nobody who has been working, honestly, in a job in Cuba in the past 50 years could possibly afford to buy a second home,'' said Gerardo, a property broker in Havana who asked that his full name not be used because his job was still illegal. ''That money has to come from relatives overseas.''
He added that nascent capitalism would probably include a black market just as hard to figure out and uproot as the underground economy that has grown up around decades of socialism.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales in October Fell Short of Expectations

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
In a potentially troubling sign for the holiday shopping season, retailers released data on Thursday suggesting that Americans were slowing down spending and hunting for discounts.
The retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters posted in October an average increase of 3.4 percent in sales at stores open at least a year compared with the same month last year, missing analyst estimates of 4.5 percent. The disappointing growth followed stronger results in August, when same-store sales rose 4.4 percent, and September, when they rose 5.1 percent.
Analysts and consulting firms have been putting together holiday-growth projections, and most numbers have been gaining in the 3 to 4 percent range. Yet other indicators suggest a weaker holiday season ahead. Consumer sentiment continues to be weak, and ports have been reporting that much less holiday inventory has been coming through their docks than expected. 
''I think it's going to be a turbulent, tough holiday,'' said David Bassuk, managing director and head of the global retail practice at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. ''We've got the consumer in a real value mode.''
A number of retailers were reported to be discounting even more than usual to pump up October sales.
''Even retailers who reported significant upside to sales had to give up margin to drive the incremental sales,'' Adrienne Tennant, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets who follows specialty retailers like American Eagle Outfitters, Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch, wrote in a note to clients.
Other sectors, like higher-end department stores, were refraining from heavy promotions, said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, a research firm. Across the board, Mr. Perkins said in an e-mail, ''discounting has been a factor, but not the only one.''
The good news for retailers is that October is not a critical month for their bottom lines. They typically use it to cut prices on early fall merchandise to make room for holiday stock on the floor. This year, the warm weather at the beginning of the month -- few people want to buy a wool coat when it still feels like summer -- combined with the snowstorm in the Northeast on the last Saturday of the month, contributed to keeping some shoppers out of stores.
Saks Inc., which operates Saks Fifth Avenue stores, posted one of its lowest same-store sales numbers for the year, an increase of 1.8 percent, while analysts had expected 5.4 percent. Nordstrom, the other high-end department store to report on Thursday, said its sales rose 5.4 percent, one of the biggest increases reported, although analysts had expected 6.4 percent.
Still, other data indicated that ''luxury momentum seems to be holding,'' said Michael McNamara, vice president for research and analysis for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which tracks consumer spending.
Among the worst performers in October was Gap Inc., which announced last month it would close one-fifth of its Gap brand stores in the United States by the end of 2013. Its same-store sales slid 6 percent, 0.4 percentage point below what analysts had expected.
J. C. Penney, which has been revising its strategy under a new chief executive, Ron Johnson, said October same-store sales declined 2.6 percent, versus analyst estimates of a 1 percent increase.
Costco reported the biggest increase for October, with same-store sales rising 9 percent, though analysts had estimated its increase would be 9.2 percent. Dillards also turned in a strong performance, blowing past analyst estimates of 3.7 percent to post an 8 percent jump in same-store sales.
Mr. Bassuk said that despite the handful of surprisingly good results, he remained cautious.
''The retailers are optimistic as always,'' he said. But ''unemployment remains tough, the stock market remains turbulent, housing prices are way down, the consumer confidence is at real lows.''
Mr. McNamara said spending on apparel, which was strong for most of the year, had slowed in October. For instance, growth rates of the men's and family apparel categories in October were less than half what they were in September.
''They won't have the same kind of momentum we saw in back to school,'' he said. ''You're kind of right in between back to school, and right before holiday, so October, for apparel sales, can get a bit of a squeeze.''
There were some bright spots in October, Mr. McNamara said.
Electronics had ''the first positive number we've seen since March,'' he said, adding that the interest was most likely driven by new introductions from video game and media companies.
Halloween spending, as measured by dollars spent at drug, gift, novelty and grocery stores, was up 5.1 percent over last year. And the gift-and-novelty part of the spending registered the first increase SpendingPulse had recorded in October since 2006, rising 2.1 percent over last year.

HEADLINE: Petition Drive Challenges Medical Marijuana Ban In Rural California County

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY; Ian Lovett contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Malia Wollan from San Francisco.

 BODY:
BAKERSFIELD, Calif. -- Kern County is not exactly the kind of place where you would expect a voter rebellion, what with its conservative rural residents, its live-off-the-land values and its almost unshakable devotion to the Republican Party.
But over the last several months, Kern County -- about 100 miles north of Los Angeles and as far as it can get from San Francisco -- has become the scene of a civil war of sorts over an issue, medical marijuana, whose supporters are often of a more liberal stripe. At stake is a controversial law -- passed unanimously in August by the county's all-Republican Board of Supervisors -- which would have effectively shut many of the three dozen or so medical marijuana dispensaries in the county.
But a funny thing happened on the way to the ban: medical marijuana advocates started a petition drive to challenge it, calling for a referendum on the law, something that could happen as soon as next year. In the meantime, the law is in limbo. 
And while such an effort is nearly unheard of in Kern -- perhaps the first time in modern memory that anyone can recall a county law being so challenged -- it is not the only place in California, the original medical marijuana state, where local regulation is meeting opposition. Laws passed in several other counties and cities have also been the subject of referendum movements, something permitted by California state law.
In San Jose, for example, advocates for medical marijuana filed tens of thousands of signatures last Friday to try to force a vote on a new law that would have regulated dispensaries there, a development that Mayor Chuck Reed said could cost his city -- facing a $100 million deficit next year -- sorely needed finances to mount an election.
''It's definitely not a small number,'' Mr. Reed said. ''But that's the choice we'll have to make.''
At the same time, some state officials in California are also increasingly perplexed about mixed signs from the federal authorities, who still view marijuana as illegal under federal law despite legislation in more than a dozen states allowing the drug's medical use. The strongest indication of recent federal disapproval came in early October, when four United States attorneys in California said they would crack down on dozens of dispensaries -- which sell marijuana to anyone with a doctor's recommendation -- saying that many are operating as large-scale drug-selling operations, not medically minded collectives, as required by state law.
And while state officials here admit that the current model of distribution is subject to manipulation by those simply wanting to buy marijuana for recreational use, they argue that the federal threats are endangering those who truly need it.
''If there are abuses we should deal with those, but this is not the way to do it,'' said Tom Ammiano, a state assemblyman from San Francisco, who called the federal threats thuggish. ''I expect any day now for a droid to come down on some poor dispensary in Fresno or something and obliterate the people.''
The two men at the heart of the battle over the Kern County ordinance have similar backgrounds -- both with years of law enforcement experience -- but very different attitudes about California's landmark medical marijuana law, Proposition 215, which was passed by voters in 1996. On one side is Sheriff Donny Youngblood, a former Army drill sergeant, who has made it very clear that he thinks the way Proposition 215 is being used now is a ''sham'' that flies the face not only of federal statutes, but also of common decency.
''It's not just a legal stand,'' Sheriff Youngblood said. ''It's really a moral stand.''
On the other extreme is Robert Wade, a narcotics officer turned entrepreneur, who says being laid off led him to open a medical marijuana dispensary and clinic last year, an operation that now brings him a six-figure salary in what he calls ''one of the few growing industries in this country.''
''Five years ago, I was living the American dream,'' said Mr. Wade. ''Now, I'm living the American dream, just in a different avenue.''
Mr. Wade is one of several dispensary owners and supporters who helped finance a movement to collect the 17,000 signatures -- some at booths in front of Wal-Mart -- needed to put the new law to a vote. Those petitions were turned in in early September, temporarily suspending the carrying out of the law. The county board is now considering its next step, but a referendum could come as soon as next spring.
And while the biggest block of Kern's 310,000 registered voters are Republicans, national drug reformers say the vote here could be an indication of what they feel is increasing bipartisan support for medical marijuana.
''For Kern, as a red county, to step up and say, 'Wait a minute,' I think that would really resonate,'' said Ethan Nadelmann, the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, which lobbies for more liberal drug laws.
That said, it will not necessarily be an easy sell. Kern County's right-leaning tendencies are well-documented and deeply felt, including its pride over Representative Kevin McCarthy, a fourth-generation resident who serves as the House majority whip. Even more tellingly, Kern County voters soundly rejected a 2010 measure to legalize recreational use of marijuana, with 65 percent of the vote.
Local supporters of medical marijuana say that they are confident that Kern residents are more independent-minded than that some outsiders expect. ''The people here, they're pretty tough,'' said Gary Fly, a former big rig driver who runs two dispensaries in Kern County. ''They're not the pushover type of people. If they want to fight for their rights, they will.''
But Sheriff Youngblood says that marijuana has been a destructive force in his county, destroying public lands -- where growers often plant -- and bringing into an otherwise largely peaceful rural environment an influx of weapons as a result of what he says are criminal cartels involved in the drug trade. He has conducted several major raids this year, including one in September that netted more than 2,100 plants near the town of Wasco.
He rejects the notion that somehow sick people are being denied succor. ''This marijuana issue is about money,'' he said, ''not about medicine.''
Mr. Wade says that he has, in fact, invested tens of thousands of dollars in his business, a pair of handsomely appointed storefronts just north of Bakersfield in Oildale, near several other marijuana-related dispensaries and horticulture shops. Last week, Halloween decorations adorned Mr. Wade's consultation center as customers compared samples of marijuana mounted on a magnetized board in the dispensary next door.
Mr. Wade, who uses marijuana to treat his own anxiety, said he has been fielding questions from worried patients about whether the local law will stand or a federal crackdown will shut him down. He worries, too, he said, not only for his business but for the nearly dozen workers he has hired in a county with double-digit unemployment.
''There's people here who weren't working before who are working now and are living in apartments and buying cars,'' he said. ''Now they have hope for the future.''

HEADLINE: Amid Wall Street Protests, Smaller Banks Gain Favor

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
Vince Siciliano - a Birkenstock-wearing, organic food-eating, public transportation-riding sympathizer of Occupy Wall Street who earns $240,000 a year - is far from a banking baron.
But as the chief executive of New Resource Bank in San Francisco, Mr. Siciliano has managed to pull off what his bigger rivals have not: turn a profit and stay out of the line of fire.
''Our business has tripled this month,'' said Mr. Siciliano, 61, referring to October. ''We have had nonstop, all day long, people moving their money.'' 
New Resource, a small community bank that focuses on sustainable and ''planet-smart'' small businesses and nonprofits, is one of the many community-based lenders benefiting from the criticism of Wall Street.
In recent weeks, big banks, already barraged by flagging profits and widespread layoffs, have been a focus of global protests and disparagement over new fees. A $5 monthly debit card fee introduced by Bank of America provoked enough outrage that the company retracted its decision. An online campaign, called Bank Transfer Day, that encourages clients of the nation's largest banks to park their money elsewhere, has attracted more than 75,000 Facebook commitments from angry customers of big banks.
On the margins, customers are seeking out alternatives like community banks and credit unions. Without the obligations to generate huge returns for public shareholders, these smaller banks often can charge lower fees and pay higher interest rates than their bigger competitors. More than 650,000 people have joined credit unions since Sept. 29 - the day Bank of America announced its debit card fee - and have brought in an estimated $4.5 billion in new deposits, according to a survey conducted by the Credit Union National Association.
''I think it's a last-straw thing,'' said Bill Cheney, the association's chief executive. ''Even though banks are backing up on some of their fees, there's a sense that if it's not this fee, its going to be something else.''
In October, New Resource added 150 new accounts and $1.5 million in deposits. GreenChoice Bank, a company based in Chicago that describes itself as a ''green community bank,'' has opened at least 100 new accounts since Occupy Wall Street began, including one for a couple who drove from Darien, Ill., 25 miles away, to move their money.
''People vote with their deposits,'' said Steve Sherman, GreenChoice's chief operating officer. ''It all points to a broader cultural shift in what people expect from their bank, and from the companies they're doing business with.''
Many bankers at these smaller companies come from traditional finance backgrounds. Mr. Siciliano spent 10 years at Bank of America, where he worked in Asia on corporate finance projects, before decamping to community banking. His switch to New Resource in 2009 required a major attitude shift.
''I tell people, there's slow banking and fast banking,'' Mr. Siciliano said. ''In fast banking, you say, how fast can I grow? How high are my prices? How high an internal rate of return can I generate? Whereas slow banking says, it's not about an exit strategy. It's about building a long-term franchise around the mission.''
When Mr. Siciliano arrived at New Resource, during the financial crisis, it was in a state of disrepair. Deposits had shrunk, and federal regulators had ordered the bank to clean up its balance sheet. But after the bank began marketing itself as a green alternative to mainstream bank, and it became certified as a B-corporation - a type of corporation that encourages businesses to focus on creating environmental and social benefits as well as profits - business began to thrive. Last quarter, New Resource made a profit of $196,000, compared with a loss of $433,000 a year ago.
''It's a good time for us,'' Mr. Siciliano said. ''Midsized foundations and nonprofits and companies are being asked by their boards, 'Why do we bank at Wells Fargo or Bank of America?' And we're able to step in and offer an alternative.''
Part of the appeal of smaller banks has always been their focus on local investments. New Resource's clientele is West Coast-centric, and includes Bay Area small businesses like San Francisco's Haight Street Market in addition to people in the area.
''It's a way to put your money in an institution that is investing in your community, and holds that as one of its core values,'' said Jeannine Jacokes, chief executive of the Community Development Bankers Association, a trade group.
There are drawbacks, too. Many smaller banks lack the expansive ATM networks and online banking services of larger companies. And it can take weeks to move an account and set up auto-pay bill systems and direct deposits and have checks clear.
Michael Radparvar, the co-founder of Holstee, a lifestyle goods company in New York, does the company's banking at Bank of America. He and his colleagues were contemplating switching to a smaller bank but had not decided whether the hassle would be worth it.
''The whole purpose is beautiful, and it jibes really well with our personal values,'' he said. ''It's a matter of us finding a way to switch systems that's seamless and doesn't mess with the flow of what we're working on.''
For some customers, though, feeling connected to a local bank is all that matters. David Becker, president of PhilippeBecker, a design firm in San Francisco, and a Bank of America refugee, said he had found shelter in a small local credit union, which charged him fewer fees, even though it lacked some of the conveniences of a larger bank.
''What's a pretty Web interface worth?'' he said. ''What are you really getting?''
Mr. Becker, who has been keeping his business accounts at the Bank of San Francisco, a small local bank, for years, said it would be difficult to go back to his impersonal, fee-laden life as a big-bank customer.
''I called my credit union up the other day, and someone answered the phone,'' he said. ''I was like, holy smokes! I'm on a different planet!''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

'The La MaMa Cantata' (Monday and Tuesday) Before her death in January, Ellen Stewart was the driving force behind the East Village experimental theater space La MaMa, which she founded 50 years ago. Festivities last month in celebration of the theater's new season included a gala that featured an excerpt from ''The La MaMa Cantata,'' a new musical by Elizabeth Swados that tells of the life and work of Ms. Stewart through her words as well as those of others. (Above from left, Charnele Crick, Alicia Miles, Grace McLean and Starr Busby, with other cast members, at last month's gala.) On Monday, which would have been Ms. Stewart's 92nd birthday, a cast of 23 will perform the full work at 7:30 p.m. in the theater that bears her name. The show, a blend of pop and world music, will also be performed at the same time on Tuesday. Tickets are $50. Box office information: (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. The theater is at 66 East Fourth Street. You can't miss it; just look for the sign at Second Avenue and East Fourth Street that reads ''Ellen Stewart Way.'' (Anne Mancuso)

HEADLINE: Study Finds Big Spike In Poorest In the U.S.

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The number of people living in neighborhoods of extreme poverty grew by a third over the past decade, according to a new report, erasing most of the gains from the 1990s when concentrated poverty declined. 
More than 10 percent of America's poor now live in such neighborhoods, up from 9.1 percent in the beginning of the decade, an addition of more than two million people, according to the report by the Brookings Institution, an independent research group.
Extreme poverty -- defined as areas where at least 40 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line, which in 2010 was $22,300 for a family of four -- is still below its 1990 level, when 14 percent of poor people lived in such areas.
The report analyzed Census Bureau income data from 2000 to 2009, the most recent year for which there was comprehensive data.
The measure of concentrated poverty came into broad public use among academics in the 1960s when civil unrest, the decline of blue-collar jobs and the flight to the suburbs left parts of American cities stranded in islands of poverty.
In ''The Truly Disadvantaged,'' William Julius Wilson, a sociologist now at Harvard who pioneered the concept, argued that residents of such areas were more likely to experience joblessness, poor schools, broken families and high crime.
Living in such areas often led to poorer health and educational outcomes for children, creating higher hurdles for success as adults.
''It's the toughest, most malignant poverty that we have in the United States,'' said Peter Edelman, the director of the Center on Poverty, Inequality and Public Policy at Georgetown University. ''It's bad outcomes reinforcing each other.''
The data in the Brookings report captures the first part of the decade most clearly, when growth in concentrated poverty was highest in metropolitan areas in the Midwest. Of the places where poverty concentrated the most, three were Midwestern: Toledo and Youngstown in Ohio, and Detroit.
The report estimated that in metropolitan areas, worsening economic conditions in 2010 may have bumped up the portion of those living in concentrated poverty areas to 15 percent, a notch below the 1990 level, 16.5 percent. The biggest rises were in Sun Belt areas like Cape Coral, Fla., and Fresno, Calif., where the housing bust was biggest.
The Census Bureau's traditional measure of poverty tends to overstate poverty for some groups, because it does not take into account noncash government assistance for the poor, like food stamps and the earned income tax credit. Those programs lift millions of people above the poverty line.
The rise in extreme poverty was a disappointment to policy makers, who had hoped that its decline in the 1990s was the beginning of a historic turnaround. The decade was one of a great increase in prosperity across the income spectrum.
But the past decade has proved them wrong. The number of neighborhoods of extreme poverty grew in roughly three-quarters of the nation's largest metropolitan areas.

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Officials, Hoping to Stave Off Critics, Point to Increased Drug Approvals

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
Federal drug officials on Thursday claimed credit for an increase in the approval of new drugs and argued that the results demonstrated the need for legislation to continue financing the current drug approval system.
The Food and Drug Administration approved 35 new drugs in the year that ended in September, a number that was surpassed only once in the past decade.
The agency approved 24 of the drugs before they were approved in any other country. And many of them were important advances, including the first new drug for lupus in 50 years, the first new drug for Hodgkin's lymphoma in 30 years, and the first drugs for late-stage melanoma that have been shown to prolong survival. 
''I want to underscore that we approved a set of drugs that are truly medically important, and in fact did so in a way that made these drugs available to Americans before other places around the world,'' Dr. Margaret Hamburg, commissioner of the F.D.A., said at a news conference.
The increase in drug approvals is good news for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, which have failed to produce many new drugs in recent years. New drug approvals peaked in the mid-1990s and have generally declined since then despite increases in research spending. Major drug makers have steadily cut their research spending since 2008 because of poor productivity, although increased spending by the biotechnology industry has generally made up for this shortfall.
For years, F.D.A. officials said little about the declining number of new drug approvals. When some industry analysts blamed government rules for the slowdown, agency officials instead blamed a decline in high-quality industry applications and a general drought in industry labs.
Now that approvals are increasing, however, Dr. Hamburg is claiming some credit by saying that the agency has lowered some approval standards -- particularly for cancer drugs -- and speeded up many of its reviews.
Asked about this apparent contradiction, Dr. Hamburg responded, ''I think the point we're trying to make is that when high quality science, good applications come before us, we are able to act swiftly and surely.''
Part of the reason for the agency's new message is that it wants to try to defuse growing calls in Congress -- supported by biotechnology and medical device industry groups -- to weaken its approval processes.
Some conservative economists and commentators have argued recently that Europe is now more supportive of innovation than the United States, pointing to the fact that devices are sometimes approved there earlier. These reports rarely mention that Europe's health care systems are largely government-run, with prices that are generally significantly lower than those in the United States.
Dr. Hamburg acknowledged that some complex devices are approved first in Europe, but she blamed differing regulatory standards. And she said the device industry did not pay as much in fees to support the F.D.A. as the drug industry did. ''A higher percentage of our overall drug program'' is supported by fees from drug makers, she said, while the device approval process, with its related fees, ''is a younger program and pays for a much smaller share.''
The medical device industry is particularly incensed that the F.D.A. is considering asking for more information about the effectiveness of complex medical devices before approving them.
The proposed changes result from a series of safety scandals involving devices, including metal-on-metal hip implants that underwent very little testing before being approved for sale. The battle between the industries and the agency will intensify in the coming months as Congress considers legislation that includes industry fees crucial to the drug agency.
The legislation is a compendium of deals that the F.D.A. negotiates separately every five years with industry players -- the branded drug industry, the generic drug industry, the medical device industry and others. The fees that result from the law now provide a significant portion of the agency's financing.
Agency officials are worried that the legislation will become enmeshed in next year's presidential campaign and that Republicans -- who have made denunciations of government regulations a central part of their economic message -- may look beyond the Environmental Protection Agency and train their fire on the F.D.A., arguably the government's most important regulatory agency. Twenty-five cents of every dollar spent by consumers is regulated by the F.D.A.
Dr. David Wheadon of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the increase in approvals demonstrate a shared commitment to medical progress by the agency and the industry. He said it underscored the need for the fee legislation ''to allow F.D.A. to continue to serve, and enhance, its essential function.''
If the legislation with the fees fails to pass next year, the F.D.A. will be forced to fire much of its staff. If the legislation passes but has weakened approval standards, the agency may not need much of its staff.

HEADLINE: Stocks Climb After Interest Rate Cut in Europe

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER and DAVID JOLLY; David Jolly reported from Paris. Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt, and Rachel Donadio and Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.

 BODY:
Stocks rose strongly in the United States and in Europe on Thursday after the European Central Bank, concerned about an economic slowdown, cut its benchmark interest rate and Greece abandoned a planned referendum on its latest bailout deal.
Equity markets in Europe accelerated their gains and Wall Street opened up on the move by the E.C.B., which came after the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development earlier this week added its voice to the chorus calling for lower borrowing costs to stimulate growth. Bond prices fell.
Hours later, amid continued uncertainty over his political future, Prime Minister George Papandreou of Greece called off his plan to hold a popular vote on Greece's new loan deal with foreign creditors. The referendum was seen as a risky move that could have had serious repercussions for the entire euro zone. 
Mr. Papandreou reversed course after meeting with his French and German counterparts in the south of France, where President Obama and other leaders from the Group of 20 nations were holding a summit meeting focused on the European sovereign debt crisis.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, closed up 2.5 percent, with Germany's DAX up 2.8 percent and the CAC 40 in Paris up 2.7 percent. The FTSE 100 index in London rose 1.1 percent.
At 4 p.m., the Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 1.9 percent, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.8 percent, and the Nasdaq rose 2.2 percent.
Treasury prices fell. The United States Treasury's benchmark 10-year note was up to 2.063 percent in yield from 1.99 percent on Wednesday.
Investors are closely watching some of the more highly indebted countries with struggling economies in Europe.
The Italian bond yield rose to a high of 6.353 percent on Thursday before pedaling back to 6.167. Spanish bond yields were 5.463 percent, slightly higher than on Wednesday.
''It is obvious that the E.C.B. has caught the crisis virus and is trying everything it can to prevent a full-fledged recession,'' Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING in Brussels, wrote in a report.
The question now, he added, ''is whether the E.C.B. is also willing to do everything to prevent a further escalation of the sovereign debt crisis, becoming the unconditional lender of last resort of the euro zone.''
The sovereign debt troubles have overshadowed global markets for more than a year. Most recently, equities markets have bounced around since an agreement reached in Europe last month, staging a strong rally before falling back as uncertainty grew about the details of the plan.
While the latest developments in Greece were seen as supportive for stocks, ''the big thing was the European rate cut and that is what is driving the market,'' said Doug Cote, chief strategist at ING Investment Management. ''Investors are going to start nibbling around and going back to risk.''
The E.C.B had raised its benchmark interest rate twice this year, to 1.5 percent from 1 percent. On Thursday, the bank cut it to 1.25 percent.
Stanley Nabi, the chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said the E.C.B. had made a mistake when it raised rates, and was now correcting it in the context of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Greece and economic troubles in Europe.
''To an increasing degree every one of the countries in the euro zone is now experiencing a sluggish economy or is on the precipice of a recession,'' he said. ''I think what they are trying to do is just in case Greece pulls out of the euro zone or is thrown out, they want to build a moat around the other countries so that it won't have a very deep impact on the global economy and European economies.''
Asian shares closed mostly lower. The Sydney market index S.&P./ASX 200 fell 0.3 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 2.5 percent. Shanghai bucked the trend, with the composite index rising 0.2 percent. Tokyo markets were closed for a national holiday.
Officials meeting in Cannes were grappling with the growing possibility that Greece will leave the euro zone, leaving a trail of scorched lenders in its wake and possibly shifting the focus of market turmoil to bigger countries like Italy and Spain. But even as they address those questions, the disarray in Europe threatens to weigh more broadly on the global economy.
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve offered a sobering outlook for growth in the United States, predicting the economy would expand 2.5 percent to 2.9 percent in 2012, down from its prior forecast of 3.3 percent to 3.7 percent. It said the unemployment rate would probably remain at 8.5 percent or above through the end of next year.
The euro was at $1.3845 from $1.3747 late Wednesday in New York.

HEADLINE: In Blunt Report to Congress, U.S. Accuses China and Russia of Internet Spying

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- American intelligence agencies, in an unusually blunt public criticism of China and Russia, reported to Congress on Thursday that those two foreign governments steal valuable American technology over the Internet as a matter of national policy.
Both China and Russia hide behind the anonymity of proxy computers and dispersed routers in third countries to pilfer proprietary corporate information to accelerate their own economic development, according to the new intelligence assessment.
They have also targeted the computer networks of government agencies and universities, the report said. 
American officials have for years hinted that China and Russia were leading suspects in the Internet theft of economic secrets, and those accusations have appeared as scattered commentary in government reports. Google has accused China twice in two years of broad Internet intrusions targeting its users.
However, American officials, when pressed, have said that pinpointing the culprits remained difficult in cyberspace, and they also usually emphasized that specific complaints of computer-network espionage were best raised in private government-to-government channels.
In contrast, the new intelligence study, compiled as a report to Congress on foreign economic and industrial espionage over the past two years, presents a pointed case that China and Russia are the leading actors in the Internet theft of economic secrets.
''The computer networks of a broad array of U.S. government agencies, private companies, universities and other institutions -- all holding large volumes of sensitive economic information -- were targeted by cyber espionage,'' the report said.
''Chinese actors are the world's most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage,'' it added. ''Russia's intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from U.S. targets.''
The governments in Beijing and Moscow, and their intelligence services, contract with independent hackers to expand their capabilities and cloak responsibility for the computer intrusions, the report said.
Even friendly nations spy on the United States via computers. The report warns that ''some U.S. allies and partners use their broad access to U.S. institutions to acquire sensitive U.S. economic and technology information.''
In addition, some of the efforts to steal American economic, technical and trade secrets are conducted by foreign corporations, by organized criminal groups and by individuals.
Internet espionage exists within the United States, but it is subject to domestic criminal law, and intelligence officials underscored that the United States does not conduct economic espionage as a matter of national policy.
Senior officials in China also state unwaveringly that their government opposes computer-based espionage. In July, during a news conference in Beijing, the Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said, ''The Chinese government opposes hacking in all its manifestations.''
Most computer-network espionage against American economic targets has focused on these areas, according to the study: information and communications technology; assessments of supplies of scarce natural resources; technologies for clean energy and health care systems or pharmaceuticals; and military data, especially maritime systems, and air and space technologies.
The report is the collective assessment of 14 American intelligence agencies and was compiled by the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive, which reports to the director of national intelligence.
Although it described the theft of economic and trade information as a national security threat, the study says there are no reliable estimates of the monetary value of the losses. ''Many companies are unaware when their sensitive data is pilfered, and those that find out are often reluctant to report the loss, fearing potential damage to their reputation with investors, customers and employees,'' the study said.
The report concludes with a series of recommendations for strategies to determine how open a company needs to be on the Internet, programs for assessing threats from inside a company, efforts to manage data more effectively, and an emphasis on network security and auditing.
That last category could include real-time monitoring of computer networks for intrusions, muscular software to protect files, the encryption of corporate information as well as better programs to authenticate users.

HEADLINE: New Attention Paid to Homeless Youth and Families

BYLINE: By MERIBAH KNIGHT. 
mknight@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
More than 10,000 homeless students are enrolled in Chicago's classrooms this fall, a 16 percent increase over last year and a record high, according to Chicago Public Schools data for September.
The school district's numbers reflect a trend seen by service providers around the city: Chicago's homeless population is becoming younger. More families are living on the street, and the number of homeless youths on their own has grown exponentially.
With a lack of affordable housing, a rising number of foreclosures and a state unemployment rate higher than the national average, the increase in homeless youths and families is putting stress on a social support system that is facing sharp cuts in budgets and programs.
''The safety net is disappearing while the need is dramatically increasing,'' said Patricia Nix-Hodes, associate director of the Law Project at the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless. ''There are more and more families. The numbers show us that. It's worrisome because it seems to be only getting worse.'' 
City agencies have been hit particularly hard by state and federal budget cuts. The budget at the Department of Family and Support Services has been cut by 15 percent this fiscal year, to $364 million. The decrease is mainly due to cuts in state and federal grants, which make up 96 percent of the department's budget.
Federal stimulus money, which accounted for $40 million of last year's budget, will not be replaced because stimulus spending has ended. Financing from the city is expected to drop 10 percent, to $15.5 million, down from $17.3 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30.
''We are seeing the consequences of the recession,'' said John Pfeiffer, the deputy commissioner of Chicago's Department of Family and Support Services.
On a recent chilly, drizzly Tuesday, dozens of young people gathered around the Night Ministry youth outreach van parked at Belmont Avenue and Halsted Street. Volunteers and Night Ministry workers provided homeless young people with a brown-bag sandwich dinner -- turkey, ham and cheese or peanut butter and jelly, with a banana and a soda. Inside the van, some took advantage of free testing for H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted diseases.
Tedd Peso, the government-relations manager for the Night Ministry, said he had witnessed the increase in need. ''We are seeing a lot more minors,'' he said. Supportive services are necessary to prevent a future generation of homeless adults, he said.
The city is about to enter its ninth year of the highly touted 10-year Plan to End Homelessness. But from the start, the initiative -- begun by Mayor Richard M. Daley in 2003 -- overlooked the young homeless people who can be most vulnerable when living on the streets, experts said.
Now the city is working on a new strategy, referred to in policy circles as Plan 2.0 or the second phase. Initial programming meetings were held on Thursday, and the fall and winter will be spent fielding ideas and creating a new plan for ending homelessness in Chicago -- this time with no 10-year deadline.
The Chicago Alliance to End Homelessness, an agency that partners with the city to help non-governmental service providers, identified eight issues it plans to focus on during strategy meetings. Most dealt with tactics, but two ''special populations'' were recognized for particular attention: youth and ex-offenders.
''This is a moment when we can take stock of what we've done and set a new set of priorities for the future,'' said Mr. Pfeiffer, who is on the plan's strategizing committee. ''It would not surprise me if we give high priority to youth homeless programs.''
Of the 10,660 students designated as homeless by the school system, 90 percent were ''doubled up,'' staying with friends or relatives outside the immediate family. Nine percent were living in shelters, records show. In addition, 17 percent of homeless youth on the district's rolls are living without a parent or guardian. Altogether 1,773 students are living unaccompanied, according to the district data, an increase of more than 600 percent over last year.
Because some people may not want to identify themselves as homeless, Ms. Nix-Hodes said she believed the actual number of homeless students was far higher than the published data indicate. ''These numbers represent the tip of the iceberg in terms of the true picture,'' she said.
Statistics collected by the Chicago Alliance to End Homelessness in 2010 show that more than half the people served by emergency shelters and transitional housing facilities in the city were families. More than a third were under the age of 17.
But most initiatives are geared toward the chronically homeless and people with disabilities, so homeless youths and families sometimes do not get help.
''I've always felt that families were always getting the short end of the stick because the focus is on the chronically homeless,'' said Julie Dworkin, the director of policy at the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless.
A recent report by the National Alliance to End Homelessness showed that from 2008 to 2009, Illinois's chronic homeless population decreased by 13 percent. Yet the population of homeless families in Illinois increased by 3 percent, slightly higher than the national average.
Complicating discussions about how best to provide services to the homeless is the question of which groups the term includes. The Department of Education defines the homeless as ''individuals who lack a fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence.'' That includes individuals doubled up -- staying with friends or family -- a key indicator, according to most experts.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development defines homelessness as sleeping in a shelter or space ''not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings.''
For those administering services, the discrepancy between the two definitions can be frustrating.
In 2009, Congress passed the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition Housing Act. The law broadens the definition of homelessness to include youth and families living in unstable conditions, aligning it more with the education department's explanation.
''The definition of homelessness is pretty controversial,'' said Nicole Amling, the director of policy at the Chicago Alliance to End Homelessness. ''What HEARTH does is combine the two.''
But Congress has not yet provided financing to put this new definition in effect.
''The problem, of course, is that there is no money out there,'' said Ellen Bassuk, founder and president of the National Center on Family Homelessness. ''HUD is not nasty. They just don't have enough money to fund a broader definition.''
Merging those definitions could have a big impact on people like those gathered around the van at Belmont and Halsted last week. Around 9 p.m., the rain had let up and dozens of young people milled about, talking, laughing and eating. One zipped by on Rollerblades and waved to a friend before stopping to shove a sandwich into his backpack.
Next to the building, another young man, who would identify himself only as Juan, devoured a peanut butter and jelly sandwich -- his breakfast, lunch and dinner, he said -- and he contemplated his sleeping plans for the night: in an abandoned house or under a bridge.

HEADLINE: State Religions: Victories, Not Symbolism

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- There are games where the hype looms heavily beforehand and games that appear larger in the rear view. Such was Alabama-Louisiana State in 1958, the season opener for the Crimson Tide, played at Ladd Memorial Stadium in Mobile, Ala.
The Tigers, led by Billy Cannon, won, 13-3, and would go on to win a national championship, their first in the poll era. Alabama would go on to its first winning season in years under the leadership of a new coach, Paul W. Bryant. (The stadium, for its part, would go on to become the site of the GoDaddy.com Bowl.) Even in his losing debut, this Bryant fellow seemed promising. 
When Bryant died a quarter century later, I was only 6, and like all Tide fans born after a certain time, I have lived much of my rooting life on an inheritance. Houndstooth remained the heraldic pattern, but the estate was growing musty. There were years of good coaching and years of mediocre coaching, and there were years where the coaches came and went like Hollywood marriages.
Then arrived a coach in 2007 who, like Bryant in 1958, seemed different. Nick Saban had already won a national championship -- with L.S.U., no less -- so he cost a bit more money than Bryant, roughly $50 a year for each of the 100,000 seats in Bryant-Denny Stadium. But Alabama fans, by and large, would gladly pay that fee to watch their team going undefeated into a huge showdown for the second time in three years.
Just like the old days. Except that they aren't, not entirely.
This week, the university's history department is hosting a symposium on race and football; Andrew Doyle, a professor of Southern history at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C., is the keynote speaker.
Doyle has written quite a bit about the Crimson Tide, describing how its victory over Washington in the 1926 Rose Bowl, a game the haughty establishment only grudgingly allowed Alabama to play, was ''the most significant game in Southern football history,'' and a cultural triumph for Southerners still floundering in a swamp of defeat, humiliation and economic backwardness brought on by the Civil War.
The notion of football as marker of regional pride was not explicitly Southern, but as with so many things it was here that it took on its most eccentric forms. The historian T. Harry Williams described how Louisiana Gov. Huey Long, his identity synonymous with his state's, insisted that L.S.U. use plays of his design, and devised a system in which he would signal the call from the sideline by grabbing the poor coach by the neck.
In the Bryant era, the Crimson Tide again became a rallying point for newspaper editors, politicians and the Southern public at large; the Tide has always seemed like a pro team because so many of its fans, myself included, have no more connection with the university than being born in the same state.
As the South was again becoming a national pariah, this time for its defense of racial subjugation, the dominant Crimson Tide was ''a potent symbol of pride and cultural vitality to white Southerners in the midst of profound social transformation,'' Doyle wrote in his paper ''Bear Bryant: A Symbol for an Embattled South.''
The Bear's wiry, white Alabama farm boys, in a testament to the rearing of their mommas and poppas, could take on any team in the country, including those that were integrated. And indeed they could, until they couldn't.
Much has been discussed about Bryant's role in this social transformation -- whether his moves toward integration at Alabama were slyly pragmatic or disgracefully late -- but the point is that he had one, whether he wanted it or not.
Nowadays you might be able to find some children and dogs named Saban, but the notion that he is an exemplar for some embattled Southern Way of Life seems pretty exotic. The South is just not the foreign country it once was. There are Bank of Americas next to the barbecue stands. Dixie has been Americanized, the United States has been Dixified and everybody eats at Applebee's. The game has changed, too.
The competitive market for television -- witness the backroom horse-trading required to move this weekend's game to prime time -- the multimillion-dollar coaching salaries and the increasing nationalization of recruiting have bled out much of the old intimacy. In 2009, running back Mark Ingram became the first Crimson Tide player to win the Heisman Trophy, a testament to how mommas raise their children -- in Michigan.
''The regional identity of football has become less distinct over time,'' Doyle said, pointing to ''the rise of ESPN and the fact that kids can grow up in Oregon and North Dakota and develop an attachment to Alabama.''
Yes, there are a few Mississippi fans who think their team's current misfortunes have something to do with the decommissioning of their former mascot, Colonel Reb. And the chanting of ''S-E-C! S-E-C!'' may be, as some have suggested, a politically correct way of singing ''Dixie.'' But with Missouri and Texas A&M likely to join the Southeastern Conference, the definition of Dixie may soon have to be pretty broad.
I come in and out of Alabama these days covering politics and even some rather hotly debated state laws, and I will be in the stands on Saturday night with the unhinged pilgrims of the Tide faithful. These two things are different, it seems to me, and I can't imagine anyone would suggest otherwise. For all the commercialism, homogenization and other evils of the modern world, they have brought about this bit of horse sense: when we Tide fans yell our fool heads off on Saturday night, we want a win on the football field, and that is plenty enough.
And it is unlikely that Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal would think of foisting his defensive strategies on the L.S.U. coaching staff. Though if he chose to do so this weekend, I do not think that many Tide fans would begrudge him.

HEADLINE: Cain's Campaign Aide Faces Tough Questions

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL; Susan Saulny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Until this week, Mark Block was famous as the guy who inhaled in a Herman Cain campaign Web video that went viral.
Now Mr. Block, who is Mr. Cain's top aide, is better known as the adviser in the hot seat. His management of the sexual harassment allegations enveloping the Cain campaign is under scrutiny as Mr. Cain gives evolving explanations of his contact with women at a restaurant trade group and the legal settlements reached with them.
But it is Mr. Block's role helping Mr. Cain get his campaign off the ground that may pose just as great a challenge. A nonprofit group that Mr. Block ran contributed to the start-up of Mr. Cain's presidential run, serving as a conduit for possibly illegal contributions. The campaign said it had asked an outside lawyer to review the allegations.
Steve Grubbs, a longtime Republican operative who is Mr. Cain's Iowa chairman, said he had only once before observed so deep a relationship between a candidate and his top aide -- ''when I met with Karl Rove and George W. Bush in 1998.'' 
In an interview a day before the sexual harassment charges broke, Mr. Cain said he had consulted just three people before entering the presidential race: his wife, Gloria; his minister; and Mr. Block, 57, one of the more unlikely top strategists even before he cast himself as the star of the odd campaign video that ends with his drag on a cigarette.
''He had been in politics just about all his life,'' Mr. Cain said. ''I said, 'Give me your honest assessment.' '' After Mr. Block mulled it over, Mr. Cain recounted, ''He said, 'My instincts tell me that this country could be ready for an unconventional candidate.' ''
Like the wedge issues Mr. Rove identified for Mr. Bush to build his appeal among conservative Republicans, Mr. Block and Mr. Cain's meeting of the minds was forged over small-government principles that both were paid to promote on behalf of Americans for Prosperity, an advocacy group that has roots in the libertarian movement and the Tea Party.
Mr. Block led the group's state chapter in Wisconsin. Mr. Cain was hired in 2005 to lead its ''Prosperity Expansion Project'' to seed more state groups, using his gift for public speaking to advance goals like lowering taxes, slashing government regulations and curtailing unions.
Americans for Prosperity was co-founded and financed by David H. Koch, the billionaire who with his brother, Charles, controls Koch Industries, the energy and chemical conglomerate. When the group holds its annual conference in Washington on Friday and Saturday, Mr. Cain will be one of the keynote speakers, along with Mitt Romney.
Because the Cain campaign's core staff members are veterans of Americans for Prosperity -- Mr. Block, his deputy manager, the senior economic adviser -- some critics on the left suggest that despite Mr. Cain's image as an outsider, his candidacy is in effect a mouthpiece for the corporate interests of the Koch brothers.
A former Cain staff member said, ''Mark wants to be the next Karl Rove and Herman wants to be the next president, so the two feed off each other well.''
Ironically, Mr. Rove has been a sharp critic of the Cain campaign's response to the charges of sexual harassment, scolding its spokesman and Mr. Cain for dodging the charges when they were first reported. Even though Politico said it had informed the campaign several days before it published the first account of the harassment charges, Mr. Cain's spokesman first uttered a blanket denial, before Mr. Cain acknowledged additional details in the following days.
The former staff member also described Mr. Block, who entered politics at 18 as the youngest elected county supervisor in Wisconsin and later stocked shelves at Target during a three-year exile from politics, as lacking ''the slightest sense of humor.''
The sense of a campaign in disarray over its messaging continued Thursday, when Mr. Block did an about-face from an accusation he made the day before that an aide to Gov. Rick Perry of Texas had leaked the sexual harassment charges. Mr. Cain ended up repeating the charge later in the day.
Americans for Prosperity first hired Mr. Block in 2005, after he had paid a $15,000 fine and been barred for three years from Wisconsin politics to settle a suit over improprieties in his managing of a state Supreme Court justice's election.
Mr. Cain, who had left the leadership of the National Restaurant Association, an industry lobbying group, traveled extensively with Mr. Block. ''We ended up spending a lot of time together, much of it in a car, traveling from meeting to meeting,'' he writes in his campaign autobiography.
On a trip to Ohio to help open a new chapter of the group, they worked with Rich Lowrie, who is now Mr. Cain's chief economics aide and the principal author of his ''9-9-9'' tax plan.
Mr. Lowrie credits Mr. Block with being ''the tip of the spear'' in Wisconsin, with his years of grass-roots organizing leading to the state flipping ''from blue to red'' in the 2010 elections when Republicans took the governorship and the Legislature.
Scot Ross, executive director of One Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group, mordantly credited Americans for Prosperity with ''derailing a discussion about how we had to move to more clean energy, which is where the Koch brothers' interests come in.''
He called Mr. Cain a ''hand-picked corporate spokes-candidate.''
''It's pretty clear his political messaging was developed in the Americans for Prosperity laboratory,'' he said.
Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, which says it has 34 state chapters and 1.8 million activists, said that claim was preposterous. ''Are they implying that Herman Cain is not capable of thinking for himself?'' he said.
Mr. Cain's conservative views, including opposition to a government health care overhaul and support for a version of a flat tax, date to well before his work for Americans for Prosperity. Even though he has no formal role with the group today, he continues to support it and -- presumably -- to benefit from its influence on voters and donors.
In June he spoke at one of the group's rallies in New York opposing a multistate agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions. In January he attended a secretive gathering for wealthy Republican donors in Rancho Mirage, Calif., at which the Kochs reportedly began a campaign to raise more than $200 million for conservative groups in the 2012 election.
In an interview last weekend, Mr. Cain said the goals of Americans for Prosperity are the same ones he has long held personally. ''I already had the same mission -- free-market principles,'' he said.
As if crisis management of the present moment weren't strain enough, Mr. Block faces questions over about $40,000 in expenses that a group he controlled paid to the Cain campaign in its early days, possibly violating tax and election laws.
The group, Prosperity USA, paid for private flights, $3,700 worth of iPads, and travel to Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Houston, according to records obtained by The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Because the group, set up by Mr. Block, is a tax-exempt entity, it cannot make contributions to a campaign, nor can the campaign accept them. A campaign spokesman, J. D. Gordon, said Wednesday the campaign had asked an ''outside counsel'' to investigate, though he did not say who would investigate or when it might conclude.
As for the source of Prosperity USA's income, the balance sheets identify $150,000 in loans it has received but do not identify the lenders. Mr. Phillips of Americans for Prosperity -- which has no connection to Prosperity USA -- said the money did not come from his group. ''We're not in the loan business,'' he said.
Nonetheless the documents indicate money due from Americans for Prosperity, including for ''H. Cain travel/Hill Aircraft,'' a charter jet service near Mr. Cain's home in Atlanta.

HEADLINE: CBS and DirecTV Results Attest to Media Strength

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
Flying in the face of a weak economy, the CBS Corporation said Thursday that advertising revenues were stable in the third quarter of the year.
Also Thursday, DirecTV reported a 4 percent increase in satellite television subscribers, its strongest quarterly growth in two years. 
The earnings of the two companies attested to the durability of both the content and distribution sides of the media business. The CBS Corporation, the owner of the CBS network and Showtime, posted revenue of $3.37 billion for the quarter, 2 percent higher than the same quarter last year.
The company reported net income of $338 million, or 50 cents a share, up from $317 million, or 46 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. CBS said Thursday that it was increasing its share buyback program by $1.5 billion.
What are by far the biggest parts of CBS, its broadcast network and syndication units, grew slightly in the quarter in part because of new online streaming deals and international deals. The smaller part that includes Showtime and the CBS Sports Network grew more significantly, largely for the same reasons.
Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, said such deals were allowing the company to decrease its exposure to advertising ups and downs and increase ''the stability of our revenue base.''
But advertising is still the biggest source of CBS's revenue by far, and it was flat for the quarter.
In a conference call, Mr. Moonves said that local broadcasting remained a source of strength even though odd years like 2011 do not benefit from the political advertising of even years like 2010 and 2012. Nonpolitical revenue rose in the ''low single digits'' in the third quarter, Mr. Moonves said, although total revenues for local broadcasting were down 3 percent because of the lack of political ads.
''If we're up at this point in 2011 without virtually any political advertising, imagine what we can do with it in 2012,'' Mr. Moonves said.
The enduring popularity of the CBS prime-time lineup helped to drive national ad sales revenue in the quarter, he added.
Earlier on Thursday, DirecTV reported third-quarter revenue of $6.84 billion, up 14 percent over the same quarter last year. Net income came in at $516 million, or 70 cents a share, up from $479 million, or 55 cents a share.
The company credited its promotion of the N.F.L. Sunday Ticket package for helping to add 327,000 customers in the United States in the quarter, for a total of nearly 19.8 million.
''The company showed its ability to continue to grow and take share in a virtually zero-sum U.S. market,'' James M. Ratcliffe of Barclays Capital wrote in an analysts' report.
DirecTV's gains were even sharper in Latin America, where it is aggressively expanding. There, the company had its best quarter ever, Michael White, chief executive of DirecTV, said.
Mr. White said that higher costs for the rights to channels hurt the company's margins in the United States. Earlier in the week, DirecTV resolved a price dispute with News Corporation that had led both companies to warn about a possible programming blackout.

HEADLINE: Anti-Washington: Perry Criticizes I.R.S. and Bailouts

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.

 BODY:
JOHNSTON, Iowa - As controversy swirls around rival Herman Cain, the evolving strategy of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas as he readies for the Iowa caucuses in two months has become clear: To paint himself as the most anti-Washington candidate in the Republican field. 
On Tuesday, he said the Internal Revenue Service had become a ''taxpayer harassment agency.''
And on Thursday, at a carefully choreographed appearance at a company here, he declared that ''Wall Street and Washington, D.C. have been in bed together way too long.''
Making anti-bailout comments, he suggested that companies should never be allowed to grow large enough that their failure would hurt the economy.
''If you are too big to fail, you are too big,'' Mr. Perry said. ''I don't care whether you are a country or whether you are a corporation.'' The comments appeared to be a suggestion to either prevent companies from growing so large that failure posed a systemic risk to the economy, or to break up companies that have already grown that large. A spokesman for Mr. Perry did not respond to a request for elaboration. Mr. Perry also stated that regulation and taxes are why corporations have moved offshore, not, as economists believe, for reasons like lower wages or because they have emerging markets for their products in foreign countries.
''They did not leave to begin with just because they could find cheap labor somewhere. That may have been part of a formula, but it is not the reason they left,'' he said.
''I would suggest to you they left because they were over-regulated and the cost of that regulation and the tax structure that we have in place in this country is what drove the masses away.''
Offering a different view, the World Bank has said that the United States has one of the easiest and most business-friendly regulatory systems in the world.
Mr. Perry does not expect applause from Washington for his tax plan, which would scrap the graduated income tax and replace it with a 20 percent flat rate, cutting taxes for the wealthy. ''The establishment,'' he said, ''really doesn't like'' it.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senators' Letter Clouds Talks on Deficit

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As a powerful Congressional committee searched desperately for ways to reduce the federal budget deficit, conservative Republicans and progressive Democrats hardened their positions on Thursday by drawing lines that will make it more difficult for the panel to find consensus.
A group of 33 Republican senators sent a letter to members of the panel insisting on ''no net tax increase.'' 
The letter, circulated by Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, said that any deficit-reduction deal should also ''balance our budget within 10 years, place entitlements on a path to fiscal solvency'' and include ''comprehensive tax reform that lowers rates and promotes economic growth.''
In an exchange of proposals last week, Republicans on the 12-member committee offered a package of spending cuts and new revenues. A Republican aide said on Thursday: ''The letter is a warning to Republican members of the supercommittee. The $600 billion tax hike floated last week is a nonstarter.''
Democrats said the letter was a serious setback for efforts to strike a bipartisan deal to achieve the goal of reducing deficits by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years. Democrats say any deal must include spending cuts and increases in tax revenues, as recommended by fiscal experts who testified this week at a hearing of the panel, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction.
Signers of the letter include three Republicans from a separate bipartisan group known as the Gang of Six, whose earlier deficit-reduction plan included tax changes that could raise additional revenue. The three Republicans were Senators Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Michael D. Crapo of Idaho.
Mr. Chambliss saw no inconsistency. ''I have consistently stated that I am not in favor of tax increases,'' Mr. Chambliss said. ''I also consistently said I am in favor of significant tax reform to lower rates, simplify the code and close loopholes, actions that experts believe will increase revenues and improve America's fiscal solvency.''
The action came as restive Senate Democrats demanded more information about the work of the secretive joint committee.
The Senate Democratic caucus met Thursday to hear from the three Democratic senators on the panel: Patty Murray of Washington, Max Baucus of Montana and John Kerry of Massachusetts.
Until Thursday, the panel's members had generally refused to tell colleagues what they were doing in the committee, which is authorized to consider every provision of the tax code and virtually every dollar of government spending.
The committee is supposed to make its recommendations by Nov. 23. The Senate and the House are supposed to vote on the package by Dec. 23, with no amendments allowed.
Liberals like Senators John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, and Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, had sought the caucus meeting on Thursday because they felt their concerns were being overlooked by the committee.
Mr. Rockefeller, a senator for more than 25 years, said, ''I am getting worried that this committee is headed in a direction where we end up with a series of cuts aimed at Medicare and Medicaid without any sacrifice asked of corporations and the very wealthy.''
In an interview, Mr. Sanders repeated his message to the Democratic caucus and the committee members: ''The American people are saying, in demonstrations all over the country and in opinion polls, what they want. The wealthiest people, who are doing phenomenally well, and corporations with record-breaking profits must pay their fair share of taxes, more than they are paying now, to help with deficit reduction and job creation.''
Sentiments expressed in the caucus indicated that even if the committee can agree on a deal to reduce the deficit -- a big assumption -- there is no guarantee it will be approved by the full Senate.
On the other side of the Capitol, Speaker John A. Boehner said, ''The mood is one of nervousness.''
''We have to come to an agreement. It is important for the supercommittee to succeed.''
Mr. Boehner said ''there is room for revenue'' in a deal to reduce the deficit. He said he had told President Obama, ''I will put revenue on the table, but there has to be real reform of entitlement programs'' like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
When Republicans speak of additional revenue, they include the proceeds of selling radio spectrum licenses, higher Medicare premiums for some beneficiaries and the increase in revenues expected to result from economic growth. Democrats talk about higher taxes on high incomes.
For the third time in a month, the Senate on Thursday rejected a version of Mr. Obama's jobs bill that would have been financed entirely with a tax on income exceeding $1 million. The bill would have provided $60 billion for roads and bridges and other transportation and infrastructure projects. The Senate voted 51 to 49 to take up the bill, but 60 votes were needed.
Mr. Boehner disclosed Thursday that Republicans would soon move forward with their own effort to create jobs and build highways -- financed with revenues from an expansion of American energy production, including more drilling for oil and gas.
Democrats said Republicans were blocking legislation to help the economy because they wanted Mr. Obama to fail in his bid for re-election.
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said, ''I'm now convinced that the president actually believes he would be benefited by the committee not succeeding'' because success ''would step on his story line that we can't do anything on a bipartisan basis.''

HEADLINE: A Cop From the Projects And a Boy's Guilty Secret

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
The density of surreal urban grit -- filthy kitchens, graffiti-stained hallways, broken-down furniture, castoff junk and layers of caked blood and dirt -- cannot camouflage the fundamental fatuity of Dito Montiel's police corruption drama, ''The Son of No One.''
The flaws of the movie, which maintains only a tenuous connection with reality, are all the sadder because several of the performances of its star-heavy cast -- Channing Tatum, Ray Liotta, Katie Holmes, Tracy Morgan, Juliette Binoche and Al Pacino -- are reasonably intense. Ms. Binoche, almost unrecognizable and with a New York accent, is outstanding as a crusading newspaper reporter, except that her character is preposterous. 
The melodrama revolves around the guilty secret carried by its protagonist, Jonathan White (Mr. Tatum), a 30-year-old New York police officer living on Staten Island with his wife, Kerry (Ms. Holmes), and young daughter. Jonathan is dismayed to find himself assigned to the 118th precinct in Astoria, Queens, where he grew up in a public housing development with his grandmother.
''The Son of No One'' is set in 2002 shortly after 9/11, a time when the New York police enjoyed such high repute for heroism, the movie implies, that no one would dare question their integrity. Jonathan's old neighborhood is a nightmarish jungle on the verge of explosion. In his precinct house, presided over by Captain Mathers (Mr. Liotta), fights break out, suspects are verbally and physically abused, and furious chaos reigns.
The story repeatedly and irritatingly zigzags between 2002 and 1986, when Jonathan, then a middle-schooler nicknamed Milk, lived in a project overrun with drug addicts that is visualized as a hellhole as awful as any prison. In a state of panic one day the boy kills two quarrelsome addicts, while his best friend and neighbor Vinny Carter (Brian Gilbert) looks on. Afterward he persuades Vinny to vow lifelong secrecy about what he has seen.
Meanwhile the detective in charge of the case, Charles Stanford (Mr. Pacino), who had been the police partner of Jonathan's father, quietly allowed the case to remain unsolved. It had been all but forgotten until Loren Bridges (Ms. soche), a hard-bitten reporter for a small borough newspaper, begins receiving anonymous letters that accuse the police of covering up the crime and threaten to identify the perpetrator. Is the letter writer the now grown-up Vinny (Mr. Morgan), who has a history of mental illness? Jonathan assumes so.
The screenplay by Mr. Montiel (''A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints'') is, in a word, calamitous: his story filled with gaping holes, his dialogue laughably overheated. At the same time Mr. Tatum's performance stands alongside Taylor Lautner's in ''Abduction'' as one of the year's most wooden, expressionless star turns, while Ms. Holmes's hysterical Kerry veers to the opposite extreme. Mr. Pacino and Mr. Liotta amble through their paces, but the screenplay works against them.
''The Son of No One'' self-destructs in a ludicrous, ineptly directed anticlimactic rooftop showdown in which bodies pile up, and nothing makes a shred of sense.
''The Son of No One'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Extreme violence and profanity.
THE SON OF NO ONE
Opens on Friday nationwide.

HEADLINE: Market Anxiety Grows Over Italy

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Christine Hauser contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When Italy issued 3 billion euros in bonds last week at an interest rate of more than 6 percent, it was about 1.5 percentage points higher than it had to pay as recently as last summer -- and the most expensive 10-year money it had borrowed since joining the euro a decade ago.
That cost -- extracted by financial markets increasingly doubtful about Italy's ability to repay its loans -- shows just how hard it is for indebted European countries to escape their raging financial crisis. Even as they frantically cut back their debt mountains through austerity measures, the debt servicing costs are piling up. 
In Italy's case, the extra bond yields are adding as much as 3 billion euros (about $4.1 billion) in additional interest payments annually, estimates Tobias Blattner, a former economist at the European Central Bank who is an economist at Daiwa Securities in London.
''That is a lot of money for someone trying to cut their debt,'' he said. ''Each day the situation deteriorates and you have to go back for more austerity measures to match them.''
The interest rates on Italian debt fell back on Thursday after Greece called off its proposed referendum on the terms of its planned bailout, and the European Central Bank cut interest rates, announcements that cheered financial markets across Europe and the United States.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, closed up 2.5 percent. The German DAX was up 2.8 percent and the CAC 40 in Paris rose 2.7 percent. The FTSE 100 index in London rose 1.1 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 1.9 percent, or 23.25 points, at 1,261.15. and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.8 percent, or 208.43 points at 12,044.47. The Nasdaq rose 2.2 percent to 2,697.97.
Energy, industrials, technology and materials each rose about 2 percent, while financial stocks were up 1.12 percent.
The latest developments in Greece were seen as supportive for stocks, but ''the big thing was the European rate cut and that is what is driving the market,'' said Doug Cote, chief strategist at ING Investment Management. ''Investors are going to start nibbling around and going back to risk.''
The Italian 10-year yield -- rising to 6.352 percent on Thursday before falling back to 6.167 percent -- remains uncomfortably high, and could move higher again, analysts said. Facing a confidence vote on Friday, the Greek government may still be forced to call for a new election. That would again call into question the entire rescue package for indebted European countries that was agreed to last week at a summit meeting in Brussels.
Prime Minister George A. Papandreou of Greece ''still has to face the confidence vote,'' said Win Thin, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ''If he passes, he could still reintroduce the referendum. If he does not pass it, then the opposition is not happy about the current deal. It gets politically messy.''
Italian bond yields were generally rising even before last week's Brussels deal, suggesting that markets felt the evolving plan was not sufficient to tackle its problems. The European Central Bank has been regularly buying Italian bonds in the open markets to try to keep yields down, but many analysts say they think it will have to buy bonds on a much larger scale to force yields meaningfully lower or even just to stop the creep higher.
Some analysts say Italian bond yields may now be reaching worrying heights. ''Six percent is a light flashing,'' said Mr. Thin. ''For Greece, Ireland and Portugal, when it went to 7 percent that was a red light, and the yield never came back down below that.''
Those countries were no longer able to afford the high market interest rates and had to turn to official lending by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund for financing. The high yields -- and widening gaps in yields between countries -- complicate monetary policy. Even though the European Central Bank cut short-term rates by a quarter point to 1.25 percent on Thursday to lift growth, the policy's effect will be muted if at the same time long-term bond yields are moving higher.
According to Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays Capital in New York, Italy may be able to withstand the higher interest rates better than countries like Portugal if it has stronger underlying growth. The problem is that interest rates are rising just as austerity measures are sapping Italy's growth, he said.
According to Daiwa, there is still demand for the bonds of the peripheral European countries. Italian bonds, for example, are bought by institutional investors in Italy who are obliged to hold Italian debt, but also by insurance companies abroad. But demand is slipping. Italy faces new tests in further auctions of its debt this month -- it has to raise 30.5 billion euros in November, and a further 22.5 billion in December, according to Daiwa.
Yields have been rising for other European countries, too, although the markets seem less worried about nations like Spain than they are about Italy. The 10-year bond yields of Spain, which has to raise about 7.5 billion euros this month, dipped back below 5.5 percent. The premium France must pay over Germany to borrow 10-year money has risen to a euro-era high; the benchmark German bond was at 1.9 percent.
At least these countries can tap markets relatively easily. For those countries relying on official financing there were some troubling developments this week. The latest 8 billion euro tranche of multilateral aide for Greece -- required, analysts say, to avoid a messy default by Greece on its debts -- has been held up until Greece can commit to last week's summit meeting deal.
And the European Financial Stability Facility had to postpone a bond offering that was meant to raise money for payments to Ireland, according to analysts.
The E.F.S.F. has issued only three bonds so far, according to Mr. Blattner, and this was the first to be postponed. He said Klaus Regling, the chief executive of the E.F.S.F., had just returned from a visit to Asia, and the postponement suggested worryingly low demand for European debt, in particular from Asian investors.
''It was a very bad signal for markets,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Being Texan Doesn't Mean You Support Perry for President

BYLINE: By EMILY RAMSHAW and ELIZABETH TITUS. 
eramshaw@texastribune.org etitus@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Texans have elected Rick Perry governor three times -- with almost 55 percent of the vote in 2010 -- but that does not mean Texas' Republican establishment is falling in line to help elect him president.
Some prominent Texas business executives, Republican members of the state's Congressional delegation and even university regents whom Mr. Perry appointed have lent their money -- if not their endorsements -- to other Republican contenders, most notably former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
It is a risky endeavor. Whether Mr. Perry makes it to the White House or comes back to the governor's office, he will wield legislative power, political influence and a veto pen. 
''It's a risk you run when you work against somebody,'' said Bill Miller, an Austin-based lobbyist and political consultant, who said some high-dollar donors to Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison's failed 2010 run for Texas governor were still writing big checks to Mr. Perry to apologize. ''If you guess wrong, there's always a price.''
Among the prominent Texans who have formally endorsed Mr. Gingrich are Representatives Michael Burgess of Lewisville and Joe Barton of Arlington, both Republicans.
Louie Gohmert, a Republican congressman from Tyler, has not endorsed a candidate but has contributed to Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota -- and as o the end of September had not reported any contributions to Mr. Perry.
Mr. Romney's endorsements include those of Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of San Antonio; former Chief Justice Tom Phillips of the Texas Supreme Court; and Scott Caven, a former University of Texas System regent who once served as Mr. Perry's finance chairman and has contributed more than $18,000 to his re-election bids for governor in the last decade.
Mr. Smith declined to speak with The Texas Tribune, but he said in a statement that he had committed to Mr. Romney three months before Mr. Perry announced his candidacy.
In the current election cycle, Mr. Romney has received campaign contributions in Texas from John Barnhill and Janiece Longoria, former University of Texas System regents; Bob Perry, a billionaire home builder; Larry Kellner, the former Continental Airlines chief executive; and Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas, none of whom reported contributions to Mr. Perry in the first 48 days of his presidential campaign.
Mr. Kellner, who has contributed $25,000 to Mr. Perry in past elections, said in an e-mail that Mr. Romney ''is the right leader for the country in these challenging economic times.''
Mr. Rawlings said through a spokeswoman that his contribution should not be seen as an endorsement of Mr. Romney and that he made it at the request of his business partner, who is Mr. Romney's co-chairman for finance in Texas.
A spokesman for Bob Perry (no relation to Rick Perry) -- who has given Mr. Perry's campaigns for governor more than $2.5 million over the last decade -- did not respond to questions about whether he endorses Mr. Romney.
Meanwhile, the Dallas real estate magnate Harlan Crow has helped finance the presidential bid of former Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, despite having given more than $142,000 to Mr. Perry's past bids for governor. John Mackey, the chief executive of Whole Foods, based in Austin, has contributed to the long-shot campaign of former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico, a libertarian.
In separate interviews, Dr. Burgess and Mr. Barton, both of whom say they had decided to endorse Mr. Gingrich before Mr. Perry entered the race, said they did not believe that Mr. Perry was the best-qualified Republican candidate.
Mr. Barton said the governor assured him last spring that he had no interest in running for president. He said Mr. Perry is ''not quite as well prepared to step into the No. 1 office right off the bat'' as Mr. Gingrich, but that he thinks Mr. Perry could ''get there'' quickly.
Dr. Burgess, who acknowledged he ''got on the other side'' of Mr. Perry last year by endorsing Ms. Hutchison for governor, said he had personally asked Mr. Gingrich to run in late 2009.
Dr. Burgess said he patched up ''a lot of the hurt feelings'' with Mr. Perry last spring. But the governor ''did not convey to members of the Texas delegation that he was thinking about doing this,'' Dr. Burgess said. ''Rick never came up here and said, 'I've got to have you guys.' ''
Mr. Miller, the political consultant, said support for Mr. Perry's bid in Texas, while widespread, had a far different feel from George W. Bush's first presidential race. To campaign for Mr. Bush, then the Texas governor, state lawmakers and Austin lobbyists routinely traveled to primary states at their own expense, he said -- some of them Democrats.
''Everyone was saying: 'Have you been to Michigan? To New Hampshire?' There was a cool factor,'' Mr. Miller said.
But the risks of opposing the sitting governor were great then too. When Representative Garnet Coleman, Democrat of Houston, campaigned against Mr. Bush in his first presidential bid, it was unusual; Mr. Coleman and Mr. Bush were friends, and some of Mr. Coleman's fellow Democrats were on the trail supporting Mr. Bush.
Mr. Coleman was bullied. Lawmakers warned him he was endangering a good political career. They told him he had a target on his back. He worried that his bills would be vetoed, but he was not deterred.
''I thought it was better that we keep him here than send him to the White House, where he could do more harm,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Crime Doesn't Pay. Oh, Wait.

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
Rich guys are among the most reliable villains in Hollywood movies, and it takes no special insight to point out that the guys who make and star in those movies tend to be pretty well off themselves. You can call this hypocrisy, but I prefer to think of it as one of the cultural contradictions of capitalism that all of us have to live with.
Today's specimen is ''Tower Heist,'' an action comedy produced by Brian Grazer, directed by Brett Ratner and starring Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy. The previous sentence could be expressed mathematically as a whole bunch of zeros, which is to say that the $20 million that is one object of the heist in question is small change. The movie's makers and marketers surely expect to take much more than that from you and your friends in the next 48 hours or so, and you could do worse than to chip in your share, with a little something extra for the Coca-Cola Company. 
What you will receive in return (in addition to high-fructose corn syrup) is a mild, chaotic and cartoonish dose of populism, set in a Manhattan luxury high-rise at the southwestern corner of Central Park from which the name ''Trump'' has been excised with the utmost digital care. At the top of this heap lives Arthur Shaw, a Wall Street titan played with twinkly malevolence by Alan Alda.
Mr. Alda, who spent years on ''M*A*S*H'' turning himself into a paradigm of niceness, has since relished subverting that image, and he generously supplies occasions for the audience to snarl and hiss and gasp at him in indignant disbelief. A genial plutocrat, Shaw fancies himself a man of the people. He loves to remind Josh Kovaks, the building's manager (Mr. Stiller), that they grew up in the same Queens neighborhood, and he is generally expert at disguising his condescension as bonhomie.
Shaw also turns out to be a Bernard Madoff-like Ponzi schemer, or perhaps something worse (or at least easier to explain in a 10- or 15-second burst of expository dialogue). Among the millions that have disappeared under his watch are the pension fund of the building's staff and the life savings of a beloved doorman, Lester (Stephen McKinley Henderson), whose dreams of a comfortable retirement are shattered when the F.B.I. arrives to arrest Shaw for fraud.
It was Josh who had invested his colleagues' money with Shaw, and so his outrage at the criminality of a man he had admired and envied is mingled with a sense of responsibility. He hatches a scheme to extract restitution, enlisting a bunch of other aggrieved parties, mostly fellow tower workers, to burgle Shaw's penthouse during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Josh believes that $20 million in cash is hidden in a secret safe, though the real situation turns out to be much more complicated.
There are heist pictures that offer careful and detailed accounts of criminal procedure, generating suspense by focusing on the precise arrangements necessary to bring a brazen and improbable crime to fruition. ''Tower Heist'' is emphatically not one of those movies. Important plot points seem to have been edited away -- or never bothered with in the first place -- and credulity is strained at nearly every point, sometimes amusingly (as when a car dangles from a skyscraper, apparently unnoticed by the crowds below) and sometimes annoyingly.
If this is a Robin Hood story, it is more in the manner of Daffy Duck than Errol Flynn (or, heaven help us, Russell Crowe). Which is great -- or would be if Mr. Ratner were daring or disciplined enough to unleash the full farcical anarchy that ''Tower Heist'' occasionally promises but rarely delivers. Josh has a motley crew backing him up, including Gabourey Sidibe as a housekeeper, Michael Pena as an elevator operator, Casey Affleck as a concierge and Matthew Broderick as an evicted tower tenant, an unemployed stock trader whose misery results from the general financial malaise rather than his upstairs neighbor's corruption. They are abetted by a sympathetic F.B.I. agent (Tea Leoni) and coached by Slide, a hoodlum played by Mr. Murphy.
On the one hand, there is something a little dismaying about seeing Mr. Murphy in such a blatantly stereotypical role. In the movies, it seems, when a white guy wants to commit a crime, he hires an available black guy to teach him how to do it. ''Horrible Bosses,'' in which Jamie Foxx took on the mentor duties, at least tried for a hint of protective self-consciousness, but that might be too much to ask in this case.
On the other hand, though, Mr. Murphy's blend of exuberance and hostility is just what ''Tower Heist'' needs. Younger viewers who know him only as Dr. Dolittle and the voice of Shrek's sidekick Donkey will catch a glimpse of an earlier, more volatile performer, and conscientious parents will hasten to add ''48 Hours,''''Trading Places'' and the ''Beverly Hills Cop'' movies to the Netflix queue.
If only Mr. Stiller were in similarly strong form. Josh is closer to the anxious, frantic character he played in the ''Night at the Museum'' films than to his crazier comic inventions, which is a shame. And while we're at it, what about Ms. Leoni, who was so marvelously and crazily paired with Mr. Stiller in ''Flirting With Disaster''? If not for one pretty funny drunken scene, you would not know from watching ''Tower Heist'' that she is one of the sharpest and most resourceful comic actresses in movies.
Oh, well. Mediocre entertainment is not a crime -- this is still America, dammit! -- but ''Tower Heist'' could and should have been much more. Mr. Ratner goes for the safe bet and the easy score, which means that, for all his shows of solidarity with the working stiffs, he has more in common with the wealthy scam artist who took their hard-earned money.
''Tower Heist'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Naughty words and deeds.

HEADLINE: U.S. Leverage Is Limited as Greek Debt Drama Dominates G-20 Meeting

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
CANNES, France -- President Obama plunged Thursday into the fast-moving European debt crisis, arriving here to exhort European leaders to get their financial house in order.
But while the president hustled from meeting to meeting with world leaders, he was in many ways thrust into the rare position of bystander, as the unfolding drama over whether the Greek government would fall (it did not) and whether Greece would back the comprehensive accord to protect the euro reached last week (it will, at least for now) dominated conversations in the hallways and conference rooms here in this iconic seaside town.
The grand Espace Riviera is more accustomed to red-carpet arrivals by movie stars and hangers-on for the Cannes Film Festival; on Thursday it was transformed instead into ground zero for blue-suited bureaucrats grappling with a financial crisis and the global contagion that it threatened. 
Instead of Angelina Jolie posing before the paparazzi, it was Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany holding a frozen smile as she greeted Mr. Obama in front of the cameras. There was little preening before the hundreds of reporters gathered from all over the world; President Nicolas Sarkozy of France quickly swept Mr. Obama into a meeting to discuss how to try to stop the unfolding Greek drama from turning into a tragedy, for global markets at least.
Mr. Obama arrived early Thursday morning and, during an initial meeting with Mr. Sarkozy, he called the European financial crisis the most important task for world leaders gathered at the Group of 20 economic summit meeting.
For Mr. Obama, the stakes are high. He has called the European financial crisis the largest headwind facing the American economic recovery, and he knows that his own re-election prospects are tied to how well the American economy does. But at the same time, his leverage is limited.
In public, Mr. Obama largely stuck to his administration's official message that Europe's leaders must ''flesh out details'' about the plan they agreed to last week in Brussels to deal with the debt crisis in the 17 European Union countries that use the euro. But American officials, including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, were huddled in private with their European counterparts trying to hash out an agreement that, at the very least, would stop the disintegration under way in Greece from spreading to Italy and Spain, a contagion that could further stymie America's own anemic economic recovery.
American officials exhorted their European counterparts to use Europe's own resources to try to solve the crisis, instead of seeking bailout help from China. Obama administration officials point to the steps that the United States took to try to address its own financial crisis over the past three years.
''Look, we went through this ourselves,'' an Obama administration official said on Thursday, speaking on grounds of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. ''They have the capacity to handle this within Europe.''
Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said that the 2008 Wall Street crisis could provide insight on steps Europe should take. He maintained that the United States remains influential in advising its allies on how to deal with the problem, even if the United States is in no position to provide financial support.
''The United States, obviously, has a great deal of influence, because of who we are and the role we play in the global economy, and globally in general,'' Mr. Carney said in a news briefing on Wednesday. ''I would not discount the significance of the experience that we have in terms of its usefulness to the Europeans.''
The Obama administration is not eager to see an increase in the resources sent by the International Monetary Fund to Europe; that might further mute American influence as the additional resources would most likely not come from the United States, but rather from Asia -- and most likely China.
''The I.M.F. has a substantial amount of resources to deal with a range of challenges in Europe and around the world,'' said Benjamin Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications.
Michael Froman, the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, said the turmoil in Greece and uncertainty over how exactly Europe plans to carry out its accord to cut Greece's debt and shore up its finances ''underscores the need to move rapidly toward the full elaboration and implementation of the plan.''
Specifically, Mr. Froman said that the United States wants to make sure that Europe has ''a firewall that is sufficiently robust and effective ensuring the crisis does not spread from one country to another.''
Mr. Froman said the United States was also trying to make sure that attention was also paid to stimulating economic growth, both in Greece and throughout the euro zone. Part of the anger among Greek citizens has stemmed from a belief that the euro agreement focuses more on Greek austerity and repaying the banks than on growth, a balance that many people fear could lead to higher unemployment rates as the Greek government cuts public sector jobs to pay its creditors and stabilize its finances.
''I think right now the highest priority in Greece is stabilizing the situation,'' Mr. Froman said. ''But the program that Greece has is also about reforming its system and engaging in structural reforms, so that it could become more competitive and therefore grow as part of the euro area.''

HEADLINE: Experts Say Bleak Portrait Of Poverty Missed the Mark

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, ROBERT GEBELOFF and SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When the Census Bureau said in September that the number of poor Americans had soared by 10 million to rates rarely seen in four decades, commentators called the report ''shocking'' and ''bleak.'' Most poverty experts would add another description: ''flawed.''
Concocted on the fly a half-century ago, the official poverty measure ignores ever more of what is happening to the poor person's wallet -- good and bad. It overlooks hundreds of billions of dollars the needy receive in food stamps and other benefits and the similarly formidable amounts they lose to taxes and medical care. It even fails to note that rents are higher in places like Manhattan than they are in Mississippi.
On Monday, that may start to change when the Census Bureau releases a long-promised alternate measure meant to do a better job of counting the resources the needy have and the bills they have to pay. Similar measures, quietly published in the past, suggest among other things that safety-net programs have played a large and mostly overlooked role in restraining hardship: as much as half of the reported rise in poverty since 2006 disappears. 
The fuller measures have also shown less poverty among children but more among older Americans, who are plagued by high medical costs. They have shown less poverty among blacks but more among Asians; less poverty in rural areas and more in cities and suburbs, where the cost of living is high. And they have found fewer people in abject destitution, but a great many more crowding the hard-luck ranks of the near poor, who do not qualify for many benefit programs and lose income to taxes, child care and medical costs.
''The official measure no longer corresponds to reality,'' said Jane Waldfogel, a professor of social work at Columbia University. ''It doesn't get either side of the equation right -- how much the poor have or how much they need. No one really trusts the data.''
Coming amid soaring need and bitter debt debates, the findings in Monday's release are likely to offer fodder both to defenders of safety-net programs and fiscal conservatives who say the government already does much to temper hardship and needs to do no more.
Experts expect the new report to be consistent with a decade of research about the ways in which the official poverty rate distorts the realities of American poverty.
The numbers in this article are based on that research -- by the census, the National Academy of Sciences and others -- and include not just cash income but also government benefits, work expenses, taxes and cost of living. Many experts expect Monday's census report, based on similar methods, to add a bit to the official poverty count of 46.2 million, while most experts also expect the recent growth will ap-pear less steep.
One alternate census data set quietly published last week said the number of poor people has grown by 4.6 million since 2006, not by 9.7 million as the bureau reported in September. At least 39 states showed no statistically significant poverty growth despite surging unemployment, according to an analysis by The New York Times, including Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas.
In North Carolina, poverty has risen by more than 250,000 people by official count, but stayed flat under the alternate measure despite soaring unemployment.
One explanation can be found in programs the official count ignores: food stamps and tax credits. Combined the two programs delivered $221 billion across the country last year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, more than doubling since 2006.
In Charlotte, Angelique Melton was among the beneficiaries. A divorced mother of two, Ms. Melton, 42, had worked her way up to a $39,000 a year position at a construction management firm. But as building halted in 2009, Ms. Melton lost her job.
Struggling to pay the rent and keep the family adequately fed, she took the only job she could find: a part-time position at Wal-Mart that paid less than half her former salary. With an annual income of about $7,500 -- well below the poverty line of $17,400 for a family of three -- Ms. Melton was officially poor.
Unofficially she was not.
After trying to stretch her shrunken income, Ms. Melton signed up for $3,600 a year in food stamps and received $1,800 in nutritional supplements from the Women, Infants and Children program. And her small salary qualified her for large tax credits, which arrive in the form of an annual check -- in her case for about $4,000.
Along with housing aid, those subsidies gave her an annual income of nearly $18,800 -- no one's idea of rich, but by the new count not poor.
''They help you, my God,'' Ms. Melton said. ''I would not have made it otherwise.''
The official way of counting poverty -- beloved not even by many of the people who run the count -- is a historical artifact. A federal official named Mollie Orshansky created it as a placeholder in 1963 until something more sophisticated came along.
It takes a limited view of income by counting cash alone. It ignores expenses, like taxes and medical costs. And it set the poverty threshold in an outmoded way -- as a multiple of food costs, which have dwindled as a share of most budgets, as is typical as a country becomes richer over time.
All three elements need updating, experts say. Yet other than to adjust the poverty line for inflation, the government has not changed it since Ms. Orshansky's day. Efforts to do so have been slowed by both technical and political concerns. Conservatives worry liberals will inflate the number to justify more spending; liberals worry conservatives will define poverty away.
Virtually every effort to take a fuller view -- counting more income and more expenses -- shows poverty rising more slowly in the recession than the official data suggests. That is true of localized studies in New York City and Wisconsin and at least four different national data sets that the Census Bureau publishes. While the official national measure shows a rise of 9.8 million people, the fuller census measures show a range from 4.5 million to 4.8 million.
''That's a big difference,'' said Timothy Smeeding, an economist at the University of Wisconsin who oversaw the study in that state. ''It's about time we started counting the programs we use to fight poverty.''
Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the new measure ''is showing that government help is keeping millions of families above the poverty line right now.''
While most scholars have called the fuller measure a step forward, Robert Rector, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, argues that both census counts -- old and new -- sharply overstate the amount of deprivation in the United States. In a recent study, he cited government data showing many poor families had game systems like Xbox.
''When the American public hears the word poverty, they are thinking about material hardship -- bad housing, homelessness and hunger,'' he said. ''Most of the people that are defined as poor by the government are not poor in that sense.''
One consistent finding in the alternate measures is that poverty falls among children, the target of many government programs. And it rises among Americans 65 or older, who often have high out-of-pocket medical costs, despite being covered by Medicare.
Such is the case for John William Springs, 69, a retired city worker in Charlotte who gets nearly $12,000 a year in Social Security and disability checks. That leaves him about $1,300 above the poverty threshold for a single adult his age -- officially not poor. Then again, Mr. Springs had a heart attack last summer and struggles with lung disease. Factor in the $2,500 a year that he estimates he spends on medicine, and Mr. Springs crosses the statistical line into poverty.
An upbeat survivor of a lifetime of need, Mr. Springs fills his prescriptions in partial amounts and argues the poverty counters got him right the first time.
''I ain't poor,'' he said. ''I eat. I got a roof over my head.''
Some experts say cases like that of Mr. Springs may point to a hidden need among the elderly, whose official poverty rates have sharply declined over the past generation. Others have cautioned that the new measure still has flaws -- failing to capture, for instance, that many elderly can draw from savings and are less reliant on annual income and benefits than younger people.
One concern in recent years is the sharp rise in ''deep'' poverty, defined as living on less than half the money it would take to no longer be poor. That is partly because of changes that make cash welfare harder to get. Yet many of the very poor do receive food stamps, a program whose rapid expansion has made it a safety net of last resort.
In part by counting food stamps, the fuller Census measure analyzed by The Times shows deep poverty falling by nearly 25 percent.
At the same time, all the new measures show many more people in ''near poverty'' -- living on incomes between 100 percent and 150 percent of the poverty line. The alternate census data show a 50 percent rise in their numbers, with 44 million Americans in that economic band, where benefits dwindle in sums lost to taxes and child care, and medical expenses mount. ''That's where your safety net benefits phase out,'' said Sheila Zedlewski, a researcher at the Urban Institute.
Even with assistance, life is a series of hard choices. Ashley Bolton was lifted above the poverty line under the new measure by about $10,000 in federal programs that cushioned her earnings as a hostess at the Original Pancake House in Charlotte. Still, sometimes she lets her car insurance lapse. She juggles two part-time jobs with classes to become a pharmacy technician, and relies on her mother, who works nights, to put her children to bed.
''I live the recession,'' Ms. Bolton said. ''All that stuff that happened to people -- that's my life every day.''

HEADLINE: Shale Gas Revolution

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The United States is a country that has received many blessings, and once upon a time you could assume that Americans would come together to take advantage of them. But you can no longer make that assumption. The country is more divided and more clogged by special interests. Now we groan to absorb even the most wondrous gifts.
A few years ago, a business genius named George P. Mitchell helped offer such a gift. As Daniel Yergin writes in ''The Quest,'' his gripping history of energy innovation, Mitchell fought through waves of skepticism and opposition to extract natural gas from shale. The method he and his team used to release the trapped gas, called fracking, has paid off in the most immense way. In 2000, shale gas represented just 1 percent of American natural gas supplies. Today, it is 30 percent and rising. 
John Rowe, the chief executive of the utility Exelon, which derives almost all its power from nuclear plants, says that shale gas is one of the most important energy revolutions of his lifetime. It's a cliche word, Yergin told me, but the fracking innovation is game-changing. It transforms the energy marketplace.
The U.S. now seems to possess a 100-year supply of natural gas, which is the cleanest of the fossil fuels. This cleaner, cheaper energy source is already replacing dirtier coal-fired plants. It could serve as the ideal bridge, Amy Jaffe of Rice University says, until renewable sources like wind and solar mature.
Already shale gas has produced more than half a million new jobs, not only in traditional areas like Texas but also in economically wounded places like western Pennsylvania and, soon, Ohio. If current trends continue, there are hundreds of thousands of new jobs to come.
Chemical companies rely heavily on natural gas, and the abundance of this new source has induced companies like Dow Chemical to invest in the U.S. rather than abroad. The French company Vallourec is building a $650 million plant in Youngstown, Ohio, to make steel tubes for the wells. States like Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York will reap billions in additional revenue. Consumers also benefit. Today, natural gas prices are less than half of what they were three years ago, lowering electricity prices. Meanwhile, America is less reliant on foreign suppliers.
All of this is tremendously good news, but, of course, nothing is that simple. The U.S. is polarized between ''drill, baby, drill'' conservatives, who seem suspicious of most regulation, and some environmentalists, who seem to regard fossil fuels as morally corrupt and imagine we can switch to wind and solar overnight.
The shale gas revolution challenges the coal industry, renders new nuclear plants uneconomic and changes the economics for the renewable energy companies, which are now much further from viability. So forces have gathered against shale gas, with predictable results.
The clashes between the industry and the environmentalists are now becoming brutal and totalistic, dehumanizing each side. Not-in-my-backyard activists are organizing to prevent exploration. Environmentalists and their publicists wax apocalyptic.
Like every energy source, fracking has its dangers. The process involves injecting large amounts of water and chemicals deep underground. If done right, this should not contaminate freshwater supplies, but rogue companies have screwed up and there have been instances of contamination.
The wells, which are sometimes beneath residential areas, are serviced by big trucks that damage the roads and alter the atmosphere in neighborhoods. A few sloppy companies could discredit the whole sector.
These problems are real, but not insurmountable. An exhaustive study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded, ''With 20,000 shale wells drilled in the last 10 years, the environmental record of shale-gas development is for the most part a good one.'' In other words, the inherent risks can be managed if there is a reasonable regulatory regime, and if the general public has a balanced and realistic sense of the costs and benefits.
This kind of balance is exactly what our political system doesn't deliver. So far, the Obama administration has done a good job of trying to promote fracking while investigating the downsides. But the general public seems to be largely uninterested in the breakthrough (even though it could have a major impact on the 21st-century economy). The discussion is dominated by vested interests and the extremes. It's becoming another weapon in the political wars, with Republicans swinging behind fracking and Democrats being pressured to come out against. Especially in the Northeast, the gas companies are demonized as Satan in corporate form.
A few weeks ago, I sat around with John Rowe, one of the most trusted people in the energy business, and listened to him talk enthusiastically about this windfall. He has no vested interest in this; indeed, his company might be hurt. But he knows how much shale gas could mean to America. It would be a crime if we squandered this blessing.

HEADLINE: Oligarchy, American Style

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Inequality is back in the news, largely thanks to Occupy Wall Street, but with an assist from the Congressional Budget Office. And you know what that means: It's time to roll out the obfuscators!
Anyone who has tracked this issue over time knows what I mean. Whenever growing income disparities threaten to come into focus, a reliable set of defenders tries to bring back the blur. Think tanks put out reports claiming that inequality isn't really rising, or that it doesn't matter. Pundits try to put a more benign face on the phenomenon, claiming that it's not really the wealthy few versus the rest, it's the educated versus the less educated.
So what you need to know is that all of these claims are basically attempts to obscure the stark reality: We have a society in which money is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few people, and in which that concentration of income and wealth threatens to make us a democracy in name only. 
The budget office laid out some of that stark reality in a recent report, which documented a sharp decline in the share of total income going to lower- and middle-income Americans. We still like to think of ourselves as a middle-class country. But with the bottom 80 percent of households now receiving less than half of total income, that's a vision increasingly at odds with reality.
In response, the usual suspects have rolled out some familiar arguments: the data are flawed (they aren't); the rich are an ever-changing group (not so); and so on. The most popular argument right now seems, however, to be the claim that we may not be a middle-class society, but we're still an upper-middle-class society, in which a broad class of highly educated workers, who have the skills to compete in the modern world, is doing very well.
It's a nice story, and a lot less disturbing than the picture of a nation in which a much smaller group of rich people is becoming increasingly dominant. But it's not true.
Workers with college degrees have indeed, on average, done better than workers without, and the gap has generally widened over time. But highly educated Americans have by no means been immune to income stagnation and growing economic insecurity. Wage gains for most college-educated workers have been unimpressive (and nonexistent since 2000), while even the well-educated can no longer count on getting jobs with good benefits. In particular, these days workers with a college degree but no further degrees are less likely to get workplace health coverage than workers with only a high school degree were in 1979.
So who is getting the big gains? A very small, wealthy minority.
The budget office report tells us that essentially all of the upward redistribution of income away from the bottom 80 percent has gone to the highest-income 1 percent of Americans. That is, the protesters who portray themselves as representing the interests of the 99 percent have it basically right, and the pundits solemnly assuring them that it's really about education, not the gains of a small elite, have it completely wrong.
If anything, the protesters are setting the cutoff too low. The recent budget office report doesn't look inside the top 1 percent, but an earlier report, which only went up to 2005, found that almost two-thirds of the rising share of the top percentile in income actually went to the top 0.1 percent -- the richest thousandth of Americans, who saw their real incomes rise more than 400 percent over the period from 1979 to 2005.
Who's in that top 0.1 percent? Are they heroic entrepreneurs creating jobs? No, for the most part, they're corporate executives. Recent research shows that around 60 percent of the top 0.1 percent either are executives in nonfinancial companies or make their money in finance, i.e., Wall Street broadly defined. Add in lawyers and people in real estate, and we're talking about more than 70 percent of the lucky one-thousandth.
But why does this growing concentration of income and wealth in a few hands matter? Part of the answer is that rising inequality has meant a nation in which most families don't share fully in economic growth. Another part of the answer is that once you realize just how much richer the rich have become, the argument that higher taxes on high incomes should be part of any long-run budget deal becomes a lot more compelling.
The larger answer, however, is that extreme concentration of income is incompatible with real democracy. Can anyone seriously deny that our political system is being warped by the influence of big money, and that the warping is getting worse as the wealth of a few grows ever larger?
Some pundits are still trying to dismiss concerns about rising inequality as somehow foolish. But the truth is that the whole nature of our society is at stake.

HEADLINE: Demonstrators Test Mayor, a Backer of Wall St. and Free Speech

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
Shortly before noon on Wednesday, the barricades that impeded foot traffic along Wall Street for weeks came down. Elected officials praised the mayor. Shopkeepers breathed sighs of relief.
But just seven hours later, the barricades went back up. Occupy Wall Street protesters were on the move, and the police were worried they would flood the street.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who over the last seven weeks has struggled publicly with how to manage New York City's response to the demonstration Occupy Wall Street, on Thursday offered a staccato analysis of his administration's latest effort at finding a way forward:
''Taken down. People marched in the streets. Put up. We'll try again.'' 
The decision to remove the barricades, followed by the quick reversal, was emblematic of the quandary that has vexed Mr. Bloomberg and his administration since a few hundred people critical of the nation's economic inequities first bedded down in Zuccotti Park on Sept. 17.
Mr. Bloomberg's evolving response to the protest has come to embody a central tension in his third term, between his celebration of free, and at times cacophonous, speech as a hallmark of New York, and his emphasis on bolstering the city's economy by improving its appeal to residents, employers and tourists. Mr. Bloomberg, who is generally known for his decisiveness, at first emphasized his disagreements with the protesters, then began describing them as peaceful dissenters exercising a fundamental liberty. In the last several days, he has sounded increasingly exasperated, a reflection of complaints from neighbors and accusations of criminal activity in Zuccotti Park.
''There is no easy answer,'' Mr. Bloomberg told reporters on Thursday morning. ''But there is a right answer, and the right answer is allow people to protest, but at the same time enforce public safety, provide public safety and quality-of-life issues, and we will continue to do that.''
Since Sept. 15, when a reporter asked him about the planned protest -- ''First I heard about it,'' he responded -- Occupy Wall Street has come to dominate Mr. Bloomberg's public time. He was asked about the movement while marching in a Columbus Day parade, painting the finish line for the New York City Marathon and visiting Jerusalem. His attitude toward the protesters has been parodied on ''Saturday Night Live.'' At one point, he felt compelled to disclose that he did not talk about Zuccotti Park while in bed with his girlfriend.
The mayor is in an awkward position -- while the protesters proclaim themselves ''the 99 percent,'' Mr. Bloomberg, with a net worth estimated by Forbes at $19.5 billion, is an elite member of the top 1 percent, the 12th richest person in a nation of 312 million. His wealth derives from Wall Street, the target of the protesters' ire, and he has repeatedly made clear that he does not support the demonstrators' arguments or their tactics.
''My personal view is, why don't you get out there and try to do something about the things that you don't like, create the jobs that we are lacking, rather than just yell and scream,'' Mr. Bloomberg said Thursday. ''But if you want to yell and scream, we'll make sure you can do it.''
Mr. Bloomberg has managed simultaneously to be less sympathetic to the protesters' point of view, and more sympathetic to their right to protest, than some other elected officials around the nation. ''There's nobody that's more of a defender of the First Amendment than I am,'' he has often said.
In Oakland, Calif., protesters have been furious with the mayor, Jean Quan, since the police used tear gas at a demonstration; this week, a march there attracted thousands and forced the port to close. In Los Angeles, Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa had been accommodating, giving the protesters ponchos during a rainstorm, but has more recently said that their encampment ''cannot continue indefinitely.''
In New York, the protests have altered life at City Hall. Mr. Bloomberg meets daily with an unofficial protest task force, made up of the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly; the fire commissioner, Salvatore J. Cassano; two deputy mayors, Howard Wolfson and Caswell F. Holloway; and the head of the city's Law Department, Michael Cardozo. Many evenings, he calls Mr. Wolfson or Mr. Holloway for an update before he goes to sleep.
For Mr. Wolfson, protest response has become virtually a full-time job. He talks regularly with key players, including John E. Zuccotti, the co-chairman of Brookfield Properties, the company that owns the park; members of the local community board; and elected officials and labor leaders. He monitors social media and occasionally responds to critics.
Mr. Wolfson and Mr. Holloway visit the park; Mr. Wolfson rides by on his bike on weekends. Mr. Wolfson photographed a warning sign near flammable materials at the encampment, which he then posted on the Internet as evidence after fire officials confiscated generators and cans of gasoline.
Mr. Bloomberg has interacted with the protesters directly only once, on the evening of Oct. 12, when he briefly walked through the park. He was both cheered and heckled as ''Billionaire Bloomberg.''
''Clearly he's not personally or ideologically committed'' to the protesters' agenda, said Douglas A. Muzzio, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College, ''and he has spoken publicly and sometimes in a tone-deaf way about what their agenda might be and what it all means.'' At the same time, Professor Muzzio said, he ''doesn't want to be known as the anti-free-speech mayor'' or ''the hammer of the 1 percent.''
In the early weeks, the New York police came down hard on the protesters, arresting hundreds during a march across the Brooklyn Bridge, and pepper-spraying several during a rally. But an effort to clear out Zuccotti Park temporarily for cleaning was abandoned when hundreds of supporters gathered to protect the encampment. There continue to be regular arrests -- on Thursday, over a dozen demonstrators were detained after marching to the headquarters of Goldman Sachs -- but the city has generally tried to avoid confrontation.
''As inconvenient as this is, the image that New York City is peaceful and tolerant in the long run is better for business than the image that the city is turbulent and ugly, and I think the mayor and the people who surround him understand that,'' said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor of political science at Hunter College.
Some of the protesters said they sensed that Mr. Bloomberg was in a difficult position.
''I don't think it's prudent for him to make a decision on what's going on here right now, for a lot of different reasons,'' Jason Harris, 40, said. ''The general feel that I get when I'm down here is I sense a limbo in the political system and our leadership in exactly how to handle this.''
Mr. Bloomberg and his aides seem uncertain when, or how, the protest will end, although they have suggested that winter could thin the protesters' ranks, and have pledged to take whatever actions they deem appropriate for public safety.
''At the moment, it will continue,'' Mr. Bloomberg said of the protest last week. ''What will happen down the road... ,'' he said, trailing off. ''We watch it very carefully.''

HEADLINE: For Perry, Use Of Private Jets As Part of Job

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
On a July morning in 2008, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and several aides boarded a plane for Washington to lobby on ethanol use, an issue important to corn growers and livestock owners in his state.
The growers favored federal rules requiring the use of the corn-based fuel in gasoline, but beef and chicken suppliers said the rules would raise the price of feed stocks. Mr. Perry was firmly in the livestock camp, and he took his case straight to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, urging him to waive the ethanol mandate to lower the cost of corn.
While executives from the livestock industry did not attend Mr. Perry's private meeting at the E.P.A., the governor would not have made it there without them -- literally. The Hawker 800XP plane that Mr. Perry and his team flew from Austin to Washington and back was provided by Lonnie Pilgrim, one of the world's largest chicken producers and a leading critic of the ethanol mandate. 
Mr. Pilgrim had urged Mr. Perry during a meeting in March to take up the matter, and a lobbyist for Mr. Pilgrim's company, the Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, worked with the governor's office to prepare for the waiver request. The poultry magnate also flew the governor to Washington in June to take part in a news conference on the issue.
The two trips, each valued at $9,179, were among more than 200 flights worth a total of $1.3 million that Mr. Perry has accepted -- free -- from corporate executives and wealthy donors during 11 years as governor, according to an analysis of Texas Ethics Commission records by The New York Times.
Although many of the trips were for political or ceremonial events -- not unusual for elected officials -- others involved governmental functions, including some that were of interest to the planes' owners. As a result, a group of well-heeled businessmen has effectively helped underwrite some of Mr. Perry's activities as governor.
The head of a Texas oil refinery spent almost $20,000 flying Mr. Perry and his staff to a trade meeting in Mexico, where the governor asked Mexican energy officials to consider more joint ventures with Texas oil companies. Other Texas business owners have paid Mr. Perry's way to Washington to lobby on immigration, testify before Congress and meet with the homeland security secretary.
Mr. Perry's travels adhere to Texas ethics laws, and he is far from alone in accepting gifts of air travel. But among politicians he stands out for taking private flights for activities that are considered part of his job as governor. That is different from campaign travel or the sort of quasi-official trips for which officeholders normally use private planes, like attending a conference or giving a speech.
''It would be unusual for an official to be flown to Washington to testify before Congress by a special interest of some kind,'' said Robert M. Stern, president of the Center for Governmental Studies in Los Angeles. ''Usually the state would pay for that.''
Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Mr. Perry, defended the governor's use of private planes, saying it was part of an effort to save tax dollars. Mr. Sullivan acknowledged ''there are critiques to be made'' about using state-owned versus private planes, but said ''we chose to err on the side of protecting taxpayers.''
When the governor's staff asks to use a private plane, no promises are made and no consideration is given to whether the owner has an interest in the trip, he said. ''Over the years we've developed a good feel for supporters and other Texans who own private aircraft that we could ask to use,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''The governor bases all of his decisions on his philosophy and on what he believes is best for the citizens of the state.''
Mr. Perry's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination has had to answer questions recently about his use of supporters' planes. Two weeks ago, after The Times questioned whether he was properly reimbursing the costs of such flights for the presidential race, his campaign said it had mistakenly understated them and would pay tens of thousands of dollars more to comply with the law.
Before running for president, Mr. Perry drew attention in Texas for his plane use. A 2007 report by Texans for Public Justice, a nonprofit policy group, found that of the 338 private plane trips taken by 81 elected officials in the previous two years, Mr. Perry took the most, accounting for 18 percent of the total.
Nationally, concern about the ethics of such practices has stirred changes. When he was governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger regularly flew on jets paid for by donations to a foundation he used for that purpose, until the practice was effectively banned by state law last year. Members of Congress generally cannot use private aircraft for duties related to their office, under a 2007 federal law, said Paul Ryan, a lawyer with the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center.
Texas remains relatively permissive. State law says an officeholder's expenses can be paid with private donations if they ''are not reimbursable with public money,'' which would seem to rule out official trips. The Texas Ethics Commission, however, has said officials are not required to charge those expenses to the state. Further, while state law allows officials to count the cost of any flights as in-kind campaign donations, they are not required to reimburse plane owners.
As a result, said Buck Wood, an Austin lawyer who specializes in ethics cases and admits being ''no friend of Rick Perry,'' the governor broke no laws by accepting flights for official activities.
''If you want to say it smells to hell, it does,'' Mr. Wood said. ''But the fact is, that sort of transaction is not uncommon and is permitted in Texas.''
Details of Mr. Perry's flights as governor are sketchy. The purpose of in-state trips does not need to be reported, and only minimal disclosure is required for those outside the state. In the case of the ethanol lobbying trip, Mr. Pilgrim had an obvious interest, but any motivations of other plane owners are less clear; none of those contacted, including representatives of Mr. Pilgrim, would comment.
The privately financed trips included that official visit to Mexico in August 2007, where Mr. Perry met with President Felipe Calderon and took along Texas business leaders to talk about trade. The flight was provided by Paul Foster, the chairman of Western Refining, an El Paso-based oil refiner and marketer with interests in Mexico. During the trip, Mr. Perry encouraged the Mexican government to open up its state-owned oil monopoly to partnerships with Texas companies.
When Mr. Perry and aides traveled to Capitol Hill to testify about hurricane relief before the Senate Appropriations Committee, the flight was provided by Danny Janecka, the owner of a Texas food processing company, who has given $158,000 to Mr. Perry's campaigns. Mr. Janecka paid $16,700 for the round-trip flight, according to ethics commission records.
Mr. Perry has taken trips paid for by TexasOne, a nonprofit economic development initiative he created that is financed by corporations including AT&T, Exxon Mobil and Novartis. The foundation arranged for Mr. Perry and his wife to use a private plane for an economic development trip to Israel in 2009, paid for with an $180,000 donation from a road-building contractor, according to published reports confirmed by the governor's office.
The trips provided by Mr. Pilgrim in 2008 followed a lobbying effort by the livestock industry to halve the national quota of nine billion gallons of renewable fuel that year. Mr. Pilgrim, who has contributed more than $600,000 to Mr. Perry's state campaigns, donated $100,000 to the Republican Governors Association, then led by Mr. Perry, in March 2008, around the time the ethanol issue was being discussed.
Mr. Sullivan, the governor's spokesman, said that he did not know how Mr. Perry wound up using Mr. Pilgrim's plane, but that it did not affect Mr. Perry's decision to pursue the waiver, which the governor had long believed was necessary to protect a major sector of the state's economy.
Mr. Perry's June flight to Washington to take part in a news conference with livestock industry lobbyists was noted at the time by The Houston Chronicle, which first reported on the governor's dealings with Mr. Pilgrim on the ethanol issue. His subsequent trip to meet with Stephen L. Johnson, then the E.P.A. administrator, has not been previously reported. After that meeting, Mr. Perry and his aides returned to Austin the same day, according to Flightwise.com, which tracks flight data.
Mr. Johnson ultimately decided against granting the waiver. But Mr. Perry's lobbying did not sit well with corn growers, who said they felt snubbed by the governor's office, which seemed to be taking its cues from the influential livestock and poultry industry.
''We came to the view that it was more about politics than about policy,'' said David Gibson, executive director of the Texas Corn Producers Board.

HEADLINE: As Regulators Pressed Changes, Corzine Pushed Back, and Won

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED and BEN PROTESS; Michael J. de la Merced, Andrew Ross Sorkin and Peter Lattman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Months before MF Global teetered on the brink, federal regulators were seeking to rein in the types of risky trades that contributed to the firm's collapse. But they faced opposition from an influential opponent: Jon S. Corzine, the head of the then little-known brokerage firm.
As a former United States senator and a former governor of New Jersey, as well as the leader of Goldman Sachs in the 1990s, Mr. Corzine carried significant weight in the worlds of Washington and Wall Street. While other financial firms employed teams of lobbyists to fight the new regulation, MF Global's chief executive in meetings over the last year personally pressed regulators to halt their plans.
The agency proposing the rule, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, relented. Wall Street, which has been working to curb many financial regulations, won another battle. 
Yet with MF Global in bankruptcy and regulators scrambling to find $630 million in missing customer funds, Mr. Corzine's effort may come back to haunt him.
The proposed rule would have restricted a complicated transaction that allowed MF Global in essence to borrow money from its own customers. Brokerage firms are allowed to use customers' money to earn interest, not unlike banks, but this rule would have outlawed using customer funds for a loan to the firm itself.
While such financing is not unknown on Wall Street, it carries substantial risk. An outside lender would require a firm like MF Global to produce strict accounting for a loan. Without that oversight, regulators worried that firms could use such internal customer money inappropriately, including bolstering the business in hard times. The proposed rule would have affected several dozen other financial firms.
Regulators are now examining whether these transactions explain the missing money at MF Global, according to people briefed on the investigation.
The C.F.T.C. has issued subpoenas to MF Global's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is also conducting an inquiry. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also looking into the missing money, although there is no indication that criminal laws were broken.
Still, Mr. Corzine has hired a prominent criminal defense lawyer, Andrew J. Levander, a partner at Dechert, according to people briefed on the matter.
Mr. Levander represented a number of Wall Street executives after the financial crisis of 2008, including the independent directors of Lehman Brothers and John A. Thain, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch.
Neither Mr. Corzine nor MF Global has been accused of wrongdoing. MF Global declined to comment and Mr. Corzine did not respond to a request for comment.
Just three months ago, Mr. Corzine's firm assured regulators that the proposed rule could cripple the futures brokerage industry by hurting their profitability. In a letter, MF Global told regulators that they were trying to ''fix something that is not broken,'' adding that the firm was not aware of any brokerage firm like itself that was unable to ''provide to their customers upon request any segregated funds.''
MF Global's clients, including hedge funds, individual investors and agricultural firms, now know a different reality, as the clients struggle to locate their missing funds. And regulators are pushing to again move forward on the rule. But for MF Global, the rule will come too late.
The trades at the center of MF Global's downfall - big bets on the debt of five European countries - may yet prove profitable. But they raise questions about why the firm escalated its risk-taking under Mr. Corzine, leading to a crisis of confidence among rating agencies, creditors and regulators.
As a former sovereign debt trader at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Corzine wagered that the European regulators would backstop any default. So even as dark clouds circled over Europe, he sensed an opportunity. Starting in late 2010, MF Global began to accumulate short-term sovereign debt of countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal.
MF Global financed these purchases through complex transactions known as repurchase agreements. In these, the bonds themselves were used as collateral for a loan to purchase them. The interest paid on that loan was less than the interest the bonds paid out, earning the firm a profit from the spread.
While that practice is quite common, the C.F.T.C. wanted to crack down on such lending in those instances when customer funds were used. The C.F.T.C. proposal would have also banned the use of client funds to buy foreign sovereign debt.
It is unclear whether the firm used client funds to purchase the risky bonds of Italy, Spain, and other debt-laden European nations, but experts say it is not unusual for such transactions to be paid for with customer money.
A person close to MF Global said the firm did not use client funds to finance these trades.
Leading the government's effort to curtail these arcane practices was Gary Gensler, the chairman of C.F.T.C., who had worked for Mr. Corzine at Goldman Sachs. Mr. Gensler pushed for the proposed change in October 2010, and planned to bring it to a vote this summer.
MF Global has four outside lobbyists in Washington, tiny by Wall Street standards. But it was Mr. Corzine who marshaled the firm's response to the proposal, lobbying most of the agency's five commissioners directly. One commissioner said he visited with Mr. Corzine in MF Global's headquarters, and acknowledged being impressed by the Wall Street titan, said a person with direct knowledge of the meeting who asked for anonymity because the meeting was private.
The C.F.T.C. polices the markets for futures trades. Staff members there often do not have a Wall Street pedigree.
Mr. Corzine's background in finance made him highly credible, agency officials said.
Mr. Corzine's efforts culminated on July 20, as the agency was preparing for a vote on the proposal. That day, MF Global executives were on four different calls with the agency's staff. Mr. Corzine himself was on two of those calls.
One of the calls was with Mr. Gensler. Both men are active Democrats, and served on financial panels together recently.
Shortly after the calls, Mr. Gensler, aware that he could not push the vote through, decided to delay the proposal indefinitely.
But after MF Global's blowup and the ensuing fallout from the missing funds, regulators said they were considering pushing again on the rule.
''I think it's time to move ahead - expeditiously - and make that rule tighter, cleaner, and ultimately safer, for customers,'' Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the C.F.T.C., said in a statement.
Mr. Chilton also wants the agency to require firms to produce detailed documentation ''to ensure that the funds are really there.''
Internal repurchase agreements emerged on Wall Street in 2005. At the time, the transactions were off limits to banks and brokerage firms. But at the urging of Lehman Brothers, the C.F.T.C. blessed the new approach to getting financing.
In September 2008, Lehman collapsed amid a global financial crisis. It later was disclosed that Lehman's use of another little-known repurchase agreement allowed it to temporarily obscure billions of dollars in losses.
Michael J. de la Merced, Andrew Ross Sorkin and Peter Lattman contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Europe's New Central Bank President Cuts Rate

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- The new president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, quickly responded to the latest developments in the sovereign debt crisis on Thursday, overseeing a cut in the euro zone's benchmark interest rate while warning of a mild recession.
Two days after assuming office in one of the most turbulent phases in the history of the euro zone, Mr. Draghi signaled that he might be more willing than his predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, to tolerate inflation in the name of economic growth. The bank cut the benchmark rate to 1.25 percent from 1.5 percent, a move aimed at putting more money into the European economy by making borrowing easier.
Investors cheered the decision by pushing stocks higher in Europe and the United States.
The cut, which surprised some analysts, may signal a shift in strategy -- or at least in tone -- at the bank, which oversees monetary policy for the 17 European Union nations that share the euro. Known for his caution, Mr. Draghi, formerly the governor of the Bank of Italy, was not expected to make bold moves so soon. 
But speaking to reporters after he presided as chairman of the bank's governing council for the first time, Mr. Draghi indicated that he felt he had little choice but to reduce interest rates. He warned that economic growth was likely to be significantly worse than the bank expected. That assessment came a day after the Federal Reserve also reduced its growth forecasts through 2013.
While campaigning this year to succeed Mr. Trichet, Mr. Draghi emphasized his credentials as an inflation fighter and as a voice of fiscal prudence in his native Italy. But on Thursday, he played down the risks posed by inflation, which at a current annual rate of 3 percent is above the bank's target of about 2 percent. Slower growth, he indicated, would act as its own curb on inflation.
''In such an environment, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also be moderate,'' he said. ''Today's decision takes this into account.''
At the same time, though, Mr. Draghi disappointed those who want the bank to help calm skittish global investors by aggressively buying European government bonds, using its ability to print money to reduce the risk that the Greek crisis might create a contagion infecting Italy, Spain and others. He stuck to the position that the bond purchases the bank has been making since the spring of 2010 were temporary and limited, and justified solely as a way for the bank to maintain its control over interest rates.
Rather, Mr. Draghi said, it was up to national leaders to regain investor confidence by reining in spending and removing excessive regulations and other obstacles to growth. ''The first and foremost responsibility for maintaining financial stability lies with national economic policies,'' he said.
Mr. Draghi's statements on bond market intervention led some analysts to conclude that, despite the rate cut, he would not veer significantly from the path set by Mr. Trichet. Mr. Draghi described his predecessor on Thursday as a ''role model.''
The bank has spent 173.5 billion euros, or $240 billion, intervening in bond markets since May 2010, a modest sum compared with the securities purchases made by the Fed or the Bank of England to help prop up their own financial markets and stimulate their economies.
''The E.C.B. seems to be continuing to play its dangerous game of doing the minimum amount possible, counting on the European politicians to extinguish the fire,'' Jens Sondergaard, an analyst at Nomura, wrote Thursday in a note to clients.
Still, some analysts said that Mr. Draghi's statements on bond buying should not be taken at face value and that the bank would intervene if necessary to save the euro.
''If worse came to worst, the E.C.B. would buy government bonds on a massive scale,'' Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, wrote in a note.
But Mr. Draghi cannot say that out loud, the thinking goes, for fear that leaders like Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy would renege on promises to remove barriers to competition and improve economic performance.
''It is understandable that they don't want to give governments a free lunch,'' said Marie Diron, a former European Central Bank economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young.
European stocks rose sharply after the bank rate announcement. The Euro Stoxx 50, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, climbed 2.45 percent, helped by signs that Greece would move ahead with the bailout plan. The euro rose to $1.3812. The main United States stock gauges also rose.
After just one meeting of the governing council, it was too early to say whether Mr. Draghi would set the bank on a new course. But he seemed to confirm predictions by some analysts that he would take a more nuanced view of inflation than Mr. Trichet, who was not an economist. Mr. Draghi has a doctorate in the field.
Mr. Draghi on Thursday seemed at ease as the top official at the central bank, rather than just one vote on the governing council. He sparred confidently with reporters and seemed to answer questions more directly than Mr. Trichet, who had been prone to digressions.
Mr. Draghi seemed to be ''a bit more open,'' Ms. Diron said. She noted his frank use of the word ''recession.''
''It is unusual that the E.C.B. would use these words before the data is published,'' she said.
Mr. Draghi, however, also added an extra degree of formality to the monthly news conference, delegating an aide to choose questioners. Mr. Trichet made such selections himself.
The rate cut is the first by the bank since May 2009. It came after interest rate increases in April and July under Mr. Trichet, which many analysts say have made Europe's economic woes worse than they would be otherwise.
Mr. Draghi said the decision to cut rates was unanimous -- a surprise considering the reverence with which German members of the bank's governing council regard price stability.
Mr. Draghi has assumed office with Greece's future in the euro zone in doubt. But he rejected suggestions that Greece could exit, saying there was no legal provision for the country to do so. ''It's not in the treaty,'' he said. ''I have nothing to add to that.''
Mr. Draghi also said that Greece should be the only country to receive debt relief. There have been rumblings in countries like Portugal and Ireland that they, too, should get breaks on their debt. ''The Greek situation is exceptional and unique,'' Mr. Draghi said.
The Portuguese prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, has ruled out renegotiating the main targets set by the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and the European Central Bank, or asking for more money, Reuters reported. But he said the country wanted to discuss ''more flexible conditions in applying the program.''
The central bank meeting coincided with a meeting of the Group of 20 leaders in Cannes. Mr. Draghi planned to meet with G-20 leaders on Thursday night but said he would attend only in his capacity as chairman of a panel that makes recommendations on bank regulation.

HEADLINE: Calculating Poverty

BYLINE: JASON DEPARLE, ROBERT GEBELOFF and SABRINA TAVERNISE


HIGHLIGHT: By consulting a variety of sources, reporters constructed a statistical portrait of the American poor that diverged sharply from previous Census figures. 

 BODY:
To preview how the Census Bureau's new Supplemental Poverty Measure may change the portrait of poverty, The New York Times consulted multiple alternate measures that researchers have quietly published in recent years. 
They included a 2009 version of the Supplemental Poverty Measure, as well as four of eight alternate measures the Census has published, incorporating recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences. 
They also included studies from the University of Wisconsin and from officials in New York City, along with three state analyses by Sheila Zedlewski and colleagues at the Urban Institute. 
While there are differences in the calculations, all go beyond the official measure by counting benefits like food stamps, work expenses, taxes, and the cost of living.
In addition, The Times did an in-depth analysis of one experimental data set (known as MSI-GA-CPI). It is the Census measure that comes closest to the new Supplemental Measure, while also providing a methodologically consistent look back at prerecession years.
That produced a number of interesting figures that our article length could not accommodate.

 Among children, it showed poverty rates falling to 15 percent, from 22 percent, in the official count. That removes about 5.2 million children from poverty. That drop is broadly consistent with what the Urban Institute researchers found in Massachusetts, Illinois and Georgia - an average decline in child poverty of about 24 percent. 
It also falls sharply for women ages 25 to 39 - many of them mothers. Many safety net programs, particularly the Earned Income Tax Credit, focus on families with children.
 Among elderly, The Times's examination of the Census data showed poverty rates rising to 13.8 percent, from 9 percent, by the official count. The 2009 Supplemental Poverty Measure and the Urban Institute studies found broadly similar climbs. 
Some experts found this possibly portentous - a complication in the generally accepted story that poverty among the elderly has been on a long-term decline. Irwin Garfinkel of Columbia University said his own studies of alternate poverty measures showed that the figure had been climbing for a decade. ``We've been slipping backwards and we didn't know that before,'' he said.
But others, including Bruce Meyer of the University of Chicago, cautioned that it could be a statistical anomaly. Many elderly people use retirement savings but do not report that money as income. And measures of consumption among the elderly, these experts say, have not shown a rising level of hardship.
In The Times analysis, poverty rates in rural America drop sharply, to 10.9 percent from 16.4 percent in the official count, most likely reflecting the lower cost of living. But they rise in metropolitan areas, to 14.9 percent from 13.9 percent. While poverty rises in the Northeast and West, it falls in the South and Midwest, by a total of about six million people.
The Times study found poverty dropping sharply among blacks, falling by 6.7 percentage points to 20.6 percent. Most other studies have also showed significant declines among blacks, which could reflect either that they receive relatively more benefits or live in relatively low-cost locations.
The Times study found poverty growing among Asians, as did all the others. It found poverty declining among Latinos, though by a much smaller amount than it declined among blacks. Some other studies have found Latino poverty rates rising. One possibility is that Asian and Latino immigrants have a harder time getting access to benefits. Another is that differences between the official and alternate studies reflect where people happen to live, perhaps disproportionately in high-cost areas.
What elements of the new measure lift people from poverty? The Times examined the characteristics of those Americans considered poor by the official count, but not poor by the alternate. About 70 percent lived in households that received food stamps a year. A third lived in households with housing subsidies and 19 percent lived in households that received the earned income tax credit. 
A caveat: this data is not the same as what the Census Bureau will release on Monday, which among other things uses a different cost-of-living adjustment. But while the numbers may vary, the general trends are likely to remain the same.

HEADLINE: Sick in America, Aching for Africa

BYLINE: DAYO OLOPADE


HIGHLIGHT: Africa's no-frills attitude toward health care is more effective than America's no-expenses-spared approach in treating diseases like malaria. 

 BODY:
CHICAGO - I came down with my first African disease in America. It happened after I traveled to Nigeria last April to witness my country elect a new government. I landed with notebooks and questions, but not antimalarial medication. I had been more prudent on dozens of prior stays, but, I thought, no matter: I had already been running around the continent for months with no mishaps. After three rounds of free and fair voting, I returned to my apartment in Nairobi, buoyant about democracy in Africa. 
Two weeks later, during a visit to the United States for Mother's Day, I found myself flat on a gurney, shuddering in a hallway in a bleached Chicago hospital. Fever, chills, muscle pain, dehydration: I knew I had malaria. The mosquito-borne parasite must have been brewing in my bloodstream for weeks. 
Malaria is a nasty disease and a grave threat to life and to productivity, particularly in Africa. The parasite killed about 781,000 people in 2009, mostly south of the Sahara, and is properly called a scourge of the 108 countries where it's endemic. But the disease can be prevented by taking the prophylaxis I forgot or simply by sleeping under a mosquito net. 
Upon arriving at the Chicago hospital, I told every doctor in sight I had malaria. They needed a lot of convincing. Over the next two days, I underwent blood cultures to check for typhoid, a spinal tap to screen for meningitis, and lengthy interviews with the rarely roused tropical-disease specialist. Three bags of antibiotics hovered over two separate IVs in my right arm. Curious doctors hovered over them.

Feverish and miserable, I found myself wishing I had fallen ill in Africa - anywhere where the disease is so prevalent as to be unmistakable. My nurse - a Nigerian, coincidentally - shook her head at the stream of orders and ointments coming into my room. "It's just malaria," she laughed with me.
Her laugh, along with the hospital's final bill - almost $16,000, not fully covered by insurance - suggested that I may have been better off in a different cultural context. In Kenya, my home at the time, doctors treat malaria as a repeat player, not an exotic case study. A single prick of blood is enough to diagnose the illness; a spinal tap is out of the question. Thanks to subsidies from drug makers, the three-day sequence of pills used to treat the disease comes over-the-counter for less than one dollar. 
The differential in cost and convenience is a result of both differing resources and differing attitudes toward risk. I've visited my share of hospitals and clinics across Africa, and I'll venture to say that patients and doctors there are less cautious. Where official safety nets don't exist, tolerance for illness and injury is high. Insurance policies are scarce. Resilience is assumed. Many hospitals are strictly pay as you go. It's counterintuitive, but this "no frills" approach can improve outcomes and reduce waste. Absent expensive imaging equipment, doctors keep up their diagnostic instincts. Basic tasks are shifted to nurses or community health workers. 
In the United States, by contrast, the most relevant thing about health care is that it does too little and costs too much: standing alone,the U.S. healthcare industry would be the fifth-largest economy in the world. Shannon Brownlee, a colleague at the New America Foundation who wrote a book about overtreatment in the United States, says that a Western sense of advancement is the result of "interventions in data management, consumer empowerment, and awareness, but not necessarily in retail care." Doctors can outsource diagnosis to machines. Patients armed with Web research can insist on unnecessary procedures. The cost of such decisions is often mystifying to patients, and may ultimately break the bank. 
I don't wish to romanticize health systems in Africa. Africa's advantage might not be so for a serious heart condition, or a car accident, or a mysteriously crying infant. Inadequate access to care is a real problem, especially outside of major cities. Still, if Americans have come to want it all, African patients tend to expect less, and the result may be greater efficiency. 
Where's the middle ground? Practitioners in rich and poor countries alike are looking for cheaper diagnostics and leaner models for delivering care: less of doing anything that's possible, more of doing everything that's reasonable. But if there is a sweet spot, I'd wager that unfussy African health systems will get to it first.

HEADLINE: The Lasting Financial Impact of a Layoff

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: A new study finds that those laid off from long-term jobs in the recession are likely to lose a total of $774 billion in earnings over the next 25 years, even if they get new jobs. 

 BODY:
Losing a job you wanted to keep is never a good thing. But for those who lost their jobs during the Great Recession, the long-term consequences will probably be very significant.
 According to an economic analysis by the Hamilton Project, a research group in Washington, those laid off from long-term jobs between October 2008 and April 2009 are likely to lose a total of $774 billion in earnings over the next 25 years, even if they get new jobs.
 The analysis of Census Bureau data, conducted by Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney, looks at how the seven million workers who lost jobs they had held for three years or more at the time of the layoff fared in the two years following the job loss. 
 Including those who have not yet found work as well as those who did find new jobs, the average earnings of the group were barely half what they were before the workers lost their jobs, falling from $43,700 before to $23,000 two years later. The income numbers do not include unemployment benefits.

 Focusing just on those who were able to find new jobs, the study found they were earning an average of 17 percent less than they earned in their previous posts. 
 Mr. Greenstone and Mr. Looney based their calculations of future losses on research conducted by Steven J. Davis, an economist at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago, and Till von Wachter, an economist at Columbia University, which found that workers who lose their jobs during recessions lose an average of $112,100 over their careers. 
 Mr. Greenstone, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said many of the displaced workers either have no college degrees or have skills that are rapidly being outdated, and therefore need education to get back to work in jobs that will match their prior incomes. The sobering data, he said, "highlights the importance of trying to identify training programs that can help this set of workers so they don't lose that money."

HEADLINE: The Fall of the House of Plastic Flowers, and Its Rebirth

BYLINE: COREY KILGANNON


HIGHLIGHT: The show is over for a Queens house that became a goofy landmark for its forest of fake flora and over-the-top decorations that infuriated many neighbors. 

 BODY:
 Maybe plastic flowers can die, after all.
 The show is over for a Queens house that became a goofy landmark for its forest of fake flora and over-the-top decorations that infuriated many neighbors. 
The house, 93 Puritan Avenue in Forest Hills Gardens, has been sold by the longtime owners who had turned it from a stately Tudor home into the notorious House of the Plastic Flowers: a curiosity that attracted sightseers.
The buyer is a local real estate agent who is in discussions with television producers about documenting the renovation of the house into a home-makeover segment.
"It was a lot of fun while it lasted, as the flower house, but we're definitely changing it back to a conventional home," said the buyer, Gigi Malek, a sales agent with Terrace Sotheby's International Realty, which specializes in listings in this neighborhood, which is one of America's oldest planned communities and one of New York's more elegant enclaves. 
Ms. Malek, who bought the house with her husband, Lloyd Llamas, said they paid about $700,000 range for the five-bedroom, 1,500 square-foot house - which is less than half of what it may have sold for had it been in better condition, several real estate brokers said. By comparison, the house next door sold for about $1.9 million a couple of years ago.
The seller, Michael Sheridan, 58, grew up in the house, and for many years had lived somewhat a reclusive existence there with his mother, Elizabeth Sheridan. Mrs. Sheridan began decorating the house to honor her deceased husband, who died about 15 years ago.
For years, the two Sheridans hoarded belongings inside, and spent their mornings primping and pruning and changing the exhibits in front. Tons of decorative debris accumulated in the front yard over two decades: a virtual forest of artificial Christmas trees bordered by colorful artificial flowers and knickknacks. The Sheridans long maintained that they were simply beautifying their home.
Mrs. Sheridan died last year at age 92 and Mr. Sheridan wound up moving in with his girlfriend on Long Island, he said in a recent interview. He left the house's exterior rotting and peeling away, and left the grounds piled with an eclectic array of stuff. Inside, the house was packed, floor to ceiling, with belongings.
"It took 17 Dumpsters to get the stuff out, and we're still clearing out the basement," Ms. Malek said, adding that the entire house would be gutted, and the severe overgrowth of wild trees on the property would have to be addressed.
 "It will be a huge undertaking," she said. "All I want to do is bring it back to normal. Ms. Malek explained that she was friends with the Sheridan family for years and was able to assure Mr. Sheridan that the house would be in good hands.
"Michael is happy to see it go to people he knew and grew up with - he feels the house is staying in the family," she said. "He's happy to see my kids will grow up there and bring life back to the house."
Over the years, some neighbors complained that the Forest Hills Gardens Corporation, whose board governs the community, let the Sheridan property become a public nuisance by failing to enforce its strict aesthetic regulations.
"We're just relieved the blight on the block will be taken out," said Peter E. Vairo, a Manhattan lawyer who lives across the street from the flower house and who several years ago filed a lawsuit against the Sheridans and the Gardens Corporation. The suit was dismissed after the Sheridans countersued, claiming that Mr. Vairo was harassing them.
"They were destroying the look of the neighborhood, and they had contempt for the local rules," said Mr. Vairo, who claimed at one point that the Sheridans were putting the most garishly colored items facing his house, to taunt him.
Susanna Hof, who runs the Terrace Sotheby's office and who also lives on Puritan Avenue, said many neighbors found the Sheridans' decorations amusing.
"I doubt anyone would have considered buying the house the way it was," she said. "It's great someone's going to bring it back into shape."
Ms. Malek said she that in memory of Mrs. Sheridan, "I'm going to leave one plastic flower out front, just for her."

HEADLINE: 33 Waterfront Acres for Sale (but Read the Fine Print)

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Prime Staten Island waterfront real estate is available, if you are willing to accommodate garbage trucks. 

 BODY:
Anybody interested in 33 acres of waterfront property in New York City?
The city's Economic Development Corporation began asking that question on Friday with a proposal posted on its Web site. But before spinning any fantasies of an idyllic estate with a yacht moored out back, dreamers should read all the fine print.
The waterway in question is the Arthur Kill, and the neighbors would include a pair of unused tanks for liquefied natural gas. One adjacent road is named Chemical Lane, and the city wants to park garbage trucks on the site. If none of those are deal breakers, the development corporation would like to hear from you.
The city's goal is to turn the land in the Rossville section of Staten Island, which it acquired in 1990, into a productive part of the industrial waterfront. It is looking for developers who want to use it for shipping or some related business. 
At least part of the property, which has 2,000 feet of shoreline, would have to have a maritime purpose. But the proposal says the developer -- who would either buy or lease the land from the city -- could use some of the land in a way that supports the maritime business. It adds that the city "strongly encourages" respondents to offer eight acres of the property as a new home for the sanitation department's garage in Community District 3.
The site is in an area that the city is considering for the first industrial business zone in Staten Island, a designation that would provide benefits to businesses there, including tax credits for jobs moved into the zone.
"In this economy, Staten Island needs jobs, jobs, jobs - that's what we hope will emerge" from this proposal, said the Staten Island borough president, James P. Molinaro.

HEADLINE: Occupy Wall Street: How Should It Be Covered Now?

BYLINE: ARTHUR S. BRISBANE


HIGHLIGHT: The public editor asks readers what they would like to see from The Times in its future Occupy Wall Street coverage. 

 BODY:
The Occupy Wall Street movement has certainly generated a lot of ink and bytes. Seven weeks into it, the journalistic challenge of covering it has probably grown in complexity. It is not simply a matter of covering the events attending to the individual protests in New York and scattered around the country. There are larger themes to address. 
What are the themes? How should The New York Times cover this movement that resembles no other in memory?
I wanted to start a discussion about that and so I reached out to journalists outside The Times who have been editors and understand the challenge of mobilizing reporters and editors to cover complex stories. I asked them this question:
A number of people sent me detailed discussions and you will find them below. I am particularly interested, as well, in hearing from readers on this subject. If you were the assignment editor, how would you approach the story?
In addition to coverage schemes, I heard from a couple of former editors who wanted to make more general points. One suggested The Times should examine how OWS relates to the issue of class warfare in America: OWS adherents and conservatives accuse one another of waging class warfare. Are they both right? 
Another former editor suggested looking at OWS in the context of new studies that show deepening income disparities, and then looking closely at urban centers where Occupy protesters have taken root. Is it possible that these are places - cities like New York, Boston, Oakland, London - where income disparity is heightened by the concentration of knowledge-based, high-paying industries?
There are many interesting questions and, for The Times and other news organizations, it is not easy to identify the most fruitful avenues of inquiry. Here are some of the ideas suggested by the outside journalists I queried. I want to thank them for offering their thoughts.
Stephen Buckley, dean of faculty, The Poynter Institute; former managing editor, St. Petersburg Times 
To my mind, the compelling question driving the Occupy Wall Street story is: How come these people are so angry? And maybe more compellingly: Why did it take them so long to get angry? (We've been feeling the effects of a recession for more than four years....)
 So, were I an editor, I'd be scrambling to figure out ways to craft narratives around those two questions. So, assuming resources weren't an issue, here are some questions that would drive upcoming stories (again, with anger as the overarching theme):

        
So, why has it taken so long for this anger to surface?
        
What do the various protests around the country -- and world -- have in common? How are they different? Could we send a reporter to every Occupy city (or several) and file a live day-in-the-life of Occupy story?
        
How does this compare to other protest movements in recent American (and world?) history? 
        
Why are some people so moved that they're traveling thousands of miles to participate? Who are those people (beyond the quotes in the stories)?
        
Who are the organizers, and what compelled them to start this movement? (The irony of a movement's declaring itself leaderless is that someone in charge -- unofficially in charge, if nothing else -- is often the person declaring this.) 
        
Once the protesters are past their anger, where does the movement go from here?
        
What's the protest like hour by hour? Can we get a 24-hour peek into what it's like to be a protester?
        
What's it like to try to cover this movement? Can we spend time with a reporter to see how he or she is trying to cover the protesters?
        
What's the racial/ethnic makeup of the protests? Hispanics have been shellacked by the recession, but they don't seem to be a significant presence in the Occupy movement. How come? Are they not as angry? If so, how come?
Jerry Ceppos, dean, Manship School of Mass Communication, Louisiana State University; former executive editor, San Jose Mercury News 
This certainly must be the first significant movement for which I can't paint a picture of typical leaders and followers. How is that possible? Have I simply not followed the stories carefully? Or have we as journalists covered the forest and failed to profile the trees?
Here are some ways I'd identify the trees:

        
Leadership tells you a lot about a movement. But I can't cite the name of a single Occupy Wall Street leader. I know some members say the groups are "leaderless." But I have trouble believing that this is an entirely organic movement that grew without a leader. I'd push hard to see if there are leaders and to profile them.
        
Likewise, I don't have a clear picture of a typical protester. Is there such a thing? If so, tell me the story of a few such people. These stories could be fascinating: Are the protesters ex-Lehman millionaires who lost it all in the melt-down? Or are they regular people who just can't get jobs? Or do they have jobs but think that financial life still is unfair? In addition, is the mix of protesters similar in each city?
        
As has so often been asked, what specifically do OWS demonstrators want? Do they agree? Are their wishes reasonable? How would I be affected if their wishes came true?
Rick Rodriguez, professor, Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, Arizona State University; former executive editor, Sacramento Bee
I would really use the entire array of the Times desks and resources to try to assess whether this movement will be sustained and grow or eventually fizzle. The story is moving beyond New York more each day. Its success ultimately will be judged not only on how it impacts Wall Street but communities across the country and the world. What is happening in Oakland today (Nov. 2) - a call for a general strike - is an example of that. The strike was preceded by police injuring a protester - a war veteran - who has become a martyr, a rallying point for protesters. In Sacramento, my hometown, police are clearing out the park that is being occupied and arresting those who don't leave by 11 p.m., with 83 arrests made so far, and the protesters are in court challenging the police action. Some of the responses I've read from government officials are reminiscent of those made dismissing the civil rights movement - the protesters are people from outside the mainstream (outside agitators?); that the protests are hurting small businesses and neighborhoods; sanitary and other health problems abound. But is anyone listening to the message or will the powers that be simply wait things out? That question intrigues me. So does whether the protesters can grow and diversify their base; can they bring multitudes of working class people, can they appeal to Latinos, African-Americans and others who have been hit hardest by the economic downtown. Predicting the future is hard to do but sending reporters across the country to assess the potential for the movement to grow is where I would start.
Timothy M. Kelly, Lexington Herald-Leader publisher, 1996-2011; editor, 1991-1996
If I were an assigning editor, I'd start with the basic 5 W's and How. Among the questions I'd want answered:

        
Who are the protesters?
        
Who are the leaders?
        
Who's really behind all this?
        
Who's going to pay for the cleanup?
        
What do they hope to accomplish?
        
What can citizens do to take part in the protests, or avoid them?
        
What is happening inside the camps?
        
What is going to be the city's response to the camps?
        
When did this start?
        
When will it end?
        
When are demonstrations planned?
        
Where are the camps and protests happening, locally and elsewhere?
        
Where's the money for them coming from?
        
Why are they happening?
        
Why should I care?
        
How did this all get organized?
        
How long will the city allow it to go on before taking some action?
        
How much does Wall Street care?
Tom Fiedler, dean, College of Communication, Boston University; former executive editor, Miami Herald
You've posed a thought-provoking question for my imaginary editing position: "What are the stories you would like to see about Occupy Wall Street and its affiliated Occupy branches around the U.S. and the world?"
The answer, in a few words, is that I would only like to see stories that move the event forward. Not to sound glib, but the coverage of "Occupy" brings to mind the old Saturday Night Live chestnut of "Franco is still dead!", which Chevy Chase would solemnly repeat week after week. 
As a journalist vying for the limited and valuable time of an audience, I bear the responsibility of intruding on the audience's attention only when I have something of interest - something new and worthy (or newsworthy) - to report. Otherwise I'm just an annoyance. Now that I've reported exhaustively on the Occupiers' presence and their general unhappiness with many things, I have no obligation to chronicle their on-going daily existence, which best I can tell has devolved into something of a mixture of Grateful Dead parking-lot scene, Woodstock without bands (although plenty of bongos), and unofficial skid row (e.g., Adam Nagourney's story, Nov. 1). 
So what would I consider to be news? Of course, if today's reincarnations of Douglas MacArthur and George Patton (or their municipal equivalents) charge into the protesters behind tanks and bayonet-wielding soldiers - that would hit my bar. 
To the other extreme, a running blog or newspaper column about life in the Occupy camps - somewhat akin to reports done out of refugee camps on the Somali border, though lacking the human tragedy - would find a small place in my news budget, perhaps anchored in the same place for easy navigation. 
But I would otherwise reserve my resources until my reporters found news that disrupts the current equilibrium, or threatens to disrupt it. As an example, if the Occupiers suddenly focused their protest on something in a way that could initiate a public-policy debate - just as the World War I Bonus Army demanded that their bonus bonds be cashed early to help them cope with the Depression - I would order coverage of that development. If they chose to register en masse in a political party and vowed to punish any candidate who failed to vote correctly (in their view) on specific issues, I would see that this was covered. I am searching for something to emerge from these camps akin to the 1968 "Clean for Gene" movement, where youths of my generation trimmed their hair, shaved their beards (if male, of course), dressed up neatly, and stormed into New Hampshire to help Eugene McCarthy challenge LBJ for the Democratic nomination. Best I can tell, New Hampshire is fairly quiet and safe for GOP candidates. 
To be honest I've stopped reading the many, many stories and columns that continue to come out of this because they are empty at their core. Yes, many people have been hurt by this country's financial system and they are appropriately angry. Yes, many in Wall Street deserve a public flogging (see Joe Nocera's column, Nov. 1). But unless and until this anger is channeled into something that catalyzes a policy debate, it is not particularly newsworthy.

HEADLINE: More on Calculating Poverty

BYLINE: JASON DEPARLE, ROBERT GEBELOFF and SABRINA TAVERNISE


HIGHLIGHT: How the methodology in a Times study differs from that of a new Census Bureau measurement of poverty, and why. 

 BODY:
Poverty researchers have been debating alternatives to the traditional poverty rate for years. So it's not surprising that some people wondered why we chose the particular method that we used for today's article about poverty.
Under guidelines established by National Academy of Sciences, the Census Bureau publishes eight alternative methods of calculating poverty. They are broadly similar. All take a fuller accounting of economic well-being than the official poverty measure does. They include benefits the official measure ignores, like food stamps and tax credits. And they subtract taxes, work expenses and out-of-pocket medical costs, which the official measure does not.
They differ in part by the way they account for inflation, with four using the Consumer Price Index and four using the Consumer Expenditure Survey.
One of the questions we wanted to ask was whether an alternative measure - by including many billions in increased safety-net spending - gave a different view from the official count of how much poverty has risen since prerecession days. 
That question cannot be answered with the measures in the Consumer Expenditure Survey because of a change in its methodology in 2007, contaminating comparisons with earlier years. Therefore, under guidance from the Census Bureau, we chose the Consumer Price Index measure that most closely approximates a new alternative the bureau will release on Monday - the Supplemental Poverty Measure.

Our analysis of that measure showed the number of poor people had risen by 4.6 million people since 2006 - not by 9.7 million people as the official Census count reported in September. 
Shawn Fremstad of the Center for Economic and Policy Research notes that the Supplemental Poverty Measure, being released on Monday, uses the Consumer Expenditure Survey and therefore differs from the method we used. That is true. But the Consumer Expenditure Survey measures cannot be used for prerecession comparisons. We used the next best thing - a measure that, like the measure coming Monday, includes a fuller account of income and expenses and adjusts for differences in costs of living.
It's worth noting that since the methodological change occurred, both sets of alternative measures show poverty rising more modestly than the official measure does. From 2007 to 2010, poverty rose 2.6 percentage points by official count; 0.8 points on average by the four Consumer Expenditure Survey measures, and 0.9 points by the four Consumer Price Index measures. That bolsters our finding that alternative measures show poverty rising less than the official numbers suggest. It's also worth noting that our findings echo those by researchers in Wisconsin and New York City, who also found safety net programs doing more than the official numbers show to restrain poverty growth.
By official count, there are 46.2 million Americans in poverty. Many experts think the Supplemental Poverty Measure may produce a slightly higher count, as our article noted. That is a different question from whether safety net programs have done more than the official count shows in restraining its growth.

HEADLINE: A Student's Call for a Learning Revolution

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A student's view of what's needed in the classroom of the 21st century. 

 BODY:
3:20 p.m. | Updated 
I was struck last week by a Huffington Post essay written by Nikhil Goyal, a 16-year-old junior from Syosset High School on Long Island who is clearly part of what I call "Generation E." The piece, "It's Time For a Learning Revolution," was a student-eye-view of the need -- and glaring opportunity -- for innovating teaching (and learning) from the bottom up. (He's writing a book on the subject.)
As I've written here before, finding and disseminating education methods that foster creative, collaborative and resilient learning and problem solving is a prime path toward fitting human aspirations on a finite planet. Nicholas Kristof's recent column, "Occupy the Classroom," explores relevant terrain. This approach is also particularly useful in the face of prolonged economic uncertainty.
Notably, the potential learning-by-doing role of American students and scholars in advancing human prospects in struggling regions came up today at a meeting organized by the United States Agency for International Development (which just celebrated its 50th anniversary) and hosted by the Woodrow Wilson Center. Alex Dehgan, the science and technology adviser to the agency's administrator, said you'll know we're there "when we have students not asking what is your major, but what is your problem."
Current classroom norms, which Goyal described as the "culture of fill in the bubble tests and drill-and-kill teaching methods," aren't a good fit in a complicated, connected, competitive world. He referred to the TED talk of Sir Ken Robinson on the 19th-century roots of our early-21st-century schools.
After I read Goyal's piece, I got in touch via his @TalkPolitical Twitter account and invited him to weigh in here, in part hoping he'd also reflect on my related piece, "Breaking Things on a Path to Breakthroughs." I also sent him a highly relevant, and fascinating, piece by Jonah Lehrer in The Wall Street Journal on "The Art of Failing Successfully" and the merits of rewarding effort more than outcomes. Here's a repost of video of the bridge-breaking project, which I think illustrates the value of this approach beautifully:
Here's his "Your Dot" piece: 
The 21st century global economy demands students to think critically and creatively, collaborate well, communicate their ideas, and take risks. America was founded on the principle of taking risks - dauntless, courageous inventions and ideas, not Wall Street poker games. Sadly, in schools, children have been indoctrinated into believing they aren't supposed to take a plunge into the uncertain.
A typical classroom looks like a few rows of desks lined up. It's appeared like that for the past century, while the world has been transformed in every facet imaginable. School is boiled down to a process of memorization, regurgitation, and forgetting that information.
Enter project-based learning. It's designed to put students in the driver seat. No longer is the teacher the only hub of information. No longer do kids work in silos, isolated from their peers and the community around them. As exemplified in your blog post, the cost of the materials the students used to construct the bridge was minimal.
It's unnecessary for school districts to plunk down thousands of dollars for textbooks when the Internet and cheap resources are at students' fingertips.
One of the best high schools that has adopted project-based learning is High Tech High in San Diego, California. Projects drive the curriculum, rather than the reverse. And they incorporate a wide range of interdisciplinary subjects to achieve real-world relevance. Learning isn't supposed to be boring and a process of nailing facts in students' heads. It's hands-on, it's practical, and it's creative. And project-based learning offers constant feedback and revision to develop higher quality work.
I covered one example of this kind of learning way back in 1999 -- "Trout in the Classroom." What else is out there?
At universities, there's plenty of ferment. I spent much of Thursday at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and The Sage Colleges in Troy, N.Y., and met a variety of students with the same eagerness to make a difference, both in their own education and their education. That's certainly the case at Pace University, where there's a long tradition of learning by doing, from the law school to the communications program.

HEADLINE: Podcast: Jobs Report, European Debt and the Flat Tax

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen. 

 BODY:
Each month, the Labor Department issues a report on jobs and unemployment. It would be a relief to get one showing that jobs are being created in large numbers in the United States, and that unemployment in rapidly sinking. 
But we will have to keep waiting: that, alas, was not the report that the Labor Department released for October.
Instead, like so many monthly tallies before it, the latest report paints a picture of an economy that isn't creating enough jobs to keep up with population growth, Catherine Rampell says in the new Weekend Business podcast. While the unemployment rate dipped slightly, from 9.1 to 9.0 percent, the drop was so slight that it might well be a statistical anomaly. 
Heightened uncertainty from the Greek financial crisis has affected the global economy and the markets. It's the focus of my column in Sunday Business, as I mention on the podcast. And as Gretchen Morgenson says on the podcast, the crisis has already caused collateral damage in the United States. It contributed to the downfall of MF Global, the financial firm that went into bankruptcy last week. It had been headed by Jon Corzine, the former governor and senator from New Jersey and a former chief of Goldman Sachs. She writes about some of the broader implications of the firm's failure in her Sunday Business column.

In this presidential campaign season, proposals for the institution of a flat tax have re-emerged but they are likely to go nowhere once again, in the opinion of Robert Frank, the Cornell economist. He discusses his Economic View column in Sunday Business, which says that while flat taxes are attention-getters, they would add to the growing income inequality in the United States. 
And in a separate conversation in the podcast, David Gillen talks to Evelyn Rusli about Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, who has become an increasingly important figure in Silicon Valley.
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Catherine Rampell on the jobs report (31:11); news headlines (22:55); Evelyn Rusli on LinkedIn (20:51); Gretchen Morgenson on the European crisis (15:36); Robert Frank on flat taxes (9:51); the week ahead (1:36).
As articles discussed in the podcast are published during the weekend, links will be added to this post.

HEADLINE: Mets' First Off-Season Move: Layoffs

BYLINE: RICHARD SANDOMIR


HIGHLIGHT: The Mets laid off about 10 percent of their front-office staff, which is not a good omen in the Jose Reyes sweepstakes. 

 BODY:
The Mets announced Friday that they recently laid nearly 10 percent of their 180 front-office employees, a development that will only further discourage a fan base bracing for the possible departure of Jose Reyes, their free-agent shortstop. 
In a statement, the team said: "Several weeks ago, we made work-force reductions in both the baseball and business-operations departments, which amounted to less than 10 percent of our full-time staff."
The acknowledgement of the layoffs comes just a day after free agents like Reyes became eligible to sign with any team they wish. It also comes amid speculation that the Mets, with all their financial problems, will not try to outbid other teams to retain Reyes and will be limited on what they can spend on any other players who will be available.

Attendance at Citi Field fell 7 percent this season as the Mets finished in fourth place for the third consecutive year. The Mets also laid off a handful of workers in the ticket office last February.
These are particularly difficult times for the Mets because of their performance on the field, the overall economy and their owners' ongoing legal battle with Irving H. Picard, the trustee for the victims of the Bernard L. Madoff Ponzi scheme. The team's principal owner, Fred Wilpon, said earlier in the season that the team might lose as much as $70 million this year, after posting a $51 million loss in 2010.
Wilpon and his co-owner, Saul Katz, are being sued by Picard on behalf of Madoff victims and remain liable for up to $386 million in connection with their years of investments with Madoff. If there is no settlement in the case, a trial could take place in the first part of next year.
The Mets already have announced that they are cutting ticket prices for 2012, the third straight season they are making such a move to bolster sagging attendance. Next year, no full 81-game season-ticket holder will pay more than this year, and more than 80 percent of the people in that category will have their ticket prices fall at least 5 percent.
About a year ago, the team borrowed $25 million from Major League Baseball because of a cash shortage. The loan was supposed to be repaid by the end of June, but that has not happened because of the collapse of a deal in which the hedge fund manager David Einhorn would have made a $200 million investment in the club. The Mets are instead trying to secure a group of minority partners - perhaps 10 in all - who would purchase small shares of the team for perhaps $20 million apiece and thus provide the needed infusion of cash.
Commissioner Bud Selig acknowledged last month at the World Series that the Mets had not repaid the $25 million loan. Nevertheless, he maintained that the team's current financial state was not worrisome to him. "We're doing fine with the Mets," he said in remarks to reporters at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. "I don't have any concerns with the Mets. They're working on an alternative financing plan, and they seem to be very encouraged, and I'm encouraged."

HEADLINE: Solyndra Auction Draws Huge Crowd

BYLINE: MICHAEL KANELLOS


HIGHLIGHT: The auctioneer said the two-day event raised millions of dollars and drew both gawkers and serious buyers. 

 BODY:
There's nothing like a financial train wreck to draw a crowd.
This week's auction for industrial assets, office equipment and company T-shirts owned by the failed solar manufacturer Solyndra, which we previewed in Tuesday's Times, was wildly successful, according to Ross Dove, a managing partner at Heritage Global Partners, which conducted the two-day event.
"We had over 1,000 people at the factory and 2,500 online. We had people from Tunisia, Beijing, Shanghai," he said.
"Usually, at an industrial auction you get 100, 200, 300 people. We haven't had that many people since Enron," Mr. Dove added, referring to the 2002 auction, also overseen by the Dove family, of that failed company's assets.
And, like the Enron auction, the Solyndra sale drew its share of ghouls attracted to the garish spectacle as well as serious buyers seeking discounts on slightly used robots, spectrometers and other industrial equipment.
Solyndra T-shirts and polo shirts sold for $18 and up. A company banner went for $400.
Monday, 1:13 p.m. | Updated And if you're still hankering for some
Solyndra modules, eBay has some on offer.
"We sold a hard hat for $300 or $400," Mr. Dove said. "We had bidding wars. We had items with 40 or 50 bidders. As auctioneers, we had a lot of fun."
The highest-price single item was a scanning electron microscope that went for $270,000. (Before the auction, AQT Solar's chief executive, Michael Bartholomeusz, told us that electron microscopes that retail for $600,000 to $1,000,000 can often be bought at auction for $250,000 to $750,000.)
The highest price fetched for a single lot of items was $1 million for a collection of spare Solyndra solar modules, according to Mr. Dove. Although Solyndra has been dogged by controversy and financial difficulties for years, it actually sold quite a lot of its products. The company shipped more than 500,000 modules over the last three years, and cumulative revenue since 2008 topped $250 million, according to bankruptcy documents.
Someone, clearly, wanted spare parts. 
The circus atmosphere put a damper on the affair for some serious buyers, who attend these events in hopes of picking up nearly new equipment for pennies on the dollar.
"Most everything we wanted sold for twice to six times more than we would pay," Terry Liu, a marketing manager for Quanta Laboratories, a testing and verification company in nearby Santa Clara, Calif., wrote in an e-mail.
Mr. Liu, who checked out copper tubing and environmental test chambers at an auction preview on Monday, wound up getting only a humidity instrument in the auction. "I saw a Solyndra poster that was framed for $400 and a Samsung 55-inch TV go for around $1,000. We saw a tool chest sell for around $1,000."
The auction brought in "multiple millions" of dollars, Mr. Dove said, declining to be more specific because of the bankruptcy proceedings. Solyndra's liabilities stood at $749 million as of Jan. 1, so the results of the auction will put only a moderate dent in its debts.
Solyndra shut its doors and sent 1,100 full-time and temporary employees home on Aug. 31. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sept. 6.
Still, the federal government, which issued $528 million in loans to the company; private investors; and other creditors will have more opportunities to recover their losses.
Solyndra has not yet sold its intellectual property, its large Fremont, Calif., factory or a complete manufacturing line. It is trying to sell those assets, ideally intact, before a court hearing in its bankruptcy proceeding that is scheduled for Nov. 22.
These other assets could be a tough sell. Standard flat silicon solar module prices have plummeted in 2011, thanks to a surfeit of worldwide factory capacity, weak economic conditions and declining government subsidies. Solyndra modules cost about $2 a watt to produce, Shyam Mehta, senior analyst at GTM Research, told The Times in September.
At the time, Chinese crystalline solar module makers could produce conventional modules for $1.10 a watt. Now, bargain-basement modules can sell for 85 cents to $1.05 a watt.
Still, the remaining core of assets could find a home. The tubular shape of Solyndra's modules, arguably, create a few novel advantages. Solyndra's modules cost less to install and can withstand high winds better than conventional modules, according to the company. The tubes can also harvest power during sunrise and sunset more efficiently .
Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service allows owners of these types of solar arrays to get tax credits for new roofs because the roof plays an integral part in reflecting sunlight onto the tubes.
Large conglomerates like Samsung and LG have announced corporate goals to become dominant manufacturers in solar in a few years from a base that is close to zero. Solyndra's ideas, in the hands of a well-financed mass manufacturer, could prove economical.
So even if you couldn't tune into the auction this week, don't worry. The drama will continue.

HEADLINE: Coming to Terms With Being the Boss

BYLINE: MP MUELLER


HIGHLIGHT: The skills that worked in starting the company were not the ones I needed to sustain and build it. 

 BODY:
Every November, as we start winding down another year and reflecting on what we accomplished, what worked, what didn't and what we should be planning, I yearn for some time and space to really have some good, deep thought about where we are going and how to get there. I also yearn to reconnect with that girl on fire who started my ad agency 17 years ago.
I started this business with a passion for my field -- but, like a few other other small-business owners I've met, with little knowledge of how to actually run a business. Along the way I learned some things about management and leadership, but it was the creative juice that kept me, and the agency, humming.
And yet, the skills that worked in starting the a company were not the ones I needed to sustain and build it. The more we grew, the more my role evolved into operations, and the less I was in touch with what fed my soul. Weighty human resources decisions replaced font choices and creative copy writing. I kept plugging away in a role that still feels like a shirt with too tight a collar and cuffs -- a boxy yet essential operations role. It was working, the agency was growing. But I felt like I was running on fumes. 
Especially during the recession, those tough H.R. decisions -- including an employee termination that I really wrestled with -- took my soul to the edge of self-loathing. My passion for the business was waning. More and more, it felt like a prison from which I had no exit plan. Two years ago, I decided to take a minisabbatical to try to rediscover my mojo and do some things in my personal life that I'd been putting off.
My plans for the sabbatical were both small and big. I wanted to learn how to make the world's best enchiladas from the cooks in the tiny kitchen at Lala's Cafe in Mirando City, Tex. I wanted to take a spirituality course. I wanted to drive to Aspen, Colo., to relive my post-college days of skiing without responsibility. I wanted to make cement yard art. O.K., it was my compressed version of "Eat, Pray, Love."
Week One: I fixed things like broken screen doors and burned some water-sucking cedar at our place in the country, which is always cathartic and offers the instant gratification of seeing a pile disappear (something that never seems to happen to the piles on my desk). But on a larger level, I was totally unprepared for the loss of purpose I experienced. My identity was so tightly interwoven with being a business owner, that I went into free fall when the tethers loosened.
It was such an uncomfortable feeling. I tried to shake it off and revel in the moment. But the staff at the agency did not miss a beat without me, it seemed, and I found myself wondering, "What is my value proposition?" I found excuses to call the office, only to be met with, "Why are you calling?"
Week Two: I caught up with all of my long-put-off doctor appointments, and I met my goal of seeing all of the movies that have been nominated for Best Picture. I bought stacks of interesting books that just smirked at me, as if they knew I wasn't going to read more than their covers.
Week Three: I pulled the trigger on a 2,000-mile, "Thelma and Louise" road trip (but nobody died) to Colorado with my friend Gigi. The key to a successful sabbatical, I learned, is not to try doing it at home. You have to get out and change the scenery, or else you will shuffle through the day wondering what is going on at work.
But nothing's foolproof. Relaxing in the mountains, I came across a newspaper ad that was a request for proposals for advertising services for Aspen's tourism bureau. I was on the phone to people in the office in minutes, breathless, instructing them to overnight an agency book so I could drop it by the office. Redemption! Suddenly, I was doing something that wasn't totally self-indulgent and frivolous. As it happened, we did make the cut to the final four, and we were back a month later to present.
In Colorado, I re-learned an important lesson -- sometimes the more you try to control, the less you control. There is room to be both responsible and adventurous, like when that guy passed me a rolled joint at the bar. The good girl soccer mom felt like she was back in college. The joint still sits in a box on my bathroom counter. "I can go there if I want to," I tell myself.
I returned to work pleased with my role as captain of the agency's ship. I also felt very fortunate that I get to choose the people with whom I spend most of my waking hours. And I gave myself permission to bring all of me to work -- not just the business owner from central casting. I've learned that I need the daily oxygen of nonstructured times. Of course, that's hard to do as head of a business. Creativity is great but not when you're working in spreadsheets. I still wrestle with the push and pull of the two sides of the brain.
The recession and the endless post recession have meant that my financial management has evolved from checking the bank account balance monthly to managing cash flow weekly, delving into spreadsheets and projections with newly critical eyes. That kind of analysis is not creative, but I've grown to appreciate the linear, black-and-white, just-the-facts, quality of storytelling it offers. Two years later, I'm committed to seeking balance on a frequent basis and to resisting the whack-a-mole approach to management that can leave you unfocused and reactive.
But I've also come to terms with who I am -- I am the owner.
