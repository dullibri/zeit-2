HEADLINE: A Campaign Pitch Rekindles the Question: Just What Is Liberation Theology?

BYLINE: By MARK OPPENHEIMER.

 BODY:
The year 2012 looks a lot like 2008: high unemployment, a candidate named Obama promising to do something about high unemployment, and the Giants beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl. And one more thing: conservatives are still ridiculing liberation theology. With the complicity of clueless pundits and incurious journalists, they are reducing an important theological movement of the past 40 years to an abusive sound bite.
In 2008, conservatives gleefully attacked the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., Mr. Obama's home pastor in Chicago, for his provocative remarks in sermons, taken out of context, including his assertion that 9/11 was evidence that ''America's chickens are coming home to roost.'' They persuaded many that Mr. Wright was wielding something called ''liberation theology'' -- and that Candidate Obama had to answer for it.
''How important a strain is liberation theology in the black church?'' a reporter asked Mr. Obama at an April 2008 news conference. ''And why did you choose to attend a church that preached that?'' 
To his credit, Mr. Obama began his reply to that reporter by saying, ''I'm not a theologian.'' But others had no such modesty. In March 2008, after tapes of Mr. Wright's fiery sermons surfaced, Jonah Goldberg wrote in his blog for National Review, ''I keep meaning to go to school on black liberation theology, but I just haven't had the time. The similarities between certain strains of the German Christian Movement and Jeremiah Wright's shtick certainly seem significant.'' The German Christians were a movement of pro-Nazi Protestants in prewar Germany.
Also that month, Glenn Beck, then a Fox News host, called black liberation theology ''the theological tradition based in hate, intolerance and racial black nationalism.''
Last week, four years since the last liberation-theology scare, it was reported that Joe Ricketts, a billionaire business executive, was considering a plan to finance an anti-Obama advertising campaign, focused on Mr. Wright and those same video clips. The campaign prospectus was incendiary and demeaning -- it recommended that the backers ''include an extremely literate, conservative African-American in our spokesman group'' -- and Mitt Romney quickly said he rejected any such campaign on his behalf.
While Mr. Wright has said his ministry is inspired by James H. Cone, the author of ''Black Theology & Black Power,'' the founding text of black liberation theology, Dr. Cone's 1969 book is far subtler than any one sermon, no matter the preacher. Contrary to the simplifications of the past four years, liberation theology, which has become hugely influential, teaches not hate, nor anti-Americanism, but a renewed focus on the poor and the suffering, as embodied by Jesus.
''Liberation theology, at its most simple, is the Sunday school Jesus who healed the sick or took care of the poor people,'' said Shannon Craigo-Snell, a theologian at Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Kentucky. ''It's what your Sunday school teacher taught you if you grew up in a church. It isn't something people should be afraid of, unless they're invested in poor people not getting fed or sick people not getting healed.''
Dr. Cone, who teaches at Union Theological Seminary in New York, defines liberation theology as ''an interpretation of the Christian gospel from the experience and perspectives and lives of people who are at the bottom in society -- the lowest economic and racial groups.''
In the words of Dr. Craigo-Snell and Dr. Cone, it sounds obvious: Jesus identified with the oppressed, not the oppressor. But Dr. Cone notes that many theologians have ignored poverty or subordinated it to other concerns. After the Social Gospel of the very early 20th century passed, the poor largely slipped from the agenda of Christian theology.
''You can read the liberal theologians, the fundamentalist theologians, the neo-orthodox theologians, the Christian realists'' -- we're talking about prewar titans like Karl Barth and Reinhold Niebuhr -- ''but they don't see the voice of the poor as the starting point for what the meaning of the Gospel is all about,'' Dr. Cone said. They focused instead on questions of sin, or war and violence, or salvation.
The focus on Mr. Wright's sermons makes liberation theology sound like an anti-American philosophy, or one relevant only to African-Americans. But as a category, liberation theology, which often draws heavily on Marxist analysis, is not ethnocentric. It has been taken up by oppressed groups including third world peoples, Latinos, Asians and other American ethnic minorities. Its most famous text, ''A Theology of Liberation,'' published in 1971 by the Peruvian priest Gustavo Gutierrez, is associated primarily with Latin American Christianity.
Since his and Dr. Cone's books, lesbian, gay and other queer theologians have developed a liberation theology of sexuality. Black women propound what they call womanist theology, and Latina women have taken up ''mujerista'' theology, for the Spanish word for ''womanist.''
The founding mother of mujerista theology, Ada Maria Isasi-Diaz, a Cuban-American who taught at Drew University, died May 13. She is remembered for the radical step of doing theological field work, talking to Latina women for theological insights that scholars might not glean from books. In works like ''En La Lucha'' (''In the Struggle''), she used interviews with Latina women, and their descriptions of prayer and religious rituals and festivals, to elaborate the Latina relationship to Christianity, and to the Bible.
''Hispanic women's experience and our struggle for survival, not the Bible, are the source of our theology and the starting point for how we should interpret, appropriate, and use the Bible,'' Ms. Isasi-Diaz wrote in ''Mujerista Theology,'' published in 1996.
Ms. Isasi-Diaz will be remembered not only for her fieldwork, and her frequent use of Latinas' anecdotes -- a manifestation of her belief that theological insights can come from those who have never studied theology -- but also for her commingling of English and Spanish terms. ''La lucha,'' ''lo cotidiano,'' ''la familia'': to finish one of Ms. Isasi-Diaz's books is to have assimilated these terms, even when she has not defined them. It was her way of saying that her books belonged to her mujerista sisters, who lived between two languages. The rest of us had to enter their world.
Mujeristas may know nothing of Jeremiah Wright, still less of James H. Cone. They are not black, and they don't know Marxist theory. But they, too, are liberation theologians, whether Jonah Goldberg knows it or not.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus the weekly addresses and a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
In public, both sides avow that the presidential campaign is about substantive issues, and that religion and race will not determine who wins the election, Jodi Kantor writes. In private, those close to Mitt Romney express concerns about faith that sound uncannily like those of supporters of Barack Obama on race.

        
The Senate has been unusually active in recent weeks - passing bipartisan legislation, confirming nominees and potentially isolating House Republican leaders who have made Senate inaction a centerpiece of their political appeals, Jonathan Weisman reports.

        
Joe Ricketts, a billionaire investor hoping to finance President Obama's political defeat, is involved in a visceral documentary film based on a widely criticized book asserting that Mr. Obama is secretly carrying out the "anti-colonial" agenda of his Kenyan father, Jim Rutenberg and Jeff Zeleny report. His involvement shows how the more strident attacks against Mr. Obama continue to find backing even as the Republican Party and the Romney campaign seek to keep the focus on the economy.

        
The Romney campaign once kept its distance from Jim Wilson, a fanatical supporter who has driven from one campaign stop to another with giant "Romney for President" posters festooning his pickup truck, Michael Barbaro writes. But they began to see an upside to his doggedness and free labor; over time he has become unexpectedly valuable to the campaign.
 
Weekly Addresses

        
President Obama honored the veterans from "Lexington and Concord to Iraq and Afghanistan" in his weekly address, urging all Americans to reaffirm their commitment to those who risk their lives for the nation's safety. "We have to serve them and their families as well as they have served us," he said. "By making sure that they get the health care and benefits they need; by caring for our wounded warriors and supporting our military families; and by giving veterans the chance to go to college, find a good job and enjoy the freedom that they risked everything to protect."

        
After taking a moment to acknowledge the sacrifices made by members of the armed forces, Representative Lynn Jenkins of Kansas used the Republican weekly address to argue against Mr. Obama's economic policies. "We owe it to our service members to do everything we can to ensure they come home to a strong, growing economy that creates jobs and opportunities," she said. Pushing for her party's "Plan for America's Job Creators," Ms. Jenkins is hoping that she and her colleagues will be able to develop an economic policy that is built around "small businesses, not big government." Key components of their plan include tapping into domestic energy resources and the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. "While the president demonizes homegrown energy and pursues tax policies that advantage foreign energy over domestic, Republicans are working to make the United States the largest energy-producing nation in the world, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs right here at home," she said.
Happenings in Washington

        
The Rolling Thunder motorcade - a group that advocates for service members who were abandoned after the Vietnam War - will celebrate Memorial Day with a ride through the city and a musical tribute to veterans at the Korean War Memorial on Sunday.

        
On Monday morning, President Obama and Michelle Obama will host a breakfast in the State Dining Room in honor of Gold Star Families for Peace, an organization founded by individuals who lost family members in the Iraq war. Later, the president will lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will join him at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall for a ceremony in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War.

        
The actors Gary Sinise and Joe Mantegna will serve as honorary parade marshals for Monday's Memorial Day Parade.

HEADLINE: Political Dividends

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney has made it very clear how he will help Wall Street if he wins. It's President Obama who is in a conflicted position. 

 BODY:
Four years after the 2008 collapse, the finance industry has regained its dominant position in American politics. Perhaps the development of deepest significance is an absence: the failure of a powerful anti-Wall Street faction to emerge in either the House or the Senate. This is in contrast to the response to previous financial crises, when Congress enacted tough legislation - after the Savings and Loan implosion of the 1980s, for example, and more recently after the bankruptcy of Enron and WorldCom in the early 2000s.
Look at the current political environment this way: if Mitt Romney's campaign and the Romney-supporting super PAC Restore Our Future were a public company, the financial services industry would have a controlling interest.
President Obama, in turn, has been noticeably cautious in his critique of Wall Street, trying instead to focus on Romney's former company, Bain Capital. Obama's ambivalence about speaking out is a tacit victory for the industry.
The financial collapse did seriously damage the credibility of the industry's central claim: that economic growth results from a deregulated free market, a view that dominated policy-making in the 1980s and 1990s. Simon Johnson, a professor at M.I.T. who was the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund in 2007 and 2008, masterfully described this earlier intellectual capture of political elites in his May, 2009, Atlantic article, "The Quiet Coup:"
The American financial industry gained political power by amassing a kind of cultural capital - a belief system. Once, perhaps, what was good for General Motors was good for the country. Over the past decade, the attitude took hold that what was good for Wall Street was good for the country.
At the peak of its influence, Johnson explains, the industry 
did not have to buy favors the way, for example, the tobacco companies or military contractors might have to. Instead, it benefited from the fact that Washington insiders already believed that large financial institutions and free-flowing capital markets were crucial to America's position in the world.
The damage to the industry's stature in the aftermath of 2008 was minimal considering the staggering $12.04 trillion cost of the financial crisis.
Stefano Pagliari, of the Balsillie School of International Affairs and the International Centre for Financial Regulation, and Kevin Young, of the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton University, wrote in an email to the Times: 
The legitimacy of the traditional claims made by financial industry - regarding efficient financial markets, the pricing of financial risks, etc. has been seriously weakened. But the financial industry has turned to new arguments, often about the economy at large - issues like growth and jobs.
Pagliari and Young, authors of the forthcoming study "Leveraged Interests: Financial Industry Power and the Role of PrivateSector Coalitions," report that 
financial industry groups have teamed up with other members of the business community. One of the most surprising aspects of our research is the fact that the increased mobilization of non-financial groups in financial regulatory debates triggered by the crisis has very frequently been a resource rather than a threat for financial industry groups.
A key ally of the finance industry in fending off stringent regulation and legislation, the two authors found, was the Coalition for Derivatives End-Users. The coalition, established in 2010, is a powerful alliance of business associations and major corporations that seeks to protect their use of derivatives to minimize their exposure to risk and volatility. The group led the charge against proposed legislation and regulation, taking the burden off the shoulders of the then-suspect financial services industry. In addition to such groups as the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, the coalition included such heavyweight businesses as 3M, Ford, General Electric, I.B.M., Apple, Caterpillar and Boeing.
In the political arena, the financial industry is now everywhere. It is a dominant presence in the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney. In terms of both his agenda and his core financial support, he is the candidate of Wall Street.
Romney has received more money from securities, investment, banking and other finance sources, $13 million, than from any other industry.
The top six corporate employers of donors to the Romney campaign are Goldman Sachs, $564,580; JPMorgan Chase & Co, $400,675; Bank of America, $364,850; Morgan Stanley, $363,550; Credit Suisse Group, $316,160; and Citigroup Inc, $286,015.
There is a very similar pattern in the separate contributions to the pro-Romney independent expenditure super PAC, Restore Our Future, which cannot legally coordinate with the Romney campaign. Seven out of the 16 donors of $1 million or more to the super PAC are from the finance industry: Edward Conard, a former partner of Romney's at Bain Capital; John Paulson, of Paulson and Co.; Robert Mercer, co-CEO of hedge fund Renaissance Technologies; Julian Robertson, founder of hedge fund Tiger Management; Paul Singer, founder of hedge fund Elliott Management; and John Kleinheinz, founder of Kleinheinz Capital Partners, a hedge fund.
A total of $24 million out of the $56.4 million contributed by all donors to Restore Our Future was from people and corporations in finance. Romney, in turn, is an outspoken proponent of the industry's agenda. He has promised that he will, if elected, seek repeal of the Dodd-Frank regulatory act and weaken provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that was passed after the bankruptcy of Enron. Romney has announced tax proposals that would work to the advantage of the industry and top finance executives. He wants to make a permanent, across-the-board 20 percent cut in marginal rates; to maintain current tax rates on interest, dividends and capital gains; to eliminate the estate tax; and to repeal the alternative minimum tax.
But it isn't just the Republicans. Both political parties are deeply beholden to the financial services industry.
This sector, including securities, investment and banking, is the single largest source of cash, at $19.5 million, for the national Democratic Party's various campaign committees, dwarfing, for example, donations from the entertainment industry, $7.9 million, and the real estate industry, $7.4 million.
Parallel Republican committees received $23.3 million from these same financial interests, again far larger than the amount donated by any other industry, including real estate, $9.3 million, and oil & gas, $5.1 million.
Obama has been caught between rising corporate opposition to his re-election, on one hand, and his own reluctance to take an adversarial stance towards the industry, on the other.
After receiving strong backing from the industry in the 2008 campaign - at $25.9 million, employees in the financial sector were the single largest source of campaign cash - Obama was pointedly moderate in his reactions to the financial collapse, despite the prominent role played by Wall Street leading up to the crash.
On Feb. 10, 2009, less than a month after his inauguration, Obama rejected out of hand any suggestion of temporarily nationalizing the country's most troubled banks as Sweden had done, telling Nightline's Terry Moran:
You know, the scale of the U.S. economy and the capital markets are so vast and the problems in terms of managing and overseeing anything of that scale, I think, would -- our assessment was that it wouldn't make sense. And we also have different traditions in this country. Obviously, Sweden has a different set of cultures in terms of how the government relates to markets and America's different. And we want to retain a strong sense of that private capital fulfilling the core - core investment needs of this country. And so, what we've tried to do is to apply some of the tough love that's going to be necessary, but do it in a way that's also recognizing we've got big private capital markets and ultimately that's going to be the key to getting credit flowing again.
More recently, at a news conference on May 21 in Chicago, Obama was asked to defend his critique of Bain Capital. His reply was carefully worded to make clear he was not indicting the entire industry:
My view of private equity is that it is set up to maximize profits. And that's a healthy part of the free market. That's part of the role of a lot of business people. That's not unique to private equity. And as I think my representatives have said repeatedly, and I will say today, I think there are folks who do good work in that area. And there are times where they identify the capacity for the economy to create new jobs or new industries, but understand that their priority is to maximize profits," he declared, adding that "when you're President, as opposed to the head of a private equity firm, then your job is not simply to maximize profits. Your job is to figure out how everybody in the country has a fair shot. Your job is to think about those workers who got laid off and how are we paying for their retraining. Your job is to think about how those communities can start creating new clusters so that they can attract new businesses. Your job as President is to think about how we set up an equitable tax system so that everybody is paying their fair share that allows us then to invest in science and technology and infrastructure, all of which are going to help us grow. And so, if your main argument for how to grow the economy is I knew how to make a lot of money for investors, then you're missing what this job is about.
The circumspection of his remarks suggests not only that Wall Street have a reliable candidate in Romney, but also that even if Obama wins re-election, the financial sector will emerge well positioned in Washington.
Romney has made it very clear how he will help Wall Street if he wins. It's President Obama who is in a conflicted position. Obama could conceivably take a more aggressive regulatory posture. The more likely scenario, given recent history, is that he would be apprehensive about the consequences of regulating hedge-fund operators and investment bankers. In the aftermath of Citizens United, Obama and the rest of the political community are aware of how dangerous the financial sector can be in the freewheeling world of campaign finance.

HEADLINE: Eat, Talk,Tweet

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
DANIEL DELANEY, 26, decided recently that he wanted to smoke and sell brisket, bringing small batches of what he called real Texas barbecue to New York.
Mr. Delaney, a New Jersey native who produced a video podcast about street food called VendrTV, had already held a few supper-club nights for 20 people in his Brooklyn apartment, charging $45 for admission. In another era, Mr. Delaney might have tried to start a restaurant or a wholesale product line. Instead, on April 21 he posted an offer to his social media contacts, inviting them to register for a limited supply of handcrafted barbecue, $25 a pound, to be served at unspecified events in the future.
''I needed it to feel cool, and I'm not a cool person,'' he said. ''It had to feel underground, secretive, exclusive.'' So he stressed the brisket's scarcity, urging people to pay now for a product that did not yet exist, from a chef with very little track record. He expected about 300 people to sign up. 
Instead, he got 4,300 registrations in a little over a week, selling more than a ton of meat. ''I took in $60,000 in 48 hours,'' he said -- enough money for him to hold 25 or more events, then graduate to a pop-up, or temporary, restaurant. ''I'm not a religious person,'' he said, ''but that was a godsend.''
Mr. Delaney's surprise -- that a large number of people would stampede for something whose appeal was that it was limited to a few -- tells a lot about New York dining in the summer of 2012, when the frisson of the inaccessible, the microbatch or artisanal, the locally sourced or handcrafted, becomes readily available to anyone with a few dollars and a dream.
There will be ample choices for eating at fine restaurants or eating at home this summer. But much of the food-snob energy will percolate in the improvised spaces in between: street markets and concert festivals, food courts and food truck feedlots, underground events and barter gatherings, where the focus will be not just on the food, but also on the experience of beating your friends to it.
At Smorgasburg in Brooklyn or the Governors Ball Music Festival on Randalls Island, at Meatopia or the monthly Queens County Market, there is an artisanal ice pop or boutique corn dog with your name on it, and a chef to tell you the story behind it.
Eric Demby, a founder of the food-friendly Brooklyn Flea and its all-food offshoot, Smorgasburg, compared the current food moment to New York's fine-arts scene of the 1970s and '80s, when ''art had an underground cachet'' and artists used new places and media to make their names. At Smorgasburg, which is held on Saturdays on the waterfront in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, about 100 small booths vie for attention, most offering some form of hand-held comfort food: brisket sandwiches or chocolate-dipped bananas, fried doughnuts or lobster rolls. The bazaar is not for the calorie-conscious or, given the state of the portable toilets at midday, the squeamish.
''The food vendors are like artists,'' Mr. Demby said. ''You're eating, but also meeting the people who are making these things and creating the culture. The people themselves are quite cool: they often live in your neighborhood; they quit some job or want to quit some job. You're not talking to a celebrity.''
Some readers may object that a well-made kimchi taco is not the equivalent of a Basquiat canvas, but others will remember that such high-blown rhetoric attended the 1980s' art world as well.
And food has been a rare bright spot in New York's economy. Since 2007, as other manufacturing sectors have cratered, the number of food manufacturers in the city has grown by 14.1 percent, mostly in small businesses concentrated in Brooklyn, according to the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
At the Hester Street Fair on the Lower East Side, a competitive indie food ethos reigns, even with 8,000 visitors on a typical Saturday, said the former MTV correspondent SuChin Pak, its founder. ''It's definitely a shared experience,'' she said, ''but it has a mentality of having gotten there first, being the influencer in your group. Those thousands of people all consider themselves food critics. If you have an Instagram account, you feel you can say something was delicious.''
Because start-up costs are low, the food changes with trends at the speed of fashion. Lobster rolls and braised meat abound at most markets; Indian food, despite some of the world's great street dishes, is rare or absent. Grilled cheese is the new black.
''Korean food seems really new now because people took the lead in adapting it,'' said Joann Kim Nunez, who books the food vendors at Dekalb Market in Downtown Brooklyn. ''It's all marketing and messaging. For anyone who doesn't know better, this is Korean food. But for people who know, they know Koreans don't eat tacos.''
Carmen Costanzo, 31, a bartender in Sunnyside, Queens, did not seem to care. On a recent Saturday, he sampled a plate of lentils, spinach, chicken stew and spongy injera bread from Taste of Ethiopia at the Queens County Market, after a long conversation with the owner, Hiyaw Gebreyohannes.
''I love being able to talk to the person who created the food,'' Mr. Costanzo said. ''Hear their story, how they started.''
Mr. Costanzo said the market filled a niche in his life, one not necessarily related to sustenance.
''I used to spend five hours in a record store looking for albums,'' he said. ''Now everything's online. But I can't find artisanal sausage online and eat it right away. Maybe food markets are the vintage record shops of 2012. There's something attractive about finding something no one else has, but then sharing it. I was sending text messages to all my friends in the neighborhood to come out. With a record, you'd keep it for yourself.''
Thus Mr. Costanzo took his place in the current food moment, in which some eaters go to great lengths to find inaccessible or unique food experiences, but they also serve who just read about it on Twitter.
On a recent Saturday at Smorgasburg, George London, 26, tallied an hour's grazing: blueberry apricot ice pop from People's Pops, fried shrimp, handmade Dutch stroopwafel from the Good Batch and a chicken schnitzel sandwich on a pretzel roll from Schnitz, which the celebrity chef Mario Batali recently visited for ''The Chew'' on ABC and recommended on his Twitter feed. For Mr. London, who is unemployed, the market was a cheapish indulgence.
''There's nothing I'd rather be doing right now than wandering around, looking at all the options here,'' he said. ''It's probably impossible to find something here that's not good. The people who come to this kind of thing, the vendors, these foods are a projection of their personality.''
His plan for the day?
''I'm going to eat until I'm physically full and can't eat anymore, which is getting dangerously close at this moment.''
Harris Damashek, 37, has higher ambitions for ad hoc food experiences. Mr. Damashek, who runs a Web design and development firm, started Underground Eats to curate and produce one-off food events. Its official kickoff is June 3, with a theme dinner for 350 at the McKittrick Hotel, based on the 1939 World's Fair. Tickets start at $175.
Or for homier experiences, a Brooklyn group called BK Swappers holds regular barter events -- my artisanal citrus marmalade for your homemade kombucha -- including one on May 31 at Hayseed's Big City Farm Supply, a pop-up shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
Then there is Nat Christiana, who, according to a Taco Bell ad broadcast this spring, drove his friends 965 miles to try a pilot dish from Taco Bell that used Doritos chips to make the shell.
He is a real person, living in Clifton Park, N.Y., and last month he posted a video addressing the ad. He did eat a Loco Taco on a road trip last year, he said, but he did not go out of his way to do so, let alone drive 965 miles. The taco was good, he said.
But without a story, a taco is a taco. And in this summer's food zeitgeist, story is the secret spice.

INDIA BECOMING
A Portrait of Life in Modern India
By Akash Kapur
292 pp. Riverhead Books. $26.95.
''India'' and ''change'' were once virtual antonyms: old India hands returned again and again in large part because the subcontinent was so dependably different from the West. But since 1991, when a financial crisis forced India's government to devalue the rupee, lower import barriers and relax controls on private investment, things have nearly reversed themselves. As the journalist Akash Kapur demonstrates in his lucid, balanced new book, ''India Becoming,'' his homeland now seems almost synonymous with change.
Kapur is especially qualified to assess the contrasts and contradictions all that change has brought. The son of an American mother and an Indian father, he was raised on the outskirts of Auroville, a utopian international community in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Sent away to boarding school in the United States at 16, he studied at Harvard and Oxford, then returned to South India 12 years later, in 2003. His lively ''Letter From India'' appeared for several years in The International Herald Tribune and the online edition of The New York Times. 
At first, he was dazzled. While the friends he'd left behind in America fretted about holding on to their jobs, it seemed to him that every other young person he met in India was eager to quit his or hers to become an entrepreneur. The Indian economy was then growing at about 8 percent, led by the expanding service and I.T. industries, and the country's mood was ''giddy, exuberant,'' ''ardently capitalist,'' and aspirational. ''For the first time -- the first time in my life, but arguably in India's history, too,'' he writes, ''people dared to imagine an existence for themselves that was unburdened by the past and tradition. India, I felt, had started to dream.''
But, over time, as he settled permanently back into the countryside, married and had two sons, he found himself at least as appalled by the new India as he was admiring. For all the restaurants and yoga centers, colleges and gated communities that now lined the newly blacktopped country roads he'd known as a boy -- and despite two decades of new money and new opportunities -- poverty stubbornly persists. More than 300 million of India's 1.2 billion people still live on less than a dollar a day, he tells us; more people have cellphones than access to a toilet. And heedless growth steadily despoils the environment; nearly half of India's land is eroded; at least 70 percent of its surface water is polluted and, according to one recent study, India's air is now the most toxic on earth -- a fact vividly brought home to Kapur and his family one spring when the smoky reek of thousands of tons of smoldering untreated garbage dumped outside the town of Pondicherry seeped into his home and sickened one of his /children.
His conclusions about all this are rarely surprising and often reiterative: we are told too many times that change comes at a cost; that ''unrelenting optimism'' is ''delusional''; that ''India could often feel like two nations.'' But Kapur is determinedly fair-minded, neither an apologist nor a scold, and he is a wonderfully empathetic listener, willing patiently to visit and revisit a large cast of men and women over several years to learn how they are benefiting from -- and being battered by -- the change going on all around them.
He is on familiar ground when following the careers of middle-class young people who've left behind the small towns and ancient customs that had given shape to their lives in order to build wholly new ones in the brand-new big-city world of shopping malls and office towers. Hari, a gay I.T. worker in Chennai, finally comes out to his friends but can't bring himself to confide in his parents. Selvi, a call-/center worker in the same city, disappointed to find that most of the Americans with whom she speaks each night are ''rude and also quite stupid,'' suddenly finds herself accused by neighbors and relatives of being a loose woman simply because one of her flatmates is found to have been involved in a love affair.
But Kapur is at his best when writing about what is happening out in the country, where he has chosen to live. Gandhi once said the soul of India was to be found in its villages. ''That was still true when I was growing up,'' Kapur notes, ''when the pastoral world around me -- the hand plows, the windmills, the bicycles, the catamarans and bullock carts -- contained all the charm and simplicity (and the backwardness) of the nation.'' Despite the movement of millions of people from the land in recent years, 7 out of 10 Indians still live in rural areas, but their world, too, is becoming almost unrecognizable.
Kapur's guide to most of what's happening there is a middle-aged landowner named Sathy, whose warrior clan once controlled the village of Molasur (along with 75 surrounding communities), but who cannot now persuade even his citified wife to live with him in the country. For him, everything seems upside down. His once-rich fields have been poisoned by chemical fertilizers. His neighbors are selling off their land to developers, relying on shopkeeping or remittances sent home by sons in the city to keep going.
Caste is loosening its grip. Sathy introduces Kapur to a Dalit (untouchable) named Das, still unwilling to enter Sathy's house out of respect for older members of the family, who has nonetheless made himself prosperous by buying up 50 acres of farmland, dividing it into 1,700 plots and selling all of them off within four months to newly prosperous young couples from Chennai, looking for second homes. He has named his colony Kingmaker City.
Sathy has more or less made his peace with the fact that the people of his hometown are no longer satisfied to have their children lead the truncated lives they and their ancestors have always led; he marvels that his own niece and Das's son now study in the same school, something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. But ''if all the farms are gone,'' he asks, ''then who will feed all these fancy people?'' He has a point: Indian agricultural production has slowed; food prices and malnourishment are both on the rise.
Villages like Molasur have become, as Kapur puts it, ''wounded places,'' no longer predominantly agricultural, not yet really urban. ''People are lost,'' Sathy says. ''They no longer know who they are. All the money has taken them away from themselves.'' The rapid infusion of cash combined with the collapse of old hierarchies has led to lawlessness: thuggery, kidnappings, bombings, clashes between castes. When Kapur's car accidentally injures a boy, an angry mob collects around the police station where he and his driver have gone to report the incident. The police officers seem unable or unwilling to intervene. Kapur phones Sathy, who, still cloaked in a remnant of his ancestors' feudal power, hurries to the site and manages to calm things down. Had he not been able to do so, Kapur and his driver might have been lynched.
''I had left America because I felt that the country was in many ways at a standstill,'' Kapur writes. ''I moved to India in search of action. I wanted to feel alive, and I suppose I got a little bit more than I had bargained for. India was undeniably -- sometimes terrifyingly -- alive. The country was an adventure. On good days, the dust and chaos and danger could seem part of the adventure; they were invigorating. On bad days, I now decided, I would remember the good days.'' For Indians and Indophiles alike, that is very good advice.

HEADLINE: U.S. Efforts Fail To Curtail Trade In Afghan Opium

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN and MATTHEW ROSENBERG; Taimoor Shah contributed reporting from Kandahar, Afghanistan.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- For years, American officials have struggled to curb Afghanistan's opium industry, rewriting strategy every few seasons and pouring in more than $6 billion over the past decade to combat the poppies that help finance the insurgency and fuel corruption.
It is a measure of the problem's complexity that officials can find little comfort even in the news this month that blight and bad weather are slashing this year's poppy harvest in the south. They know from past seasons that blight years lead to skyrocketing opium prices and even greater planting efforts to come.
''Now I am desperate, what can I do?'' said Mohammed Amin, a poppy farmer in Tirin Kot in Oruzgan Province, who harvested only one kilogram of opium poppy this year compared with 15 last year. ''I don't have any cash now to start another business, and if I grow any other crops, I cannot make a profit.''
The seemingly unbreakable allure of poppy profits -- for producers and traffickers, government officials and Taliban commanders alike -- has kept fighting opium at the heart of efforts to improve security. It drove Richard C. Holbrooke, later the special envoy to Afghanistan, to write in 2008: ''Breaking the narco-state in Afghanistan is essential, or all else will fail.'' 
That concern is no less serious today, on the eve of the departure of thousands of American troops. But even as American leaders continue to emphasize the importance of the anti-opium effort, some officials are privately conceding that there is little chance for its large-scale success before the end of the NATO military mission in 2014.
The withdrawal is one worry. As the money from the Western military and civilian aid programs dwindles, the relative importance of opium to the economy is likely only to increase, said Jean-Luc Lemahieu, the director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Afghanistan.
''Some money is available through the licit economy, but less than in the past as the Western contracts dry up, and so the importance of the illicit, informal economy will increase: human trafficking, gems, timber and weapons smuggling, and of course narcotics is a huge chunk of it,'' he said, adding: ''The prognosis post-2014 is not a positive one.''
Opium poppy, much like the coca grown in Colombia and Peru, poses a number of problems because there is so much money to be made that powerful political players, from police chiefs to governors, inevitably want a cut. The Taliban also support the drug trade, directly by protecting opium farmers, and indirectly by shielding traffickers, who pay off everybody in order to move their products quickly to the borders, according to narcotics experts at the United Nations and the Afghan government.
''Drugs are not the only priority issue for Afghanistan,'' said William R. Brownfield, the State Department's assistant secretary for international narcotics and law enforcement, in an interview this month. ''But by the same token, if you do not address the drug issue you will not succeed in the other security, stability, democracy, prosperity objectives you are aiming for.''
Despite all the effort, there are many troubling indicators. Nationwide, the number of poppy-free provinces, which reached a high of 20 in 2010, has now dropped to at least 17 and could be found to be still lower once researchers finish surveying remote provinces. Overall acres under poppy cultivation began rising again in 2009 after a significant drop the year before, and the total has grown slowly but steadily since.
Interdiction, while somewhat improved under new Afghan counternarcotics leadership, nets only about 3.5 percent of the 375 tons of heroin that leaves the country every year, according to the United Nations.
Even the success stories are unlikely to be sustainable, officials say. The prime example is the combined American and British counternarcotics campaign in the Helmand River Valley, in the heart of the province that produces nearly half of Afghanistan's opium. Since its start in 2009, the military mission has coincided with a 33 percent decrease in opium poppy cultivation in the area, and concurrent programs to create alternative jobs and crops have had a significant effect there.
But the troops are leaving -- as many as 14,000 American Marines could depart Helmand by the end of the year -- and many of the incentive programs are closing down unless Afghanistan's counternarcotics minister can persuade the West to renew them.
''We have to watch the answer develop over the next 6 to 12 months,'' Mr. Brownfield said, speaking of the effects of the military withdrawal. ''That's what transition is all about -- we're changing from a known to an unknown.''
This year's low opium harvest has thrown another element of unpredictability into the picture. It has already driven a few farmers to commit suicide and others to flee because they feared retribution from creditors, according to the governor's office in Helmand. But rather than serving as a disincentive, the poor crop is more likely to prompt many to plant even more poppy next year to make up for this year's losses. That was the pattern in previous blight seasons, like 2010.
Mr. Amin, the poppy farmer in Tirin Kot, says that despite the risks, there is nothing to replace opium: ''The poppy is always good, you can sell it at any time. It is like gold, you can sell it whenever and get cash.''
In the meantime, the price for opium at the farm gate has soared -- up more than 50 percent from a month ago and now selling for more than $320 per kilogram -- another factor likely to spur more planting, Mr. Lemahieu said. Traffickers, who stockpile opium from year to year, are making a killing, he said.
On the Afghan side, the minister for counternarcotics, Zarar Ahmad Muqbel Osmani, has increased poppy eradication efforts in areas where farmers can grow other crops and is lobbying to expand the alternative crop program. But he remains deeply frustrated with the overall lack of law enforcement. Asked what it would take to affect the country's drug problem, he answered tersely, ''Political will.''
Among the continuing problems with corruption: information leaks that scuttle potential drug raids; political pressure that results in the release of major traffickers; and local politicians and police officers who participate in the poppy trade and use eradication programs to attack their rivals.
The deputy interior minister for counternarcotics, Lt. Gen. Baaz Mohammed Ahmadi, said his specialized force must still answer to local police officials.
''Because they are dependent on the regular force for everything, for gas for their vehicles and for the vehicles, even a very junior fuel dispatcher will know about the details of our operations,'' he said. ''And when we plan an operation, we have to have approval of the local police chief or his deputy or the zone police chief, and if one of those people is corrupt or linked to a big trafficker, it leaks.''
The Americans have taken at least three different tacks to fighting opium poppy cultivation.
In the early days after the 2001 invasion, a little more than half the current acreage was under cultivation, a legacy in part from the Taliban's ban on opium, which they ignored selectively. The Western emphasis was on driving the remaining Taliban fighters from the country, and with that in mind the Americans made allies of many of the old warlords who were also involved in the drug trade, entrenching a culture of impunity.
In 2005, British forces found nearly 20,000 pounds of opium in the office of the Helmand governor, Sher Mohammed Akhundzada, an ally of President Hamid Karzai. He was forced out at the behest of the British, but was later named to the Senate.
In 2006, as Americans began promoting eradication by specially trained Afghan forces, heroin was found in a car belonging Hajji Zaher Qadir, whom Mr. Karzai had been considering to lead the border police force. That appointment was scrapped, but Mr. Qadir is now one of the leaders in the lower house of Parliament. Many of the northern power brokers are also believed to be involved in the drug trade.
In 2007, as poppy growth reached a record-high 477,000 acres, the new American ambassador, William B. Wood, began to lobby for aerial eradication of the kind that had been undertaken in Colombia.
Mr. Wood became such a vocal proponent that he was known in the British press as ''Chemical Bill.'' He once even tried to overcome President Karzai's skepticism about spraying by offering to publicly sit in a vat of pesticide clad only in a Speedo bathing suit to prove the chemicals were safe, said a Western official familiar with the discussions at the time.
Strenuous opposition from Mr. Karzai, European diplomats and some American policy makers stopped the program from getting off the ground. They feared it would backfire by reminding impoverished Afghans of Soviet-era spraying and would push them further into poverty, and into the arms of the Taliban.
In 2009, with the arrival of President Obama's team, including Mr. Holbrooke, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and later Gen. David H. Petraeus, the focus turned toward a counterinsurgency strategy that hinged on gaining acceptance from local Afghans.
Aware of how eradication deeply alienated rural Afghans who depended on opium for their families' subsistence, the American military distanced itself as much as possible from destroying poppy crops, instead supporting alternative crops and livelihoods. The State Department paid provincial governors to use Afghan forces to eradicate.
At the same time, officers from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Justice Department mentored the Afghan police in interdiction and Afghan lawyers and judges in prosecuting narcotics cases.
The efforts have led to two perceived success stories: new drug courts, and the alternative crops and jobs effort in Helmand Province. Both initiatives have taken several years to mature. The drug courts, in particular, are widely viewed as largely insulated from corruption and are efficient, handling 635 cases in 2011. A few of them involved government employees, including police officers who were smuggling heroin. In the vast majority, the prosecutors obtained convictions.
Still, for many Afghans in the poppy belt, the idea of placing a bet on the government's future by cultivating anything other than poppy seems like one of the longest of shots.
''It is not an easy choice to grow poppies,'' said Tahir Khan, a local village leader in Khogyani district in the Nangarhar Province in eastern Afghanistan. ''We know the danger and threat from the government and it is difficult, it needs hard work to recoup our investment. But the people are poor, they have no choice.''

HEADLINE: Can China Escape the Low-Wage Trap?

BYLINE: By JAMES FALLOWS. 
The national correspondent for The Atlantic and the author, most recently, of ''China Airborne.''

 BODY:
THE news out of China this year has been relentlessly bad. The political system was embarrassed in front of its own people by the Bo Xilai scandal and in front of the world by the Chen Guangcheng incident. The Chinese economy has slowed and its stock indexes have been rocked, while its neighbors have been strengthening their ties with the United States.
All this has occurred at the worst possible time for the Communist leadership, as it prepares for what was supposed to be a seamlessly orchestrated transfer of power to a new president, premier and ruling cadre later this year. Instead, the events of 2012 have made accounts of an all-capable and problem-free China, which were so common just before and after the triumphant 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, seem quaintly credulous.
While each of these problems is likely to prove surmountable, together they are clues to a question that will take much longer to answer: Can China make it as a fully modern economy and society? 
The China we have known for 30 years has been a phenomenal success, but one with some increasingly evident weaknesses and failures. ''Making it'' in this sense would mean that the China of, say, two decades from now will look like something other than a bigger, faster, more intense and frenetic version of what it is today.
The successful side of China's record is familiar. No society has ever created wealth faster nor alleviated poverty on a more sweeping scale. As every wide-eyed Western visitor reports, its super-modern infrastructure makes the rest of the world seem pathetic and paralyzed.
Meanwhile, the Chinese public has been consuming only half of the total output of their economy, the rest being set aside for public and private investment in China and amassing overseas assets, from American Treasury notes to real estate, artwork and companies.
Along the way, the texture of Chinese life has liberalized in ways very hard to imagine when Deng Xiaoping began this process more than 30 years ago.
On my early visits to China in the mid-1980s, I assumed that as a Western journalist I would be noticed, followed, surveilled -- and I was. Most of the time today, however, foreigners are noticed only to the extent that they provide an opportunity for, or create an obstacle to, a business deal some Chinese dreamer has in his or her sights.
These are the successes. Some of the limits and failures are well publicized: among others, the environmental despoliation that has made cancer the leading cause of death in China; the demographic shift caused by the one-child policy that threatens to make China the first society to grow old before it grows rich; and the problems of transparency and accountability in the Chinese governing system, illustrated most recently by the Bo Xilai and Chen Guangcheng cases.
Those, at least, are the problems that get the headlines. But there's a bigger one, which the Chinese government and public are only now starting to recognize: whether the success of China's current model is leading toward a ''low-wage trap,'' in which its outsourcing factories get bigger but don't necessarily move the country toward the higher tiers of the world economic structure.
PUT differently, will Chinese companies ever go from assembling iPads to fostering future Apples of their own -- or, similarly, from selling knockoff copies of Western movies, music, search engines and online apps to establishing China's own pop-culture industries with worldwide profits and soft-power appeal?
Nearly every Apple product is ''made'' in China, but barely 10 cents on the Apple sales dollar stay with workers, suppliers or anyone else in the country. The rest goes to designers and shareholders in the United States, component makers in Japan, machine-tool makers in Germany and retailers or shippers around the world. The problem for America with this arrangement is that it disproportionately rewards the top rather than the middle of our income scale. The problem for China is figuring out how to capture more of the rewards to begin with.
The profits of globalized commerce are powerfully skewed toward famous brand-name corporations, of which China has surprisingly few. Its most creative, dynamic firms are small subcontractors, while its biggest companies are sluggish former state monopolies. South Korea, with fewer people than the average Chinese province, has more global brand-name corporations -- like Samsung, LG, Hyundai -- than China as a whole. So does the Netherlands, with fewer people than Shanghai or Beijing.
The challenge of creating a ''Chinese Apple'' has nothing to do with the insulting question of whether Asians can innovate. While formal education in many Confucian societies is a rote-work nightmare -- and while Chinese families complain about their country's dysfunctional school system at least as bitterly as Americans do about ours -- the practical-minded ingenuity of average people is one of China's most striking traits.
Rather, an escape from the low-wage trap involves social and institutional innovations that may be easier for Chinese planners to identify than to put in place.
The societies that have produced the real Apples -- and the Toyotas and Volkswagens and Boeings -- vary widely, but they share a few traits. While they fall short of the ideal, they aspire toward reliable rule of law. They have intellectual-property protection regimes. They recognize the legitimacy of fully independent media and university establishments, and, with variations, the importance of guaranteed spheres of privacy and free speech. They are built on the necessity of encompassing a range of different beliefs within one political system.
In short, they are liberal societies. The question is whether China can acquire or apply these traits of modern civil society while maintaining the overall control that, along with territorial security, is the Communist Party's paramount interest.
This is why the Bo and Chen cases matter beyond their immediate political ramifications. In the kind of society China hopes to become, they would have to be exceptions, rather than ominous indications of the larger rule.
After another several-month stay in China last year, I came up with one proxy for China's ability to take this next step: how slow its Internet service is, compared with South Korea's or Japan's.
In much of America, the Internet is slow by those standards, but mainly for infrastructure reasons. In China it's slow because of political control: censorship and the ''Great Firewall'' bog down everything and make much of the online universe impossible to reach. ''What country ever rode to pre-eminence by fighting the reigning technology of the time?'' a friend asked while I was in China last year. ''Did the Brits ban steam?''
Another proxy is China's progress toward success in the very industries emphasized in the current ''12th Five-Year Plan,'' meant to guide development through 2015. Biotech and pharmaceuticals, advanced energy technology, Internet applications and aerospace -- these industries provide an outsize share of Western countries' exports and profits and are areas in which China wants to excel. Boeing is year-in and year-out America's leading exporter; aerospace is our top manufacturing export sector.
To help itself, this is where China is directing its efforts. We will learn a lot about its potential from its progress or frustrations in these fields.
China's 30 years of growth disprove the facile assumption that as the country prospered, it would necessarily democratize. Now we may see a different test: that to move to the next stage of prosperity and development, the Chinese system will have to embrace more of the uncontrolled characteristics of the other rich countries it hopes to emulate.

HEADLINE: Can State Laws Cohabit With Citizens United?

BYLINE: By LINCOLN CAPLAN

 BODY:
The Supreme Court is expected to respond in June to a Montana Supreme Court decision upholding the state's Corrupt Practices Act, which bans corporations from making political expenditures from their general treasuries.
American Tradition Partnership, a nonprofit group, and co-petitioners sued for a declaration that the act violates their freedom of speech. They contend the Citizens United decision so clearly invalidates the Montana law that the justices should reverse the state ruling without oral argument.
Montana, however, makes a sound and compelling argument that Citizens United, which struck down a federal ban on independent spending in political campaigns by corporations and unions, does not bar it from fighting political corruption with a carefully tailored campaign law. The Supreme Court should quickly uphold the state ruling, or hear oral argument before making a decision. 
The Montana case, while about state law, deals with the central fallacy of Citizens United -- that ''independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.'' The justices seemed to believe there would be no consequences for democracy if unlimited money flooded campaigns.
Montana's history with corporate influence on elections has shown that to be wrong. Now, after two years with Citizens United governing politics, officials, scholars and advocates are reporting back to the court what they've found. Corruption or the appearance of corruption is rampant. Disclosure, which the court counted on as a check against corruption, is scarce. Independent spending is rarely independent. Here are excerpts from Montana's brief on its case and friend-of-the-court briefs explaining the damage done when campaign finance laws are gutted:
Montana's brief
In Montana and elsewhere, today's state political campaigns are different in kind, not just degree, from federal campaigns. State elections are many orders of magnitude smaller than federal elections. The $12 million annual budget of Citizens United, a relatively small player in national politics, is roughly double the total amount raised by every state executive, legislative, and judicial candidate over a biennial election cycle in Montana
Notes: The state's sparse population, dependence on extraction industries and low campaign costs make it extra vulnerable to improper influence. Here's a nightmare scenario without the Corrupt Practices Act: a nonresident corporation that wants to eviscerate mining regulation picks and installs politicians who will do that.
A.T.P.'s undisputed purpose is to use the nonprofit corporate form primarily to evade disclosure of funding sources that are themselves out-of-state (and potentially offshore) business corporations that seek to influence Montana elections anonymously.
Notes: Disclosure of campaign contributions, the Supreme Court has said, is crucial. But if the court strikes down Montana's anticorruption law, the state would be left with little ability to require disclosure of significant corporate spending.
Brief for Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and John McCain
The news confirms, daily, that existing campaign finance rules purporting to provide for ''independence'' and ''disclosure'' in fact provide neither. Regulatory filings show that much of the funding for independent expenditures comes from shell companies, pass-through entities and nonprofit organizations that conceal the true source of the individuals and companies supporting them.
Notes: In the 2010 elections, two- thirds of the independent spending was the result of ending limits on corporate contributions. Outside spending, totaling $289 million, far surpassed spending by political parties.
Brief for the Campaign Legal Center and other groups
Federal coordination rules are so narrow and limited in scope that an ''independent'' spender can be married to a candidate and share the same home without running afoul of federal coordination limits, so long as the spouses refrain from discussing the details of specific ad buys.
Notes: Shockingly loose rules set by the Federal Election Commission under federal laws and court rulings have made the surge in ''independent'' spending possible.
Corporations have clear incentives to avoid disclosure and accountability; federal tax and campaign finance laws, as well as state campaign finance laws, have accommodated their desire to do so. Consequently, non-disclosing corporations spent more than $120 million to influence the 2010 federal midterm elections.
Notes: I.R.S. rules allow tax-exempt organizations set up under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code to take part in political campaigns. Those organizations can raise unlimited sums from any sources, without having to disclose who they are, so corporations use them to hide campaign contributions.
Brief for a group of former federal, state and local election officials
In a recent national poll by the independent Opinion Research Corporation, 69 percent agreed that ''new rules that let corporations, unions and people give unlimited money to super PACs will lead to corruption.'' ... Sixty-five percent of respondents said they trust government less because donors to super PACs have more influence than average voters, and 26 percent said they were less likely to vote as a result.
Notes: Campaign finance laws, as well as Supreme Court rulings, are supposed to increase confidence in the political system. Citizens United has done the opposite, leading to even greater cynicism.
Montana's law does not restrict corporate speech: businesses remain free to make contributions to support their interests and many do. But the anticorruption law requires that any corporate campaign contributions come from shareholders, employees or officers and be made through a related political action committee. This kind of safeguard is particularly important for elected local officials whose impartiality is crucial, like judges, sheriffs and prosecutors.
Twenty-two other states and the District of Columbia have urged the justices to uphold the Montana ruling. They have made clear that any decision ''will have consequences for state laws across the country,'' affecting the democratic character of state and local elections. They're understandably worried that nonresident corporations, with specific economic interests, would be able to distort, even steal, elections if state campaign laws requiring accountability were dismantled.
Citizens United has done great harm to federal elections for Congress and the president under the guise of protecting free speech. The harm would be greatly magnified if the justices extended that flawed analysis to cut down state laws aimed at corruption.

HEADLINE: ID Thieves Loot Tax Checks, Filing Early and Often

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Besieged by identity theft, Florida now faces a fast-spreading form of fraud so simple and lucrative that some violent criminals have traded their guns for laptops. And the target is the United States Treasury.
With nothing more than ledgers of stolen identity information -- Social Security numbers and their corresponding names and birth dates -- criminals have electronically filed thousands of false tax returns with made-up incomes and withholding information and have received hundreds of millions of dollars in wrongful refunds, law enforcement officials say.
The criminals, some of them former drug dealers, outwit the Internal Revenue Service by filing a return before the legitimate taxpayer files. Then the criminals receive the refund, sometimes by check but more often though a convenient but hard-to-trace prepaid debit card.
The government-approved cards, intended to help people who have no bank accounts, are widely available in many places, including tax preparation companies. Some of them are mailed, and the swindlers often provide addresses for vacant houses, even buying mailboxes for them, and then collect the refunds there. 
Postal workers have been harassed, robbed and, in one case, murdered as they have made their rounds with mail trucks full of debit cards and master keys to mailboxes.
The fraud, which has spread around the country, is costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars annually, federal and state officials say. The I.R.S. sometimes, in effect, pays two refunds instead of one: first to the criminal who gets a claim approved, and then a second to the legitimate taxpayer, who might have to wait as long as a year while the agency verifies the second claim.
J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, testified before Congress this month that the I.R.S. detected 940,000 fake returns for 2010 in which identity thieves would have received $6.5 billion in refunds. But Mr. George said the agency missed an additional 1.5 million returns with possibly fraudulent refunds worth more than $5.2 billion.
Florida, with its large population of elderly residents and health care facilities, provides a wealth of opportunities for swindlers. South Florida, which had the highest rate of identity theft in the nation, and Tampa have been hit hardest.
The United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Wifredo A. Ferrer, called identity-theft tax fraud an ''epidemic.'' He formed a task force of 18 federal and state agencies, including the I.R.S., to combat the problem. Despite those efforts, it is worsening, Mr. Ferrer said.
''The I.R.S. is doing what they can to prevent this, but this is like a tsunami of fraud,'' Mr. Ferrer said. ''Everywhere I go, every dinner, every function I attend, someone will come up to me and tell me they are a victim -- people in this office, police officers, firefighters.''
In the past two years, the I.R.S. has recognized the severity and rise of this type of fraud, and its vulnerability to it. The ease of electronic filing and the boom in identity theft have outpaced the agency's technological ability to detect this sort of fraudulent claim, senior agency officials say. The I.R.S. receives 100 million tax returns a year, most filed within a short period of time and a vast majority legitimate.
From 2008 to 2011, the number of returns filed by identity thieves and stopped by the I.R.S. increased significantly, officials said. Last year, it was at least 1.3 million, said Steven T. Miller, deputy commissioner for services and enforcement at the agency.
This year, with only 30 percent of the filings reviewed so far, the number is already at 2.6 million. The bulk are related to identity theft, Mr. Miller said.
The agency, prodded by lawmakers and the public, is moving more aggressively to stop the avalanche. It has increased the number of investigators, put in place better technology that flags more returns, distributed personal identification numbers to victims for the next filing season and hired more workers to help taxpayers get their refunds. The agency, which had $300 million cut from its budget this year, has invested the same amount in combating the problem.
The agency is also working with local law enforcement officials in Florida, allowing them to obtain information on tax returns with the permission of the rightful taxpayer, an important tool for investigators.
''We have gotten much better at it,'' Mr. Miller said, ''and still have a ways to go.''
At the same time, members of Florida's Congressional delegation have introduced legislation to increase penalties on tax-fraud identity theft. A wide-reaching bill sponsored by Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, would also bolster protections for victims, help secure some Social Security numbers and make it easier for law enforcement agencies to work together.
''There is almost no disincentive, because the penalty is so low for a thief to do this repeatedly,'' said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, another Democrat who has introduced a bill. She said her South Florida office had been inundated with complaints about tax-fraud theft in the past year.
Flora Goldberg, an 80-year-old Broward County resident, provided one of them. Last year, she did what she has done for decades: she filed, or tried to file, her tax return, this time electronically. But she quickly received a message saying her claim had already been processed. One month later, she got a letter informing her that she had been a victim of identity theft.
Impatient with the bureaucracy and the delays in getting answers, she called her congresswoman. She received her $4,000 refund in December.
''After I got the letter, then I was a little hysterical,'' Ms. Goldberg said, adding that the I.R.S. eventually assigned her a personal identification number for future use.
In South Florida and Tampa, the problem has gotten so bad that police officers conducting unrelated searches or simple traffic stops routinely stumble across ledgers with names and Social Security numbers, boxes of stolen medical records and envelopes with debit cards.
The Tampa Police Department set up a special unit last year related to this kind of fraud after officers continued to find an ''ungodly amount'' of identity-theft material, said Detective Sal Augeri, a veteran on the unit. Last year, the department handled nearly 1,000 incidents; this year, the number is ''way, way above that,'' he said.
Fraudulent filers first used names and Social Security numbers of the deceased to file claims. The numbers become public by law and, until recently, were easily available on popular genealogy Web sites. Swindlers also used the Social Security numbers of prisoners.
When officials cracked down on those two avenues, the theft migrated to anywhere Social Security numbers are collected. Most vulnerable are records from health care facilities, assisted-living centers, schools, insurance companies, pension funds and large stores that issue credit cards. The police say employees steal the information and sell it, an increasingly common practice here.
Everyone is susceptible. Two dozen Tampa police officers, including one whose job it is to investigate identity-theft fraud, had their identities stolen and their tax refunds diverted this year.
Career criminals know easy money when they see it. The police say they run across street corner drug dealers and robbers who have been in and out of prison for years now making lots of money by filing fraudulent returns. Some have been spotted driving Bentleys and Lamborghinis.
''A gentleman, a former armed robber, said: 'I'm not doing robberies anymore. This is much cleaner. I don't even have to use a gun,' '' said Sgt. Jay J. Leiner of the economic crimes unit in the Broward Sheriff's Office, which has formed a multiagency task force.
Mr. Ferrer, the United States attorney, said he had seen tax fraud overtake violent crime in Overtown, a poor, high-crime section of Miami. He said criminals there were holding filing parties, at which they would haul out laptops and, for a fee, teach others how to run the swindle.
''There is no real competition,'' Mr. Ferrer said. ''They are not fighting each other. Altogether, they are stealing from the I.R.S.''

 BODY:
David Leonhardt came to The Times from Business Week in 1999 and began a steady ascent, starting as a business reporter, becoming an economics columnist in 2006 and winning a Pulitzer Prize for commentary last year. Since September he has been The Times's Washington bureau chief. In his writing as in his career, Leonhardt has positioned himself at the intersection of economics and politics, viewing issues with a skeptical but pragmatic eye. As he said in his final column last summer, ''We do not spend enough time focusing on our actual economic problems. We are too often occupied with distractions, rather than trying to answer a simple question: What works? What economic policies have succeeded before and are most likely to lead to the best life for the largest number of people? Instead, we've effectively decided that because the United States is the richest, most successful country in the world, it is guaranteed to remain so.'' 
Which policies are most likely to succeed according to Leonhardt? His answer has an obvious connection to the division between Hamiltonians and Jeffersonians that Michael Lind highlights in his book ''Land of Promise,'' which Leonhardt reviews this week. Leonhardt writes, ''When it comes to economics, we know that a market economy with a significant government role is the only proven model of success.''

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
WHEN economic waters are rough -- or perhaps just to shake things up in times of stagnation -- musical institutions try to redefine themselves, sharpen their sense of mission and do some image tweaking. That can be hard when your mission is already unusual and clearly defined. But the American Composers Orchestra, which has been putting a spotlight on (mostly contemporary) American music since 1977, has lately been reinventing itself as a hybrid performing ensemble and service organization.
''I think of the A.C.O. a little bit like the Bronx Zoo,'' Michael Geller, the orchestra's executive director, said recently. ''If you didn't know anything about zoos, and I asked you what its mission was, you would say, 'It looks like a place where grandparents take children to entertain themselves while they're getting to observe living creatures.' But of course their mission is not that. Their mission is environmental. It's about protecting species. It's about doing research. The zoo is the public face of it, and that's important. Clearly if it were just a research center, it wouldn't be the same. 
''For us the concerts are the public face of what we do. But there really has to be some strategic, intellectual and artistic rigor in how we present that public face. I don't think anybody, from the start of the A.C.O., ever thought that presenting a good concert was the ultimate end.''
But whatever anyone may have thought, giving concerts was mostly what this polished freelance ensemble did for its first 15 years. It also commissioned new works. But it was not until the early 1990s that it began adding programs like the Underwood New Music Readings -- free public sessions at which young composers hear their works rehearsed and recorded -- and festivals like Sonidos de las Americas, which brought Latin American music into its purview.
Today, on a modest budget of $1.75 million, the orchestra plays three or four concerts a season at Zankel Hall and offers special events, like the American premiere of Philip Glass's Ninth Symphony at Carnegie Hall in February. But now performances are a fraction of its activity.
The Underwood readings offer a glimpse of what Mr. Geller sees as a more useful future for his organization. Originally they were held on a single day, with several conductors splitting the work. This year the readings are spread over three days: the first two, on Friday and Saturday at the DiMenna Center for Classical Music, are open to the public; the Sunday session is for the composers only. And George Manahan, the former music director of the New York City Opera who took over the American Composers Orchestra's podium in 2010, is doing all the conducting: a change, he said, that allows him greater flexibility in allotting time and resources for works of varying difficulty.
As in past years, one of the six participating composers -- Ryan Chase, Peter Fahey, Michael-Thomas Foumai, Paul Kerekes, Pin Hsin Lin and Benjamin Taylor -- will win a $15,000 commission. Mr. Geller has also added an audience-choice award and workshops on copyright and intellectual property law, fund-raising, score engraving, self-publishing and publicity.
Derek Bermel, who was the orchestra's composer in residence from 2006 to 2009 and is now its creative adviser -- part of a team that oversees its programming, including Mr. Manahan and Robert Beaser, the artistic director -- has benefited from the boost the readings can give a composer. In 1994, while he was still a student, his ''Dust Dances,'' a work based on African xylophone music that he now describes as ''my first presentable orchestra piece,'' was accepted for the readings.
''I had no idea how a lot of what I wrote would sound,'' Mr. Bermel said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles, where he is composer in residence at the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. ''So while it was gratifying just to hear it, it also helped me assess, both in the moment and for a long time afterward, what I had done well and badly, what needed work, what was an interesting idea but might not have been clear.
''There were also frustrations. I had a 30-minute block, and that's a short time for an orchestra to absorb something. There was no chance to make corrections. It was just boom, and it was over. I remember feelings of exhilaration, frustration and embarrassment. It was overwhelming.''
The newly expanded readings address those problems. Mr. Manahan and a group of ''mentor composers'' go through the scores with the participants before the first session and again afterward, with representatives from each section of the orchestra on hand to offer practical advice. The composers can make changes before the second session, when the work is recorded. A final meeting includes a three-hour analysis of how it all went.
''It can get -- not heated -- but pretty intense,'' Mr. Manahan said of these discussions. ''Sometimes composers get very defensive, and they don't want to change the music. But the sessions I've been to are very positive and encouraging. It could be anything from the players saying, 'You need to make these notes bigger,' to composers giving each other orchestration tricks or discussing structure.''
The Underwood readings are the inspiration for several newer programs. One, EarShot -- formally, the National Orchestral Composition Discovery Network, a collaboration with the League of American Orchestras, the American Composers Forum and New Music USA -- has taken the public new-music readings format to orchestras around the country since 2009. This year the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra and the San Diego Symphony took part. And the Jazz Composers Orchestra Institute, started jointly with the Center for Jazz Studies at Columbia University in 2010, gives jazz composers an intensive tutorial on writing for a classical orchestra, followed by a pair of concerts.
These programs are part of what Mr. Geller calls the orchestra's ''laboratory approach,'' or, given his fondness for partly capitalized titles, a ColLABoratory. Another venture, Playing It UNsafe, opens the laboratory to more experienced composers. Last year, the orchestra invited Joan La Barbara, Laura Schwendinger, Henry Threadgill, Sean Friar and David Heuser to use the orchestra as a canvas, creating new works from scratch -- or in some cases, from a notebook full of ideas -- in five public workshops and a concert.
''I suppose the Underwood readings and Playing It UNsafe are complete opposites,'' Mr. Geller said. ''In the readings, we're telling young composers, 'O.K., you're idealists, and you have a sound in your head, but you have to be clear, accurate and succinct when you work with an orchestra.' And with UNsafe, we're saying, 'Tell us what you're dreaming about, and we'll figure out a way to make it work.' We're looking at it from both sides.''
What led Mr. Geller and company to pursue this nonconcert activity so vigorously was a crisis that began a decade ago. Dennis Russell Davies, the orchestra's founding conductor and now its conductor laureate, relinquished his directorship in 2002, after 25 seasons, to focus more on his commitments in Europe. His successor, Stephen Sloane -- who is also based in Europe -- never attracted the loyal following Mr. Davies had.
Even before Mr. Sloane took over, in fact, the orchestra's Sunday afternoon concerts at Carnegie Hall had become spottily attended. A move downstairs to the smaller Zankel Hall was perceived by some listeners as a downgrade, even though the new hall, with its up-to-date electronic sound and video technology, is far better suited to the orchestra's repertory than Carnegie was. The concerts were also moved to Friday nights.
At the same time, the organization sensed that its repertory niche was being raided by mainstream orchestras. A study by the American Symphony Orchestra League, now the League of American Orchestras, showed that works by American composers accounted for 15 percent of the music American orchestras performed during the 2005-6 season, up from 3 percent in 1977, when the American Composers Orchestra was founded. (That trend has continued: the league's most recent study, for 2009-10, reports the quotient of American works as more than 25 percent.)
In 2006, the orchestra's artistic and administrative leadership drew up a revitalizing five-year plan in which all the orchestra's new programs except the jazz institute were proposed. Everything the document described has been achieved: the last item to be checked off was the presentation of ''a major festival of contemporary American composers.'' The orchestra accomplished that last October, when it pulled together 16 ensembles to perform more than 100 works by composers under 40 in SONIC: Sounds of a New Century.
Now Mr. Geller, who trained as a composer, speaks like an investment banker.
''What we're trying to do is find ways to leverage what we do,'' he said. ''And I would point out that something like EarShot is leveraging the readings we've been doing for more than 20 years. We're very experienced with them. We know how to build a good readings program, and now we can offer that to other orchestras.''
Mr. Manahan's appointment as music director was not envisioned in the strategic plan but has been a shot in the arm. Though best known for his work at the City Opera, Mr. Manahan began his career as a new-music pianist and had conducted some of the Underwood readings before he was invited to take the post.
It is an unusual directorship: Mr. Manahan and his fellow planners Mr. Beaser and Mr. Bermel build programs with an eye toward what is happening in the new-music world, rather than as a reflection of the music director's tastes. Mr. Manahan said he does not find that constraining.
''My philosophy of concerts,'' he said, ''is that while a lot of new music is intellectually interesting, the two ways to really get to an audience are through its heart or its gut. I think we've been reaching them more.
''We're not just playing crazy pieces that only the A.C.O. could do or 10-minute Neo-Classical curtain raisers. We play cutting-edge pieces that other orchestras can put together easily. And I feel that we're increasing, hugely, the repertory of works that will have an afterlife.''

HEADLINE: Club Members Learn to Swing More Than 5-Iron

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
CHAPIN, S.C. -- Slinging a pickax under a blazing sun as he dug a hole behind the ninth green at Timberlake Country Club, 68-year-old Michael Kletter conceded that this was not the golf course retirement life he had envisioned.
''No, I didn't dream of manual labor,'' Mr. Kletter, a transplanted New Yorker who is a member of the club, not its maintenance crew, said as he planted a six-foot fern. ''But the recession changed everything. The golf course was in danger of closing. It's not a golf community without a golf course. We had to do something.''
So Mr. Kletter joined about 300 other Timberlake members in a consortium that bought the financially distressed country club outside Columbia, S.C. But to make the arrangement work, the members did something that would have been unheard-of five years ago: they agreed to do much of the work to operate and maintain the club.
On a recent hot weekday morning, about 35 members were on the course raking bunkers, planting grass, trimming tee boxes, weeding, digging holes for new bushes and even brandishing chain saws in a work crew that felled three ailing 50-foot trees. 
''I know the old golf community culture was a life of leisure,'' said Jon Pierce, a retired professor leaning on his shovel after planting tee box grass. ''But a lot of those golf courses are going bankrupt. Being leisurely has left people with a backyard of knee-high weeds instead of a beautiful golf course.
''The economic reality is that we had to protect our lifestyle and investment.''
With dozens of golf courses closing nationwide because of failed real estate developments, the Timberlake club is an example of a new model in the industry. Rather than watch home values plummet as a lush golf course is abandoned, nearby residents are banding together to buy the course -- even if it means running it themselves.
In the wealthiest communities, this process often means that 10 or 20 of the most affluent member-residents write checks to save the course. In the case of another South Carolina golf community 35 miles from Timberlake, the WildeWood and Woodcreek clubs in Columbia, 574 members contributed an average of $4,700 to execute the purchase. Then scores of those members took on administrative duties that became like part-time jobs.
And in the case of Timberlake Country Club and others like it in states flush with retirement golf communities -- North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Arizona and Nevada -- the members have donned work gloves and wielded hedge clippers and weed whackers to help keep the courses green and the clubs' revenue ledgers in the black.
''The members' sweat equity cuts our maintenance budget in half,'' said Timberlake's general manager, David Madden, whose maintenance budget is about $250,000, or about one-sixth of annual revenue.
Cutting down those three Timberlake trees, for example, would have cost about $1,800 if done professionally. Earlier this year, when it came time to construct a new fitness center, grill and card room in the clubhouse there, one member donated the wallboard and other members installed it. When the club decided it needed rolling bar stations for outside parties, two members built them by hand. In 2011, the club president, Julie Nelson, counted nearly 3,000 hours of members' labor.
The club does pay a small maintenance staff for mowing fairways and greens, and the heavy-duty labor performed by members is done under the supervision of the course superintendent. But the hands-on ownership attitude runs deep. With the Timberlake community about 70 percent retirees, it is common for four or five couples living on a particular hole to adopt the hole. They keep an eye on the flower beds around the tee boxes, cut and trim the edges of sand traps, weed the fringe around the green and remove loose debris, tree limbs or trash from the fairways and rough.
If they need a reminder of what is at stake, they look east toward the ocean, where 22 courses in the once-booming golf haven of Myrtle Beach have all but vanished in the last decade, with young trees sprouting through the old greens.
''I hope the economy improves and the members might not have to do all this extra work,'' Mr. Madden said. ''But right now, it's letting us survive and prosper.''
The number of clubs being taken over by members may be a small percentage of America's 16,000 courses -- perhaps no more than 400 -- but industry experts say it is a growing sector of the golf marketplace. And many of the clubs, like Timberlake, are open to the public as well.
The members at the private WildeWood and Woodcreek bought the clubs in 2009 for $4.2 million. Bill McDougall, a retired airline pilot who spearheaded the purchase, said intensive member interest had changed the way his clubs, and other clubs, would do business forever.
''Only the top 5 percent of clubs -- the very most high-end clubs -- will be able to run things as they did 5 or 10 years ago,'' Mr. McDougall, 65, said. ''The members now want to be involved, they want to help set priorities and they want things streamlined.''
Not every member takeover has been a success story, with dozens of failed ventures and abandoned golf courses. Northgate Golf Course, a top-rated layout in Reno, Nev., that closed in 2009, is now overgrown, more a home to bunnies than to bogeys.
Not far away, the developer of D'Andrea Golf Club in Sparks, Nev., lost money year after year without the revenue that a robust housing market was expected to provide. In March, Will Gustafson, the managing partner of the ownership group, asked the D'Andrea homeowners association for a $28 monthly maintenance fee to keep the golf course open.
The homeowners voted against paying the fee. The next day, Mr. Gustafson closed the course. Within weeks, the fairways were burned from the heat. At night, bikers were doing wheelies on the greens and vandals invaded the majestic clubhouse set high on a bluff.
Nick Oddo, a retired real estate executive who lives nearby, quickly organized a neighborhood group to raise $90,000 to pay for the temporary watering of the golf course. He brought in the local Guardian Angels at night for security. Mr. Oddo is still trying to come up with $5 million to keep D'Andrea afloat.
''Not what I expected in retirement,'' Mr. Oddo, 82, said. ''But the golf course is a jewel we shouldn't let go. In life, things can't always be about the money; otherwise, we would not have any museums, libraries or playgrounds.''
Back in South Carolina, the Timberlake club member Linda Hamel, 68, replaced divots in the grass along the 17th hole and helped plant flowers near the tee box.
''When it's your golf course, it doesn't feel like work,'' Mrs. Hamel said. ''You know, late in life, we'll sit on the porch in our rockers, look out at the fairways and say: 'We did that. And it was worth it.' ''

HEADLINE: Nasty Like Us

BYLINE: By EDWARD TENNER. 
The author of ''Why Things Bite Back'' and ''Our Own Devices'' who is at work on a book on positive unintended consequences.

 BODY:
Plainsboro, N.J.
EDITORS and pundits seem to agree that the 2012 presidential election will be one of the hardest fought in memory. Even the international press has jumped in; an Economist cover predicts ''Hardball,'' and in April The Guardian called the campaign ''ruthless in its backstabbing,'' warning, ''you have seen nothing yet.''
What should be explained instead is how civil our recent contests have been, for as a society America has always been attracted to ruthlessness. It might be defined not just as hard competition but as the deployment of unfair, unethical and distasteful (if often technically legal) methods. American culture blended a Protestant sense of mission and virtue with a pragmatism that could countenance slavery and Indian removal. 
America hardly invented ruthlessness -- think of that all-American hero, Napoleon Bonaparte -- but it extended it to the common people. Moralists from Benjamin Franklin to Horatio Alger and beyond might celebrate character as the path to success, but the man in the street knew differently. Adventurers like the notorious filibusterer William Walker became folk heroes. After a New Orleans jury acquitted Walker of violating the Neutrality Act of 1818, he began a fund-raising tour for a new adventure. The early 20th century rags-to-riches baseball star Ty Cobb ''came in hard and with spikes high,'' as his biographer Charles C. Alexander put it, and kept alive the false rumor that he sharpened them.
Secession sought to protect not just the plantation owners' way of life but also the aspirations of Southern yeomen to slaveowning wealth, following the career of the populist military hero and president Andrew Jackson. And after the war, the robber barons were as much admired as condemned for their tactics. As the muckraking historian Matthew Josephson wrote during the Depression in his book ''The Robber Barons,'' objections to the ethics of post-Civil War entrepreneurs like Jim Fisk and Jay Gould were countered by the observation that they were ''smart men.''
Americans had mixed feelings about their 20th-century technological and financial heroes, too. Thomas A. Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company hired thugs to enforce his patent claims; independent filmmakers moved to Hollywood partly to avoid them. Steve Jobs paid little attention to conditions in his Chinese contractors' factories. After his death protests grew too large for Apple to ignore; but even then, not only was ''bad Steve'' praised, but many of the demonstrators in the early Occupy Wall Street movement still revered him.
Attacks on the ruthless may actually increase their allure. In the 1930s, The New Yorker reported that a young man applying for a brokerage job declared that he had read ''The Robber Barons'' and wanted to become one of them. Fifty years later, the Oliver Stone film ''Wall Street,'' intended as an expose of greed, inspired a generation of fans of the fictional Gordon Gekko, as portrayed by Michael Douglas. Perhaps it was this dark glamour that helped persuade President Bill Clinton, supported by his deputy attorney general (and current attorney general), Eric H. Holder Jr., to pardon a refugee from justice, Marc Rich.
Liberal Democrats, no less than their Republican foes, have a heritage of ruthlessness. The patrician Franklin D. Roosevelt, as some of Richard M. Nixon's Republican defenders pointed out during the Watergate crisis, had abused the powers both of J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. and of the Internal Revenue Service. The fallen Canadian conservative newspaper publisher Conrad Black, in his biography of Roosevelt, even praised this side of his character (''dissembling,'' ''love of intrigue''), finding him so ruthless that he was able to conceal the extent of his ruthlessness. Mr. Black asserted openly what F.D.R.'s liberal admirers have believed tacitly: if he hadn't been so bad, he wouldn't have been so good.
It's not surprising, then, that President Obama (supported by Attorney General Holder) has been positioning himself as a foe of global terrorism willing to approach, if not cross, ethical lines by targeting at least one American citizen for assassination without trial -- a ''possible'' impeachable violation, according to the libertarian Republican candidate Ron Paul.
If Mr. Obama had to overcome the suspicion that, like Jimmy Carter, he wasn't ruthless enough, Mitt Romney has a reverse challenge. His now defeated opponent Newt Gingrich circulated a video portraying him and his company Bain Capital as ''more ruthless than Wall Street'' -- quite a ruthless gesture in its own right. Mr. Romney can't retreat into moderation again now; he has to double down on creative destruction, arguing the long-term mercy of short-term ruthlessness to end the deficit crisis.
Politically and economically, Americans are very likely to remain of two minds. Even after Watergate and the election of Jimmy Carter, one of the best sellers of the 1970s was Robert J. Ringer's ''Looking Out for Number One.'' Whoever will be elected in November, the attraction and repulsion of ruthlessness to Americans is unlikely to change.

HEADLINE: Gauging the Cost Of the Bailouts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Seeing Bailouts Through Rose-Colored Glasses'' (Fair Game, May 20), which questioned how the Treasury Department accounts for the costs and benefits of the government's financial stability programs, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program of 2008: 
First, we're required by law to account for TARP's direct fiscal cost by a method that measures the subsidy costs based on a market-risk adjusted rate. That's partly why the original estimates of TARP's costs were in the hundreds of billions. But those initial estimates ultimately proved wrong as we continue to recover most of the funds we invested.
The larger issue is this: To compare the government's investments to what a private investor would have charged misses the point of our programs. They were necessary because private investors were not willing or able to put out the financial fire, and the financial markets had all but ground to a halt. While there are many ways to calculate the programs' broader economic impact, it's clear that they helped stem the panic and stabilize the economy. Timothy G. Massad
Washington, May 22
The writer is the assistant Treasury secretary for financial stability.
To the Editor:
The column was right to criticize the logic that the financial bailouts of 2008 may ultimately be profitable for taxpayers.
The true cost of the bailouts should include the interest that the nation's savers (who are also taxpayers) have sacrificed over the past four years in the form of vastly lower interest rates. The amount is huge, given that interest rates on deposits are often at least three percentage points lower than they were four years ago -- and are now near zero on many bank and money market accounts.
Of course, the Federal Reserve, banks and borrowers are benefiting from this, but at the expense of savers. That's a clear transfer of wealth from one group to another. Steve Paluszek

 BODY:
THOSE WHO HAVE BORNE THE BATTLE
A History of America's Wars and Those Who Fought Them
By James Wright
351 pp. PublicAffairs. $28.99.
The familiar narrative of the American military experience traces the long, occasionally glorious, always bloody march from Lexington and Concord to Iraq and Afghanistan. ''Those Who Have Borne the Battle'' amends that account by adding two subjects of acute contemporary relevance: how the United States has raised the forces with which it wages war; and how, in the aftermath of battle, it cares for and remembers those who fought.
James Wright brings to his story unusual qualifications. Raised by working-class parents in Galena, Ill. (the adopted home of Ulysses S. Grant), he enlisted in the Marine Corps at age 17, back when a stint of military service was almost a rite of passage for young men. Upon completing an uneventful tour of duty, he went on to college and then attended graduate school during the Vietnam War, which he ardently opposed. After earning a Ph.D. in history, Wright embarked upon an academic career at Dartmouth. There he remained for 40 years, eventually becoming college president in 1998. 
In the aftermath of 9/11, Wright began periodically visiting military hospitals, not standard fare for an Ivy League president. His encounters with severely wounded soldiers -- and his discomfort with present-day civil-military relations -- spurred him to write this book. ''We pay lip service to our 'sons and daughters' at war,'' he says, ''even if the children of some 99 percent of us are safely at home.'' With the United States more or less permanently at war, Americans profess unstinting admiration for those serving in uniform. Yet the gap between soldier and society is wider than at any time in our history.
On whom does the nation rely to defend itself? The standard answer, going back to the Revolution, was: ''its citizens.'' A deeply rooted dislike of standing armies and a generous evaluation of the citizen-soldier's fighting prowess sustained this tradition through World War II. The G.I.'s who fought the ''Good War'' were not professionals. Representing a cross-section of society, they simply wanted to finish the job, go home and get on with their lives.
After World War II, however, Washington concluded that ''go home'' no longer constituted a policy option. The exercise of global leadership and the practice of relying on citizen-soldiers proved incompatible. Before 1940, Wright observes, ''Americans mobilized in response to war rather than in expectation of war.'' After 1945, this reactive approach did not suffice: the United States required forces held in readiness for immediate combat.
If there were any doubts on that score, the Korean War removed them. For Wright, Korea defines ''the missing chapter, the absent lesson'' of American military history. It also served as a precursor of what was to come. Korea, he writes, was ''a presumptive war, one aimed at a presumptive threat, and one with changing goals.'' War was becoming amorphous -- undeclared, lacking clear objectives, with victory as such no longer the goal. Americans conscripted to fight such no win wars disliked them intensely. So too did those watching on the home front.
If Korea sounded the death knell of the citizen-soldier tradition, Vietnam killed it once and for all. Wright repeatedly refers to the events of the Vietnam War as ''tragedies,'' an odd characterization suggesting some sort of cosmic inevitability. In fact, American policy makers chose to fight in Vietnam. They willed the war, which was at the very least a catastrophic blunder and arguably qualifies as a crime. Still, on one essential point Wright is surely correct: As this ill-advised, mismanaged war divided the nation, with substantial numbers of citizens turning againstthe armed forces, ''it was no longer possible to pretend that military service was an obligation of citizenship in which all shared.''
Out of the wreckage of Vietnam came the so-called All-Volunteer Force, at first the subject of indifference, then with the passage of time widely acclaimed. In /places like Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States still fights ambiguous no win wars in pursuit of elusive objectives. Yet in contrast to the reaction to Vietnam, the public finds these conflicts tolerable. Not required to serve or to sacrifice (or even to cover the costs incurred), Americans have effectively off-loaded responsibility for national security onto a small warrior elite, whose members, according to Wright, ''are embraced as heroes, even as we do not really know them.''
Nothing is too good for these heroes when they come home, politicians and pundits alike agree -- although the prevalence of homelessness, unemployment and post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans belies the rhetoric. Still, as military service has become a matter of personal choice, status, as well as privileges, has accrued to those willing to serve. Back when citizenship included (in theory) a responsibility to contribute to the country's defense, those who served were merely doing their duty. Gratuities offered in return for wartime service tended to be belated and even grudging. During the Great Depression, Bonus Marchers -- impoverished World War I veterans petitioning for early payment of a promised $500 bonus -- learned this the hard way: In 1932 United States Army regulars under the command of Gen. Douglas MacArthur used tanks, tear gas and bayonets to send them packing. The following year President Franklin Roosevelt let it be known that ''no person, because he wore a uniform, must therefore be placed in a special class of beneficiaries.''
Any politician expressing such views today would risk being tarred and feathered. On the list of what the nation is said to owe its veterans, reward has taken its place alongside remembrance.
For James Wright, both ends of the arrangement -- how we constitute our forces and how we honor those who serve -- contain much that is unseemly and disconcerting. A public disengaged from military service has lost an important check on Washington's inclination to use force, with the result that the troops professed to be held in high regard are repeatedly misused and abused. Meanwhile, the vacuous symbols like bumper stickers and pregame ceremonials that have supplanted substantive engagement between citizens and soldiers invite mockery and derision.
How to remedy this situation is less clear. Wright concedes -- correctly in my view -- that a revival of conscription is politically implausible. (He does not consider the concept of national service -- a universal obligation required of all youngsters, with military enlistment one option among many.) His alternative approach to reconnecting soldiers and society -- waging war on a pay-as-you-go basis -- has considerable merit. ''There should be no military action authorized by the United States,'' he writes, ''that does not include income- and corporate-tax surcharges . . . sufficient to cover all of the operating costs of the war'' and to create ''a trust fund to provide for lifetime support for those who serve and sacrifice in the war.''
No war without taxes. That sounds like a proposal around which fiscal conservatives and left-leaning proponents of equality could rally. But don't hold your breath.

HEADLINE: First a Black Hood, Then 81 Captive Days For an Artist in China

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Mia Li contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The policeman yanked the black hood over Ai Weiwei's head. It was suffocating. Written in white across the outside was a cryptic phrase: ''Suspect 1.7.''
At the rear of a white van, one policeman sat on each side of Mr. Ai, China's most famous artist and provocateur. They clutched his arms. Four more men sat in the front rows.
''Until that moment I still had spirit, because it didn't look real,'' Mr. Ai said. ''It was more like a performance. Why was it so dramatic?''
On the morning of April 3, 2011, the policemen drove Mr. Ai, one of the most outspoken critics of the Communist Party, to a rural detention center from Beijing Capital International Airport, where Mr. Ai had planned to fly to Hong Kong and Taiwan on business. So began one of the most closely watched human rights dramas in China of the past year. 
China's treatment of social critics has been thrust back into the spotlight by the diplomatic sparring over Chen Guangcheng, the persecuted rights advocate who left here on May 19 for the United States. A blind, self-taught lawyer, Mr. Chen pulled off a daring nighttime escape from house arrest. Like that case, the tale of Mr. Ai's 81 days of illegal detention, recalled during a series of conversations in recent months, reveals the ways in which the most stubborn dissidents joust with their tormentors and try to maintain resistance in the face of seemingly absolute power. No critic has so publicly taunted the Communist Party as Mr. Ai, even as security officers have employed a variety of tactics in a continuing campaign to cow him.
Despite warnings from the authorities, Mr. Ai, 54, uses Twitter daily and meets with diplomats, journalists, artists and liberal Chinese. This month, a Beijing court agreed to hear a lawsuit that Mr. Ai has filed against local tax officials for demanding that he pay $2.4 million in back taxes and penalties. Last month, Mr. Ai set up four Web cameras to broadcast his daily home life, his way of mocking the police surveillance that surrounds him. Officers ordered him to stop.
''His personality is, 'The more you push me, the harder I'm going to push back,' '' said Liu Xiaoyuan, a lawyer and friend who was also detained last year.
During the 81 days, interrogators told Mr. Ai that the authorities would prosecute him for subversion, Mr. Ai said. The three main interrogators worked in an economic crimes unit of the Beijing police, and their aim was to gather evidence to charge him with subversion, tax evasion, pornography and bigamy. (Mr. Ai has a 3-year-old son from an extramarital relationship.) They questioned him repeatedly on his use of the Internet, his foreign contacts, the content of his artwork, its enormous sales value and a nude photography project from 2010.
Mr. Ai's eyes grew moist when he recalled how interrogators threatened him with a dozen years in prison. ''That was very painful,'' he said, ''because they kept saying, 'You will never see your mother again,' or 'You will never see your son again.' ''
In two different centers, Mr. Ai was confined to a cramped room with guards watching him around the clock. The second site, a military compound, was harsher, he said: lights remained on 24 hours, a loud fan whirred and two men in green uniforms stared silently from less than three feet away. Mr. Ai got two to five hours of sleep each night. He stuck to a minute-by-minute schedule dictating when he would eat, go to the toilet and take a shower. Mr. Ai, known for his portly frame, lost 28 pounds.
But the authorities at the military center ensured that he saw a doctor four to seven times a day. He received medicine for his many ailments: diabetes, high blood pressure, a heart condition and a head injury from a police beating in 2009. Mr. Ai noticed the hard-boiled egg on his breakfast tray each day had a tiny hole; a guard told him the authorities were keeping samples of each meal in case he got sick or died.
Mr. Ai's ordeal began the morning that police officers drove him from the airport into the countryside. He was marched into a building and pushed into a chair.
''Stand up,'' someone said.
Mr. Ai stood up. A man whipped off his hood. ''I saw this tall guy right in front of me,'' he said. ''This guy looked like he was from an early James Bond movie.''
Mr. Ai thought he was about to get beaten. Instead, the man emptied Mr. Ai's pockets and took his belt. His right hand was handcuffed to an arm of his chair.
The first team of interrogators arrived much later, at 10 p.m. One typed on a laptop, the other asked questions. The main interrogator, Mr. Li, about 40, wore a pinstriped sports jacket with leather elbow patches. He said he had never heard of Mr. Ai until he did an Internet search.
Mr. Li questioned Mr. Ai for more than two hours while chain smoking. He asked Mr. Ai about Internet chatter urging Chinese to start a ''Jasmine Revolution.'' Mr. Ai was questioned about a sculpture to be displayed in New York that consisted of 12 bronze heads of the Chinese Zodiac's animals. Mr. Li accused Mr. Ai of not deserving credit for the work, since the display was modeled after a fountain at the old Summer Palace in Beijing, and workers had done the casting for him.
He also said he was surprised one head could sell for a half-million renminbi, or $80,000.
''Very few people know why art sells so high,'' Mr. Ai replied. ''I don't even know.''
Mr. Li asked Mr. Ai about his extramarital relationship with the mother of his son. The policeman threatened Mr. Ai with a bigamy charge. ''Don't try to insult me,'' Mr. Ai said. ''You wouldn't call that a marriage.''
As the two argued, Mr. Li took another tack.
''Your real crime will be subversion of state power,'' Mr. Li said, as Mr. Ai recalled. ''You scold the government all the time, you talk to foreign press all the time. We have to teach you something. We have to announce you're a liar, you have economic problems and you married twice. And you put pornography on the Internet.''
So it went for about two weeks. Guards brought in a mattress each night. He was interrogated almost daily. Mr. Li alternated with a short, plump man named Mr. Liu.
The investigators were ''respectful,'' Mr. Ai said. Eventually he sensed them getting bored. Mr. Liu talked about noodle-making. The guards played with their cellphones. ''You feel like a bead falling into a gap somewhere and you are forgotten, totally cut off from your connections and whatever experiences you had before,'' Mr. Ai said.
The transfer to the second detention center happened without warning. Once again, officers hooded Mr. Ai. The guards were 80 young soldiers from the People's Armed Police, a paramilitary force. They put Mr. Ai in Room 1135. White padding was taped to the walls, as in an asylum. The compound housed prominent suspects, including billionaires.
The new interrogator was sterner. One day, he and Mr. Ai mused on why Mr. Ai had embraced political activism. Was it because Mr. Ai had lived in New York for 11 years? Or because he had suffered during the Cultural Revolution? No, other Chinese had gone through those experiences and not been radicalized. The two men then hit on the reason: the Internet. Before Mr. Ai began blogging in 2005, he had been a stranger to computers.
On May 15, Mr. Ai was ordered to shower and put on a white dress shirt to see his wife. Mr. Ai knew the visit was for propaganda purposes and did not want to go. Officers told him he could say only three things: that he was being treated well; that he was being investigated for economic crimes; and that his family should not talk to journalists. Mr. Ai and his wife, Lu Qing, met for 15 minutes in the Chaoyang District police headquarters. ''I didn't even want to look at her,'' he said. ''It was completely insulting.''
Back in detention, the interrogations dragged on. One morning, the officers said they were sending Mr. Ai to prison, and asked him whom he wanted to see one last time. Then they said he might be released if he could persuade Ms. Lu to sign a document stating he was in charge of Beijing Fake Cultural Development, the company registered under Ms. Lu's name. The police were building a tax case against the company, and the document would give them leverage over Mr. Ai.
The police called Ms. Lu. ''Just sign whatever they want you to sign,'' Mr. Ai told her.
She signed. Then officers sat Mr. Ai down in front of a videocamera and made him promise certain things: Never get on the Internet again. Never talk to foreigners. And so on. Mr. Ai signed a document saying he had been notified he owed back taxes. Officers blindfolded him for the drive to the Chaoyang police station.
At the station, he met his wife and mother. Together they went home.

HEADLINE: Albany, Ever Self-Absorbed

 BODY:
Pandering to the antitax crowd, Republicans controlling the New York State Senate will not give a number of county governments the authority to raise their local sales taxes -- even a small percentage on the dollar. What makes that especially destructive is that many of these communities are struggling financially after an ill-conceived property tax cap imposed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and legislators last year. 
Without relief, these counties are looking at drastic cuts -- to parks, services for the elderly, even law enforcement.
''We're in a fiscal bind like we've never seen,'' said Karen St. Hilaire, the administrator of St. Lawrence County government. Her county, which is on the Canadian border, is one of only five in New York that still has a sales tax as low as 3 percent. St. Lawrence officials want to increase it to 4 percent.
The county has already cut dental care for children and services for pregnant women. Without extra revenue, it will cut home health care and help for the elderly. But Senate Republicans seem shamefully unconcerned. Democrats and Mr. Cuomo show no real interest in challenging them on it.
C. Scott Vanderhoef, the Rockland County executive, a Republican, is facing a $21 million hole in his $710 million budget. He asked the Legislature to increase his county's local sales tax by three-eighths of a cent, and to allow small increases on mortgage and mortgage transfer taxes. He said he was told the Senate was ''not raising taxes for anybody.''
Without Albany's approval for new revenue, Mr. Vanderhoef says he will have to fire 150 of 2,500 employees and cut restaurant inspections, park hours and some law enforcement services. He and the County Legislature were allowed to exceed the tax cap for emergencies, which they did this year, but that is not enough.
Sales taxes are not equitable. But county governments are desperate because of the lower revenues and additional demands imposed by the recession and, of course, that property tax cap.
As ever, too many of Albany's politicians are focused solely on their own political futures -- worrying that some political challenger will blame them for raising taxes, even a tiny bit. They should be worried about what not raising taxes, even a little, is doing to New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: For Many Illegal Entrants Into U.S., a Particularly Inhospitable First Stop

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ; Michelle O'Donnell contributed reporting from Houston.

 BODY:
EDINBURG, Tex. -- For decades, the first stop for illegal immigrants making their way across the Texas border has often been a stash house or drop house, an apartment or rental home where they might spend hours or days in squalor waiting to be transported elsewhere. Often it is where they are held until their families pay the smugglers' fees.
But in recent months, stash houses have proliferated in border towns in the Rio Grande Valley and in cities farther north, like Houston, a trend that has been occurring in Texas but not in other states on the border. 
And local, state and federal authorities in Texas say these houses are becoming increasingly overcrowded, with smugglers packing in dozens of people and treating the occupants not so much like customers but prisoners whom they starve, beat or rape.
In this South Texas town this month, as the police approached a house and a trailer on a dead-end dirt road, illegal immigrants scattered and fled. But those inside a third residence -- a two-bedroom house made of white-painted cinder block, no more than 800 to 1,000 square feet -- could not escape, because of chains on the doors and security bars on the windows.
There was no air-conditioning, no electricity. A total of about 115 men and women were being held at the property, but the largest group -- at least 50, perhaps more -- were locked in the cinder block house. A few of them told investigators that they had been warned they would be killed or beaten if they did not remain quiet. Some had not been fed in days.
One of two men who subsequently pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiracy to harbor aliens, Marcial Salas-Garduino, 23, greeted newcomers to the house the same way, according to court documents.
''Welcome to hell,'' he told them.
Fourteen miles away, in a rural area near the town of Alton, 33 immigrants were found in a 400-square-foot house in March. The man who ran it gave them two eggs and three tortillas once a day and forbade them to go outside.
In March and April, the authorities discovered 32 people crowded into a trailer in Edinburg, 49 in a three-bedroom house in Houston, about 60 in a house in Brownsville and 60 others in a three-bedroom residence in McAllen.
''We were used to encountering 10 to 15 people per stash house in the past,'' said Enrique Sotelo, the Alton police chief. ''Now we are not surprised when we see 40 to 75 people crammed into small two- or three-bedroom houses.''
Overcrowding has become routine in stash houses, where there is often no furniture and people sleep on the floor. Chief Sotelo said he had been in stash houses where people were packed so tight that some slept sitting up, leaning against the walls. Border Patrol agents in South Texas have not only raided more stash houses this year than they did last year, they have also found substantially higher numbers of people inside them.
In the federal Customs and Border Protection's Rio Grande Valley sector -- a large area of Southeast Texas that includes Edinburg, Brownsville and McAllen -- more than 2,000 illegal immigrants have been apprehended this fiscal year in nearly 80 stash houses, up from 1,012 in 69 stash houses in the entire 2011 fiscal year.
''You've got people stacked on top of people,'' said Jerry Robinette, special agent in charge with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Antonio. ''When you have a two-bedroom house that's made for a family of 4 or 6 and you have 30 or 40 people in there, you can imagine how things can escalate in that kind of an environment.''
Occupants of stash houses in Texas have been sexually assaulted, denied food or water, forced to work for their captors and tortured. One of the 21 people found at a stash house last year in Edinburg told investigators that the man in charge had hit him with a baseball bat because the occupants connected the refrigerator after being told not to.
Smugglers often hold the immigrants as ransom to extort more money from their families. Even those who are not being used for extortion are held captive to avoid detection by neighbors and to prevent the loss of money that would result if they escaped before all the fees were paid.
The rise of stash houses in Texas comes as an opposite trend unfolds in parts of Southern California and Arizona, where such activity has declined in recent years. The Phoenix area was once known as the drop house capital of America, but no longer -- federal agents discovered 805 immigrants in 51 homes there last fiscal year, down from 3,221 people in 186 homes in the 2008 fiscal year.
Law enforcement officials said the reason behind the trend was unclear.
Some said that while the authorities in Arizona had been focused on drop houses for years -- federal agents in the Phoenix area helped reduce the number after forming a drop house task force in 2009 -- those in Texas were now detecting more of them in part through improved coordination and increased enforcement.
Others said the smugglers operating in Texas appeared to be doing whatever they could to increase their profits at a time when illegal immigration into the United States at the Mexican border has slowed.
''I can only guess that at this point it's more economical for them to keep people in one house,'' said Sean McElroy, deputy special agent in charge with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Houston. ''I think they're just trying something different. They're definitely feeling a lot of pressure.''
And as human smuggling across the border has become dominated by Mexican drug cartels, the treatment of those inside the stash houses has worsened. ''The detection and apprehension of illegal aliens right now is becoming more like a rescue operation,'' said Steven McCraw, the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety.
These days, the first phone calls or tips that lead the authorities to the houses often come from those locked inside or from their relatives. In Edinburg, a town of 77,000 about 16 miles from the border, neighbors said they never saw or heard large numbers of people inside the cinder block house. The police were summoned by a 911 call made by a Spanish-speaking man who was locked inside.
In a hushed voice, he asked the dispatcher to send help.

HEADLINE: A Power Vacuum Is Choking The Euro Zone

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
AS problems mount in the euro zone, it's increasingly evident that we've been witnessing an institutional failure of monumental proportions.
What is to be done about Greece? Simply keeping it in the euro zone won't help much, even if it's possible. The continuing crisis has sapped confidence in banks not only in Greece, but also in Spain, Italy, Portugal and Ireland, though to varying degrees. Unless there are explicit guarantees to these banks soon, the market will likely take a further turn for the worse.
An absence of guarantees could prompt a broader chain reaction of capital flight and bank collapses across several countries. 
The basic problem is that many people won't keep their euros in a Greek bank, and perhaps not in a Spanish bank, either, when those euros can be moved to Germany or some other haven.
Yet German citizens do not appear ready to guarantee Spanish banks or, by extension, the whole credit system of Spain and the other periphery nations. Guarantees of that scope are probably impossible and may also require constitutional changes in some nations.
We thus face the danger that the euro, the world's No. 2 reserve currency, could implode. Such an event wouldn't be just another depreciation or collapse of a currency peg; instead, it would mean that one of the world's major economic units doesn't work as currently constituted.
We are realizing just how much international economic order depends on the role of a dominant country -- sometimes known as a hegemon -- that sets clear rules and accepts some responsibility for the consequences. For historical reasons, Germany isn't up to playing the role formerly held by Britain and, to some extent, still held today by the United States. (But when it comes to the euro zone, the United States is on the sidelines.)
THERE appears to be a power vacuum, and the implications are alarming. We may be entering a new world where international cooperative arrangements, in environmental areas as well as finance, are commonly recognized as impossible. If the core European nations cannot coordinate effectively, what can we expect in dealings with China, Russia and other countries that have less of a common background and understanding?
In the euro zone, we are seeing two refusals to cooperate: Germany won't renew financial pledges to Greece without Greek compliance on previous agreements, and Greece doesn't want Germany to control its national budget. Both seem reasonable positions, and maybe they are, but reasonable positions can apparently destroy an international agreement rather easily.
Is there a way out? To seek a binge of pro-growth government spending, in the hope of stimulating economies, is to assume what already stands in doubt. The crisis has reached a head partly because the market already lacks trust in the periphery governments to invest money for sustainable economic growth.
There is also talk of forming a true fiscal union, but that seems to be doubling down on a bad idea. If the euro zone cannot summon enough cooperation now, how is any union requiring tighter cooperation supposed to work? How would national budgets be set and approved? A credit collapse remains a real possibility.
Is it too late for monetary policy to make a difference? The other euro-zone nations might allow Greece to leave, while guaranteeing payments for food and fuel, both of which Greece imports, for a reasonable period. Higher price inflation might then depreciate the euro, limit the need for difficult downward wage adjustments, and help Spain and Italy improve their competitiveness. The inflation could come through central bank bond purchases from the troubled nations, thus easing their debt problems. That may be the only useful option still on the table.
But that's also not easy. First, economically healthier nations may be reluctant to accept the inflation, which would represent a rather direct, continuing redistribution of wealth to the troubled debtor countries.
The second problem is that some of the banking systems in the periphery nations may be too broken for monetary policy to take hold. Imagine the European Central Bank trying to infuse new money and credit into Spain, while bank deposits move quickly to Germany, Switzerland and other safer places. Again, why would anyone want to keep money in the bank of a fiscally troubled nation? That loss of confidence will not be easily repaired.
Since December, the European Central Bank has lent more than a trillion euros to euro-zone banks, but that has bought no more than a few months of peace. It isn't clear how much more can be done. It probably is about time to judge the euro zone as a failed idea -- and rarely is it wise to double down on failed ideas.
What is most disturbing is that the euro-zone nations are democratic, protective of basic liberties, and have advanced intellectual and research communities. The final lesson of this debacle is that smart nations with noble motives can make very big mistakes. And that should concern us all.

HEADLINE: Firing Bullets Across a Border And a Bloodline

 BODY:
WILLIAM ANDERSON HATFIELD (known as Devil Anse) and Randolph McCoy (Ole Ran'l) were the best of friends -- until they became the worst of enemies. Civil War loyalties and the theft of a pig set off the feud along the Kentucky-West Virginia border between the men and their extended families. But all hell broke loose when McCoy's daughter Roseanna ran off with Hatfield's son Johnse, and their fathers decided it was a love that was not to be. By 1890 a dozen people had died and the governors of both states had called up their militias to restore order.
Starting Monday at 9 p.m., History will recreate the saga in ''Hatfields & McCoys,'' a three-night mini-series starring Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton. The men recently spoke by phone with Kathryn Shattuck about the story's significance some 150 years after it began and -- no animosity here -- their budding bromance. Edited excerpts from the conversation follow: 
Q. Kevin, how'd you come to play Hatfield on television?
KEVIN COSTNER The script was sent to me. People have enough sense about me to know that I respond to the writing and not necessarily the medium.
Q. And how'd Bill get cast as McCoy?
K.C. We needed a world-class actor -- actually, I said a world-class ass -- no, I said actor. It was really important because McCoy is a formidable person.
BILL PAXTON Aw, come on.
K.C. Hey, if you can't take a compliment get off the phone.
Q. Was the mini-series the next logical step in your careers?
B.P. I had concerns about playing a patriarchal character who was so religious coming off of ''Big Love.'' And Kevin said: ''Oh, this is different. He gets to wear a beard.''
K.C. This is a special piece of material and has a religious fervor. I think Bill had the harder part. He had less flattering rants and raves, and it takes a brave actor to face that.
B.P. You'll have to forgive us. We have a kind of mutual admiration society. Kevin, when I heard you were doing it, that's what really piqued my interest.
Q. How did you prepare for your roles?
B.P. I went down to Pikeville, Ky., to do a little research. But these were men who didn't leave a written record. I had a book of letters that my great-great-grandfather Elisha Franklin Paxton had written to his wife during the Civil War. He had gone to Yale and died at age 35 at the Battle of Chancellorsville, leading Stonewall's brigade. The mind-set of that time, when every decision you made was based on Christian duty and honor, was a foreign concept to a modern mentality. To really hear someone of their time speaking under duress was helpful to both these characters, who started out like brothers in the Civil War and came out enemies.
K.C. He shared the writings and they informed me. Music informed me.
B.P. There were two songs that Kevin wrote while we were doing the movie, ''I Know These Hills'' and ''How Deep the Water Runs.'' They had this haunted pride and wistfulness to them, and they were very evocative to me.
Q. What was the root of the feud?
K.C. It's fair to say that the economics of the time were the provocateurs in this story. I think there was a moment when Hatfield and McCoy would have laid down their guns. But these young guys didn't have jobs anymore as we moved toward industrialization. They started to have children, and their families doubled in size, and suddenly they had to feed 26. Young men killing young men -- it really has a lot to do with the offspring not having enough to do. Look, you're talking about alcohol and guns, and you're talking about unemployment, so there's a reason for the bitterness.
Q. You filmed in Romania, where much of ''Cold Mountain'' had been shot. What was that like?
B.P. Economics forced us to go over there. We were trying to render this in a 70-day shooting schedule. And I'm a good adjutant, so I was Kevin's adjutant.
K.C. This is a pretty telling thing: We weren't going to get a lot of time, so it meant we really had to listen. I might look over at Bill during a scene and whisper if I thought he might be doing something. That's not something you can do with an actor who's not secure.
B.P. It's a simple thing because we had a trust. I love that kind of collaboration. It's not about ego.
Q. Come on, wasn't there even a little tension on the set?
K.C. What I so appreciated was that Bill was ready to play. You can hear about people, but until you work with them, you don't really know. There's a generosity in him. You either come prepared or you don't, and Bill came prepared.
B.P. I learn a lot from actors like Kevin. He has a way of creating a maximum impact with minimal effort. I tend to overdo things. Kevin, I always thought you had a quality like Steve McQueen. You showed up, and I was pulling out a script while you were already off-book. You put everyone on alert. The guy, he comes loaded for bear.

HEADLINE: Muscles on Its Muscles, But Nuance in Its Soul

BYLINE: By EZRA DYER

 BODY:
ALTON, Va.
WHEN I first heard rumors that Chevrolet was going to produce the 2012 Camaro ZL1, I thought, ''Fine, G.M. is building a Camaro with a supercharger and more horsepower. Big deal.''
Now I've driven it and I know better: defining the ZL1 solely by its extra power is similar to saying that Dennis Rodman is famous just for his rebounding ability.
There's quite a bit more to the story.
Adding a supercharger is only the first step in making a ZL1 out of a workaday Camaro SS. If you want to do it Chevy's way -- that is, create a car that will stand up to the output of a deep-breathing V-8 -- you'll need to install a new clutch and flywheel, along with improved synchronizers for better shifting of the 6-speed manual transmission. Then upgrade the differential and axle shafts. And brakes and antiroll bars. 
Next, throw in a performance traction control system and Magnetic Ride Control shock absorbers -- and tweak the bodywork in a wind tunnel so it generates downforce at higher speeds.
Voila! That's most of it.
In short, wringing 580 horsepower from a 6.2-liter V-8 is relatively easy. Creating a Camaro that laps Germany's Nurburgring in a Porsche-hounding seven minutes and 41 seconds is not.
While the ZL1's styling is as subtle as an anvil falling from the sky, its performance is defined by Chevy's attention to nuance. That might sound counterintuitive, given that we're talking about a monster Camaro whose LSA V-8 (a close cousin of the 638-horsepower LS9 in the Corvette ZR1) pushes it to 0-to-60 times in about four seconds flat.
But a day of driving during the press introduction at Virginia International Raceway here -- a fast, challenging road course near the North Carolina border -- revealed a Camaro that evokes blue-ribbon sport coupes like the BMW M3. Except that the ZL1 surely gets around V.I.R. much quicker.
The handling of the current-generation Camaro SS has always been characterized by understeer, the tendency for the front tires to lose grip before the rears, causing the front end to push wide in hard cornering. Understeer makes a chassis benign and predictable, but it's not exactly fun.
''Understeer is irrelevant for 99 percent of drivers, because they'll never push hard enough for it to be a problem,'' said Tony Roma, engineering manager of the ZL1 program. ''But for the other 1 percent, it was a big issue.''
So the ZL1 got a different layout for its antiroll bars, which gives the car lively, neutral handling, and in similar form trickles down to 2012 SS models. Call it voodoo chassis-nomics.
At the racetrack, Chevy had a car propped up to show off the cleverness underneath. There was a lot to take in, but I was immediately intrigued by what looked like miniature shock absorbers on the suspension control arms. These turned out to be wheel-position sensors, part of the ZL1's Performance Traction Management system.
Conventional traction control systems detect a loss of grip and then reduce the engine's torque or tap the brakes. The ZL1 aims for a predictive approach. If, say, you're going full-throttle through a corner and the front tires hit a bump, the system will start cutting torque before the rear wheels arrive at the bump, saving you from a lurching half-slide followed by a scolding computer intervention.
The suspension is a partner in this exercise, processing input from the sensors 1,000 times a second (which means that at 60 m.p.h., the ZL1 ''reads'' each inch of road). The Magnetic Ride Control shock absorbers make the most of this information, instantly adapting their responses to the circumstances.
I put all of that wizardry to the test on the track, a great place to remind yourself how little you know about driving. I rode with Mr. Roma to reacquaint myself with the course; on the first lap the driver behind us went into a corner too hot and skidded into the grass. They weren't joking about spicing up the Camaro's handling.
For my turn at the wheel, I set the traction management system to mode three, which firms up the suspension and dials back the traction-control intervention but retains the safety net of the stability control electronics. The next two settings progressively banish the electronic nannies, culminating in mode five, in which the electronic handling aids are shut off. In theory, this is much like Ferrari's F1 Trac system, which lets the driver decide the extent of the car's computer-aided heroics.
On the track, Performance Traction Management functions like Ferrari's system, letting the driver use full throttle when exiting corners while the computer precisely metes out torque. The Ferrari system is no doubt slicker, but hey, I just compared Camaros to Ferraris. Raining frogs are imminent.
This Camaro is one of the rare road cars that generates aerodynamic downforce. At 150 m.p.h., the ZL1's vented hood, flat underbody and rear spoiler help it to produce 65 pounds of downforce. It doesn't sound like much, but at the same speed a Camaro SS is contending with 200 pounds of aerodynamic lift. Trust me, rocketing through the Climbing Esses section at V.I.R. you'll appreciate the difference.
I'm sure some buyers will confine their track time to dragstrips, where the original ZL1, a limited-production -- and barely domesticated -- 1969 model earned its reputation. G.M. says that the 2012 version's 556 pound feet of torque will help it to pound out quarter-mile elapsed times in the high 11-second neighborhood on the factory tires.
But this car is really built for road courses, and it would be a shame to condemn it to a life of quarter-mile runs.
For a big car, the ZL1 dances. You can wrestle a 426-horsepower Camaro SS around a track at respectable speed, but the ZL1 behaves as if it were born to be there. Instead of plowing through corners, the rear end is willing to step out and point the front end into the turn. I've driven an M3 on this track, and the ZL1 really feels like a big BMW M car. Call it the M6's American pen pal.
The uberCamaro also costs nearly as much as an M3, which brings me to my caveats. Is $54,995 too much for a Camaro? (Don't forget to add the $1,300 guzzler tax for the manual transmission model or $2,600 for the automatic.) That's a question only you and your wallet can answer. But I will say that for your money, nothing else with a back seat can approach the ZL1's thundering performance.
The other smirch on the ZL1's report card is its weight: 4,120 pounds with the manual transmission, some 241 pounds more than a Camaro SS. The ZL1 weighs so much because it's built to survive the severe abuse that will inevitably be heaped upon it. The huge differential, for instance, has a cast-iron housing and its own cooler. The optional 6-speed 6L90 automatic transmission is the same one used on G.M.'s heavy-duty pickups. The brakes are enormous -- 14.6-inch front rotors with six-piston calipers, 14.4-inch rear rotors with four-piston calipers.
If Chevy charged $100,000, the ZL1 could have been built with lighter materials, but at this price, improving durability will add pounds.
While the ZL1 doesn't feel heavy, its corpulence is evident in the E.P.A. fuel economy ratings: 14 m.p.g. in town and 16 highway for the manual transmission, and 12/14 for the automatic. An offensive lineman pushing a tackle sled builds up an appetite, you know.
Given the tenuous nature of G.M.'s survival a few years ago, it's faintly amazing that Chevy now builds a muscle car capable of lapping the Nurburgring hot on the heels of a machine like the Porsche 911 Turbo. Call the ZL1 heavy, call it expensive, but don't call it just a Camaro with a supercharger.
INSIDE TRACK: A blunt instrument, sure, but a very effective one.

HEADLINE: The Thing About Lisbon

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI. 
FRANK BRUNI, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times, was the restaurant critic of The Times from June 2004 to August 2009.

 BODY:
WE meet the places we wind up loving much the way we meet the people we fall for: on purpose and accidentally; at precisely the right moment and exactly the wrong time; in the highest of spirits and the lowest of moods.
I met Lisbon in a snit. I was exhausted and impatient and thinking well past it, to the northern Portugal city of Oporto and the wine country nearby, my ultimate destination and real interest. Lisbon was just a 24-hour stopover, reached after a sleepless overnight flight from New York, and my hotel there didn't want to let my companion and me check in and nap and shower and get into clean clothes for another six hours. After some fruitless groveling, we staggered into the streets, lacking a map or an agenda or any particular desire.
Immediately we noticed the castle. You can't fail to. Medieval and partly Moorish, it sits astride one of the highest of the city's many hills, both a topographical and an emotional point of reference, somewhat like the Parthenon in Athens. Your eyes are drawn to it. The rest of you, too. 
''What do you think?'' I asked my companion, Tom, nodding in its direction. I was contemplating all the eating and drinking we'd be doing in the week to come and calculating how useful some uphill walking would be as a metabolic down payment.
''Might as well,'' he said. ''The exercise will keep us awake.''
We didn't plot a route. We intuited one. So the beauty we encountered was serendipitous: the mosaics of black and white stone with which so many of the sidewalks, esplanades and plazas are paved; the tiles -- yellow, green, white -- with which so many of the buildings are faced. Mosaics like these I'd seen elsewhere, though they had a special dominance and whimsy here. But tiles like these, used this way, were a revelation. It was as if Lisbon wore a set of jewels that other cities didn't bother to.
We climbed higher. And higher. And soon two colors took precedence over the others: the red of the roofs, terraced on the hillsides below us; and the blue of the Tagus River and the harbor, flashes of which entered and exited our field of vision depending on where we were standing. A major port in a country with a rich and proud seafaring history, Lisbon has a connection to the ocean -- the Tagus meets the Atlantic only a dozen or so miles away -- that is essential, intimate and palpable. It's one of those places that's not just on the water but of the water.
''I'm coming back,'' I told Tom, because what I experienced during those first few hours, despite my exhaustion and wrinkled clothing and matted hair and overarching physical wretchedness, was a blush of the true, unfettered romance that I'd longed for and forced myself to feel in cities more clucked about, cities more fabled.
That was two years ago, and come back I did: not just for another 24-hour pause en route between Oporto and New York but again last September and then, yet again, in April. And that won't be the end of it, because Lisbon and I, we sparked. And as I continue to revel in that, I continue to try to figure it out.
After all those other European capitals, each so splendid in its own way, why this one?
I COULD argue that this is a particularly good moment to visit Lisbon, and for a few paragraphs I will, though the truth of the matter is that I don't think Lisbon needs any recommendation beyond the blessed fact of it. It warranted attention and favor years ago and will warrant them years hence.
As for now, well, there's a clear economic rationale. Times aren't flush, and Lisbon presents a noticeable price break from London, Paris, even Rome. It's faded imperial glory on the cheap: Western Europe marked down 20 to 30 percent. And Portugal's economic woes -- it's currently in a fiscally austere league with Greece, Spain and Ireland -- have in some sense unleashed a creative spirit among its people, who are taking chances, improvising and, as it happens, trying to boost tourism. Outside money is one answer to inside need.
I sensed this energy during my last two visits, when I repeatedly met or heard about former architects, bankers or lawyers who had started small, idiosyncratic enterprises, and I repeatedly stumbled upon new, clever projects. I stayed in one of them: the Lisbonaire, a hotel masquerading as an apartment complex, or maybe it's the other way around, where each spacious studio or one-bedroom unit has been decorated in a deliberately cheeky fashion by a different Portuguese designer or artist, with all the minimalist furniture made in Portugal. Each unit also has a fully equipped kitchen stocked with glassware, plates, utensils, pots and pans. All of this plus reliable wireless, a communal lounge in the basement and an ideal location sets you back as little as 65 euros (about $81 at $1.26 to the euro) a night.
Over the last few years Lisbon has experienced a boom in stylish hotels, including the lilac-colored Internacional Design Hotel on Rossio Square, the city's majestic nucleus, and the Altis Belem, right on the water in the quieter, palm-lined neighborhood of Belem, where bikers and runners use paths along the river. It has also become a more exciting place to eat, with two of its most acclaimed chefs opening intensely pleasurable restaurants. You can find a table without making a reservation as far in advance as you often have to in cities that draw a greater number of gastronomic pilgrims. Lisbon lets you in.
It also lets you be. Not every stroll and every reverie is shared with other travelers. I wandered one afternoon into the tiny Church of Sao Miguel, just a few minutes by foot from the main cathedral; slipped into one of just 10 rows of pews; looked around; and was stunned at how thoroughly the ceiling, walls, various nooks and a variety of objects had been covered in gold leaf or gold paint. Midas would say his rosary here. I was even more stunned to realize that not one other tourist was present. I kept company with three elderly Portuguese women, all in housecoats, scarves covering their hair, saying their devotions aloud. Their voices rose and fell; their bodies rocked. For nearly a half-hour I watched and listened, hunching down low so as not to distract or disrupt them.
Wandering is what I relish most in a place that I'm still learning, and Lisbon encourages it, because it doesn't come with the long inventory of must-see museums and must-photograph monuments that so many of its European peers do. There's no equivalent of Madrid's Prado, though I do recommend the Tile Museum, dedicated to the decorative fillip that makes the city so distinctive. There's no religious structure as visually iconic as Florence's Duomo, though you should treat yourself to the Jeronimos Monastery in Belem, just outside the center. It's a fascinating example of a peculiarly ornate, late-Gothic style of Portuguese architecture known as Manueline.
While the sort of checklist you carry in Venice or Berlin can be thrilling, it can also be oppressive, a gilded prison of obligations. In Lisbon I have freedom. I can sprint into a random cafe to wait out a sudden downpour, discover that I like the progressive English folk music (Fink) pouring gently from the speakers, learn that the house white wine is utterly drinkable and just 2 euros a glass, and decide to stay for an aimless hour. This is what happened 15 minutes after I left the Church of Sao Miguel, which sits on a round plaza with a single thick palm tree in the center, and this is the true meaning of vacation.
IN Lisbon it occurred to me that maybe our favorite places are simply those in which our expectations are routinely exceeded, happenstance cuts in our favor, and it doesn't matter which fork in the road we take. It leads somewhere we're happy to be.
''Psst!'' says a Portuguese woman standing about 15 feet from Tom and me. She's eavesdropping on our conversation with a hotel concierge, who has given us a lunch recommendation. She motions us over.
''Don't go there,'' she says. ''Go here.'' She writes down a name -- Pinoquio -- and gives us directions. When we arrive, we worry that she's led us astray: its location near the train station, its kitschy decor and its crush of outdoor tables scream ''tourist trap.'' But then the steak for two that she told us to get arrives -- gorgeous, glistening hunks of beef in a cast-iron vessel with blood and oil pooling at the bottom. These drippings are the rightful destiny of the hunks of bread in an adjacent basket. We dunk and dunk.
In Lisbon I pop out for a routine run and am treated to something better: the sharp incline of Eduardo VII Park, a slanting rectangle of cobblestone framing a network of precisely manicured hedges that resemble a maze. The park rises, steeply, from the top of Avenida da Liberdade, Lisbon's grandest boulevard, and my legs burn all the way to its summit, where I'm rewarded with a view of Liberdade and all the trees and 18th- and 19th-century buildings skirting it as it descends toward the city's main squares, which then give way to water. I can see for miles. Exhilarated, I do several laps -- restorative declines alternating with muscle-shredding inclines -- and am entertained along the way by someone playing fetch with his dog among the hedges. The dog has learned to leap acrobatically over them, like a horse in a steeplechase.
Lisbon is always tickling me like that. Ana, one of several friends I have made in the course of reporting stories about Portugal over the years, takes me to the neighborhood that has grown up over the last several years around the LX Factory in Alcantara. There's a network of boutiques, galleries and restaurants in industrial structures used decades earlier for manufacturing. My friend wants to show me a bookstore: a waste of time, I figure, given that most of the books aren't in a language I read. But this store, Ler Devagar, doesn't look like any other. It's in an enormous, multistoried space once devoted to a printing press that's still there. A series of staircases and ramps and catwalks have been created to lead you to and through shelves and more shelves of titles popular and obscure. It's a library cum Escher print, with a few bars tucked in. A browser needs coffee, and maybe even some wine.
Another new friend, Rui, says he'll swing by the Lisbonaire in his car to pick me up for dinner. To me that means a more pleasant, economical alternative to a taxi, but to Rui it means the chance to stage a thrilling roller coaster ride down (and up) some of the city's narrowest and most precipitous streets. The coaster pauses at Largo da Graca, a sort of square where there are trees and tables and a panorama stretching all the way to the 25 de Abril Bridge, whose reddish glow recalls the Golden Gate. (Much about Lisbon brings to mind San Francisco, including the trams, which are Lisbon's version of cable cars.)
But Lisbon puts a greater premium on public spaces than American cities do, and Largo da Graca has stiff competition from other gorgeously situated belvederes where you can find a seat, a beer, some company. My favorites include the Miradouro de Sao Pedro de Alcantara, with its bustle, and the Jardim do Torel, with its quiet. Measure your mood. Tailor your perch accordingly.
LISBON'S layout gives you clear, tidy options. From the relatively flat Baixa neighborhood, where the two grandest squares (Rossio and Praca do Comercio) are, you can choose to ascend into the scruffy past on one side or into the stylish present on the other. Two different hills. Two different sets of experiences and emotions.
Alfama represents the past. It's a working-class district spared by the 1755 earthquake that wiped out whole chunks of the city, turning much of Lisbon's history to rubble. I start my walks through it by fueling up at the Pois Cafe, which is about as pleasant a coffee and sandwich shop as I know, stuffed with curios and bric-a-brac and children's toys, the furniture an eclectic collection of stools and armchairs and couches, the walls sculptured from handsome stone. I wend my way down curving alleys, past fish stores and butcher shops, under low archways, up tiny staircases. There's laundry strung from one window to another, humble apartment buildings painted in yellow, pink and other pastels. Lisbon doesn't shy away from color.
On the opposite hill everything's fancier, better scrubbed. Fewer chipped tiles. More gleaming white cobblestone. On its slopes there are two neighborhoods. The slender byways, white walls and profusion of trendy bars and restaurants in one of them, Bairro Alto, give it the feel at times of a Greek isle. On weekend nights in particular it turns into a sprawling outdoor party -- crowds of young people drinking, smoking and posing.
Chiado is Bairro Alto's slightly more refined adjunct, with more conventional shopping and proper hotels. On the top of the Hotel do Chiado, I meet another new friend, Paulo, for a drink just after dark. We have the roof to ourselves and hover there above the soft lights of the city. Although there's a criminal surfeit of vermouth in my martini, my contentment is absolute.
Later, as we walk through one of Chiado's several small, elegant squares, I say how lovely Lisbon is.
''Really?'' Paulo answers, and in that moment I realize what -- more than the tiles, trams or water -- endears Lisbon to me. It has a humility that is rare on a storied continent with so much reason and readiness to boast.
I wasn't told to approach it on bended knee. I could instead stumble upon it, tumble into it and let it lift me up.
On that first day, Tom and I got to Castelo de Sao Jorge -- that's what the hilltop citadel is called -- before noon. We still had three hours before check-in. But we were no longer in any rush at all.

HEADLINE: This Is How We Ride

BYLINE: By DAVID BYRNE. 
An artist and musician.

 BODY:
THIS summer the city's Department of Transportation inaugurates a new bike-share program. People who live and work in New York will be able to travel quickly and cheaply between many neighborhoods. This is major. It will make New Yorkers rethink their city and rewrite the mental maps we use to decide what is convenient, what is possible. Parks, restaurants and friends who once seemed beyond plausible commuting distance on public transportation will seem a lot closer. The possibilities aren't limitless, but the change will be pretty impressive.
I've used a bike to get around New York for decades. There's an exhilaration you get from self-propelled transportation -- skateboarding, in-line skating and walking as well as biking; New York has good public transportation, but you just don't get the kind of rush I'm talking about on a bus or subway train. I got hooked on biking because it's a pleasure, not because biking lowers my carbon footprint, improves my health or brings me into contact with different parts of the city and new adventures. But it does all these things, too -- and sometimes makes us a little self-satisfied for it; still, the reward is emotional gratification, which trumps reason, as it often does. 
More than 200 cities around the world have bike-share programs. We're not the first, but ours will be one of the largest systems. The program will start with 420 stations spread through the lower half of Manhattan, Long Island City and much of western Brooklyn; eventually more than 10,000 bikes will be available. It will cost just under $10 for a day's rental. The charge includes unlimited rides during a 24-hour period, as long as each ride is under 30 minutes. So, for example, I could ride from Chelsea to the Lower East Side, from there to food shopping, later to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and after that, home. This system is not geared for leisurely rides up to the George Washington Bridge or to Coney Island. This is for getting around.
I've used bike-sharing programs in London, Ottawa, Washington, Toronto, Barcelona, Milan and Paris. In London, where they introduced a public bike program two years ago, I could enjoy a night out without having to worry about catching the last tube home or finding a no longer readily available black cab. In Paris, the Velib program has more than 20,000 bikes and extends all the way to the city's borders. Significantly, the banlieues, the low-income housing projects that surround that city, aren't included, so the system reinforces a kind of economic discrimination, but maybe more coverage is coming.
New York's program will have some advantages over the Paris and London programs. New York's high-rise housing projects are scattered throughout the city, so neither they nor their inhabitants will be excluded from the covered bike-share program area. The ugly tendency to segregate by race and class will be, in a small way, mitigated here. By bikes!
PROTECTED bike lanes in Berlin, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Vancouver signal increasing acceptance of bikes as a modern transportation alternative and increasing interest in bike safety. Some of these cities even have stoplights for cyclists, most of whom actually stop. European bikers take traffic rules seriously: passers-by yelled at me once when I stood in a bike lane, as New Yorkers often do, and chatted with a friend.
I just completed a Latin American tour, not a music tour, but a series of discussions about bikes and transport; there it seems every city has its own bike-share program, many with peculiar local traits. Bogota, Colombia, for example, has ciclovias, when the main streets are closed to all traffic except cyclists on weekends. Though Gabriel Garcia Marquez reportedly had to lobby his community for approval for a bike path that was to go through his neighborhood in Bogota, today those citizens are completely sold on biking as a way of getting around; Bogota bike use has increased by a factor of five. Significantly, the increased biking has affected the city's economy, as Bogota recently extended a network of bicycle paths through lower-income neighborhoods around the city's periphery, making it easier and more affordable for those who don't live in affluent areas to get to work. Bike paths = jobs.
New York's system will be a lot like the one in London, which I used last summer. Before setting off, I downloaded a map and app that showed me where to find the bike station closest to my hotel, near Soho Square and to my destinations, an art gallery in Mayfair and later a restaurant in Notting Hill. I made one payment -- a pound (about $1.50 -- cheap!) -- and I was good all day; there are no additional charges as long as each bike trip is under 30 minutes. (It's easy to keep bike trips within that time limit because there are loads of stations where you can drop the bike off, and you can get a new bike after having a coffee.)
So, I don't have to worry about leaving my bike somewhere if it rains or if I decide to cab home? Nope. I don't have to worry about parking my bike outside for hours? Nope. I don't have to think about whether my friend has a bike if we're going somewhere together? Nope. Everyone has a bike now.
In Paris, Montreal and Washington -- other cities with systems that work the same basic way -- I could use bikes to get to work or meetings, run errands and get pretty much wherever I wanted to go. Often, I arrived at destinations more quickly than friends who took cabs or the subway.
At home, it's gotten easier and safer to ride in the last few years. The city has added 280 miles of bike lanes and paths since 2007; if you stick to the paths, biking is less scary here than in London and Paris. I wouldn't advise a novice to ride down Canal Street or (God forbid!) on Flatbush Avenue, because there are lots of lanes of different kinds of traffic there and no protected area for bikers.
How do I use a bike on a typical day? The other afternoon, I took a break from writing and biked south to Chelsea to get groceries. I rode down the protected bike lane on Ninth Avenue; it's definitely a lot more relaxing to ride in these than it is to negotiate naked New York streets, though you do have to watch out for salmon-cyclists who ride against the flow of traffic.
I try to stop at red lights and often feel lame when other cyclists zoom by. But if this system is ever going to be safe enough for kids, stopping for lights and following traffic rules is something we all have to do. I was ticketed twice here in New York for running a red light; I got the second ticket while riding downtown to argue the first one!
After getting my groceries I tossed the bag in my basket (yes, very geeky, I know) and rode home up 10th Avenue. If I had wanted a safer, quieter ride, I could have gone over to the Hudson River bike path, which I use to commute to work in SoHo. The ride along the water is gorgeous and relaxing. Compare the feel of pedaling along the riverside to the clenched-jaw, stressed-out feel people have when they drive to work, get stuck in traffic, pay a fortune for parking or circle around looking for impossible-to-find street parking. Just saying.
I realized that bike travel had practical value a long time ago, when I was a kid, in Baltimore. I lived in Arbutus, which is on the outskirts, near the city line. There was public transportation, a bus line, but it was designed mostly to get people into the central city. It was useful for an occasional urban gawking adventure, but it was useless if I wanted to visit my friends. So I rode a bike to get to the nearby neighborhoods where they lived and where my high school was.
The house in Arbutus was flattened in 1970 and became a parking lot. My parents moved to a suburb farther outside the city, and I went to college. My parents were part of the phenomenon known as white flight, which involved lots of mostly white people leaving cities for suburbs and houses with yards, a garage and a driveway where they could park the cars they needed to get around. (Anyone who has seen ''The Wire'' knows how this removal of the urban tax base affected public services, especially the school systems that were available for the primarily black and minority urban population left behind.)
When I finished college, I wanted to live in the city, where the excitement was. Like a lot of other young people, I arrived in the city with no money and lived in glorious squalor; we spent most of our full, busy lives in bookshops, bars, tiny apartments and cheap ethnic restaurants. It was exciting and productive, but it wasn't easy, and eventually we wanted life to be less of a constant struggle. We saw that people in other urban centers, especially in Europe, were finding ways to live with their cities rather than in spite of them. How could we do that?
Questions like this aren't uncommon and spring from a sense that one's life might be rewarding in ways that don't have to do with material success, status or making money. Quality of life -- cliche though it has become -- eventually became a big consideration for a lot of people, not just artists and immigrants, but also businesspeople, designers, office workers and code writers, who came to the city and wanted to stay. They want to raise children here and live a vibrant, exciting life as they grow old.
I just turned 60 and have no plans to retire to the suburbs. I love it here. For me, and lots of other people, the answer to the question ''What would improve the quality of our urban life?'' involves simple things like ... um ... bicycles, which make getting around -- and being in -- the city easier, more pleasant and more affordable. New York is one of many cities that are creating all kinds of new green spaces, riverside parks and bike programs, all of which are symptomatic of our desire to make our cities into our homes.
Look around you. Bikes are everywhere: in glamorous ads and fashionable neighborhoods, parked outside art galleries, clubs, office buildings. More and more city workers arrive for work on bikes. The future is visible in the increasing number of bikes you see all over the urban landscape. This simple form of transportation is about to make our city more livable, more human and better connected; New Yorkers are going to love the bike-share program; culturally and physically, our city is perfectly suited for it.

HEADLINE: Power Shortages Set Off Small Protests in Myanmar

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
BANGKOK (AP) -- Numerous small protests have arisen in Myanmar over persistent power shortages as the past year's democratic reforms have led to rising expectations from a long-suppressed population. 
Demonstrations in the past week in Myanmar's two largest cities and several towns could be seen as an indicator of the new openness under President Thein Sein, who has overseen the country's emergence from decades of authoritarian rule.
But from another point of view, the protests -- which have been limited to a few hundred people -- are a reminder of the early stages of past unrest in Myanmar, formerly called Burma. The most recent uprising, led by monks in 2007, began as small protests over fuel price increases.
''Protests like this in Myanmar always have the potential to escalate and lead to political unrest,'' said Trevor Wilson, a former Australian envoy to Myanmar who now teaches at Australian National University. ''It is hard to predict how these protests might develop.''
Mr. Thein Sein was prime minister of the previous military government but shed his formal links with the army to run with its proxy political party in 2010. His program has led to the easing of economic penalties imposed by the United States and the European Union. His government's efforts won the cooperation of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the longtime face of the opposition.
Though Myanmar has plentiful natural gas and even exports it to Thai and Chinese markets, the country has suffered from power shortages for more than a decade. A poor power distribution infrastructure has lagged even more as the economy has grown.
The immediate prospects for strife are hard to calculate. The protests have been peaceful and relatively unassertive so far, with the crowd in Yangon -- Myanmar's biggest city -- topping out at about 300 on Friday night.
The demonstrations continued for a fifth night on Saturday in Yangon, though the number of protesters dropped to about 200. Truckloads of riot police officers looked on but did nothing.
The authorities are clearly nervous, though. In the central city of Mandalay, the Special Branch political police held several protesters briefly for questioning.

HEADLINE: A Fallen Ultramarathoner's Spirit Endures

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
Re ''The Run of His Life,'' May 21: I usually skip the Sports section, and I am not a runner, but I read every word. Engaged, informed and spiritually uplifted, I kept returning to and reflecting with sadness upon the haunting image of Little Creek.
We can't all be Micah True, but we can be inspired by his humanity. 
Tom Woodham
Atlanta
To the Sports Editor:
Micah True's story is a great one, but this article missed a critical element: the voice of the Raramuri people whom True befriended. Overcoming their distrust of outsiders was his real feat.
True and these isolated people shared not only an interest in running, but also values like generosity, reciprocity and humility.
Undoubtedly, few Raramuri consider themselves athletes. Just as there is no word for art in indigenous languages, running is just what Raramuri do -- part of a complex culture in which values and behaviors are interwoven.
In this worldview, the conventional sports frame of the heroic individual climbing ever-higher mountains is the wrong one. Was this recognition the real reason True chafed against capitalizing on his fame? The Raramuri could probably tell us.
In my American Indian community, it is said that you run for your people. Clearly, True ran for his -- the Raramuri.David Cournoyer

The Lure of Sports Cards
To the Sports Editor:
Re ''The Collection of a Lifetime,'' May 22: I am making plans with my 10-year-old grandson to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art to see Jefferson R. Burdick's amazing collection of ephemera. My grandson is collecting sports cards and has most of the walls in his bedroom covered with them.
I am thrilled that he wants to know the stats of the players and the joy of finding another card.
I remember in the 1940s and '50s, many children were such collectors. That was before TV, electronic games and iPads.

Baffert's Quick Hook
To the Sports Editor:
Re ''Taking Aim at Triple Crown, and Not Wasting Much Time,'' May 21: And the 2012 prize for poor sportsmanship goes to ... Bob Baffert.
Horse racing finally had a juicy, exciting, positive story: a duel between the magnificent Bodemeister and the underdog I'll Have Another. Their story could make fans forget about Barbaro, Eight Belles and ''Luck,'' and make nonfans follow horse racing.
But Bodemeister is not preparing for the Belmont Stakes. Baffert, his trainer, sent him back to California.
What has Bodemeister been trained for if not the Triple Crown? Most trainers and owners would be proud to put second-place finishes in two Triple Crown races on their resumes.
But Baffert pouts and goes home.
The thoroughbred industry desperately needed positive publicity, not this. Baffert is too big a name in the horse world to be such a bad loser. Cynthia Roche

Olympics Have Their Costs
To the Sports Editor:
Re ''Agreement Could Push U.S. to Bid for Games,'' May 24: The Olympics are a bad deal for any American city. The host city is left with facilities that must be maintained or converted to other uses, and debt. It took Montreal decades to retire the debt from the 1976 Olympics, and Greece has not recovered from overspending for the 2004 Athens Games. English critics are complaining about budget austerity even as the London Games near.
The beneficiaries of the Olympics are the broadcasters and the large multinational companies that use the Games as another place to flog their wares. Meanwhile, the taxpayers are asked to underwrite a spectacle of doubtful economic benefit.
I would be quite happy to never see another Olympics in the United States. Gary L. Adler

Blending the Sexes
To the Sports Editor:
Re ''10 Games Worth Bringing Back,'' May 22: Tennis has long had mixed doubles, so why not mix the sexes in other sports at the Olympics?
How about running and swimming relays with two men and two women? They could race in any order. If the tug of war is reinstated, the teams could also be mixed.
With the performances of men and women growing closer in just about every area of sports and life, it's about time they competed together.

HEADLINE: The Facebook Illusion

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
THERE were two grand illusions about the American economy in the first decade of the 21st century. One was the idea that housing prices were no longer tethered to normal economic trends, and instead would just keep going up and up. The second was the idea that in the age of Web 2.0, we were well on our way to figuring out how to make lots and lots of money on the Internet.
The first idea collapsed along with housing prices and the stock market in 2007 and 2008. But the Web 2.0 illusion survived long enough to cost credulous investors a small fortune last week, in Facebook's disaster of an initial public offering. 
I will confess to taking a certain amount of dyspeptic pleasure from Facebook's hard landing, which had Bloomberg Businessweek declaring the I.P.O. ''the biggest flop of the decade'' after five days of trading. Of all the major hubs of Internet-era excitement, Mark Zuckerberg's social networking site has always struck me as one of the most noxious, dependent for its success on the darker aspects of online life: the zeal for constant self-fashioning and self-promotion, the pursuit of virtual forms of ''community'' and ''friendship'' that bear only a passing resemblance to the genuine article, and the relentless diminution of the private sphere in the quest for advertising dollars.
But even readers who love Facebook, or at least cannot imagine life without it, should see its stock market failure as a sign of the commercial limits of the Internet. As The New Yorker's John Cassidy pointed out in one of the more perceptive prelaunch pieces, the problem is not that Facebook doesn't make money. It's that it doesn't make that much money, and doesn't have an obvious way to make that much more of it, because (like so many online concerns) it hasn't figured out how to effectively monetize its million upon millions of users. The result is a company that's successful, certainly, but whose balance sheet is much less impressive than its ubiquitous online presence would suggest.
This ''huge reach, limited profitability'' problem is characteristic of the digital economy as a whole. As the George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen wrote in his 2011 e-book, ''The Great Stagnation,'' the Internet is a wonder when it comes to generating ''cheap fun.'' But because ''so many of its products are free,'' and because so much of a typical Web company's work is ''performed more or less automatically by the software and the servers,'' the online world is rather less impressive when it comes to generating job growth.
It's telling, in this regard, that the companies most often cited as digital-era successes, Apple and Amazon, both have business models that are firmly rooted in the production and delivery of nonvirtual goods. Apple's core competency is building better and more beautiful appliances; Amazon's is delivering everything from appliances to DVDs to diapers more swiftly and cheaply to your door.
By contrast, the more purely digital a company's product, the fewer jobs it tends to create and the fewer dollars it can earn per user -- a reality that journalists have become all too familiar with these last 10 years, and that Facebook's investors collided with last week. There are exceptions to this rule, but not all that many: even pornography, long one of the Internet's biggest moneymakers, has become steadily less profitable as amateur sites and videos have proliferated and the ''professionals'' have lost their monopoly on smut.
The German philosopher Josef Pieper wrote a book in 1952 entitled ''Leisure: The Basis of Culture.'' Pieper would no doubt be underwhelmed by the kind of culture that flourishes online, but leisure is clearly the basis of the Internet. From the lowbrow to the highbrow, LOLcats to Wikipedia, vast amounts of Internet content are created by people with no expectation of remuneration. The ''new economy,'' in this sense, isn't always even a commercial economy at all. Instead, as Slate's Matthew Yglesias has suggested, it's a kind of hobbyist's paradise, one that's subsidized by surpluses from the old economy it was supposed to gradually replace.
A glance at the Bureau of Labor Statistics' most recent unemployment numbers bears this reality out. Despite nearly two decades of dot-com enthusiasm, the information sector is still quite small relative to other sectors of the economy; it currently has one of the nation's higher unemployment rates; and it's one of the few sectors where unemployment has actually risen over the last year.
None of this makes the Internet any less revolutionary. But it's created a cultural revolution more than an economic one. Twitter is not the Ford Motor Company; Google is not General Electric. And except when he sells our eyeballs to advertisers for a pittance, we won't all be working for Mark Zuckerberg someday.

THE GREAT DIVERGENCE
America's Growing Inequality Crisis and What We Can Do About It
By Timothy Noah
Illustrated. 264 pp. Bloomsbury Press. $25.
Writing in the middle of the 19th century, Karl Marx predicted that the gulf between the newly rich and the miserable urban poor, made much worse by the Industrial Revolution, would continue to widen indefinitely. This ever greater disparity, he thought, would ultimately undermine capitalism. Marx turned out to be wrong. Income inequality in Britain (and, from what we can tell, elsewhere in Europe too) began to narrow after the 1860s, and inequality in wealth peaked by the time of World War I. In America, inequality in both incomes and wealth began to lessen after the 1920s. The rich continued to live far better than the poor, but over the next 50 years the gap between them narrowed /substantially. 
Writing in the middle of the 20th century, the American economist (and future Nobel laureate) Simon Kuznets extrapolated into the indefinite future this newer trend toward more equal incomes and living standards -- at least for the advanced economies. He theorized that while the initial /stages of industrialization caused inequality to increase, and would do so whenever new economies industrialized, further economic development would foster ever greater equality. Alas, Kuznets turned out to be wrong too. The gap between rich and poor has been growing for the past 30 years in most of the world's advanced economies, and especially in the United States.
Modern economists have learned from Marx's and Kuznets's mistakes. Like Kuznets, they see widening or narrowing inequality as the cumulative outcome of several different influences, some pushing the rich and the poor apart and some drawing them closer together. But instead of assuming that the tug of war between those opposing forces is automatically decided by an economy's stage of development, today's thinking seeks to understand what makes each influence stronger or weaker. And part of the object is to search out ways for public policy to affect the balance, instead of viewing the overall outcome as predetermined.
In ''The Great Divergence,'' the journalist Timothy Noah gives us as fair and comprehensive a summary as we are likely to get of what economists have learned about our growing inequality. Noah is concerned about why inequality has widened so markedly over the last three to four decades, what it means for American society and what the country can -- and, he argues, urgently should -- do about it. As he makes clear, what has mostly grown is the gap between those at the top and those in the middle. As a result, his book resonates more with the recent focus on ''the 1 percent'' than with more traditional concerns about poverty.
The principal influences on inequality that Noah examines include the failure of America's schools to keep pace with the step-up in skills that advancing technology demands from our labor force; America's skewed immigration policy, which inadvertently brings in more unskilled than skilled immigrants and thereby subjects already lower-income workers to greater competition for jobs; rising competition with China, India and other low-wage countries, as changing technology enables Americans to buy ever more goods and even services produced overseas; the failure of the federally mandated minimum wage to keep up with inflation; the decline of labor unions, especially among employees of private-sector firms; and what he sees as an anti-worker and anti-poor attitude among American politicians in general and Republicans in particular. Along the way, he enlivens what might otherwise be a dry recounting of research findings with fast-paced historical vignettes featuring colorful characters like the novelist Horatio Alger, the labor leader Walter Reuther and the business lobbyist Bryce Harlow.
What's to blame, then, for America's widening inequality? Leaving aside the politicians, Noah reviews economic research supporting the familiar hypotheses. Indeed, each of them is probably part of the explanation. But the goal of research in a policy-oriented inquiry like this one is quantitative -- establishing just how much of the explanation to assign to separate influences one by one, even if all of them contribute to the story. We want not merely to portion out the blame but to know what to do, and different explanations call for different remedies. It would make little sense, for example, to invest huge sums in reforming K-12 education and reducing the cost of college if the mismatch between graduates' skills and what the economy requires accounts for only a small part of the problem. By contrast, if my Harvard colleagues Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz are right that education is the core of the issue (Noah draws extensively on their recent research, especially their aptly titled book ''The Race Between Education and Technology''), then what and how we teach young Americans should be at the top of the agenda.
It is not Noah's fault that economic research has yet to reach consensus on how much of the blame for inequality to place on which explanation, and it is to his credit that he does not try to portray a consensus that is not there. His summary of what we know from the relevant research is faithful to what the researchers have found. Part of the problem here, which ''The Great Divergence'' also /accurately conveys, is the tension inherent in concentrating on the American facet of a worldwide phenomenon. As Noah makes clear, inequality is increasing almost everywhere in the industrialized and postindustrial world, even if the increase has been much greater in the United States. We need to know how much weight to give to America-centric explanations like the shortcomings of our schools or our immigration system or the demise of unions. But to understand a global trend, we would like a more /universal explanation.
Noah's own explanation is, in effect, ''all of the above,'' and his policy recommendation is therefore to take action on all fronts. His chief concern is the fear that ever widening inequality will undermine our democracy: ''Americans believe fervently in the value of social equality, and social equality is at risk when incomes become too dramatically unequal. . . . Growing income inequality makes it especially difficult to maintain any spirit of e pluribus unum.'' He rightly emphasizes that while the potential for individuals to move up is essential to what makes inequality acceptable, at least to most Americans, economic mobility in the United States is now more limited than it appears to have been in earlier times and -- contrary to the popular image -- more limited than in many other countries. (It also matters that in America today incomes are becoming more unequal at the same time that most families' incomes have been stagnant for more than a decade after allowing for inflation -- a point that Noah notes but does not emphasize.)
How much inequality can the Republic stand before the social and political fabric frays? Noah does not answer the question, in part because he doesn't know, but mostly because he feels he doesn't need to. ''You'd have to be blind,'' he writes, ''not to see that we are headed in the wrong direction, and we've been heading that way for too long. . . . The worst thing we could do to the Great Divergence is get used to it.''

HEADLINE: Political Dividends

BYLINE: By THOMAS B. EDSALL. 
Thomas B. Edsall is a professor of journalism at Columbia University. This is a shortened version of an essay that appears in full at nytimes.com/ campaignstops.

 BODY:
Four years after the 2008 collapse, the finance industry has regained its dominant position in American politics. Perhaps the development of deepest significance is an absence: the failure of a powerful anti-Wall Street faction to emerge in either the House or the Senate. This is in contrast to the response to previous financial crises, when Congress enacted tough legislation. 
Look at the current political environment this way: if Mitt Romney's campaign and the Romney-supporting ''super PAC'' Restore Our Future were a public company, the financial services industry would have a controlling interest.
President Obama, in turn, has been noticeably cautious in his critique of Wall Street, trying instead to focus on Mr. Romney's former company, Bain Capital. Mr. Obama's ambivalence about speaking out is a tacit victory for the industry.
The financial collapse did seriously damage the credibility of the industry's central claim: that economic growth results from a deregulated free market. But the damage to the industry's stature was minimal considering the staggering $12.04 trillion cost of the financial crisis.
In the political arena, the industry is now omnipresent. In terms of both his agenda and his core financial support, Mitt Romney is the candidate of Wall Street. He has received more money from securities, investment, banking and other finance sources, $13 million, than from any other industry. There is a very similar pattern in the separate contributions to Restore Our Future. Seven out of the 16 donors who gave $1 million or more to the super PAC are from the finance industry and a total of $24 million of the $56.4 million contributed by all donors was from people and corporations in finance.
And Mr. Romney is an outspoken proponent of the industry's agenda. He has promised that he will, if elected, seek repeal of the Dodd-Frank regulatory act and weaken provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley act that was passed after the bankruptcy of Enron. Mr. Romney has also announced tax proposals that would work to the advantage of the industry and top finance executives.
But it isn't just the Republicans. Both political parties are deeply beholden to the financial services industry. In fact, this sector, including securities, investment and banking, is, at $19.5 million, the single largest source of cash for the national Democratic Party's various campaign committees, dwarfing, for example, donations from the entertainment industry, $7.9 million, and the real estate industry, $7.4 million.
After receiving strong backing from the industry in the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama was pointedly moderate in his reactions to the financial collapse, despite the prominent role played by Wall Street leading up to the crash. More recently, at a news conference on May 21, he was asked to defend his critique of Bain Capital. His reply was carefully worded to make clear he was not indicting the entire industry: ''My view of private equity is that it is set up to maximize profits. And that's a healthy part of the free market.''
The caution of his remarks suggests not only that Wall Street has a reliable candidate in Mr. Romney, but also that even if Mr. Obama wins re-election, the financial sector will emerge well positioned in Washington.

HEADLINE: The Betting Window Is Open for Greece's Future

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
INTRADE is an online betting site with an enviable record for predicting Oscar winners and political events. It's gotten the last two American presidential elections right. Now it's wading into the perils of the euro zone.
The long-running European crisis has already roiled financial markets around the world, with investors shifting away from riskier assets like stocks and parking their money in havens like German, Swedish, Dutch and United States government bonds, whose yields are now extraordinarily low. 
Just about everyone agrees that in the last month, the chance of Greece abandoning the euro has risen, with consequences that could be much more disruptive. European leaders meeting in Brussels on Wednesday failed yet again to come up with an enduring solution.
But how high is the probability of a euro breakup? Intrade says it's about 40 percent.
More precisely, as of Friday, Intrade assessed the probability of Greece -- or some other country -- announcing its intention to drop the euro by year-end at 41.7 percent. It rises to 60 percent for a breakup by the end of 2013, and to 68.7 percent by the end of 2014.
How seriously should these projections be taken?
''The numbers on Intrade are an incredibly quick and useful way of figuring out what the average expert opinion is on a given subject,'' says Justin Wolfers, a visiting professor of economics at Princeton, who has studied Intrade and other prediction markets. While ''most political discourse is qualitative -- you say, 'this is likely to happen for these reasons' -- this is quantitative,'' he observes. ''You've got a number, and a pretty good number at that.''
Intrade is based in Dublin, though many of its traders live in the United States. People bet on contracts stating that a particular event will take place by a given time, and have traded more than $68 million worth of contracts this year through Thursday, according to Carl Wolfenden, exchange operations manager for the Web site.
Like stock or bond prices, its predictions, often expressed as probabilities, are derived by matching buyers and sellers. The probabilities are intended to embody the aggregate information of the market -- the ''wisdom of crowds,'' as the author James Surowiecki calls it.
The pricing mechanism used by Intrade is ''virtually identical'' to that of mainline financial exchanges, Mr. Wolfers says. The site's projections are imperfect, but, he added, ''empirically, they have been better than the alternatives,'' including opinion polls and individual expert opinion.
To put the projection of a euro breakup into context, it is a slightly higher probability than the one Intrade lists for Mitt Romney's chances of being elected president in November. As of Friday, it was 39.4 percent, the site says. At the same time, it gave Barack Obama a 57.1 percent chance of re-election. If Mr. Romney is formally nominated as the Republican candidate, his chances would presumably rise.
THERE is no evidence that Intrade is being widely used to handicap events that are important to financial markets, but it isn't being entirely ignored, either. Ned Davis Research, the financial research firm based in Venice, Fla., has included charts of the Intrade Greek probabilities in recent reports.
''They correlate very closely with the flight to safety in the sovereign bond markets,'' said Will Geisdorf, senior research analyst for the firm, which also relies on many other indicators that suggest deep pessimism and ''high fear readings'' among investors.
Analysts using other indicators share the view that the euro crisis has unmoored many markets. Largely because of Greece and the euro quandary, for example, Deutsche Bank predicted in a report last week that the yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note, which dropped to a low of 1.698 percent this month, could tumble below 1.5 percent this year. Robert P. Brown, president of the bond group at Fidelity Asset Management, said in an interview that ''if the Greek issue isn't resolved,'' he wouldn't be surprised if yields fell below current levels, perhaps even below 1.5 percent.
Falling bond yields -- and rising bond prices -- have been accompanied by a weak stock market, a reversal of the traditional pattern, Ed Yardeni, an independent economist, wrote recently. ''Prior to the financial crisis that started in 2007,'' he said, '' falling bond yields tended to be associated with rising valuation multiples in the stock market. The relationship has been reversed since then.''
The primary reason has been fear of contagion from a financial collapse, originally in the United States and, in recent months, in Europe. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and other central banks have deliberately lowered interest rates, but the sinking yields of relatively safe government bonds in recent weeks have overshot the expectations of most investors.
Hedging against the risk of a profound disruption helps explain the premium being paid for these low-yielding assets. And, at the moment, the Greek election on June 17 is being widely viewed as a pivotal event.
If that election results in a government that rejects bailout terms that have already been imposed, a Greek exit from the euro zone could follow. In the financial markets, contingency planning for such an event is well under way.
Some strategists see these concerns as overblown. James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, for example, says he believes that the problems of the euro zone will be with us for years -- but that they are manageable. And he says that compared with last year, the stock market's response to euro zone stress is far more restrained. United States economic data is stronger than has been widely appreciated, he says, and the stock market ''could easily rebound.''
It's time, he said, ''that we learn that these euro crises are buying opportunities, not a time to sell.''
For the moment, however, it is bond investors who have been buying. How much further will they drive down the yields of government bonds? Intrade may provide answers.

HEADLINE: The Phony Regulation Debate

 BODY:
American business has always chafed at regulation, but rarely have the cries of outrage been as shrill as during the Obama administration. The United States Chamber of Commerce has moaned of a ''regulatory tsunami of unprecedented force'' issuing from Washington. Every Republican candidate this year has run on an antiregulatory platform, and one of the loudest has been Mitt Romney, who has promised to immediately tear down President Obama's ''vast edifice of regulations.''
That is not surprising, since Mr. Romney's campaign is being bankrolled by big-business interests. The industries making unlimited donations to pro-Romney ''super PACs'' would prefer that Americans not be reminded that government regulations keep the air and water clean, improve the safety of consumer products, reduce workplace hazards, and prevent destructive financial practices. 
It is absurd, however, for Republicans to attack Mr. Obama for carrying out an unprecedented ''regulatory jihad'' when, in fact, the administration has a mediocre record when it comes to curbing dangerous practices by industry. As much as any Republican administration, Mr. Obama's has focused narrowly on the costs of a rule compared to its benefits, and has for political reasons rejected rules opposed by business. The results have often disappointed environmentalists and consumer advocates.
The administration has adopted sensible and important rules to ensure health, safety and economic security. Increased automobile fuel efficiency standards, imposed in 2010, will reduce dependence on foreign oil, improve the environment, and save money for consumers. Requiring power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants, and cutting smokestack emissions over 27 Eastern states, will improve public health. Other rules have raised truck safety standards. The president fought hard for the Dodd-Frank financial bill, which, if properly carried out, could protect consumers and help reduce the banking abuses that led to the Great Recession.
Nonetheless, the administration has issued slightly fewer rules than George W. Bush did at the same point in his tenure. A draft of its most recent report to Congress says that the $19.8 billion cost to the economy associated with all of its major rules through 2011 was slightly less than the cost of regulations issued in the last years of the Bush administration. But the administration says the $91 billion in health and other social benefits of those rules was about 30 times greater than those from the Bush regulations.
The White House's restraint means that two-thirds of the rules required to carry out Dodd-Frank have yet to be finalized, to cite one example. And there are numerous other examples of capitulation to political or industry pressure:
Last month, the Labor Department withdrew a proposed rule that would have reduced the deaths of children working on farms by prohibiting them from using power equipment and working in silos and stockyards. Farm lobbyists had loudly protested the rule, but human rights advocates rightly pointed out that the rule was needed to protect migrant teenage workers.
Workplace regulation has ground to a halt, largely because of the kind of cost-benefit analysis imposed by Congress and championed by the administration's regulatory czar, Cass Sunstein. A rule limiting exposure to silica dust, which can cause cancer and other illnesses in the road-building and sandblasting industries, has been in the works for 14 years. Hundreds of doctors and safety experts have urged the administration to issue the rule, but it is stalled while the White House weighs the benefits.
The single biggest disappointment has been the president's refusal to tighten the national standards on smog, clearly giving way to re-election concerns in the face of industry pressure. In August, when a pulmonologist explained the terrible effects of ozone on the lungs of children, William Daley, the White House chief of staff at the time, responded, ''What are the health impacts of unemployment?'' That is precisely the kind of false choice that big business and Republicans constantly demand, as if jobs and the economy cannot survive if public health is protected.
Mr. Daley's telling remark shows how ridiculous it is for Mr. Romney to claim that agencies can now impose any rule they like with little or no presidential oversight. In the end, no amount of capitulation by the Obama administration will end the attacks from the right. In fact, Republicans are running against the rejected ozone rule anyway, insisting that Mr. Obama will eventually adopt it.
Mr. Romney is open about his position: Economic growth is more important than environmental or other rules, so all new major rules should require the consent of Congress. That may be a recipe for higher profits, but such a full-blown rejection of government's regulatory responsibility would make life for Americans far more difficult and dangerous.

HEADLINE: Voting With Their Wallets

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
THE French aided the Americans in their revolution against their British oppressors. Now Benoit Pous-Bertran de Balanda, the descendant of a French general who fought for the Americans, is trying to help his wealthy countrymen escape what he calls the tyranny of a new Socialist government primed to severely tax the rich.
And France's loss could be New York's gain.
Mr. Pous-Bertran de Balanda, 30, is a broker for wealthy French clients looking to buy apartments in Manhattan. With the election of the Socialist Francois Hollande as president this month, the wealthy in France are suddenly scrambling for places to stash their money for a while. 
Well-heeled French citizens are scouring real estate opportunities in neighboring countries like Britain and Switzerland. The United States -- particularly New York and Miami -- is also drawing French investors looking to pick up rental properties or pieds-a-terre, brokers say.
In recent months, as Mr. Hollande's victory appeared more possible, the French stepped up their house-hunting visits to New York, several brokers said.
These are not billionaire Russian oligarchs with blank-check budgets on the hunt for trophy properties. The French buyers most active in recent months are generally looking at properties between $500,000 and $5 million, brokers say.
What the French are so concerned about is Mr. Hollande's campaign vow to tax income over 1 million euros at a 75 percent rate. The Socialist government, trying to put a dent in France's $1.3 trillion euro debt, has said it will also raise the tax rate on capital gains to the same level as the tax on ordinary income.
''So there would not be any kind of advantage to invest in something in France, in the stock market or real estate,'' said Mr. Pous-Bertran de Balanda, who runs Black Tulip Capital, a New York-based real estate asset management company he started last August that helps clients find properties and manages them.
To Mr. Pous-Bertran de Balanda and other wealthy French people, the news feels like a rerun of 1981, when President Francois Mitterrand decided to nationalize several big companies and raised taxes (though both moves were later reversed). And after the tax policy flip-flops by President Nicolas Sarkozy over the past five years -- he gave the wealthy tax breaks only to raise taxes two years later -- many in France see their own market is too volatile, and are searching for a safe haven.
The flagging euro and the economic struggles in Greece, Italy and Spain have only further shaken their confidence in investing at home. Last month, a Parisian couple in their 50s decided to buy a $4 million waterfront house in Miami after first considering Cannes, said Christophe Bourreau, a French broker with Barnes International who is now based in New York.
''They feel like the new president is hunting the wealthy,'' Mr. Bourreau said, ''and that the sooner their money is out of France the better.'' The window may close soon: Mr. Hollande has said he will look to put his tax plans in place this summer, after parliamentary elections next month.
Many in the new wave of French buyers who have descended on Manhattan are focused on finding something downtown and have been frustrated by the lack of inventory, said Edward Johnston, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens. Others are looking near Central Park and Columbus Circle, with buildings like the Sheffield, at 322 West 57th Street, and the Setai Fifth Avenue drawing multiple visits, brokers said.
Deborah Gimelson, another broker at Brown Harris Stevens, said that in the last two weeks she had shown three different French bankers a duplex town house in the East Village that she is co-listing for $2.95 million. One made an offer on the home but was outbid, she said.
She said she suspected that the property itself -- with an enclosed porch that looks out on a garden that ''feels like parts of Paris,'' she said -- had something to do with the visits. But they were the first French buyers she had seen in 10 years.
''Whether they are French, Italian or Greek,'' she said, ''people from Europe want to put their money here. We are seeing a lot more people come out of those countries than in a long time.''
Mr. Johnston says the city is seeing a ''massive influx of people'' from France. He has taken five groups on visits since the beginning of the year. ''They are serious buyers,'' he said, although ''they are not quick to act.''
Mr. Pous-Bertran de Balanda said he had about 20 French clients looking for condo apartments to buy in New York. He has been suggesting that they consider the Trump SoHo, the hotel-condo property. It offers ''fractional occupancy'' to owners, who can use the apartment for up to 120 days a year and have it rented out as a hotel suite the rest of the year.
The French invasion is poised to give Trump SoHo a needed boost. The 46-story project has been a source of tension in SoHo. Some residents have grumbled that it is an out-of-place abomination, towering over the surrounding low-rise structures. Amy Williamson, the development's vice president for sales, said Donald J. Trump had taken advantage of a zoning loophole that had not anticipated the ''hybrid'' between a commercial and a residential building, enabling it to be built to 46 stories.
Trump SoHo has done well as a hotel, Ms. Williamson said. But it has struggled as a condominium development. About a quarter of the 391 residences have been sold or are under contract since 2007, she said. Prices range from studios starting at $995,000 to penthouse suites starting at $2,966,250.
No French buyers have signed on the dotted line, but Ms. Williamson is confident that several purchases are imminent, particularly in view of the French election. ''The people that were originally looking have now reaccelerated their interest,'' she said.
Ms. Williamson is planning to travel with Mr. Pous-Bertran de Balanda in late June on a Trump SoHo road show to Geneva, Luxembourg and Paris.
He has been living in New York for only two years, yet Mr. Pous-Bertran de Balanda has deeper ties to North America than most Americans.
His ancestor Francois Bertran de Palmarolle served as a French general in the American Revolution. The general's father, Francois-Charles Bertran de Palmarolle, died on the battlefield in Canada during the Seven Years' War. The town of Palmarolle in Quebec was named after the Frenchman, who is buried there.
Of course, preserving the French noble family meant pulling out when the going got tough. When the revolution against Louis XVI started, Mr. Pous-Bertran de Balanda's family emigrated to Spain for five years. Most of them returned when the nobility was reorganized under Napoleon, he said.
Some stayed behind in Spain for good. Now Mr. Pous-Bertran de Balanda, who met his French wife in New York, is considering becoming an American citizen and staying for the foreseeable future. In his circle, at least, he is not alone.
''I have met a lot of French expatriates who are considering the option to stay in the U.S. for at least five years,'' he said. ''They just want to wait, to wait and see what happens in France with taxes.''

SALT LAKE CITY -- The Wasatch Range, towering over an arid, urban sprawl of a million people, provides two important assets that are increasingly at odds -- a vital supply of water for residents and pristine snow for a ski industry that rakes in $1.2 billion a year.
Now, two competing bills in Congress are setting up a new skirmish in the West's perennial battle between conservation and development. 
One bill, involving an ambitious project known as SkiLink, was filed by Representative Rob Bishop, a Republican from northern Utah. It would allow developers to bypass some jurisdictional and environmental protections to build a gondola linking the base of the Solitude ski area in Salt Lake County and the upper part of the Canyons ski area in Summit County.
The bill would override some federal and local restrictions on ski areas in the Wasatch Range and would require the United States Forest Service to sell 30 acres of public land to accommodate SkiLink.
The competing bill, the Wasatch Wilderness and Watershed Protection Act, was created after two years of public meetings and was introduced by Representative Jim Matheson, a Democrat who represents the area. It would preserve the same tract of Forest Service land for its ''wilderness quality'' and watershed.
For more than 100 years, the towering range has been protected as a watershed. Expansions of ski areas in the central Wasatch are not allowed under multiple jurisdictional management plans, which the resorts say inhibit their ability to compete.
Ski areas now cover 6,294 acres of the central Wasatch, though Mr. Bishop's legislation could create a legal precedent that could pave the way to more than double that, encompassing the watershed's headwaters and affecting Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons, which are home to four ski areas and supply 60 percent of Salt Lake City's water.
Seven ski areas -- on both the western and eastern slopes of the Wasatch -- are nearby, and two share boundaries. Nathan Rafferty, the president of Ski Utah, an industry coalition, dreams of connecting all seven of them -- a ''Super Seven connection,'' he calls it. Last month, the Salt Lake City Chamber of Commerce started a new coalition, Lift Utah, supporting SkiLink as a first step to realizing that goal.
''An interconnection would boost the ski industry tremendously,'' said State Senator Wayne L. Niederhauser, a Republican who is sponsoring a state resolution supporting the concept. ''This will be a game changer. There's nothing like this in the United States.''
SkiLink's opponents, though, say the project goes beyond providing a way to link the areas and would open the door to an increase in acreage for ski slopes.
Jeff Niermeyer, the director of Salt Lake City Public Utilities, one of the agencies responsible for watershed protection, recently stood over a map in his office showing 11 additional proposed ski area expansions beyond SkiLink. ''It's the cumulative effect of expansion that we are worried about,'' he said.
Mr. Niermeyer said the watershed was so sensitive that a water treatment plant must be shut down whenever there is digging in Big Cottonwood Creek.
Proponents and critics of SkiLink differ sharply over how the project would affect the watershed and the region. Salt Lake City's two major newspapers have split on the project.
Mark Menlove, a former head of Ski Utah, said the Wasatch already had ''a good balance between ski resorts and backcountry skiing, and something of the magnitude of SkiLink would forever alter that and certainly make the Central Wasatch less attractive to backcountry skiers.''
Mike Goar, the managing director of Canyons Resort, said the proposed SkiLink gondola would be suspended along more than 20 towers ranging from 20 to 40 feet tall and would move a thousand people an hour on the 11-minute ride across nearly three miles. He said it could be built in one summer.
A 2010 preliminary study prepared for the Talisker Corporation, which owns the Canyons ski area, predicted a $51 million increase in the state's economy in SkiLink's first year, creating jobs and revenue that would go up in future years.
The study put the cost of building the system at $35 million, though Mr. Goar said in a recent interview that the cost would be $10 million. Talisker officials declined to comment.
A similar debate over public land before the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City could offer a clue, critics of the project say, to how developers might try to break the limits that Salt Lake County, Salt Lake City and the United States Forest Service have imposed on development in the watershed.
In that controversy, Earl Holding, the owner of the Snowbasin ski area, pressed the Forest Service to privatize land at the base so he could build a lodge. Ultimately, Utah's Congressional delegation championed a bill for a land swap, arguing that the new development was needed to host the 2002 Olympics.
On the 10th anniversary of the Salt Lake City Games, an exploratory committee was formed to consider a bid for the 2022 or 2026 Winter Games. Whether the drive to attract the Games will again become a factor in the battle over skiing and public lands is worrying to environmentalists.
''There is little doubt in my mind that these two things will be brought together, just as it was in the case of Snowbasin,'' said Gale Dick, a founder of Save Our Canyons, a nonprofit group whose goal is to protect the Wasatch Range. ''As the night followeth the day, it is just absolutely certain that this will come to pass.''

HEADLINE: The Emotional Tug of Obama

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
FORGET your political affiliation. Never mind your assessment of his time in office so far. If you have any kind of heart, you're struck by it: the photograph of Barack Obama bent down so that a young black boy can touch his head and see if the president's hair is indeed like his own. It moves you. It also speaks to a way in which Obama and Mitt Romney, whose campaigns are picking up the pace just as polls show them neck and neck, are profoundly mismatched.
In a story that quickly went viral, The Times's Jackie Calmes wrote last week about the photograph, which was taken three years ago when the boy, then 5, visited the White House. It has hung there ever since, left on the wall even as other pictures were swapped out, as is the custom, for newer, fresher ones. 
David Axelrod, one of the chief architects of Obama's political career, told Calmes: ''It doesn't take a big leap to think that child could be thinking, 'Maybe I could be here someday.' This can be such a cynical business, and then there are moments like that that just remind you that it's worth it.''
Axelrod's words, meanwhile, are a reminder that more than three and a half years after Obama made history as the first black man elected to the presidency, he still presents more than a resume and an agenda. He still personifies the hope, to borrow a noun that he has used, that we really might evolve into the colorblind, fair-minded country that many of us want. His own saga taps into the larger story of this country's fitful, unfinished progress toward its stated ideal of equal opportunity.
And that gives many voters an emotional connection to him that they simply don't have to most other politicians, including Romney, a privileged and intensely private man whose strengths don't include the easy ability to humanize himself. There's a Mitt-versus-myth element to the 2012 campaign, and it influences the manner in which Romney's supporters and Romney himself engage the president and make their pitch. They must and do emphasize job-creation numbers over personal narrative, the technocratic over the touchy-feely.
Obama and his advisers don't exactly tack in the opposite direction. Understandably concerned about longstanding prejudices, they don't invoke his racial identity all that frequently.
But when they do, it's powerful. The photograph released last week instantly reminded me of one taken in mid-April, when Obama visited a museum in Dearborn, Mich. It showed him seated in the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. And it, too, pinged fast and far around the Web.
Although race represents a less central dynamic for Obama now than it did in 2008, it's a factor in his political fortunes nonetheless. It poisons some of his opponents, pumping them full of a toxic zeal beyond the partisan norm. How else to explain their obsession with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright or the lunatic persistence of the ''birthers,'' including the Arizona secretary of state, who didn't drop his threat to keep Obama off the state ballot until Wednesday? Even as he quieted down, Donald Trump piped up, raising questions yet again about where Obama was born, though Trump's motivations are surely less racist than narcissistic, even entrepreneurial. For him attention is attention and ratings are ratings, no matter how repulsively drummed up.
BUT race is also a central theme -- the central theme -- in Obama's own telling of his journey. It's how he explains where he has come from and how far he has traveled. His best-selling memoir, ''Dreams From My Father,'' is subtitled ''A Story of Race and Inheritance.'' In the first sentences of his keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, he noted that his ''presence on this stage is pretty unlikely'' and that his father was ''born and raised in a small village in Kenya.''
Race is the obstacle he has overcome, the trail he has blazed. And that, I think, is what Geraldine Ferraro, a supporter of Hillary Clinton's, was clumsily trying to get at during the Democratic primaries in 2008, when she drew attention to the color of Obama's skin and said that he ''happens to be very lucky to be who he is.''
Although Romney would be the first Mormon president, that milestone doesn't fit into the country's history in the same way. Although his religion, like Obama's race, has made him an outsider in certain circumstances and at certain times, that's not something he or his supporters really promote.
And to a degree that's striking in the age of Oprah, he hasn't succeeded in rummaging through his biography for the sorts of broadly inspirational chapters that can help a candidate bond with voters. Even George W. Bush, another child of privilege and political scion, had his tale of midlife remorse and redemption: an end to drinking, a beginning of Bible study. Romney has ... the Salt Lake City Olympics?
On top of which, he seems to be congenitally closed-off and palpably awkward about transforming the personal into the political. He has five sons, all shepherded safely into adulthood. But he hasn't mined fatherhood for memorable material. And Ann Romney has spoken more poignantly about his support for her in her illness than he has managed to.
In the end, that may not make a whit of difference. If swing voters were driven chiefly by candidates' biographies, political analysts trying to predict election outcomes wouldn't dwell so much on external measures like unemployment figures and right-track, wrong-track numbers. And if eloquence alone won the day, then these two candidates' advocates wouldn't believe, as more than a few of them do, that after all the speechifying and fund-raising and advertising, the results will boil down to positive or negative economic developments outside either man's -- or either campaign's -- control.
But if there are no clear developments one way or the other? If there's an ongoing recovery, but a meager, tentative one at that? Then the spoils will most likely go to the candidate who makes the better case for himself. And that's a battle over more than Bain Capital, the Keystone XL pipeline and the individual mandate. That's a war for hearts as well.

HEADLINE: Land of Cheese and Rancor

BYLINE: By DAN KAUFMAN

 BODY:
This past March, standing outside a Shell station in Mellen, Wis., in the state's far north, Mike Wiggins Jr. told me about a series of dark and premonitory dreams he had two years earlier. ''One of them was a very vivid trip around the North Woods and seeing forests bleeding and sludge from a creek emptying into the Bad River,'' Wiggins said. ''I ended up at a dilapidated northern log home with rotten snowshoes falling off the wall. I stepped out of the lodge, walked through some pine, and I was in a pipeline. There was a big pipe coming in and out of the ground as far as I could see. 
''I had no idea what the hell that was all about,'' Wiggins continued. But he said the dream became clearer when a stranger named Matt Fifield came into his office several months later and handed him his card. Wiggins is the chairman of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, and Fifield, the managing director of Gogebic Taconite (GTac), a division of the Cline Group, a mining company based in Florida. He had come to Wiggins's office to discuss GTac's desire to build a $1.5 billion open-pit iron-ore mine in the Penokee Hills, about seven miles south of the Bad River reservation. The proposed mine would be several hundred feet deep, roughly four miles long and a half-mile wide; the company estimated it would bring 700 long-term jobs to the area. Fearing contamination of the local groundwater and pristine rivers, Wiggins told Fifield he planned to oppose the mine. He didn't know at the time that the company's lawyers would be working hand in hand with Republican legislators to draft a bill that would weaken Wisconsin environmental law and expedite the permitting process.
What followed was a drawn-out fight that resembled other statewide battles over labor, education and voter-registration laws -- all of which have been introduced since the election of the Republican governor Scott Walker in 2010. The most bitter of these fights began in early February last year, when Walker proposed eliminating virtually all collective-bargaining rights for a vast majority of the state's public-employee unions. Around the time that Walker announced the measure, similar laws were introduced in Michigan, Ohio and Florida, and a nationwide demonization of public employees caught fire. Within two months, the National Conference of State Legislators had tracked more than 100 bills, initiated across the country, attacking public-sector unions.
From the beginning, Walker, who declined to comment for this article, seemed cognizant that his move to end collective bargaining placed him at the forefront of a national conservative strategy. His attack on public-employee unions was lauded by Mitt Romney, John Boehner and Karl Rove, and he has received significant financial support from the billionaire conservative donors Charles and David Koch. In a widely publicized prank phone call with Ian Murphy, a blogger impersonating David Koch, Walker described a dinner he held for his cabinet at his Executive Residence on Feb. 10, the night before he announced the collective-bargaining measure. ''It was kind of the last hurrah, before we dropped the bomb,'' he said to the faux-Koch. At the dinner, Walker held up a photograph of Ronald Reagan and told his cabinet that what they were about to do recalled Reagan's breaking of the air-traffic-controllers' union strike in 1981. ''This is our time to change the course of history,'' Walker said.
Act 10, the bill that included the collective-bargaining measure, eventually passed last March despite widespread demonstrations at the State Capitol, an occupation of the building by protesters, the decamping of 14 Democratic state senators to Illinois for three weeks and numerous legal challenges. According to recent polling, Wisconsin, once known for progressive policy and upper-Midwestern civility, is now the most politically polarized state in the nation. Last June, David Prosser, a State Supreme Court justice, was accused of choking a colleague in her office after an argument over the court's deliberations on Act 10. Bill Kramer, the Republican speaker pro tem of the Assembly, recently told a reporter that at times he finds it necessary to bring his Glock semiautomatic handgun to work, owing to the atmosphere in the State Capitol. (A new conceal-and-carry law permits concealed weapons even on the Assembly floor.) The protest movement the bill spawned, which shows no signs of abating, culminates in a June 5 recall election against Walker and four Republican state senators. If Walker loses, he would be only the third governor in American history to be recalled.
''There is tremendous frustration with the influence of out-of-state organizations and out-of-state money,'' Lisa Graves, the executive director of the Madison-based Center for Media and Democracy, told me when I spoke with her this spring. ''Wisconsin has an identity, the Wisconsin Idea, that is based on the notion that legislation should help as many people as possible.'' In February, David Koch gave $1 million to the Republican Governors Association, which is spending heavily to fight Walker's recall campaign, and that same month he praised Walker's anti-union legislation in The Palm Beach Post. ''We're helping him, as we should,'' Koch said. ''We've spent a lot of money in Wisconsin. We're going to spend more.'' Walker has raised more than $25 million for his campaign, 60 percent of it from outside the state, while his Democratic opponent, Tom Barrett, the mayor of Milwaukee (whom Walker defeated in a regular election less than two years ago), has raised less than $1 million. ''Wisconsin used to be the beacon of clean and open and honest government,'' Mike McCabe, the head of the nonpartisan Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks money in politics, told me. ''We are now just a pawn on a national chessboard.''
During a late-night session in early March, I sat in the gallery and watched the Assembly debate a bill referred to as the Special Needs Scholarship Act. The bill's lead sponsor, Michelle Litjens, is a freshman representative from the Appleton area and also a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a Washington-based organization that brings together corporations, legislators and interest groups to draft and disseminate model legislation for state legislatures around the country. Litjens's bill, AB 110, includes key provisions of an ALEC-model bill that has already passed in Georgia. It would provide up to an estimated $13,500 in taxpayer-financed scholarships for children with disabilities to attend private schools or schools outside their districts. The scholarships would be available to no more than 5 percent of the state's disabled children. The money for the program, as much as $80 million if the full 5 percent applied, would be drained from the public-school budget.
Of the 36 sponsors and co-sponsors of Litjens's bill, 25 were ALEC members. Mark Pocan is one of the few ALEC members who did not co-sponsor the bill. A liberal Democrat from Madison, Pocan became a member of ALEC several years ago. He told me he wanted to draw attention to the organization's unseen effect on Wisconsin's legislation. In his floor speech that night, Pocan described an ALEC conference in New Orleans that he attended last summer. ''I remember going to a workshop and hearing a little bit about a bill they did in Florida and some other states to dismantle public education,'' Pocan said. ''There was a proposal to provide special-needs scholarships. Lo and behold, all of a sudden I come back to Wisconsin, and what gets introduced? A bill to do just that.''
The next day, Pocan outlined a strategy ALEC advises its members to use: ''You have to introduce a 14-point platform,'' he said, ''so that you can make it harder for them to focus and for the press to cover 14 different planks.'' He pointed to several bills introduced in the past two sessions, including one that allows more children to enroll in virtual charter schools. ''It sounds good,'' Pocan said. ''Kids could access virtual schools for home schooling. But again,'' he emphasized, the real purpose is ''taking apart public schools, drip by drip.''
Scott Suder, the Assembly majority leader and a state co-chairman of ALEC, defended the group's work. ''ALEC's basis is free-market, Jeffersonian principles,'' Suder told me over the phone. ''That's my core philosophy: getting government out of the way as much as possible.''
Besides education, ALEC maintains seven other wide-ranging task forces, like ''Tax and Fiscal Policy'' and ''Energy, Environment and Agriculture,'' which promotes, among other things, legislation opposing climate-change initiatives. The group has recently come under scrutiny, largely because of the work of the Center for Media and Democracy. There was widespread outrage over ALEC's role in exporting the ''Stand Your Ground'' law, at the center of the controversy over the death of Trayvon Martin, to other states -- including a related bill that recently passed in Wisconsin. Since the Martin shooting, several large corporations, Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart among them, have ended their affiliation with ALEC. I asked Pocan if the increased exposure has stopped any ALEC-originated bills in the State Assembly. ''Not really,'' he said. ''They get really good strategic advice. The head of Shell Oil flew out to New Orleans to meet with legislators.''
After signing Act 10, Governor Walker told a reporter for The Associated Press that the bill was ''innovative'' and ''progressive'' -- words chosen perhaps because they resonate with the enduring pride many Wisconsin citizens still feel about their state's pioneering political history. The current Wisconsin Blue Book contains a 68-page essay extolling the achievements of the 1911 Legislature, which included the establishment of the first workmen's-compensation program, laws limiting labor for women and children and the passage of a forest-conservation act. President Theodore Roosevelt described Wisconsin as a ''laboratory for wise, experimental legislation to secure the social and political betterment of the people as a whole.'' Native icons like the populist senator and governor Robert (Fighting Bob) La Follette and the conservationist Aldo Leopold still loom in the state's collective consciousness and legislative record. More recently, Senator Russ Feingold cast the lone vote against the U.S.A. Patriot Act in 2001.
The law that Act 10 overturned had been in place since 1959, when Wisconsin became the first state to recognize collective-bargaining rights for municipal employees. Senator Fred Risser, who began his legislative career in 1956, is the country's longest-serving state legislator, and he was on the committee that introduced that measure. ''That bill was bipartisan, or it would have never gotten through in the first place,'' he said. In 1967, collective bargaining was expanded under the Republican governor Warren P. Knowles to include state employees. The Senate voted 31-0 in favor of the expansion. ''For 50 years we had relative labor peace,'' Risser said. ''Not in 50 years was there ever a partisan vote on those contracts. They were almost always unanimously accepted.''
Some Republicans also lamented the end of the long bipartisan consensus on labor rights. Dick Spanbauer, a former Marine and self-described ''pro-life, pro-family Christian,'' was one of four Republican Assemblymen to vote against Act 10. ''The leadership told me, 'Dick, we don't need unions anymore,' '' he told me. ''Really? What's changed? Is a company going to say you don't need to work 12 hours?'' Spanbauer, like his father, had worked much of his adult life in factories in Oshkosh. ''They don't understand anything about the working class,'' he said about his Republican colleagues. ''They thought you could just go crush somebody's voice and get away with it.'' Spanbauer is retiring this year.
Like most other states, Wisconsin was hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession. Walker inherited a budget gap of $137 million and a potential $3.6 billion shortfall over the following two years. Before he introduced Act 10, however, he passed a series of future tax cuts worth $142 million. Shortly after the budget bill was announced, nearly all the unions agreed to implement the financial concessions Walker requested in exchange for keeping their bargaining rights.
When Tracy Fuller, a state patrol officer and the president of the Wisconsin Law Enforcement Association, first heard about the collective-bargaining ban, he was shocked. ''It went far beyond what I thought Walker campaigned on,'' Fuller said. ''You want to freeze our pay? It's been frozen for six years. You want to freeze it again? O.K. But don't take away our bargaining rights.'' Fuller's union, which is self-run and focuses almost entirely on workplace issues, represents the state patrol, Capitol police, University of Wisconsin police and some Department of Motor Vehicles employees. The union faces an unusual predicament: two-thirds of its members lost their bargaining rights, while those in the state patrol retained theirs. ''The other members were resentful of the troopers for a while,'' Fuller said. ''Their morale is so down.''
The protests against Act 10 inspired opposition to similar laws in Michigan and Ohio and marked the first significant push back to the surging Tea Party. Few in Wisconsin are more identified with the grass-roots resistance than Lori Compas, a 41-year-old wedding photographer and mother of two. With no assistance from the state Democratic Party, Compas led an unlikely yet successful drive to recall the Senate majority leader, Scott Fitzgerald, Walker's most essential and visible ally. Compas lives in Fort Atkinson, a small town 30 miles east of Madison, and has never run for office before. She is now Fitzgerald's improbable opponent in the coming June recall election.
In early March, I met her for lunch at the Cafe Carpe, a sunny restaurant and folk club that doubles as the town's informal community center. Compas majored in agricultural journalism in college and moved to Fort Atkinson five years ago with her husband, a geography professor at a small state university nearby. ''I had never paid attention to state politics until about a year ago,'' she said. ''I started paying attention, and I got really upset at what I saw our senator doing.''
For Compas, the pivotal moment came when the collective-bargaining measure was passed. On March 9, 2011, Scott Fitzgerald led a hastily called meeting of the Senate and Assembly leadership. A few days earlier, the Assembly voted on the budget-repair bill that included the collective-bargaining measure, but the Senate had been unable to pass it because of a rule requiring a quorum of 20 members to vote on fiscal measures. At that point, the 14 Senate Democrats were still in hiding in Illinois, leaving the Republicans with just 19 votes. After attempts at persuasion and withholding their paychecks failed to bring the Democrats back, Senate Republicans decided to separate the collective-bargaining measure from the budget bill and vote on it immediately.
During the meeting, a heated argument erupted between Fitzgerald and Peter Barca, the Assembly minority leader. ''I said I wanted an explanation of what's in this document, so I can at least know what I'm voting on,'' Barca told me. He had been handed a 37-page summary of the bill, not the bill itself. Fitzgerald ignored his request and, five minutes later, called the roll. By a 4-0 vote the committee separated the measure from the budget bill. It was then passed by both houses within hours. ''I said, 'I just want to make you aware that this meeting is a violation of the open meetings law,' '' Barca said he told Fitzgerald, who called the meeting less than two hours before. (Under Wisconsin law, a government body is generally required to give 24 hours notice to the public before it meets.) The exchange was captured on WisconsinEye, a local version of C-Span, and went viral.
''Barca's standing there yelling, 'This is a violation of the law!' '' Compas said. ''I just sat there, and I cried. I've never felt so powerless and so frustrated. Regardless of where you stood on this issue, the complete contempt that Fitzgerald was showing for his legislators was unacceptable. That night I think I tweeted: 'I will recall Scott Fitzgerald if I have to crawl on my hands and knees through the snow to every house in his district.' ''
When I met with Fitzgerald in March and asked him if, looking back, he would have done anything differently during the long collective-bargaining fight, he said: ''I felt like I was flying by the seat of my pants. We handled events as they evolved.''
Wisconsin law allows for the recall of elected officials if they have served at least one year in office and if petitioners gather signatures equaling one-quarter of the total votes cast in the previous election. Despite Fitzgerald's prominent role in shepherding Walker's agenda through the Senate, the Wisconsin Democratic Party chose not to pursue a recall campaign against him. Fitzgerald's district is solidly Republican, and he won his last election with two-thirds of the vote. Most political observers maintained that it would have been a waste of resources to try to get the more than 16,000 signatures required to force a recall election.
''I just decided I'm going to start looking into this,'' Compas said. ''My husband takes the kids to school on Friday, and that's my day to just be home and focus on my business. They all left, and the house got quiet.'' She decided to call the Government Accountability Board. ''I asked: 'What does a person need to file recall papers? Do they need a team of attorneys and accountants and all that?' '' She learned that any citizen could file for a recall, and that afternoon, Compas designed her petition and set up a Web site, a Facebook page and a Twitter account. When her husband came home, he was startled to find the change in her. ''He was actually a little upset,'' she said. ''He was saying, 'I left for work and it was a normal Friday, and I come home and you're recalling the Senate majority leader.' ''
A few days after we met, I watched Compas speak before a large rally at the State Capitol in Madison. The rally marked the one-year anniversary of the passage of Act 10, and organizers estimated that more than 60,000 people attended. Standing halfway up the building's steps, I could see the surrounding streets filled with protesters and signs. The most ubiquitous was a clenched blue fist in the shape of the state map, the movement's unofficial symbol. One of Compas's friends had written her speech, but the day before, Compas decided to start from scratch. She told the crowd that Fitzgerald's recall election had been certified the day before, and then she talked about how she had seen the first sandhill cranes of spring the same day. ''Every year their return tells me that even after the most difficult winters, new life is stirring,'' she said. ''Those two things just kind of came together in my mind overnight.''
A few days later, Compas appeared at the public library in Fort Atkinson. She'd held eight public meetings over the past two weeks, and one of them, in Lake Mills, was fairly contentious. ''I'm not used to hatred being directed at me,'' she said. ''There were 10 people in that room who hated me, and they never met me.'' She was relieved to be back home, and with the exception of some polite but pointed questions from several College Republicans, the event seemed almost sedate. After the session, Compas and a few of her supporters wandered over to the Cafe Carpe. A community meeting was finishing up in the back, and one of the people leaving was Barbara Lorman, the district's former Republican state senator. In 1994, Lorman lost in a Republican primary to Scott Fitzgerald.
''There's always partisanship,'' Lorman said, as Compas and her entourage gathered around her. ''When I was first elected in 1980, I thought: It's them against us. These Democrats are the enemy, so I need to stay cool about them. Then you see them all going out for dinner together and drinking together and sitting in each other's office, and I thought, What's the deal here?It was quite collegial. You go to the floor, you have your issues, you have your rhetoric and your disagreements, but at the end of the day you leave it behind. Things are not like that now.''
Like many other Wisconsinites, Lorman was surprised when the collective-bargaining measure was introduced. ''It was like being blindsided,'' she said. ''Walker's agenda, which was always there but nobody knew it, really came from somewhere else, like the Koch brothers, the national party and ALEC. I don't think it was a local agenda, frankly.'' Lorman used to own a scrap-iron plant and years ago fought an effort by the Teamsters to unionize her small group of drivers. ''I might not be a union lover. There's a lot wrong with unions -- a lot. But I do believe in a right to bargain collectively. In a lot of cases it's what you need, it's what works.'' Lorman said she felt that Walker should have accepted the unions' financial givebacks in exchange for keeping their bargaining rights. ''He had everything he wanted,'' she said. ''They were making the concessions that everybody was asking for. Pay more for your retirement, pay more for your benefits.'' Lorman says she is supporting Compas in the coming election.
In March, Fitzgerald told me he wasn't taking Compas's challenge lightly, and he has raised more than $700,000 to defend his seat. Though he was leading comfortably in the most recent poll, last week he appeared a bit flustered, telling The Wisconsin State Journal that he believed Compas's husband and the unions were behind her effort. ''I don't for one minute believe she is the organizing force behind this whole thing,'' he said. In response, Compas posted an irreverent, sepia-toned video featuring herself as an obedient 1950s housewife asking her husband, ''What's a senator?''
Over the past year, the mining bill that Mike Wiggins was intent on stopping became increasingly significant to the Walker administration. During his campaign for governor in 2010, Walker promised to create 250,000 private-sector jobs, which he recently reaffirmed. According to the most recent monthly survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the state has lost more than 21,000 nonfarm jobs since April of last year. Despite Wisconsin's economic struggles, Walker has defended his decision to turn down $810 million in federal stimulus money for a proposed high-speed rail link between Madison and Milwaukee. By last summer, the economic situation in the state was continuing to deteriorate, and the mining bill had become a top priority in Walker's jobs program. It also managed to create a rare split in his broad-based opposition.
After GTac promised that most of the mining equipment would be built in Milwaukee with union labor, many of the large private trade unions backed the bill. Randy Bryce, the political coordinator of Milwaukee Iron Workers Local 8 and one of Walker's most tenacious opponents, reluctantly supported the legislation. ''They're trying to divide us,'' he told me, ''but my members need work.''
To Wiggins, a large open-pit mine in the Penokee Hills was a life-or-death matter for his tribe. The headwaters that feed the river would be in the footprint of the mine, and the Bad River reservation lies downstream. Wiggins was also worried about the tribe's sensitive wild-rice beds, which lie on the coast of Lake Superior. Cyrus Hester, who works for the tribe's Natural Resources Department, raised the possibility that sulfuric acid might contaminate the groundwater and harm fish populations in the area's rivers and streams.
''There's a very good reason this area has never been mined,'' George Meyer, the director of the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation and former head of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, told me. ''A lot of mining companies looked at it and walked away.'' For Meyer, one of the biggest problems with the site is that the ore sits at an angle, which when mined generates a much larger amount of ''overburden'' that needs to be discarded.
When I spoke with him in March, Wiggins detailed several meetings he had with Walker, in which he tried to convey how dire the mine would be for his reservation and the surrounding environment. Their last meeting, in September, turned particularly acrimonious. Beforehand, Wiggins held a news conference inside the Capitol outlining his opposition to the mining legislation. The Assembly bill would impose a 360-day deadline for the permitting process, where before there had been none, and it would eliminate hearings in which citizens or organizations can question mining or government officials under oath about the safety of the mine. Many of the key provisions in the Assembly bill were drafted by lawyers working for GTac.
''Walker saw the news conference as disingenuous,'' Wiggins said. ''When we got to the meeting, he was fixated on his anger with me.'' After some heated back and forth, Walker told Wiggins he didn't see the need for the meeting, since he had a copy of the tribe's news release. Wiggins got angry. ''You know, governor,'' he recalled, ''some of the things that are proposed in the mining initiative represent a catastrophic destruction for my reservation, health impacts to my people, and you think everything that you and I have to talk about is contained on one piece of paper right there?''
On March 6, the Senate narrowly voted to reject the Assembly's mining bill, 17-16. Dale Schultz, who was also the sole Senate Republican to vote against Act 10, joined the 16 Democrats in voting against the bill. Thus far it has been Walker's most significant political defeat. After the vote, GTac issued a brief statement that they were abandoning their interest in the Wisconsin mine. Before he took the vote, Fitzgerald thought he had one Milwaukee Democrat lined up to support the bill, and he still hoped he could persuade one. ''I would not rule out calling an extraordinary session,'' Fitzgerald said, ''if we could get a signal from the corporation and a 17th senator.''
A few days after the vote, Schultz invited me to his farm about 60 miles west of Madison, land that has been in his family for six generations. Schultz is an avid hunter, and as he poured me coffee, he described some of the animals -- grouse, wild turkey, even a bear -- that he has hunted throughout the state. A few days earlier, he gave a reading at an event honoring Aldo Leopold. ''I'm a guy who believes that the Leopold land ethic makes sense,'' Schultz said. ''It's about stewardship, but using resources wisely is O.K.''
Unemployment around Mellen, where the mine would be located, is significantly higher than the statewide average. But last fall, Schultz took part in a town-hall meeting there with Senator Bob Jauch, who represents the area, and a majority of the attendees registered their opposition to the Assembly bill. ''We want the mine; we fear the mine,'' Mellen's mayor, Joseph Barabe, said at the meeting. ''We have the most to lose.'' Schultz says he believes that a mine in the area is feasible, but radically changing long-established environmental law is unwise and contrary to the state's ethos. He developed a compromise bill with Jauch that sought to strike a balance between the state's conservationist traditions and the accommodations GTac sought, but it was described by Fitzgerald as a ''nonstarter'' and never brought up for a vote. Afterward, Fitzgerald admitted that perhaps the mining company, whose operations are mostly based in West Virginia and Illinois, had pushed too far for Wisconsin. ''I think the corporation and their attorneys drafted a bill that may have been acceptable in other states,'' he said.
Schultz was sympathetic to Wiggins and the Bad River Chippewa. ''For them, this place is like Bethlehem is for our Christians,'' he said. ''So they're obviously going to fiercely defend their territory. If you read some of the comments from Assembly members, they're saying, 'We don't have to listen to them.' So there is an unbelievable amount of anger and fear that's built up in the tribal community. When Mike first came to see me, I said: 'I'm for mining, and I know that you're never going to be for mining, and I understand that. But I want you to know I appreciate the fact that you're here.' That's how we began our relationship. I'm still for mining. He's not going to be for mining there, and I understand. And I would hope that he would be somewhat kind about his feelings toward me.''
The previous evening, I stood with Mike Wiggins on the coast of Lake Superior and talked about Schultz's role in staving off the mine. The civility that he demonstrated, the willingness to try to understand a different point of view -- it all stood in stark contrast to what has transpired in Wisconsin politics over the past year and a half. ''When I woke up this morning, I was thinking about Dale,'' Wiggins said as I was leaving. ''I probably shouldn't be saying this, but I had tears in my eyes.''

HEADLINE: Obama Should Seize the High Ground

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
DURING a recent discussion in Seattle with a group of educators, one of them surprised me when she pointed out that even though their state did not win President Obama's education ''Race to the Top,'' that program was critical in spurring education reform in Washington State. As I listened to her analysis, the thought occurred to me: I wonder how Barack Obama would do if he ran for president as himself. ... How he would do if he ran for re-election on all the things he's accomplished but rarely speaks about.
Barack Obama is a great orator, but he is the worst president I've ever seen when it comes to explaining his achievements, putting them in context, connecting with people on a gut level through repetition and thereby defining how the public views an issue. 
Think about this: Is there anyone in America today who doesn't either have a pre-existing medical condition or know someone who does and can't get health insurance as a result? Yet two years after Obama's health care bill became law, how many Americans understand that once it is fully implemented no American with a pre-existing condition will ever again be denied coverage?
''Obamacare is socialized medicine,'' says the Republican Party. No, no -- excuse me -- socialized medicine is what we have now! People without insurance can go to an emergency ward or throw themselves on the mercy of a doctor, and the cost of all this uncompensated care is shared by all those who have insurance, raising your rates and mine. That is socialized medicine and that is what Obamacare ends. Yet Obama -- the champion of private insurance for all -- has allowed himself to be painted as a health care socialist.
Think about this: Obama didn't just save the auto industry from bankruptcy. Two years later, he also got all the top U.S. automakers to agree to increase mileage for their vehicle fleets to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, from 27.5 m.p.g. today. As Popular Mechanics put it, this ''is the largest mandatory fuel economy increase in history.'' It will drive innovation, save money and make America less dependent on petro-dictators. Did you know Obama did this?
Finally, how did Obama ever allow this duality to take hold: ''The Bush tax cuts'' versus the ''Obama bailout''? It should have been ''the Bush deficit explosion'' and the ''Obama rescue.'' Sure, the deficit has increased under Obama. It was largely to save the country from going into a Depression after a Bush-era binge that included two wars -- which, for the first time in our history, we not only did not pay for with tax increases but instead accompanied with tax cuts -- plus a 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill that we could not afford, then or now. Congressional Democrats also had a hand in this, but the idea that Bush gets to skate off into history as a ''tax-cutter'' and not as a ''deficit buster'' is a travesty. You can't just blame Fox News. Obama has the bully pulpit.
But Obama is running even with Mitt Romney not simply because of what he didn't say, but also because of what he didn't do. As the former Obama budget director Peter Orszag notes, to get the economy moving again, what we've needed for the past two years is a plan of ''combined boldness'' -- another stimulus focused on infrastructure that would grow jobs and enhance productivity combined with a credible, bipartisan plan for trimming future growth in Medicare and Social Security and reforming taxes to get our long-term fiscal house in order, as the economy improves.
In short, we needed more stimulus paired with some version of the Simpson-Bowles deficit plan. It is highly unlikely that you could ''get one passed without the other, and you shouldn't want to anyway,'' said Orszag. Together they would launch the U.S. economy.
Obama, in fairness, tried a version of this with his ''grand bargain'' talks with the House speaker, John Boehner, but when those talks failed, Obama made a huge mistake. He should have gone straight to the country and repeated over and over: ''I have a plan that will create millions of jobs and send the stock market soaring -- near-term stimulus plus Simpson-Bowles -- and the Republicans are blocking it.''
Obama could have adapted Simpson-Bowles, but symbolically it was vital to embrace it in some form as his headline deficit plan, because it already enjoyed some G.O.P. support and strong backing from independents, who liked the way it forced both parties to compromise. Had Obama gone to the country with more near-term stimulus married to Simpson-Bowles, he would have owned the left, independents and center-right. It would have split the Republicans and provided a real alternative to the radical Paul Ryan-Romney plan.
Instead, Obama retreated to his left base, offered a stimulus without Simpson-Bowles and started talking about ''fairness.'' The result has been a muddled message that has alienated independent/center-right voters who put him over the top in 2008. Don't get me wrong: I want fairness, but fairness that comes from a growing economy and comprehensive tax reform not from redividing a shrinking pie.
In sum, Obama's campaign right now feels as though it were made in a test tube by political consultants. It's not the Obama we admire. Rather than pounding the country with ''I have a plan'' -- a rebuilding stimulus plus Simpson-Bowles -- which would be an Obama-like message of hope, leadership and unity that would put him on higher ground that Romney can't reach because of the radical G.O.P. base, Obama is selling poll-tested wedge issues. I don't think it's a winner for him or America.

LAND OF PROMISE
An Economic History of the United States
By Michael Lind
586 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $29.99.
Whatever their political party, American leaders have generally subscribed to one of two competing economic philosophies. One is a small-government Jeffersonian perspective that abhors bigness and holds that prosperity flows from competition among independent businessmen, farmers and other producers. The other is a Hamiltonian agenda that believes a large, powerful country needs large, powerful organizations. The most important of those organizations is the federal government, which serves as a crucial partner to private enterprise, building roads and schools, guaranteeing loans and financing scientific research in ways that individual businesses would not.
Today, of course, Republicans are the Jeffersonians and Democrats are the Hamiltonians. But it hasn't always been so. The Jeffersonian line includes Andrew Jackson, the leaders of the Confederacy, William Jennings Bryan, Louis Brandeis, Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan. The Hamiltonian line includes George Washington, Henry Clay, Abraham Lincoln, William McKinley, both Roosevelts and Dwight Eisenhower. 
Michael Lind's ''Land of Promise'' uses this divide to offer an ambitious economic history of the United States. The book is rich with details, more than a few of them surprising, and its subject is central to what is arguably the single most important question facing the country today: How can our economy grow more quickly, more sustainably and more equitably than it has been growing, both to maintain the United States' position as the world's pre-eminent power and to improve the lives of its citizens?
Lind, a founder of the New America Foundation in Washington and the author of several political histories, acknowl/edges from the beginning that his thesis will make some readers uncomfortable. ''In the spirit of philosophical bipartisanship, it would be pleasant to conclude that each of these traditions of political economy has made its own valuable contribution to the success of the American economy and that the vector created by these opposing forces has been more beneficial than the complete victory of either would have been,'' he writes.
''But that would not be true,'' he continues. ''What is good about the American economy is largely the result of the Hamiltonian developmental tradition, and what is bad about it is largely the result of the Jeffersonian producerist school.''
Hamiltonian development built the Erie Canal, the transcontinental railroad, the land-grant universities and the Interstate highway system. In the process, the United States became a giant, interconnected market, a place where companies like Standard Oil, General Motors, John Deere and Sears Roebuck could thrive. The government -- and the American military in particular -- also played the most important role in financing innovation at its early stages. The industries that produced the jet engine, the radio (and, by extension, the television), radar, penicillin, synthetic rubber and semiconductors all stemmed from /government-financed research or procurement. The Defense Department literally built the Internet.
The United States is like ''a gigantic boiler,'' Sir Edward Grey, a British foreign secretary during World War I, said, according to Winston Churchill. ''Once the fire is lighted under it, there is no limit to the power it can generate.'' Lind's aim is to make Sir Edward's point in the active voice: the government has often lighted the flame, and big business has often generated the power.
And Lind has a strong case to make. He cleverly notes that Jeffersonians themselves often have a change of heart when they find themselves running the country and responsible for its well-being. As president, Jefferson altered his position on federal support for canals, roads and manufacturers. His successor, James Madison, signed a bill creating a national bank, having previously denounced the idea. The leaders of the Confederacy, after decrying centralized power, realized they needed an economic machine to finance a war and started ''a crash program of state-guided industrialization from above that was more Hamiltonian than Hamilton,'' Lind writes. Modern Jeffersonians, like Reagan and George W. Bush, have campaigned on spending cuts, only to expand government while in office.
For all its logical rigor, however, the book's thesis does suffer from one basic flaw. Lind never quite explains how the United States has ended up as the richest large country in the world, with per capita income about 20 percent higher than Sweden's or Canada's, almost 30 percent higher than Germany's and almost 500 percent higher than China's. If anything, other countries have pursued more Hamiltonian policies in many ways than the United States, without quite the same success.
What, then, can explain American economic exceptionalism? Education plays an important role (and receives only sporadic mention in the book). This country long had the most educated, skilled work force in the world, which, as other economic histories have persuasively shown, helped American workers to be among the best paid.
Beyond education, the United States also has a culture that is arguably different from that of any other power -- more individualistic, more risk-taking, more comfortable with the workings of the market. If you were looking for a name for this culture, you might choose Jeffersonian.
Lind, I expect, would dispute that a Jeffersonian culture has played a major role in creating prosperity. Yet readers will emerge from the 586 pages of ''Land of Promise,'' despite its many charms, without hearing an argument that fully engages with its opponents.
American economic history, in Lind's telling, has been a series of three revolutions and counterrevolutions, with each revolution tied to an actual war. The economic decision that awaited the victorious founders in the 1780s was whether to create a system that complemented the British economy by providing resources for Britain's emerging industries and customers for its products, or to create a full-blown national competitor.
Southerners, understandably, preferred a partnership, since they had the resources, particularly cotton. The Southern view was also informed by centuries of history in which global living standards had been largely unchanged. In this zero-sum, Malthusian world, a simple agrarian economy made sense. It seemed to maximize individual freedom and avoid the pollution and concentration of power that industry brought. ''While we have land to labor,'' Jefferson wrote in 1782, ''let us never wish to see our citizens occupied at a workbench.''
Hamiltonians put more faith in economic change and progress. They subscribed to the ideas of John Locke, the pre-/eminent political philosopher of the American Revolution, in which military power stemmed from economic growth and population growth. Hamiltonians encouraged the immigration of inventors and skilled workers (Hamilton himself was an immigrant) and pushed public support for infant industries as well as tariffs to protect them. They also advocated a modern, centralized financial system to pay for the needed investments.
The grander ambitions of the Hamiltonians largely won out, but the victory was temporary. Even as the country benefited enormously, some people did not. The changes also threatened entrenched interests and stoked classically American fears of centralization. Soon Andrew Jackson, more Jeffersonian than the namesake, was on the counterattack, opposing federal road building and closing the national bank.
These cycles have continued, more or less, for 200 years. Lincoln -- a state legislator during Jackson's time who fought for federal investment -- was the great Hamiltonian of the 19th century. After the South left the Union, Lincoln, with the backing of Congress, was able to undertake an investment bonanza that Southern representatives had blocked, building rail lines, roads and colleges. Many of these programs would ultimately help industrialize the South.
Hamiltonians, obviously, did not always make the right investments. The first aviator the federal government backed was Samuel Pierpont Langley, the director of the Smithsonian Institution, whose test flights crashed into the Potomac. But the cost of such failures paled next to the returns of the successes. The military soon became the Wright brothers' first client and allowed them, and American aviation more generally, to flourish before a private market for it existed.
Among the joys of Lind's book are small, little-known stories like the one about the Wright brothers that have clear relevance today. I expect I will be returning to the index of ''Land of Promise'' with some frequency. Another joy is Lind's attempt to rehabilitate figures to whom history has not been kind. McKinley may have had some cronyism problems, yet he also fought to modernize the American economy and was ahead of his time on civil rights. Wall Street tycoons of the 19th century like J. P. Morgan may have been rapacious, yet they also provided crucial financing for inventors like Thomas Edison. Even Herbert Hoover, whom Lind criticizes for the usual reasons, receives praise for creating the (albeit too modest) forerunners of the New Deal and World War II mobilization.
That mobilization provided the most important Hamiltonian victories since Lincoln's time. A generation of bipartisan presidents afterward, from Harry Truman to Gerald Ford, largely accepted the world Roosevelt left them. Then came the Great Dismantling, to use Lind's term, when first Jimmy Carter and, much more aggressively, Reagan moved toward a less centralized, more laissez-faire economy. These decades have seen far slower income growth for most Americans than the previous century.
The chapters on the most recent years are a fairly standard liberal version of events, with deregulation and modern finance as the main antagonists. If you think airline deregulation was an abomination because service can be wretched and airline bankruptcies are common, you will like Lind's telling. If you instead prefer to concentrate on the fact that /middle-class Americans can now afford to fly regularly or that air travel has never been safer, you will not be persuaded.
But Lind ends on a stronger note. The major problems facing the United States today, he argues, are ones that demand Hamiltonian solutions. True innovation, of the kind that lifts living standards for the masses, cannot come from lone inventors. It requires resources that only large organizations have. It also requires skilled people, be they well-educated natives or immigrants admitted because of the skills they can bring.
The notion that the United States has stopped making many large-scale investments that bring great returns is not, in Lind's view, surprising. American economic history tends to run in cycles. Yes, our roads and bridges are dilapidated. Our broadband infrastructure is not quite world-class. Our schools, including many colleges, can no longer claim to be the finest. But the economic need for change will eventually create the political will for it. ''Land of Promise'' ends on as optimistic a note as the title suggests, though it also acknowledges that failure is an option.

HEADLINE: The Hunch, The Pounce And the Kill

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED

 BODY:
BOAZ WEINSTEIN didn't know it, but he had just hooked the London Whale.
It was last November, and Mr. Weinstein, a wunderkind of the New York hedge fund world, had spied something strange across the Atlantic. In an obscure corner of the financial markets, prices seemed out of whack. It didn't make sense.
Mr. Weinstein pounced.
As the financial world now knows, what was out of whack was JPMorgan Chase & Company. One its traders, Bruno Iksil, the man later nicknamed the London Whale for his outsize trades, was about to blow a multibillion-dollar hole in the mighty House of Morgan. 
But the resulting uproar, in Washington and on Wall Street, has largely obscured a simple truth of the marketplace. Yes, Morgan lost big -- but, as Mitt Romney has pointed out, someone else won. And that someone or, rather, those someones, turn out to be Boaz Weinstein and a wolf pack of like-minded hedge fund managers.
In the London Whale, these traders saw a rich opportunity, and they seized it with both hands. That, after all, is the way hedge funds roll. His cool calculus has made Mr. Weinstein a very rich man: he is in talks to buy the Fifth Avenue co-op of a reclusive heiress, Huguette Clark, for $24 million.
It might seem remarkable that someone like Mr. Weinstein, a man virtually unknown outside of financial circles, could deal such a stinging blow to one of the world's largest, most respected banks. Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan and a face of the banking establishment, is struggling to contain the damage from what he has called a ''terrible, egregious mistake.'' The loss -- JPMorgan put it at $2 billion, but it may turn out to be $3 billion or more -- has renewed calls for stronger financial regulation.
Given the secretive nature of the business, few on Wall Street, including Mr. Weinstein, were willing to speak publicly about how the hedge funds harpooned the London Whale. But interviews with more than a dozen hedge fund managers, investors and traders pull back the curtain on the ways of this band of traders, and on what really happened.
One thing is sure: Mr. Weinstein, 38, played a central role in this, one of the biggest trading blowups since the financial crisis of 2008. Mr. Iksil and his colleagues in the chief investment office at JPMorgan may have lighted the fire, but Mr. Weinstein and his cohorts fanned the flames. In the hedge fund game, a business in which ruthlessness is prized and money is the ultimate measure, Mr. Weinstein is what is known as a ''monster'' -- an aggressive trader with a preternatural appetite for risk and a take-no-prisoners style. He is a chess master, as well as a high-roller on the velvet-topped tables of Las Vegas. He has been banned from the Bellagio for counting cards.
From offices on the 58th floor of the Chrysler Building in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Weinstein runs a $5.5 billion hedge fund firm called Saba Capital Management. (''Saba'' is Hebrew for ''grandfatherly wisdom,'' a nod to his Israeli roots.) It was there, last autumn, that he noticed an aberration in the market for credit derivatives. He knew from experience what it was like to lose a lot of money at a big bank. Before starting Saba, he was responsible for a team that lost nearly $2 billion, in the depths of the financial crisis, at Deutsche Bank. Others lost even more. Last November, however, he saw that a certain index seemed to be trading out of line with the market it was supposed to track. He and his team pored through reams of data, trying to make sense of it.
Finally, as Mr. Iksil, the London Whale, kept selling, Mr. Weinstein began buying.
At the time, traders in London had no real idea that JPMorgan was behind the trades that were skewing the market in credit derivatives. In fact, they weren't even sure that it was a single bank or trader. But soon the City of London, Europe's financial hub, was buzzing. Whoever the mysterious trader was, he or she kept selling derivatives intended to rise in value in the event that certain corporate bonds became riskier. The volume of trades was off the charts. Who could possibly sell so much? And, what if the trade reversed, as it inevitably would?
And so the battle lines were drawn. On one side was JPMorgan, the American banking giant that had weathered the financial crisis far better than so many of its peers. On the other were hedge fund managers, including Mr. Weinstein at Saba.
Such standoffs are not uncommon on Wall Street. An aggressive trader makes a wrongheaded bet, then doubles down to scare off competitors on the other side of the trade. Market rivals often get slapped down, unwilling to keep buying as the other side is selling, or vice versa. For traders with the backing of a major bank, like JPMorgan, the task is much easier.
But not always. Sometimes, the other side sits tight, then hits back in force. And it does so in numbers.
By January of this year, the trade against the London Whale was not going well for the hedge funds. The price of the index, as well as others, was still falling, and the losses were mounting for Mr. Weinstein and the others. But by February, it was clear that a single, big player was behind the selling. On trading desks in London and New York, everyone was talking.
It had to be JPMorgan.
BOAZ WEINSTEIN has always played the wild card in the markets. He grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, in relatively modest surroundings, the son of an automobile insurance salesman and a translator, both regular watchers of ''Wall Street Week.'' As a student at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, he entered a contest to see who could pick the best stocks. He won -- by selecting an assortment of the fastest-growing stocks he could find from newspaper charts. He studied philosophy at the University of Michigan -- he was partial to Hume and Camus -- but today favors behavioral finance, particularly the work of his friend Dan Ariely, a professor at Duke. Mr. Weinstein is married to Tali Farhadian Weinstein, a rising lawyer in the Justice Department.
Last February, at a conference organized by another hedge fund manager, his friend William A. Ackman, Mr. Weinstein was hailed as one of the savviest credit traders in the business.
The February conference was held, ironically, in JPMorgan's offices on Madison Avenue. Workers at the bank milled about as Mr. Weinstein and others offered investment tips.
Dressed in a sharp blue suit, Mr. Weinstein stepped up to the microphone and opened with a joke that only a financial wonk would appreciate. He showed a slide comparing the cost of credit default swaps on various government debt to the percentage of young men in those countries who live with their parents. The slide titled ''Mamma Mia!'' suggested that, by that measure, Greece, Portugal and Italy were in trouble.
But what really got people's attention was his second-to-last slide. It was his pick for the ''best'' investment idea of the moment. Mr. Weinstein recommended buying the Investment Grade Series 9 10-year Index CDS -- the same index that Mr. Iksil was shorting.
The crowd, 300 or so investment professionals, began buzzing.
''Once he came out in that meeting and was so specific, others jumped in,'' one hedge fund manager said.
But the London Whale was so big that, for months, the hedge funds betting against him simply got steamrolled. One of Mr. Weinstein's funds at Saba was down 20 percent heading into May.
Then the tables began to turn, as news reports about Mr. Iksil, fed by the hedge funds, began to surface on both sides of the Atlantic. Suddenly, everyone was checking out the obscure index that Mr. Weinstein and others had seized upon.
By May, when fears over Europe's debt crisis again came to the fore, the trade reversed. The London Whale was losing. And Mr. Weinstein began to make back all of his losses -- and then some -- in a matter of weeks.
Other hedge funds were also big winners. Blue Mountain Capital and BlueCrest Capital, both created by former JPMorgan traders, were among those winners. Lucidus Capital Partners, CQS and a fund called III came out ahead, too.
INSIDE the hedge fund world, some joked that Mr. Weinstein had been able to spot the London Whale because he himself had been a whale once, too.
Mr. Weinstein was a pioneer in complex credit derivatives, latching onto them early in his tenure at Deutsche Bank, before they became the financial weapons of mass destruction that worsened the financial crisis. He was a profit machine at the bank, notching earnings in 10 of his 11 years trading there. At 27, he became one of the youngest managing directors in the bank's history. Before his book blew up, Mr. Weinstein was reportedly pulling down about $40 million a year. He exploited price discrepancies and piled leverage into his trades.
Then his team at Deutsche Bank lost $1.8 billion during the 2008 financial crisis. The trading losses ruined bonuses throughout the bank, and ruffled more than a few feathers.
He would later leave the bank and, along with 12 of his colleagues, set up Saba. Mr. Weinstein started it with $140 million -- a pittance by hedge fund standards. In the intervening years, he has outperformed his peers and managed to vacuum up assets at a time when most growing hedge funds have been struggling to hold on to what they've got. He now controls more than $5.5 billion.
The similarities between Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Iksil still resonate in the market.
''It was one whale versus another whale,'' one hedge fund manager said.
Those who have traded against Mr. Weinstein describe him as an aggressive trader who bets big and moves fast. He values a deal more than old-fashioned etiquette. Traders tell tales of losing money to him because of split-second price differences he picked up faster than they did. While that kind of behavior doesn't win a lot of friends on Wall Street, these traders concede that Mr. Weinstein is too big and powerful to ignore.
At a lot of large hedge funds, the top dogs bark orders to underlings, but Mr. Weinstein is almost always the one doing the trading at Saba. He calls around to the banks daily. His confidence and willingness to take on risk, however, leave some worried that he's never too far away from another Deutsche Bank trade -- from, in essence, becoming the whale.
''If you hand me a list of the top-performing guys in the space, I'd expect to see his name on it,'' said one bank executive who works closely with hedge funds. ''If you hand me another list of hedge funds that might blow up, I'd expect his name to be on that, too.''
Others disagree, saying that Mr. Weinstein has a long record as a steady performer.
LIKE many hedge fund traders, Mr. Weinstein is comfortable with risky pursuits, particularly those that require spot calculations and a cool head. A gambling enthusiast, he has an affinity for blackjack and poker. In 2005, Mr. Weinstein won a Maserati by competing in poker in a tournament sponsored by a unit of Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Weinstein still drives the car. He plays with celebrities like Matt Damon, too.
Not everyone is enthusiastic about Mr. Weinstein's playing style. A few years back, on a trip to Vegas, he was banned from the opulent Bellagio casino for counting cards while playing blackjack.
Much has also been made of his prowess as a chess player. He earned the chess master designation at the age of 16, and has remained a lifelong fan, though he plays less these days. At a charity auction in 2010, he paid $10,500 to play alongside the chess legend Garry Kasparov and the young chess sensation Magnus Carlsen.
Mostly, he sneaks in quick games online, sometimes with Peter Thiel, a hedge fund manager and Silicon Valley star who was an early investor in Facebook.
Both chess and playing the markets require a mind that can see several steps ahead of the next man -- a fact that has not been lost on Wall Street. Privately, Mr. Weinstein tells friends that while skill at chess is great to have, it's hardly a requisite for being a good trader.
Whatever the case, chess helped him gain his first real shot on Wall Street. At 18, after failing to land a summer job at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Weinstein ran into a senior partner in the bathroom on his way out. The partner, David F. DeLucia, a chess expert, had played Mr. Weinstein numerous times, and quickly arranged more meetings for him.
Now Mr. Weinstein is practically a featured attraction on Wall Street. He attends galas and charity events, and is sought out to speak at big events. Pictures of him clasping a drink at last night's party appear with regularity on business Web sites.
And, financially, the payoff has been enormous. Last year, he earned more than $90 million and, by some estimates, landed on the rich lists of the hedge fund industry. Such figures aside, he is described as someone who doesn't flash his wealth. Before he won his Maserati, he didn't own a car.
At another recent investor conference, Mr. Weinstein strolled among the crowd in Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center. Accompanying him was his mother, Giselle, with whom he watched ''Wall Street Week'' as a child.
While hedge fund managers, investors and analysts mingled over cocktails, Mr. Weinstein appeared buoyant. His trade against the London Whale was finally paying off, a vindication -- and a profitable one -- of his hunch months earlier. That same day, news reports said Mr. Iksil, the London Whale, would soon be leaving JPMorgan.

HEADLINE: Austerity Defenses

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Weak stuff, gentlemen. 

 BODY:
From what I'm hearing, the current defense of Cameron's austerity policies against people like Martin Wolf, Jonathan Portes, and me runs like this:
1. Austerity works! Look at our low, low rates!
2. Austerity? What austerity?
3. Anyway, America does it too.
So, on the first point: as Portes says, those low rates reflect pessimism about British economic prospects, not optimism about its creditworthiness.
On the second, a couple of things to bear in mind. First, spending as a share of GDP tends to rise in an economic slump even without a change in policy, both because GDP is smaller and because safety-net programs kick in. As a result, UK spending as a percentage of GDP shot up between 2007 and 2009. 
What about since then? I'm suspicious of the IMF numbers on potential output, which seem too pessimistic to me. But for what it's worth, they say that the output gap -- the degree to which Britain has been operating below potential -- hasn't changed much since 2009. Given that, here's what the IMF World Economic Outlook database says about spending:
Also, VAT went up. So the IMF's measure of "structural balance" shows substantial fiscal tightening:
Yes, Virginia, Cameron/Osborne are sharply tightening fiscal policy in the face of a depressed economy.
Finally, about America -- yes! We're doing a lot of austerity! Not as much as Britain, I think (although the numbers are hard to parse), but when you count in state and local government we're doing a lot of contraction. But that doesn't reflect deliberate policy, certainly not on Obama's part; it reflects deadlock in Washington and the fiscal woes of state and local governments.
The point is that Britain is choosing to emulate both the United States and the troubled nations of Europe when it doesn't have to -- all in the name of an economic theory that was foolish two years ago, and completely discredited now.

HEADLINE: From Massacres to Shortages, Syria Is Under Pressure

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Could the Houla massacre -- and difficulties ensuring grain imports -- prove to be turning points in the 15-month conflict? 

 BODY:
LONDON - The Houla massacre is being widely described as a turning point in the Syrian uprising. But a turning point to what? Will it finally provide the impetus for unified international action to force a political transition in Damascus or will it mark a slide to full-scale civil war?
United Nations officials said 90 people, including at least 32 children under the age of 10, were killed in the central Syrian village and accused the government of indiscriminately shelling civilian neighborhoods.
The government of President Bashar al-Assad appears oblivious to international condemnation of its violations of a nominal ceasefire and was insisting over the weekend that "terrorists" were to blame for the latest slaughter.
There are indications, however, that the confident-sounding regime may have an Achilles' heel that could undermine its hold on the loyalty of those who still support it: food.
In a report on Friday that quoted international grain traders, Reuters said Syria was struggling to meet its import needs, which raised the prospect of bread shortages that could sap public support for the regime.
Syria, once the bread basket of the Roman Empire, has been a net importer of wheat for 30 years. 
With domestic production below targets as a result of crop disease and disruptions created by the 15-month internal conflict, the regime is having trouble finding suppliers to fill the gap.
Grain and other food products are not subject to international sanctions imposed by the United States, Europe and other countries - these are supposed to target the regime, not the people. 
But financial sanctions are deterring foreign banks, shippers and traders from doing business with Damascus, forcing it to scramble for supplies to guarantee provisions of the subsidized bread rations on which many Syrians rely. Syria also needs to buy maize and barley for animal feed.
In January, Syrian officials were boasting that they had enough wheat reserves to cover two years of domestic consumption and were even planning to barter some for refined oil and phosphates in order to skirt sanctions on those products. 
However, since then the state General Establishment for Cereal Processing and Trade, also known as Hoboob, is reported to have been offering twice the international price for imported wheat.
The government said last week that sanctions had so far cost the economy $4 billion. Sufian Allaw, the oil minister, blamed sanctions for shortages that were forcing Syrians to stand in long lines to pay inflated prices for cooking gas, fuel, sugar and other staples.
After the Houla massacre, there will be pressure to tighten sanctions at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council that Western governments want held this week. 
Whatever measures they might seek to persuade reluctant international partners like Russia to sign on, these will not include direct restrictions on food.
That remains a taboo in global sanction regimes on the principle that populations should not be punished for the sins of their rulers.
That said, the governments that have called for an end to Mr. Assad's regime will not be too distressed if he gets the blame for failing to feed his people.
The theory is that the international community would fill the gap. The U.N. World Food Program last month stepped up its food assistance to Syria in order to reach half a million people. 
The U.N. has focused its efforts on regions worst hit by the conflict. Even before the violence broke out in Syria, a food security survey found that 1.4 million people were struggling to meet their daily food needs, the World Food Program said
But the U.N. agency complained that it had not yet managed to raise the money to pay for its food aid program. So the dilemma remains whether Mr. Assad can be starved of support without starving the Syrian people.

HEADLINE: Romney Backers Explain Past Criticism of Him

BYLINE: BRIAN KNOWLTON


HIGHLIGHT: Romney's supporters explain their past attacks on the Republican candidate. 

 BODY:
Republicans have been assailing President Obama and his re-election team for days for pointedly - and they say unfairly -- questioning the private equity experience of Mitt Romney. But on Sunday, three prominent Republicans were called to answer for their own past criticisms of the former Massachusetts governor.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a rival of Mr. Romney's in the 2008 Republican presidential primary, had painted a dim picture during that campaign of the former governor's economic policies and the health care program he put in place in Massachusetts.
Asked on the CNN program "State of the Union" how he reconciled that with his current support of Mr. Romney, Mr. Giuliani said: "Well, I mean, there's a certain amount of personal ego in that. At that point I was probably comparing his record to my record."
But even while seeking to muffle his past criticism, the former mayor managed to underscore what he deemed "my far superior record to his otherwise decent record."
"Maybe it was circumstances or whatever, but I had massive reduction in unemployment. He had a reduction in unemployment of about 8 percent, 10 percent -- I think it was 15 percent. I had a reduction in unemployment of 50 percent. They had a growth of jobs of 40,000; we had a growth of jobs of 500,000."
In case that was not the sort of ringing endorsement that Mr. Romney might have hoped for, Mr. Giuliani then shifted into full support gear:
"The simple fact is that Mitt Romney has been far more successful in the things that he's done than Barack Obama," he said. "I mean, going way back, this is a man who ran a significant business, made it into a tremendous success" and "took the Olympics out of chaos" when he headed the Salt Lake Winter Games in 2002.
In contrast, Mr. Giuliani said, Mr. Obama "had virtually no success before, just community organizer, State Senate, never really had a payroll to meet or any responsibilities."
Senator John McCain of Arizona, the man who prevailed over Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Romney in the 2008 nominating contest, has denounced Mr. Obama's criticism of Mr. Romney's stewardship of the Bain Capital private equity firm as "class warfare at its worst."
But he, too, had been critical of Mr. Romney in that earlier campaign, saying, "He managed companies, and he bought and sold, and sometimes people lost their jobs."
On "Fox News Sunday" he tried to put those words in perspective.
"The only place in the world that I can recall where companies never failed was the old Soviet Union," he said. "This is what investors do in free enterprise and the capitalistic system. When you take $5 million and a warehouse and you end up with Staples, I would argue that that's what it's all about."
A more recent Republican rival of Mr. Romney's, Newt Gingrich, was not at all coy about his past criticisms. "Sure, I went straight at him with the Bain issue," the former House speaker said on the NBC program "Meet the Press."
But Mr. Obama, he said, had a problem: "He has no model of effective job creation as compared to private capital. And I think that's why this is going to fall flat on its face."
And, he went on, "I was very careful: I didn't go after private equity."
Mr. Gingrich said it was criticism of the function of private equity firms that had stirred Democratic unease with the president's attacks, notably from Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark, who last week called such criticism "nauseating."
But to Robert Gibbs, a senior adviser to the Obama campaign, "This has nothing to do with being antibusiness"; the simple question was whether Mr. Romney's experience qualified him for the White House.
"He's very good at making money for his partners," Mr. Gibbs said on CBS, "he's not so good at creating jobs."

HEADLINE: New York Has Some Prisons to Sell You

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
One property, in the Hudson Valley, includes a 16-car garage, a piggery and hundreds of yards of lake frontage.
Another offers 69 acres of waterfront land on the west shore of Staten Island, complete with a two-story gymnasium, a baseball diamond and an open-air pavilion.
Those seeking seclusion have an option, too: 20 acres adjoining state forest land in rural Schoharie County, perfect for hunting, trapping and fishing. The property comes with its own wastewater- and sewage-treatment plants, as well as a chapel and a carpentry shop.
The ideal buyer is someone who craves space to spread out, and who does not mind a property that has had thousands of guests over the years. And a fondness for ''The Shawshank Redemption'' would not hurt. 
These real-estate listings come from an unpracticed seller, the State of New York. After cutting costs through traditional means like freezing wages of state workers and consolidating government offices, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is embarking on a less conventional effort: trying to sell New York's old prisons.
The state has a glut of vacant correctional facilities because of lower crime rates, new programs that allow early release for nonviolent offenders and the dismantling of its strict drug laws. The situation in New York reflects changing national attitudes toward criminal justice policy: the number of state prisoners nationwide declined in 2009 and 2010 for the first times in at least three decades, according to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.
Mr. Cuomo's predecessor, Gov. David A. Paterson, closed three prisons as he confronted budget problems. Mr. Cuomo declared in his first address to the State Legislature that prisons were ''not an employment program,'' and proceeded to shut seven of the state's remaining 67 correctional facilities, removing 3,800 beds.
These closings reflect a sharp reversal. After New York adopted mandatory drug sentences in 1973, the state's prison population soared from 13,437 to a peak of 71,472 in 1999, prompting a boom in prison construction, much of it during the tenure of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the current governor's father. But since then, the number of inmates in state facilities has fallen nearly a quarter, to about 55,000, leaving thousands of empty beds.
The state has other real estate to offer as well, including a Romanesque armory in Poughkeepsie where soldiers drilled before the Spanish-American War and a one-time rehabilitation center for young women in the Finger Lakes region.
For less imaginative buyers, last month the Cuomo administration auctioned 454 cars and trucks, which sold briskly. It has also set up an eBay store, hoping someone sitting at home will be tempted to buy 15 vintage industrial saw blades or 250 Dell USB keyboards.
Last year, Mr. Cuomo formed a facility closure team, composed of agency commissioners, that meets weekly to go property by property to find more that can be sold.
''Instead of spending millions maintaining facilities we don't need,'' said Howard B. Glaser, director of state operations, ''the governor's approach saves taxpayers millions and opens up transformative economic development and investment opportunities in communities across the state.''
Among the facilities the team is considering selling are 23 state-owned residences set aside for prison superintendents. Some are quite lavish: one in Auburn, to be auctioned this summer, is an 8,850-square-foot brick mansion with eight bedrooms, six bathrooms, an attached gazebo and a barn-size garage.
Several other properties have already been sold at auction or turned over to local governments, including armories in Suffolk and Washington Counties, a youth residential center in Cattaraugus County and a five-bedroom town house in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, that featured century-old wood wainscoting and decorative balustrades and netted $810,000 for the state.
But the prisons are by far the largest, and most challenging to sell, of the properties on the market. Some of them would be quite expensive to maintain or demolish, and many are in rural areas where real estate is inexpensive and undeveloped land is plentiful.
''It's a building that's just sitting there,'' said Harold Vroman, chairman of the board of supervisors in Schoharie County, where Mr. Cuomo shut down a 100-bed minimum-security prison last year. ''Who wants to buy a jail, you know?''
Other states offer some encouraging examples. In Massachusetts, the old Charles Street Jail in Boston was transformed into the Liberty Hotel, which opened in 2007 and embraces its history -- among the offerings at one of its bars, Alibi, is a $12 blueberry mojito called the Jailbait. And three years ago in New Jersey, the cells were removed from a former county jail in Newark and the building was converted into government office space.
But those buildings were jails, which are often smaller, grander and more centrally located than prisons.
''Those ones, like old courthouses, have a future life,'' said Elizabeth Minnis, chairwoman of the American Institute of Architects' advisory group for correctional facilities, courthouses and law-enforcement buildings. ''But the stuff out in the middle of nowhere, it probably has nothing. You're going to have to just try to get it off your books. It's almost worth paying somebody to take it off your hands or give it away for free, because it becomes a liability.''
Consider the Oneida Correctional Facility, a 998-bed medium-security prison in Rome that closed last October. It shares utilities with a rather unattractive neighbor: another state prison.
''The only possible thing that you could use this for would be for government or military,'' said Fred Macchia, a commercial real-estate broker in Rome. ''You couldn't make it into a hotel. You couldn't make it into an apartment complex. You're talking millions of dollars to renovate. Who's going to do it? The state's not going to do it -- they're trying to get rid of it.''
All three prisons closed by Mr. Paterson are vacant. One was mentioned as a possible test site for hydraulic fracturing, the much-debated method of extracting natural gas. Another, Camp Gabriels -- a minimum-security prison in Brighton, in the Adirondacks, that was originally built as a sanitarium for tuberculosis patients -- has twice been put up for auction, first with a minimum price of $950,000, and then with a $750,000 minimum. No one bid either time.
''The state, when they closed the prison, it didn't seem like they had much of a plan,'' said Brian McDonnell, a member of the town board in Brighton. ''You get the impression that they just walked away and threw the keys in the river and said, 'Well, move along.' ''
Cuomo administration officials said they were more optimistic about the prisons they shut down last year. They are reviewing proposals for a new retail development to replace the former Arthur Kill Correctional Facility on Staten Island, and for a manufacturing plant at Camp Georgetown, a shuttered 262-bed prison in central New York.
In the Hudson Valley, local officials have taken the lead in trying to find a new use for the former Mid-Orange Correctional Facility in Warwick. They want to split the 736-bed prison property into smaller parcels, and several manufacturers have expressed interest in moving to the site. Other ideas for reuse included a wildlife sanctuary, a solar power facility and a Greek-style yogurt plant.
Michael Sweeton, the Warwick town supervisor, said local officials feared that if they did not come up with ideas for the prison, the state would ''get some knucklehead guy to pick it up for what he thinks is a song'' and let the property fall into disrepair.
''We didn't want them to think that we were just going to sit on our hands and let this play out,'' Mr. Sweeton said. ''We looked at it as a great opportunity.''

HEADLINE: Canada May Step In To Resolve Rail Strike

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
TORONTO (Reuters) -- Talks between the Canadian Pacific Railway and the union representing 4,800 striking locomotive engineers have broken down, paving the way for the Canadian government to bring in back-to-work legislation, the company said on Sunday. 
''The mediator has withdrawn. The legislative process will now commence,'' a Canadian Pacific spokesman, Ed Greenberg, said in an e-mail statement.
The Canadian government, concerned that a rail strike could hurt an economy still recovering from recession, has said it is prepared to introduce legislation that would force the strikers back to work.
The back-to-work bill has yet to be formally introduced in the Canadian Parliament. If the government speeds it through the legislative process, it could become law this week.
Members of the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference walked off the job last Wednesday after talks over pension issues broke down, shutting down freight traffic across the country. The walkout was called less than a week after the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman won a proxy battle for control of the railroad.
The union was not immediately available to comment on Sunday's developments, but a message on its Twitter account said that mediators were no longer involved in its discussions with Canadian Pacific, and that no further talks were planned.
The majority Conservative government previously has used back-to-work legislation to end strikes at Air Canada, like Canadian Pacific a private company, and at the Canada Post, a publicly owned mail service.
Labor Minister Lisa Raitt, who has said the Canadian Pacific strike could cost 540 million Canadian dollars ($524 million) in lost economic activity each week, said on Sunday that the government was consulting with businesses to see how deeply the strike was hampering their operations. She did not say how soon the back-to-work legislation might land.
Companies have scrambled to find alternative ways to ship their grain, coal, fertilizer, autos and other goods. One industry group, Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, called on Sunday for the government to immediately intervene to end the dispute.
Canadian Pacific's routes are mostly in western Canada and in the United States, though the American operations are not affected by the strike.

HEADLINE: West Point Asks if a War Doctrine Was Worth It

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
WEST POINT, N.Y. -- For two centuries, the United States Military Academy has produced generals for America's wars, among them Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, George S. Patton and David H. Petraeus. It is where President George W. Bush delivered what became known as his pre-emption speech, which sought to justify the invasion of Iraq, and where President Obama told the nation he was sending an additional 30,000 American troops to Afghanistan.
Now at another critical moment in American military history, the faculty here on the commanding bend in the Hudson River is deep in its own existential debate. Narrowly, the argument is whether the counterinsurgency strategy used in Iraq and Afghanistan -- the troop-heavy, time-intensive, expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads, schools and government -- is dead.
Broadly, the question is what the United States gained after a decade in two wars. 
''Not much,'' Col. Gian P. Gentile, the director of West Point's military history program and the commander of a combat battalion in Baghdad in 2006, said flatly in an interview last week. ''Certainly not worth the effort. In my view.''
Colonel Gentile, long a critic of counterinsurgency, represents one side of the divide at West Point. On the other is Col. Michael J. Meese, the head of the academy's influential social sciences department and a top adviser to General Petraeus in Baghdad and Kabul when General Petraeus commanded the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
''Nobody should ever underestimate the costs and the risks involved with counterinsurgency, but neither should you take that off the table,'' Colonel Meese said, also in an interview last week. Counterinsurgency, he said, ''was broadly successful in being able to have the Iraqis govern themselves.''
The debate at West Point mirrors one under way in the armed forces as a whole as the United States withdraws without clear victory from Afghanistan and as the results in Iraq remain ambiguous at best. (On the ABC News program ''This Week'' on Sunday, the defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, called the Taliban ''resilient'' after 10 and a half years of war.)
But at West Point the debate is personal, and a decade of statistics -- more than 6,000 American service members dead in Iraq and Afghanistan and more than $1 trillion spent -- hit home. On Saturday, 972 cadets graduated as second lieutenants, sent off in a commencement speech by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. with the promise that they are ''the key to whatever challenges the world has in store.''
Many of them are apprehensive about what they will find in Afghanistan -- the news coming back from friends is often not good -- but still hope to make it there before the war is largely over. ''We've spent the past four years of our lives getting ready for this,'' said Lt. Daniel Prial, who graduated Saturday and said he was drawn to West Point after his father survived as a firefighter in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001. ''Ultimately you want to see that come to fruition.''
At West Point the arguments are more public than those in the upper reaches of the Pentagon, in large part because the military officers on the West Point faculty pride themselves on academic freedom and challenging orthodoxy. Colonel Gentile, who is working on a book titled ''Wrong Turn: America's Deadly Embrace With Counterinsurgency,'' is chief among them.
Colonel Gentile's argument is that the United States pursued a narrow policy goal in Afghanistan -- defeating Al Qaeda there and keeping it from using the country as a base -- with what he called ''a maximalist operational'' approach. ''Strategy should employ resources of a state to achieve policy aims with the least amount of blood and treasure spent,'' he said.
Counterinsurgency could ultimately work in Afghanistan, he said, if the United States were willing to stay there for generations. ''I'm talking 70, 80, 90 years,'' he said.
Colonel Gentile, who has photographs in his office of five young soldiers in his battalion killed in the 2006 bloodshed in Baghdad, acknowledged that it was difficult to question the wars in the face of the losses.
''But war ultimately is a political act, and I take comfort and pride that we as a military organization, myself as a commander of those soldiers who died, the others who were wounded and I think the American Army writ large, that we did our duty,'' he said. ''And there is honor in itself of doing your duty. I mean you could probably push back on me and say you're still saying the war's not worth it. But I'm a soldier, and I go where I'm told to go, and I do my duty as best I can.''
Colonel Meese's opposing argument is that warfare cannot be divorced from its political, economic and psychological dimensions -- the view advanced in the bible of counterinsurgents, the U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual that was revised under General Petraeus in 2006. Hailed as a new way of warfare (although drawing on counterinsurgencies fought by the United States in Vietnam in the 1960s and the Philippines from 1899 to 1902, among others), the manual promoted the protection of civilian populations, reconstruction and development aid.
''Warfare in a dangerous environment is ultimately a human endeavor, and engaging with the population is something that has to be done in order to try to influence their trajectory,'' Colonel Meese said.
In Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal so aggressively pushed the doctrine when he was the top commander there that troops complained they had to hold their firepower. General Petraeus issued guidelines that clarified that troops had the right to self-defense when he took over, but by then counterinsurgency had attracted powerful critics, chief among them Mr. Biden and veteran military officers who denigrated it as armed nation building.
When Mr. Obama announced last June that he would withdraw by the end of this summer the 30,000 additional troops he sent to Afghanistan -- earlier than the military wanted or expected -- the doctrine seemed to be on life support. General Petraeus has since become director of the Central Intelligence Agency, where his mission is covertly killing the enemy, not winning the people.
Now, as American troops head home from Afghanistan, where the new strategy will be a narrow one of hunting insurgents, the arguments at West Point are playing out in war colleges, academic journals and books, and will be for decades. (The argument has barely begun over whether violence came down in Iraq in 2007 because of the American troop increase or the Anbar Awakening, when Sunni tribes turned against the insurgency.) To Col. Gregory A. Daddis, a West Point history professor, the debate is also about the role of the military as the war winds down. ''We're not really sure right now what the Army is for,'' he said.
To officers like Brig. Gen. H.R. McMaster, much of the debate presents a false either-or dilemma. General McMaster, who used counterinsurgency to secure the Iraqi city of Tal Afar in 2005 and returned recently from Kabul as head of a task force fighting corruption, said that without counterinsurgency, ''There's a tendency to use the application of military force as an end in itself.''
To John Nagl, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who fought in Iraq, wrote a book about counterinsurgency and now teaches at the United States Naval Academy, American foreign policy should ''ensure that we never have to do this again.''
Does counterinsurgency work? ''Yes,'' he said. ''Is it worth what you paid for it? That's an entirely different question.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about a debate at the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., over the military doctrine of counterinsurgency misstated the number of cadets who graduated from the academy on Saturday. There were 972 graduates, not 1,032. (Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. used the 1,032 number in his commencement address to the cadets.)

HEADLINE: Curtailing A Service That Parents Depend On

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
Are Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council doing their traditional budget dance?
Every year, the mayor proposes cutting certain vital city programs and then, at the last minute, the City Council comes to the rescue by restoring at least some of the money.
Council members look like heroes and the mayor gets himself a point or two toward future favors.
It's a little like professional wrestling.
Of course, some years the mayor means it, and then it's a little like the war on terror. 
This year, one of the mayor's most worrisome proposals -- and I mean ''worrisome'' in the sense that he has thousands of blue-collar and poor parents very worried -- is to cut back the city's after-school programs.
Currently, New York finances enrichment programs that run from 3 to 6 p.m. at 454 sites, serving 53,000 elementary, middle and high school students and costing $90 million; the proposal is to reduce that to 261 sites, serving 27,000 children for $71 million.
This would save $19 million in a budget of $67 billion, or about a quarter of 1 percent.
The program enables parents who can't afford child care to hold jobs knowing that their children are safe and learning.
What adds to the budget drama is that some of the sites scheduled to be shut are among the city's best.
So not only is the process painful, but it is also inscrutable.
One program that is marked for closing, at Public School 24 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, is considered so good that city officials take visitors there to see how after-school services are supposed to work. In November, Michael Dogan, a senior director at the Department of Youth and Community Development, escorted two colleagues from another city agency. ''We wanted to show them a quality program'' that exemplified our model, he wrote in an e-mail to Yadira Garcia, the director of the P.S. 24 after-school program.
Another program slated for closing is at Intermediate School 318 in Williamsburg. This program produced the best middle school chess team in America, which recently won the national high school championship. Team members -- who learned chess at the after-school club -- were featured on the front page of The New York Times last month and are the subject of a new documentary.
After the victory, the mayor hosted the team during a news conference at City Hall. ''I was really impressed with you guys,'' Mr. Bloomberg told them. ''You're a lot smarter than I am.''
When it comes to cutting, it's hard to know which mayor will show up to the budget dance, Fred Astaire or Sweeney Todd. ''I know the budget dance,'' said Michelle Yanche, a leader of the Campaign for Children, an advocacy group. ''I've been watching budget dances for 20 years. This is not your normal budget dance.''
Ms. Yanche said an indicator of the mayor's seriousness was that since 2009, he reduced money going to after-school programs by $30 million. Along with the proposed cuts, it means that 58,000 fewer children will be in after-school programs than in 2009.
For Eridania Santos, a single parent of two, the program at P.S. 24 is the difference between being a $22,000-a-year legal assistant or a welfare mother. She particularly appreciates the daily homework help and the 20 minutes of independent reading. ''It means when I get home from work, it's not just, 'Eat, do your homework, go to bed,' '' she said. ''I can have time with my kids.''
Cathleen Collins, a spokeswoman for the city, wrote in an e-mail that just because programs were scheduled to be closed, it was ''not a reflection of their quality or success, but rather a factor of limited resources and high level of competition.''
She said that the 261 to remain would provide more comprehensive -- and expensive -- services than in the past, including an education specialist to coordinate with the day curriculum; more science, math and literacy lessons; and more parent involvement.
The mayor is committed to balancing the budget without raising taxes, Ms. Collins said, and even with the cuts, more children would be accommodated than when Mr. Bloomberg was first elected a decade ago. ''We are hopeful that the initiative will grow and thrive when more prosperous economic times return,'' she said.
This year, 1,200 organizations submitted proposals. The city's specifications were developed in consultation with representatives from the most respected programs, including -- you can't make this up -- two from P.S. 24. ''I assumed since they were adopting our ideas, we'd be safe,'' Ms. Garcia said.
Lucy Friedman is president of the After School Corporation, a nonprofit group that supports these providers nationwide. Her group named P.S. 24 one of the city's three best in 2008. ''It is a travesty that this program is now on the chopping block,'' she said.
The P.S. 24 program is one of two run by the Morningside Center for Teaching Social Responsibility. The other, at Middle School 214 in the Bronx, is much newer and yet has had its financing renewed for next year.
''This makes absolutely no sense,'' said Tala Manassah, the deputy director of Morningside, which opened the program at P.S. 24 in 1999. ''P.S. 24 has a great track record. There are not many programs in the entire city that are as awarded as the one we have at P.S. 24.''
The school serves precisely the children that city officials say they want to reach -- 95 percent of the 240 qualify for subsidized lunches. English is the second language for about half.
Originally, children were selected on a first-come, first-served basis, but after parents started lining up in the street hours ahead of time, a lottery system was developed.
Activities besides reading and homework include theater, art, music, robotics, sports and a peer mediation program that has been featured on -- you can't make this up -- the United States Department of Education's ''Doing What Works'' Web site.
P.S. 24 has also been awarded a $90,000 arts grant by the SHS Foundation. Students have made theater trips to see ''Spider-Man,'' ''Mary Poppins'' and ''The Little Prince,'' and taken classes at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
Eric Torres, 20, who is studying accounting at the College of Staten Island, works as a counselor in the P.S. 24 after-school program. When he was a boy, he attended the P.S. 24 program and looked up to his counselor, a young man named Santos. Among the many things Santos taught were methods of avoiding fights. ''In my entire life, I've never been in a fight, in school or out,'' Mr. Torres said.
Christian Montano, 9, is learning the same from his favorite counselor, Mr. Torres. ''He corrects me every time I do a little something wrong,'' Christian said. ''He'll give me a warning -- he makes it rhyme. 'Put it away, before I take it away,' and it doesn't get me in trouble.''
Every afternoon, the names of counselors working that day are posted on a board. ''I always look for his name,'' Christian said. ''Please be there, please be there, and then he's here.''
For those interested in seeing how a top-notch after-school program works, the film about the I.S. 318 chess team, ''Brooklyn Castle,'' will be screened Friday at 8 p.m. at the Brooklyn Heights Cinema. It wasn't intended to be a historical documentary, but that seems to be where things are going.

HEADLINE: Redistricting Poses New Challenge for Incumbent

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ; Michael D. Regan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
On May 25, 2011, Kathy Hochul woke up a star.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called her from London with congratulations. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, effusively praised her. News outlets from France, Denmark and Japan all covered the story of how she had pulled off an upset in a Republican district in a closely watched special election.
''It was an exhilarating time,'' Ms. Hochul recalled.
Life is more anxiety-filled these days for Ms. Hochul, who now is the most endangered Democratic House incumbent in New York State and one of the most imperiled in the country, according to political analysts. 
Redistricting has thrown the 53-year-old freshman into the most conservative district in the state -- away from the suburbs of Buffalo and Rochester and into a rural area of farms and villages in a district near the Canadian border.
As a result, the woman who rode a wave of anger over a Republican plan to cut Medicare a year ago must convince a primarily Republican electorate that she can represent it and offer an independent voice, regardless of party label.
''I'm going to continue doing what I do,'' Ms. Hochul said in a recent interview, ''which is trying to make a personal connection with as many people as I humanly can to let them know that you may be a Republican and I'm a Democrat, but I've got your back.''
It will not be easy.
National Republicans, still smarting over the way she transformed a little-noticed House race into a closely watched referendum on the Medicare plan, have made her a top target this fall. Two well-known Republicans -- Chris Collins, the former Erie County executive, and David Bellavia, an Iraq war veteran with Tea Party backing -- are seeking the Republican nomination to challenge her.
And voters no longer have their minds mainly on Medicare. Instead, unemployment, the economy and government spending appear foremost among their concerns, according to interviews with voters, political experts and others.
''Part of the reason she won last time was that Democrats were energized and turned out,'' said Dave Wasserman, who tracks House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. ''But this time, she needs to reach out to a larger swath of voters.''
The challenge is clear on the campaign trail, where Ms. Hochul shuns party labels and tries to persuade a constituency of farmers, veterans, factory workers and small-business owners that she is best suited to protect their interests.
At a recent breakfast in Wyoming County, she singled out Pat Gallivan, a popular Republican state senator attending the event, for praise. She also appeared to blame both parties for the gridlock in Congress.
''You hear about a lot of fighting in Washington -- they don't work together,'' she told a crowd of about 100 people nibbling on eggs, sausages and hash browns in an airplane hangar. ''That's that world, folks.''
Ms. Hochul has faced difficult odds before. Last year, top Democrats in Washington initially took little interest in her candidacy, largely because the Republican candidate, Jane L. Corwin, a popular state assemblywoman, was widely expected to win.
The race changed abruptly after Republicans leaders in the House released a plan that called for an extensive overhaul of the Medicare program to help address the federal government's deficit.
Ms. Hochul quickly seized on the plan, warning that it posed a danger to older people, in a district that was home to many elderly residents. And suddenly the race tightened.
Her eventual victory made her an instant darling in the Democratic Party -- and the first Democrat to represent the district in decades.
Democratic leaders made it clear that protecting Ms. Hochul in redistricting would be a top priority for 2012.
In fact, top Democrats in Washington, including Ms. Pelosi, called Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and urged him to help deliver Ms. Hochul a more liberal constituency in the redistricting negotiations with the State Legislature, according to a senior Democrat who was briefed on the conversations.
But with the governor and legislative leaders unable to agree on new Congressional lines, a federal magistrate judge intervened, releasing a map that created a district for Ms. Hochul that was even more conservative than the one she represented.
In all, about 10,000 additional Republican and Conservative voters were added to the district, while about 1,200 registered Democrats were cut out of it. The district, now New York's 27th, is home to 188,500 registered Republicans and Conservatives, 141,000 Democrats and 22,000 independents.
If Ms. Hochul is enjoying any advantage now, it is that the two Republicans seeking to run against her are locked in a tight and bitter primary contest.
Mr. Bellavia, the Iraq war veteran, started strongly, picking up support from several rural county organizations. But Mr. Collins, who has an established base in Erie County from his years as its executive, has gained momentum in recent weeks, particularly after the Conservative Party endorsed him.
Ms. Hochul holds a financial advantage, with nearly $860,000 in her campaign account, according to her most recent disclosure reports, while Mr. Collins, a wealthy businessman, has about $230,000 on hand, according to his campaign. Mr. Bellavia reported that he had about $7,000.
Republicans say that no matter who wins the nomination, the primary is helping both candidates sharpen a major theme that they believe will carry the day in the general election: who is most suited to go to Washington to challenge President Obama and policies, like his health care law?
''No matter what Representative Hochul says or does in her campaign, she is inextricably tied to President Obama,'' Mr. Bellavia said in an interview. ''And November will be a litmus test for the Obama-Hochul policies.''
Mr. Collins made a similar argument, saying: ''Her core values are not in sync with this conservative Republican district. She is in lock step with President Obama.''
But even as Republicans try to cast the race as a referendum on Mr. Obama, Democrats say it will turn largely on the way voters respond to the candidates themselves.
''I don't need heavy hitters to tell my story,'' Ms. Hochul said. ''If I see three cars in front of a diner, I'm stopping in to say hello.''
But Roger Lance, a 47-year-old veteran of the war in Afghanistan, epitomizes the challenges Ms. Hochul faces.
He has seen her traveling the district and has concluded that she is ''a pretty nice lady.'' He also praised her for her recent efforts in Congress to try to prevent the Air Force from closing its base in Niagara County, work that the congresswoman and her aides have lauded.
Yet he said he still had grave concerns about how fast the federal government had grown in recent years. He appeared to hold Ms. Hochul at least partly accountable.
''She seems to go in there with an agenda that the government is going to solve the problem,'' Mr. Lance, a Republican, said. ''I just want the government to get out of my life. They just seem to want to take my money with things like Obama health care. I'm a working guy. Where's my representation?''

HEADLINE: Public Pensions Faulted for Bets On Rosy Returns

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
Few investors are more bullish these days than public pension funds.
While Americans are typically earning less than 1 percent interest on their savings accounts and watching their 401(k) balances yo-yo along with the stock market, most public pension funds are still betting they will earn annual returns of 7 to 8 percent over the long haul, a practice that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg recently called ''indefensible.''
Now public pension funds across the country are facing a painful reckoning. Their projections look increasingly out of touch in today's low-interest environment, and pressure is mounting to be more realistic. But lowering their investment assumptions, even slightly, means turning for more cash to local taxpayers -- who pay part of the cost of public pensions through property and other taxes.
In New York, the city's chief actuary, Robert North, has proposed lowering the assumed rate of return for the city's five pension funds to 7 percent from 8 percent, which would be one of the sharpest reductions by a public pension fund in the United States. But that change would mean finding an additional $1.9 billion for the pension system every year, a huge amount for a city already depositing more than a tenth of its budget -- $7.3 billion a year -- into the funds. 
But to many observers, even 7 percent is too high in today's market conditions.
''The actuary is supposedly going to lower the assumed reinvestment rate from an absolutely hysterical, laughable 8 percent to a totally indefensible 7 or 7.5 percent,'' Mr. Bloomberg said during a trip to Albany in late February. ''If I can give you one piece of financial advice: If somebody offers you a guaranteed 7 percent on your money for the rest of your life, you take it and just make sure the guy's name is not Madoff.''
Public retirement systems from Alaska to Maine are running into the same dilemma as they struggle to lower their assumed rates of return in light of very low interest rates and unpredictable stock prices.
They are facing opposition from public-sector unions, which fear that increased pension costs to taxpayers will further feed the push to cut retirement benefits for public workers. In New York, the Legislature this year cut pensions for public workers who are hired in the future, and around the country governors and mayors are citing high pension costs as a reason for requiring workers to contribute more, or work longer, to earn retirement benefits.
In addition to lowering the projected rate of return, Mr. North has also recommended that the New York City trustees acknowledge that city workers are living longer and reporting more disabilities -- changes that would cost the city an additional $2.8 billion in pension contributions this year. Mr. North has called for the city to soften the blow to the budget by pushing much of the increased pension cost into the future, by spreading the increased liability out over 22 years.
Ailing pension systems have been among the factors that have recently driven struggling cities into Chapter 9 bankruptcy. Such bankruptcies are rare, but economists warn that more are likely in the coming years. Faulty assumptions can mask problems, and municipal pension funds are often so big that if they run into a crisis their home cities cannot afford to bail them out.
The typical public pension plan assumes its investments will earn average annual returns of 8 percent over the long term, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Actual experience since 2000 has been much less, 5.7 percent over the last 10 years, according to the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. (New York State announced last week that it had earned 5.96 percent last year, compared with the 7.5 percent it had projected.)
Worse, many economists say, is that states and cities have special accounting rules that have been criticized for greatly understating pension costs. Governments do not just use their investment assumptions to project future asset growth. They also use them to measure what they will owe retirees in the future in today's dollars, something companies have not been permitted to do since 1993.
As a result, companies now use an average interest rate of 4.8 percent to calculate their pension costs in today's dollars, according to Milliman, an actuarial firm.
In New York City, the proposed 7 percent rate faces resistance from union trustees who sit on the funds' boards. The trustees have the power to make the change; their decision must also be approved by the State Legislature.
''The continued risk here is that even 7 is too high,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a research group for fiscal issues.
And Jeremy Gold, an actuary and economist who has been an outspoken critic of public pension disclosures, said, ''If you're using 7 percent in a 3 percent world, then you're still continuing to borrow from the pension fund.''
The city's union leaders disagree. Harry Nespoli, the chairman of the Municipal Labor Committee, the umbrella group for the city's public employee unions, said that lowering the rate to 7 percent was unnecessary.
''They don't have to turn around and lower it a whole point,'' he said.
When asked if his union was more bullish on the markets than the city's actuary, Mr. Nespoli said, ''All we can do is what the actuary is doing. He's guessing. We're guessing.''
Vermont has lowered its rate by 2 percentage points, but for only one year. The state recently adopted an unusual new approach calling for a sharp initial reduction in its investment assumptions, followed by gradual yearly increases. Vermont has also required public workers to pay more into the pension system.
Union leaders see hidden agendas behind the rising calls for lower pension assumptions. When Rhode Island's state treasurer, Gina M. Raimondo, persuaded her state's pension board to lower its rate to 7.5 percent last year, from 8.25 percent, the president of a firemen's union accused her of ''cooking the books.''
Lowering the rate to 7.5 percent meant Rhode Island's taxpayers would have to contribute an additional $300 million to the fund in the first year, and more after that. Lawmakers were convinced that the state could not afford that, and instead reduced public pension benefits, including the yearly cost-of-living adjustments that retirees now receive. State officials expect the unions to sue over the benefits cuts.
When the mayor of San Jose, Calif., Chuck Reed, warned that the city's reliance on 7.5 percent returns was too risky, three public employees' unions filed a complaint against him and the city with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They told the regulators that San Jose had not included such warnings in its bond prospectus, and asked the regulators to look into whether the omission amounted to securities fraud. A spokesman for the mayor said the complaint was without merit.
In Sacramento this year, Alan Milligan, the actuary for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, recommended that the trustees lower their assumption to 7.25 percent from 7.75 percent. Last year, the trustees rejected Mr. Milligan's previous proposal, to lower the rate to 7.5 percent.
This time, one trustee, Dan Dunmoyer, asked the actuary if he had calculated the probability that the pension fund could even hit those targets.
Yes, Mr. Milligan said: There was a 50-50 chance of getting 7.5 percent returns, on average, over the next two decades. The odds of hitting a 7.25 percent target were a little better, he added, 54 to 46.
Mr. Dunmoyer, who represents the insurance industry on the board, sounded shocked. ''To me, as a fiduciary, you want to have more than a 50 percent chance of success.''
If Calpers kept setting high targets and missing them, ''the impact on the counties won't be bigger numbers,'' he said. ''It will be bankruptcy.''
In the end, a majority decided it was worth the risk, and voted against Mr. Dunmoyer, lowering the rate to 7.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Romney's Former Rivals Speak Out on Bain Attacks

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

 BODY:
Republicans have been assailing President Obama and his re-election team for days for pointedly - and they say unfairly -- questioning the private equity experience of Mitt Romney. But on Sunday, three prominent Republicans were called to answer for their own past criticisms of the former Massachusetts governor.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a rival of Mr. Romney's in the 2008 Republican presidential primary, had painted a dim picture during that campaign of the former governor's economic policies and the health care program he put in place in Massachusetts. 
Asked on the CNN program ''State of the Union'' how he reconciled that with his current support of Mr. Romney, Mr. Giuliani said: ''Well, I mean, there's a certain amount of personal ego in that. At that point I was probably comparing his record to my record.''
But even while seeking to muffle his past criticism, the former mayor managed to underscore what he deemed ''my far superior record to his otherwise decent record.''
''Maybe it was circumstances or whatever, but I had massive reduction in unemployment. He had a reduction in unemployment of about 8 percent, 10 percent -- I think it was 15 percent. I had a reduction in unemployment of 50 percent. They had a growth of jobs of 40,000; we had a growth of jobs of 500,000.''
In case that was not the sort of ringing endorsement that Mr. Romney might have hoped for, Mr. Giuliani then shifted into full support gear:
''The simple fact is that Mitt Romney has been far more successful in the things that he's done than Barack Obama,'' he said. ''I mean, going way back, this is a man who ran a significant business, made it into a tremendous success'' and ''took the Olympics out of chaos'' when he headed the Salt Lake Winter Games in 2002.
In contrast, Mr. Giuliani said, Mr. Obama ''had virtually no success before, just community organizer, State Senate, never really had a payroll to meet or any responsibilities.''
Senator John McCain of Arizona, the man who prevailed over Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Romney in the 2008 nominating contest, has denounced Mr. Obama's criticism of Mr. Romney's stewardship of the Bain Capital private equity firm as ''class warfare at its worst.''
But he, too, had been critical of Mr. Romney in that earlier campaign, saying, ''He managed companies, and he bought and sold, and sometimes people lost their jobs.''
On ''Fox News Sunday'' he tried to put those words in perspective.
''The only place in the world that I can recall where companies never failed was the old Soviet Union,'' he said. ''This is what investors do in free enterprise and the capitalistic system. When you take $5 million and a warehouse and you end up with Staples, I would argue that that's what it's all about.''
A more recent Republican rival of Mr. Romney's, Newt Gingrich, was not at all coy about his past criticisms. ''Sure, I went straight at him with the Bain issue,'' the former House speaker said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.''
But Mr. Obama, he said, had a problem: ''He has no model of effective job creation as compared to private capital. And I think that's why this is going to fall flat on its face.''
And, he went on, ''I was very careful: I didn't go after private equity.''
Mr. Gingrich said it was criticism of the function of private equity firms that had stirred Democratic unease with the president's attacks, notably from Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark, who last week called such criticism ''nauseating.''
But to Robert Gibbs, a senior adviser to the Obama campaign, ''This has nothing to do with being antibusiness''; the simple question was whether Mr. Romney's experience qualified him for the White House.
''He's very good at making money for his partners,'' Mr. Gibbs said on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS, ''he's not so good at creating jobs.''

HEADLINE: As the Euro Bond Wins Supporters, the Details Remain Vague

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and PAUL GEITNER; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- To euro zone countries in need, euro bonds would be a noble expression of European solidarity and a crucial instrument for preserving the common currency.
To Germans and quite a few others, though, euro bonds would be a lot like co-signing a loan for a deadbeat brother-in-law.
Those caricatures have dominated a debate that has left Europeans deeply divided on a central question: Should euro zone countries create common bonds to reduce borrowing costs for members that cannot get affordable credit on their own?
But despite the intensity of the debate, even as political upheaval in Greece and bad bank loans in Spain mushroom into existential threats to the currency union, the euro bond remains only the vaguest of concepts. 
About the only thing clear is that Germany and some other creditworthy northern countries oppose adopting such bonds anytime soon. Meanwhile, Francois Hollande, the new French president, seems keen on speeding things up -- even if he has not quite articulated how his idea would work.
''You don't know what Francois Hollande is talking about when he talks about euro bonds,'' said Jacques Delpla, a member of the French Council of Economic Analysis, a panel that advises the government. ''An open bar with German money for Greece and Spain? That doesn't work.''
At their meeting in Brussels last week, European Union leaders agreed only that euro bonds deserved further study.
Mr. Delpla is the co-author, along with a German economist, Jakob von Weizsacker, of one of the few detailed proposals so far. They outlined how euro bonds might be used to ease financial pressure on countries like Greece, Spain or Italy while addressing German concerns by encouraging more prudent government spending.
The basic idea of euro bonds does enjoy wide support among economists. Proponents also include Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund . And last week the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris called for some variation of euro bonds.
The various models share a basic idea: In addition to each country's raising money by issuing its own bonds, as is now the practice, they would put at least some of the debt into a common pool. These pooled bonds would be issued by some kind of joint European debt agency, with all members assuming shared responsibility for repayment.
There is no agreement yet on whether that pool would be used to replace existing debt or to finance new borrowing. Nor is it clear how countries would have access to the money raised by the sale of the bonds.
Surprising as it may seem, the euro zone's total government debt actually is lower as a proportion of annual gross domestic product -- 87 percent -- than that of the U.S. government, which is more than 100 percent of G.D.P.
A reason euro zone debt has reached crisis proportions is that a few countries in Southern Europe owe too much money and have lost the faith of investors.
The United States so far is able to stay a half-step ahead of its debt because it can keep selling Treasury bonds. Investors worldwide are so certain of being repaid that they accept interest rates of less than 1.75 percent for a 10-year Treasury bond.
Right now, though, the weakest euro zone members have no such credibility with creditors. So Spain must pay more than 6 percent on its 10-year bonds, while investors last week were demanding 5.6 percent for Italian bonds. And about the only ones willing to lend to Greece these days are Europe's bailout institutions and a few roll-the-dice hedge funds.
But if euro zone countries threw their bonds into the same pot, the argument goes, they could create a debt market rivaling that for U.S. Treasury securities -- and greatly improve the chances that Spain and Italy could continue to make interest payments and avoid default or a Greek-style debt overhaul.
That is why, as Greece edges toward an exit from the euro zone, and Spain wrestles with its expanding bank crisis, many analysts see euro bonds as unavoidable.
''If we don't have common bonds very soon, in the next year or so, southern European countries will go bankrupt,'' Mr. Delpla said.
The problem is that talk of euro bonds inevitably raises fundamental questions about the nature of the European Union. Such bonds would require European countries to watch one another's spending much more closely, and each country would have to cede some control over its own budget.
For euro bonds to work the way U.S. Treasury securities do, investors would need assurances that they are backed by a central treasury, or at least an agency with direct access to tax revenue from each member state.
''This needs a very strong institutional setup,'' said Guntram B. Wolff, deputy director at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. ''If you are going to sell them to a Singaporean investor, the Singaporean investor needs to know who is going to pay that bond.''
Once European governments began financing one another on a large scale, they would certainly also want more say over one another's budgets and big-ticket items like military spending or pension systems. For those who advocate a more powerful ''United States of Europe,'' these changes would be good. But they would represent a huge transformation of the decentralized Europe that exists today.
''Immediately behind the euro bond proposal lurks political union,'' said Uri Dadush, a director at the International Economics Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
''The moment you start saying, 'Give me half your tax receipts,' we are talking serious stuff,'' Mr. Dadush said. ''We are talking about giving up major sovereignty.''
The European Central Bank probably has the credibility to play the role of a euro bond debt-issuing agency. But the bank would almost certainly refuse to do so, seeing it as a threat to its political independence -- and a violation of the prohibition on using the bank to finance governments.
But even if the E.C.B. did not issue the debt itself, euro bonds would need at least the central bank's tacit support, Mr. Dadush said.
A big reason U.S. Treasury securities have retained credibility with investors, for example, is that despite official denials of complicity, there is an assumption that the Federal Reserve would not let the U.S. government go bankrupt. The E.C.B. would probably be much less likely to accede to such an implicit guarantee.
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, made an argument similar to Mr. Dadush's at last week's meeting in Brussels, saying Europe must become more economically and politically integrated before it could issue common debt. But the federal Europe she seems to have in mind could take years to build, by which time the euro could lay in ruins.
Germany also fears that lower interest rates would simply reinforce irresponsible spending habits by countries like Italy. To German eyes, Italy, Greece and others did not take advantage of the low interest rates available in past years to make their economies function better.
In a short statement to the news media after the Brussels meeting, Ms. Merkel said ''several participants noted that the common interest rates with the introduction of the euro really didn't lead to improvements in the economic competitiveness of all the euro countries.''
Economists have proposed several ways around that problem. The model by Mr. Delpla and Mr. von Weizsacker , for instance, would let countries put some of their debt -- equal to no more than 60 percent of gross domestic product -- into so-called blue bonds issued by all members. These would presumably carry a very low interest rate.
The rest -- the red bonds -- would remain the responsibility of individual countries and would probably carry much higher interest rates.
Countries would need approval from a central committee to issue blue bonds, and could do it only if they followed responsible economic and budgetary policies. Germany would effectively have veto power.
''If you behave well, you have access to blue debt,'' Mr. Delpla said. ''If you start to behave like Berlusconi, you will not have access to blue debt, and the price of red debt will go up.'' He was referring to the former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, whose policies were blamed for much of Italy's current economic and debt woes.
Thus Spain and Italy would still feel acute pressure to improve the way their economies function and to get better control of public spending. One big advantage of the proposal, Mr. Delpla said, is that it could be put into action quickly without a major restructuring of the European Union.
European leaders are certainly aware of the blue bond/red bond proposal. Mario Monti, Italy's current prime minister, is a former head of Bruegel, the research group that originally published it. But top European policy makers are still far away from approving any euro bond model.
Another of the most influential proposals actually came from the heartland of euro bond opposition. The German Council of Economic Experts, a group of independent economists who advise the government, late last year proposed pooling all of Europe's debt overhang , defined as the amount above 60 percent of G.D.P.
Under this plan, countries would get rid of their excess debt -- about 2.3 trillion worth, or $2.9 trillion -- which would be paid off over 25 years. But after that, governments would have to keep debt below 60 percent of G.D.P. That is the limit they agreed to -- but have not observed -- when they formed the currency union.
So far, Ms. Merkel has expressed support only for so-called project bonds -- joint debt used to finance roads or other infrastructure that might benefit all Europeans. Economists agree, however, that project bonds would not do much to stimulate growth across Europe, much less solve Spain's banking crisis or reduce Italy's borrowing costs.
Although leaders agreed in Brussels to study euro bonds more closely, the process is moving slowly. Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, plans to come back to the leaders at the end of June with a first look at the ''building blocks'' for moving toward projects like euro bonds. He plans first to consult with the E.C.B., the European Commission and the president of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers.
One European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said even a step toward euro bonds could reassure investors who have been watching Greece teeter and fear a bank run in Spain -- and wondering what happens next. ''The fundamental issue,'' he said, ''is who or what stands behind the euro.''
Paul Geitner reported from Brussels.

HEADLINE: Valuing Domestic Product

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Understanding the value of household work and the factors that go into it is a reminder that households nurture human capital, with long-term consequences for the economy, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
How ironic that the measure we call gross domestic product excludes the value of most domestic work. Services don't count unless they are explicitly exchanged for money.
Marry your butler (or your research assistant) and share your income equally instead of paying him by the hour. The size of G.D.P. will shrink. Divorce him, and G.D.P. is likely to expand.
Longstanding though distinctly marginal efforts to challenge this accounting convention are now gaining traction. An article in this month's Survey of Current Business provides fascinating estimates of the value of household production in the United States from 1965 to 2010.

Like most previous efforts, it relies primarily on measures of the total amount of time devoted to unpaid household tasks, multiplied by a household worker's market wage. That is, it asks, "How much would it have cost if you had hired a nanny or a maid to do it?"
Most of us probably consider ourselves more productive at many household tasks than a hired substitute, if only because we have family-specific skills.
Also, the survey data measures only time devoted to specific activities (such as "feeding a child"), excluding the supervisory constraints that care of young children or needy adults can impose. Being "on call" is not considered household work, even though babysitters and home-care workers (not to mention security guards) are often paid to fulfill this role.
For both these reasons, the new estimates of the value of unpaid domestic work represent a conservative lower bound. Yet they are by no means low: inclusion raises the level of G.D.P. 39 percent in 1965 and 25.7 percent in 2010.
One could cheerfully conclude that we were better off than we thought we were, especially in the earlier years. But many more provocative implications emerge from this genre of research, especially regarding trends in inequality.
Within the United States (as in other countries), there is far less variation across households in the value of home production than in the value of market income. As a result, the value of home production reduces the overall level of inequality in living standards. Full-time housewives are, in a sense, equalizers.
But their effect declines along with their numbers. As more women entered paid employment, average hours of unpaid work diminished. This implies that inequality in living standards increased even more sharply over the period than inequality in market income alone.
Current debates over the relative size of the middle class in the United States haven't yet come to grips with the effect of unpaid work on living standards and typically rely on measures of family market income alone.
Yet as I've emphasized in a previous post, a family earning $50,000 with one full-time wage earner and one full-time homemaker surely enjoys a higher living standard than a family with two full-time wage earners each earning $25,000, because it can rely on home-produced services rather than buying market substitutes.
The declining importance of unpaid household work is not completely attributable to increases in women's paid work hours. The estimates published in the Survey of Current Business show that average hours devoted to home production declined from 1965 to 2010 especially rapidly among women who were not employed - to 31.3 hours a week, from 47.5.
Technological change and economies of scale deserve much of the credit. The relative cost of substitutes for many home-produced goods and services has declined. It is often cheaper to buy clothes than to sew them, to buy fast food or prepared meals rather than to make them from scratch.
Consumer durables like microwave ovens and computers have reduced the time necessary to accomplish some household tasks, serving as "engines of liberation" for women in particular.
Yet these same changes have made adults more likely to live alone and more dependent on market income. When people lose their paying jobs, there isn't much they can do to compensate for the lost income, other than move in with their parents and cut back on restaurant meals.
Valuation of unpaid work reminds us that households are not just sites of consumption. They are sites of investment. Both market income and household production are inputs into the development of human capital and, more broadly, the production and maintenance of human capabilities.
There lies another irony of valuation: this output is potentially worth far more than the value of the inputs used to create it but can't be measured simply by calculating the present value of future market earnings.
Our most important domestic products are not ones that can be bought and sold.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Blame the S.B.A.

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Home sales up, gridlock eases, lessons from "Shark Tank" and Howard Stern. And do you think entrepreneurship can be taught in an academic setting? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: Small Businesses in the Spotlight
During National Small Business Week, the Small Business Administration honors its champions and recognizes top lenders, investment companies and resource partners - and then is beat up by small-business owners. The National Federation of Independent Business uses the week to talk taxes, but Ellen Bravo doesn't want to hear it. Paychex lists the five biggest issues facing small-business owners. A new report says that small businesses and new businesses have been responsible for two of every three net new jobs. Small businesses are reporting increases in hiring and sales. Business owners in the Northeast are anticipating improved revenues and moderate hiring. Capital One's barometer shows things are looking up. Next year, how about National Big Business Week?
The Economy: Step on the Gas
Gallup says economic confidence hit a new high. Economic activity (pdf) improves in Chicago, as does growth in the Kansas City region (pdf). Mark Perry updates the domestic manufacturing renaissance, while manufacturers say they are optimistic but "concerned by the impact of uncertain demand and rising commodity prices." Harvey Golub explains how the recovery went wrong. The Congressional Budget Office warns that "taxmageddon" will throw the economy back into recession. "Sportsageddon" taxes the Staples Center. Tim Duy said it seemed likely the Fed would "step on the monetary gas, even if doing so allowed Congress another year of reckless behavior. Not doing so would be a clear violation of the dual mandate." Business owners in swing states are backing G.O.P. candidates, and in a related story, Congress's vocabulary has fallen a full grade level in the past seven years. Matthew Yglesias says "taxes don't kill entrepreneurship, crazy licensing rules do: "New York barbers need 884 days of education and apprenticeship. ... Once a licensing regime is in place, existing license holders have an incentive to lobby to raise the bar for entry."
The Data: Home Sales Up 
April existing home sales (pdf) and new home sales (pdf) jump. In March, vehicle traffic volume (pdf)was up, which may mean that the economic contraction is receding. A Reds fan catches back-to-back home run balls.
Around the Country: Gridlock Eases
Lydia Dishman explains why you should start a company in Greenville, S.C.: "The clackety-clack of weaving looms has long given way to automotive and turbine manufacturing in Greenville, S.C., but the little urbane city in the foothills of the Blue Ridge is also home to a growing tech community that's about to bust out." Airlines consider charging $25 for window seats. Maryland will introduce a program to stimulate lending to small businesses. 7-Eleven plans to add 630 new stores in 2012. A parking spot in New York City goes for a million bucks. An arts and technology festival is planned on Kickstarter for Portland. Gridlock eases in most major American cities. A mountain lion walks into a California town.
Around the World: Britain's Entrepreneurial Spirit
The head of the International Monetary Fund says the world is facing the most economic insecurity since the Great Depression. Here's what austerity looks like around the world. A cash crunch hits Greece. A child in Indonesia hitches a ride on a shark. The world's tallest tower opens in Tokyo while the credit bureau Fitch downgrades Japan's banks. China's hard landing may be turning into a crash. Lauren Indvik explains how the Chinese buy online. Even as Britain's economy grows worse, Phil Wainewright is impressed by London's growing cloud start-up scene: "There's far more entrepreneurial spirit in Britain today than ever before in my lifetime." Africa is experiencing some of the biggest falls in child mortality "ever seen, anywhere." The G(irls)20 Summit meeting is this week in Mexico City.
Management: Lessons From 'Shark Tank'
Two big manufacturers combine. In this video, Jim Palmer says never, ever, ever give up. Many businesses are willing to use bribery and fraud to get ahead. Employees at the Bellagio foil a robbery. An entrepreneur bankrolls a genetically engineered salmon. Jen Waak explains how to set goals. Tim Ferriss says this may be the best commencement speech you will ever hear. Jennifer King says building a dream team is one of five steps to succession planning. David Armano tells entrepreneurs to move over - here come the intrapreneurs. Colleen Debaise explains how little guys can become partners with big companies. Here are seven lessons young entrepreneurs can learn from "Shark Tank."
Marketing: Lessons From Howard Stern
When do online shoppers abandon the cart? Why is this guy opening his beer with a chainsaw? A cartoonist shares three things he learned when his site's traffic increased 25,000 percent in one day.

Finance: When a Client Doesn't Pay
Facebook's I.P.O. turns south but Kevin Casey suggests four ways the company can woo small and midsize businesses. Here are five new money-saving Web sites you probably haven't heard of. Sun National Bank gives advice for savingmoney, gas and time while doing your banking. A Pepperdine University study finds that the restrictive financing environment is stunting business growth and hiring. Sunday Steinkirchner suggests what to do when a client doesn't pay. One suggestion is, "Join a professional organization for your trade": "You are not alone, so take advantage of the collective knowledge of your fellow professionals."
Start-Up: Crowdfunding?
A 22-year-old starts his third company. Tim Berry wonders if you have what investors want. Giant companies are listening at college pitch contests. Employers pursue a college sophomore. Small-business owners aren't that excited about the new crowdfunding legislation, and a new Start-Up Act aims to jump-start the economy. UberConference, a service that hopes to change the way conference calls are made, wins at Disrupt NYC. ZocDoc's chief advises start-ups: "Stay lean, don't listen to the naysayers and hire the right people." These are the recruiting start-ups you should know about. A Harvard professor explains why start-ups fail.
Technology: Google Glasses
Dell's outlook isdisappointing, Hewlett-Packard lays off 27,000 workers, and domestic computer manufacturing may be a lot smaller than thought. Larry Page is spotted wearing Google glasses in England. Tablets are now a billion-dollar business. Here are 37 new gadgets for your small business - but you'd be a fool to buy these 10 gadgets right now. Here's the history of the most important piece of technology ever. A 15-year-old scientist has developed a way to detect pancreatic cancer. Microsoft is developing Office for Android and iOS tablets. I.B.M. faces the peril of "bring your own device."

Google Chrome has unseated Microsoft's Internet Explorer as the world's most popular browser. Comcast takes on Skype and Google Voice. These are the 12 biggest missed opportunities in tech. And if you watch only one iPad beer trick this year, make it this one.
The Week's Bests: Those Who Can
Cathy Ashmore explains why our academic institutions are so bad at teaching entrepreneurship: "Teachers rarely have entrepreneurial experience - or the right mind-set. Effective entrepreneurship training does impart specific knowledge and skills, but it must also convey a mind-set - one that embraces a certain amount of risk and is ready to learn and bounce back from repeated failure. Unfortunately, most teachers have never been entrepreneurs; others are failed entrepreneurs who went to teaching as a more secure career; and some don't even know a business owner - not the ideal people to convey such a mind-set."
Yelp's Kevin Lee offers tips on how to work with online reviews, including: "Never respond negatively to a negative review. Yelp reminds great businesses every day that it's impossible to please everyone. Ignore the trolls and critics. For the legitimately upset customers, respond and let them know you hear them. But always take the high road and remember that you're writing not just to the individual reviewer, but to the entire community."
Robert Skidelsky explains why China won't rule: "China has a choice: it can either accept Western values, or it can try to carve out an East Asian sphere to insulate itself from them. The latter course would provoke conflict not only with the U.S., but also with other Asian powers, particularly Japan and India. China's best possible future thus probably lies in accepting Western norms while trying to flavor them with 'Chinese characteristics.' But neither choice is a scenario for China 'replacing' the U.S. Nor, I think, is this what China wants. Its goal is respect, not dominance."

HIGHLIGHT: The UK looks a lot like the US. 

 BODY:
As I get ready for my UK visit, one thing I've been puzzling over is the contrast in views between the US and the UK over the amount of economic slack. In the US, structuralist obsessives aside, there's widespread agreement that we have a large gap between actual and potential GDP. In the UK, there's much more pessimism.
What's odd is that the data aren't that different, especially if you look at wages (UK inflation numbers have been wildly distorted by changes in VAT etc.).
In the US, what we see is this:
le 
Wage growth plunged after the slump, but stalled out at a low but positive number. Is this stalling out evidence that we're actually close to the NAIRU? Probably not; instead, it reflects downward nominal rigidity, evidenced by the large number of workers getting zero wage change:
So wages don't fall, while some rise, causing the upward overall drift.
What about the UK? Their wage data don't quite match ours; the closest I've been able to come is the "regular pay" component of average weekly earnings, which I think is more cyclical than our hourly series. Still, it basically looks a lot like us:
Looking at the situation with an American eye, I see what looks like an economy operating far below potential, just like us, with wages still drifting upward thanks to a combination of the usual dispersion plus downward nominal rigidity. 
And this is important: those pessimistic assessments of potential output play an important role in the UK austerity frenzy.

HEADLINE: In Cambodia, a Start-Up Combines Web Sales Skills and Hair Extensions

BYLINE: RON GLUCKMAN


HIGHLIGHT: An e-commerce site that sells hair extensions has overcome challenges like spotty electrical service to gain some market share. 

 BODY:
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia - For an Internet start-up, Arjuni faces more challenges than usual.
The e-commerce site that sells hair extensions operates out of a five-story building here that lacks elevators and, sometimes, power. Employees typically have to travel to remote villages by motorbike or foot to pick up the goods that Arjuni sells. And the office floor is cluttered with piles of hair strands instead of computers.
But like many new ventures, Arjuni is harnessing the latest Internet tools like Twitter and social media to build a loyal customer base.
In just two years, the company, founded by Janice Wilson, has grown from a handful of employees to 80, and it now generates more than $1 million in revenue. The start-up is also slowly gaining market share from the industry's dominant players in India and China, as well as retailers in the United States and Europe.
"We not only buy and collect the hair ourselves, but sell it directly to our customers. This makes us stand out," Ms. Wilson said. "We're small, but considered one of the top brands."
While hair extensions have been around for decades, they became a fashion craze in recent years, when stars like Paris Hilton and Britney Spears started using them to change their looks. A large proportion of Arjuni customers, like Ms. Wilson, are African-Americans seeking fuller styles for their tresses.
India has long provided much of the world's natural hair, sold to wholesalers mainly in China, which in turn marketed their products to retailers in Europe and the United States. But Ms. Wilson found that Cambodians have similar hair quality, long with cuticles in alignment.
"Probably 99 percent of the world's hair comes from India. Nobody had thought of Cambodia," said Ms. Wilson, 39, straddling piles of hair on the floor.
It is a small but potentially profitable niche. The hair extensions business generates annual revenue of $250 million.
Ms. Wilson said it was important to her to have a business serve a social purpose. Many of Arjuni's employees formerly worked in Cambodia's notorious sex trade.
That effort helped attract seed capital from a Japanese investment fund, Arun, formed in 2009 by Satoko Kono to help social enterprises in emerging nations. "We like how Arjuni is employing women, and helping the needy," said Ms. Kono, who spent a decade with development organizations in Cambodia.
Additional money came from the Cambodian Export Market Access Fund, which is a World Bank-financed project that helps companies trying to develop exports. The rest came from her savings, friends and family.
A lawyer by training, Ms. Wilson has built her business by making customers feel engaged in the product via the Internet.
Customers eagerly describe their orders on home videos that they upload on YouTube, with segments on topics like hair design, delivery and grooming. Clients are encouraged to send in pictures of starlets they want to emulate, like Catherine Zeta-Jones or Beyoncé. Arjuni also floods Facebook with testimonials and promotions.
"Our clients are fanatical about hair," said Tiyana Peters, who oversees social media for Arjuni. "We get everything from wedding photos afterward to details on how the boyfriends react."
By dealing direct with customers, Arjuni eliminates the added cost of working through another retailer or site. Extensions can cost thousands of dollars, but typically average around $500.
The Internet has helped with damage control, as well. After rumors spread online that Arjuni was stealing hair or forcing women to sell it, the company began regularly posting more information on its operations on networking sites.
"This was totally untrue. We buy the hair at fair prices, and tried to explain it, but there isn't much you can do," Ms. Wilson said. "Our company grew up in the age of social media," she said. "Social media is huge, and has helped us, but these accusations really stung."
Her idea for the start-up was an evolution of sorts. Ms. Wilson, originally from Green Bay, Wis., was on vacation in Cambodia four years ago, she began thinking about opportunities to start a business here.
Cambodia was in the midst of an economic boom and had the fastest-growing economy in Asia, after China, for several years running. One of the hottest sectors was real estate. Ms. Wilson, who was working for a real estate firm in Colorado, decided to move to Cambodia, and with local partners, planned a development near the temples of Angkor, the country's top tourist attraction.
When Cambodia's property market suffered along with the global economy, she faced a grim challenge. "I either had to give up and go back to America, or find something else to do," she recalled.
The collapse of Cambodia's textile industry largely as a result of cheap competition from China led to her idea. Cambodian workers with sewing skills were suddenly unemployed, and nobody had looked at Cambodian hair as a marketable material before.
"I was thinking, what is recession-proof?" Ms. Wilson recalled. The answer: "vanity."
The best - and most expensive - hair extensions are made from natural human hair, which is cut, cleaned and sewn into individual pieces. "It was low-tech, they just needed to learn how to make them, and we just needed sewing machines. We could use the skills already here," she said.
The business was also a way to help workers develop marketable skills. Ms. Wilson now provides employees with free English, computer and math classes. A third of workers come from troubled situations like sex trafficking or spousal abuse. "But we run everything as a business," Ms. Wilson said.
Ms. Wilson acknowledged that she and her staff members were extremely ambitious at the outset, "trying to do everything at once - collection, fabrication and distribution." But they have been able to keep up the frenzied pace as the company grew.
"It's definitely been difficult to scale up," Ms. Wilson said. "But it does make us better quality."
This spring, Arjuni added yet another facet to its operation - a series of in-person events in the United States called Halo, where her staff could meet and help groom customers.
"Do I feel I have aged a lot? Definitely," Ms. Wilson said. "But I love being an entrepreneur. I love the challenges."
"When I worked in a law office, I was bored out of my mind," she added. "When you have this entrepreneurial spirit, you just have to do it."

HEADLINE: Waking Up to Major Colonoscopy Bills

BYLINE: RONI CARYN RABIN


HIGHLIGHT: Prices for colonoscopy are far higher than they should be, some experts say, in part because of rising charges for anesthesia. 

 BODY:
Patients who undergo colonoscopy usually receive anesthesia of some sort in order to "sleep" through the procedure. But as one Long Island couple discovered recently, it can be a very expensive nap.
Both husband and wife selected gastroenterologists who participated in their insurance plan to perform their cancer screenings. But in both cases, the gastroenterologists chose full anesthesia with Propofol, a powerful drug that must be administered by an anesthesiologist, instead of moderate, or "conscious," sedation that often gastroenterologists can administer themselves.
And in both cases, the gastroenterologists were assisted in the procedure by anesthesiologists who were not covered by the couple's insurance. They billed the couple's insurance at rates far higher than any plan would reimburse - two to four times as high, experts say.
Now the couple, Lawrence LaRose and Susan LaMontagne, of Sag Harbor, N.Y., are fending off lawyers and a debt collection agency, and facing thousands of dollars in unresolved charges. All this for a cancer screening test that public health officials say every American should have by age 50, and repeat every 10 years, to save lives - and money.
"Doctors adopt practices that cost more, insurers pay less, and patients get stuck with a tab that in many cases is inflated and arbitrary," said Ms. LaMontagne, whose communications firm, Public Interest Media Group, is focused on health care. "I work on health care access issues every day, so if I'm having a hard time sorting this out, what does that say for other consumers?"
More than 20 million outpatient endoscopy procedures are performed in the United States each year, and the number is growing. A few hardy patients decide that they do not need anesthesia at all. Most receive conscious sedation, a combination of drugs that block pain and help patients relax while remaining conscious; three gastroenterology societies recommend this option as adequate in cases where there are no complications.
Still, a growing number of patients appear to be receiving full anesthesia. Some gastroenterologists say that patients recover more easily after full anesthesia and that the exam is better. But there is no clear scientific evidence to support this, and critics say that an extra pair of hands in the room simply allows the doctor to perform more procedures.
According to a study by the RAND Corporation, published this year in The Journal of the American Medical Association, use of anesthesia administered by an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist during outpatient gastroenterology procedures, mostly colonoscopies, has more than doubled in recent years, to more than 30 percent in 2009 from 14 percent in 2003. Most of the increase occurred among low-risk patients who could do without the expensive service. But the practice varies from region to region: Only 13 percent of gastrointestinal procedures in the West involved an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist, compared with 59 percent in the Northeast, the study found.
As much as $1.1 billion spent on anesthesia for gastrointestinal procedures each year may not be medically necessary, the researchers concluded. Insurers often foot the bill for full anesthesia, but not always.
Mr. LaRose, 48, said that he did not want to have full anesthesia in the first place. After his first consultation with the doctor, he said, he called his gastroenterologist's office and told a staff member of his preference.
But when he showed up for the colonoscopy on June 24, 2010, his doctor, Dr. Kristin Patrick Naso, told him the procedure is normally done with Propofol, which requires an anesthesiologist. By then Mr. LaRose had already spent 24 hours fasting and going through the unpleasant cleansing preparation, he said.
Mr. LaRose said he relented after the doctors assured him that anesthesiology would be covered. "You're starving and gaseous and you just want to get the whole thing over with," Mr. LaRose said.
In an interview, Dr. Naso said his office provided all patients with a notice saying that the anesthesiologist might not be covered by insurance and providing the anesthesiologist's phone number for more information.
Although Dr. Naso was in network and accepted payment from Mr. LaRose's insurer as payment in full, the anesthesiologist, Dr. Michael Rus, billed $1,600 for the procedure. He was reimbursed $588 by the plan and, after failing to collect the remainder from Mr. LaRose, sent the balance to bill collectors.
Dr. Rus did not respond to requests for comment.
It was a similar situation when Ms. LaMontagne went for her colonoscopy. She said she told Dr. Michael Krumholz in Manhattan about her husband's experience and her concerns about a lack of coverage for full anesthesia. She said she was not told about conscious sedation, which is not available at his practice. Instead, Ms. LaMontagne said, she was told that full anesthesia was standard practice. She went ahead with the procedure in February.
Dr. Krumholz accepted $192 from Ms. LaMontagne's insurance company, Freelancers Insurance Company, which is affiliated with the Freelancers Union. But the insurer rejected the bill from the anesthesiologist, Dr. Joanne Goldman, because she is out of network.
So Dr. Goldman's charge was sent to Ms. LaMontagne: $2,800. She called Dr. Krumholz's office to ask about this charge and any others of which she might be unaware. She said she was told there would also be an additional "facility fee" of $1,800 charged by the endoscopy clinic.
In an interview, Dr. Goldman said she did not do the billing herself and could not address questions about it.
In an e-mail, Dr. Krumholz said that he tells all of his patients about the risks and benefits of colonoscopy, as well as alternatives to the procedure, and of the benefits of and alternatives to anesthesia. He will perform the procedure without anesthesia if the patient so chooses, he said, but his practice does not offer conscious sedation, nor do "most modern endoscopy facilities in New York."
Jordan Fowler, chief executive of Frontier Healthcare and business manager of the endoscopy center where Dr. Krumholz practices, said Ms. LaMontagne "should not lose sleep" over the charges because the anesthesiologists in the group are about to become in-network providers.
Asked whether a $2,800 charge is reasonable for about 30 minutes of anesthesia, he said, "You bill a high fee to negotiate with an insurance company."
Sara Horowitz, founder and executive director of the Freelancers Union, said the trend toward using two doctors for a colonoscopy is "outrageous, when we have another perfectly good kind of anesthesia, twilight sleep, that the GI can do him- or herself."
But there's a bigger problem for consumers here, too. Many physicians who are not the primary contact with patients - like pathologists and radiologists as well as anesthesiologists - do not participate in health insurance plans. When they provide medical services at hospitals or outpatient centers, their charges may not be covered, or may be only partly covered, leaving even well-insured people with large, unexpected bills.
So, what to do if you need a colonoscopy?
CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES Other recommended colon cancer screening methods include the fecal occult blood test, which involves collecting stool samples at home, and sigmoidoscopy, in which a long, flexible tube with a tiny video camera is used to examine the lower colon. Indeed, a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last week found that patients who underwent sigmoidoscopy had lower rates of colon cancer and lower cancer death rates. 
PLAN AHEAD You know when you'll be turning 50, so estimate your costs in advance and put money away in a health savings account, so at least you're not paying taxes on it. (Remember, you may lose the money if you don't use it.)
ASK QUESTIONS When speaking with your gastroenterologist about the procedure, find out what kind of anesthesia will be used and who is going to administer it. If he or she insists on an anesthesiologist or a nurse anesthetist, you have two options: find a gastroenterologist who administers sedation on his or her own, or make sure the anesthesiologist is covered by your plan.

HEADLINE: Veterans Stick With the Republican Nominee

BYLINE: MARJORIE CONNELLY


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney and Barack Obama never served in the military. But that does not seem to have changed veterans' traditional support of Republican candidates. 

 BODY:
President Obama never served, and neither did Mitt Romney. For the first time since World War II, neither presidential nominee is a military veteran. But polling suggests that veterans still have a strong preference for the Republican candidate.
In 2008, military veterans strongly backed Senator John McCain for president. In fact, Mr. McCain's huge advantage among veterans largely fueled his majority support from men in general. 
Mr. McCain, who was a naval aviator during the Vietnam War and spent more than five years as a prisoner of war, received 57 percent of the votes of male veterans while Barack Obama won 42 percent. Among men who had not served in the military, 52 percent backed Mr. Obama and 46 percent preferred Mr. McCain, according to the Edison/Mitofsky national exit poll. 
This year, according to analysis of the Gallupdaily tracking poll, voters who have served in the military strongly support Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, over Mr. Obama, 58 percent to 34 percent. Nonveterans back Mr. Obama, 48 percent to 44 percent.
The candidates are tied at 46 percent among all registered voters in this sample, based on telephone interviews conducted April 11 to May 24. Mr. Romney has an eight-point edge with men and Mr. Obama has a seven-point advantage among women. 
The polling suggests that Mr. Romney's lead among men is fueled largely by his support from veterans. And Mr. Romney will seek to capitalize on that advantage on Monday, when he campaigns with Mr. McCain at a veterans museum in San Diego.
Men who are not military veterans are evenly divided: 46 percent for Mr. Romney and 45 percent for Mr. Obama. But Mr. Romney is backed by of 60 percent of men who have served in the military; 32 percent prefer Mr. Obama. 
The candidate preferences of the 2 percent of women who have served in the military do not differ significantly from those of nonveterans. 
A quarter of adult men are veterans, mostly over 60. Less than 20 percent of men under 50 have served in the military. The military draft was in effect from 1940 to 1973, when the United States converted to an all-volunteer military. 
This analysis is based on Gallup daily tracking poll interviews conducted with 43,352 adults throughout the country April 11 to May 24. The results included 7,133 adults who said they had served in the United States military; 3,327 said they registered to vote. The margin of sampling error for veterans is plus or minus two percentage points.

HEADLINE: Dewey & LeBoeuf Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The bankruptcy filing is the final chapter in a turbulent period for the law firm, which unraveled after disappointing profits and prodigious debt forced it to slash partners' salaries. 

 BODY:
Dewey & LeBoeuf, the law firm crippled by financial miscues and partner defections, filed for bankruptcy on Monday night, punctuating the largest law firm collapse in United States history.
The filing, made in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan, is the final chapter in a turbulent period for Dewey, which came apart after disappointing profits and prodigious debt forced it to slash partners' salaries. The partners, already owed millions from previous years, grew concerned over the firm's finances and their ability to get paid. A partner exodus destroyed the firm.
Dewey announced Monday that the firm planned to liquidate. It said it would ask about 90 employees to remain on staff to assist in the wind-down of its business. The firm has $315 million in liabilities, of which $225 million is owed to its banks, according to the court filings. Other creditors include the firm's landlords and former partners owed money.
"This is a very sad day for the legal profession," said Richard J. Holwell, a former federal judge in Manhattan now in private practice. "Dewey is a fabled firm with a lot of great lawyers and a demise of this magnitude is unprecedented."
With historical roots stretching back a century, Dewey - the product of a 2007 merger between Dewey Ballantine and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae - employed at its peak more than 2,500 people, including roughly 1,400 lawyers in 26 offices across the globe.
Dewey's dissolution has generated a debate across the legal profession: Was its failure an isolated event or emblematic of bigger problems in the corporate-law industry?
Many observers say the root causes of Dewey's fall are not unique. Several of the largest firms have adopted business strategies that Dewey embraced: unfettered growth, often through mergers; the aggressive poaching of lawyers from rivals by offering outsize pay packages; and a widening spread between the salaries of the firm's top partners and its most junior ones.
These trends, they say, have destroyed the fabric of a law firm partnership, where a shared sense of purpose once created willingness to weather difficult times. Many large firms have discarded the traditional notions of partnership - loyalty, collegiality, a sense of equality - and instead transformed themselves into bottom-line, profit-maximizing businesses.
"Because the partnership lacks any shared cultural values or history, money becomes the core value holding the firm together," said William Henderson, a law professor at Indiana University who studies law firms. "Money is weak glue."
Some industry experts say that, in many ways, the turmoil at Dewey reminds them of Finley Kumble, a large, fast-growing New York firm that imploded in 1987. The causes of Finley Kumble's failure - expanding too quickly, borrowing heavily, and paying dearly for prominent talent - mirror the reasons for Dewey's woes.
"Finley Kumble was the canary in the coal mine that now seems forgotten," said Steven J. Harper, a retired partner at Kirkland & Ellis and adjunct law professor at Northwestern University.
Dewey's bankruptcy follows a handful of other big law firm collapses in recent years. In 2008, two large firms in San Francisco, Thelen and Heller Ehrman, imploded in part because of a business slowdown. Last year, Howrey, a Washington firm with more than 500 lawyers, disintegrated after financial difficulties.
"Some big law firm whose leaders think that disaster can never befall it will be next," Mr. Harper said. "We'll be talking about that firm next year."
This year, everybody is talking about Dewey, whose origins date to 1909. Thomas E. Dewey, the former New York governor, came on board in 1955. LeBoeuf, Lamb, started in 1929, was best known for its representation of insurers and utilities. About a decade ago, LeBoeuf began expanding rapidly under the leadership of Steven H. Davis.
In 2007, Mr. Davis approached the leadership of Dewey Ballantine about a merger. The combination created one of New York's largest firms with a powerful global business, but it was struck just as the booming economy started to turn. The 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession crushed Dewey's results. Adding to its woes was a heavy debt load.
Even as Dewey's performance flagged, the firm doled out lavish multiyear, multimillion-dollar guarantees to its top partners and star recruits. The guarantees - there were about 100, with several over $5 million a year - created compensation obligations that the firm could not meet.
The firm had success in the legal arena despite its financial issues.
It represented the players' unions in their court battles with the National Football League and National Basketball Association. The firm advised MetLife in its $12 billion acquisition of Travelers Life and Annuity. Dewey's real estate group represented the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in the World Trade Center redevelopment.
Dewey's collapse has devastated its employees. Hundreds of junior lawyers and support staff are looking for work in a difficult market.
The partners are collectively expected to lose tens of millions of dollars they had tied up in the firm, and could face "clawback" suits from creditors seeking to recover money.
Law firms have seen a decline in demand for legal services since the financial crisis. Large corporate clients, also buffeted by the volatile global economic conditions, have become vigilant about reducing legal expenses. They frequently ask for discounts from their outside law firms, which charge, at the high end, more than $1,000 an hour for a top partner's services.
Yet nearly all of Dewey's partners - about three-quarters of its roughly 300 - have landed at other firms. Thirty-six, for example, have joined DLA Piper, the world's largest firm by head count with more than 4,200 lawyers. DLA is the result of numerous mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures over the last dozen years. It has also been a leader in recruiting top producers away from other firms.
DLA Piper is the biggest of a handful of megafirms that, over the past decade, have transformed themselves from regional practices into global behemoths. These include Greenberg Traurig, a firm with 1,800 lawyers in 35 offices worldwide that was started in Miami. A decade ago, Greenberg had 17 locations and about 800 lawyers. Greenberg has picked up dozens of Dewey lawyers in recent weeks.
The managing partners of these firms are quick to differentiate themselves from Dewey. Frank Burch, the chairman of DLA, said that, unlike Dewey, the firm has not extended any multiyear salary guarantees to its partners, whose pay floats up and down with the performance of the firm. DLA also does not have any long-term debt, he said.
"We have conservatively managed our finances so that we can sustain and grow our business," Mr. Burch said. "Our strategy is to have a presence in key practices and sectors across the globe where our clients need us to be. Growth isn't the strategy; it's a consequence of the strategy."
Not every corporate law firm has embraced these prevailing "Big Law" trends. There remains an elite tier of firms - a group including Davis, Polk & Wardwell and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz - that adheres to a so-called lock-step model of compensation, meaning partners are paid based on seniority, and within a narrow band. These firms also rarely recruit from other firms, but groom talent from within. This group also remains among the most profitable in the country.
"Cravath and others succeed in part because corporate clients are always going to want the opinion of the leading expert in the field and they will be willing to pay top dollar for it," said Michael H. Trotter, a lawyer in Atlanta who has written two books about law firm economics. "They're also culturally strong institutions with partners who are loyal to the firm."
Other successful practices have remained decidedly small. The grandson of Thomas E. Dewey, for example, has his own firm, Dewey Pegno Kramarsky, a litigation boutique in Manhattan that he started in 1998. Thomas E.L. Dewey's 14-lawyer shop, which represents large corporate clients like Credit Suisse and Time Warner, markets itself as a cost-effective alternative to large, expensive firms.
Mr. Dewey, 48, and his relatives no longer have any ties to the firm. Reached this month, he declined to comment on the disaster that befell the firm bearing his grandfather's name.
"Sorry," Mr. Dewey said. "I know you will understand."

HEADLINE: Growing, Strand by Strand

BYLINE: By RON GLUCKMAN

 BODY:
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia - For an Internet start-up, Arjuni faces more challenges than usual.
The e-commerce site that sells hair extensions operates out of a five-story building here that lacks elevators and, sometimes, power. Employees typically have to travel to remote villages by motorbike or foot to pick up the goods that Arjuni sells. And the office floor is cluttered with piles of hair strands instead of computers.
But like many new ventures, Arjuni is harnessing the latest Internet tools like Twitter and social media to build a loyal customer base.
In just two years, the company, founded by Janice Wilson, has grown from a handful of employees to 80, and it now generates more than $1 million in revenue. The start-up is also slowly gaining market share from the industry's dominant players in India and China, as well as retailers in the United States and Europe. 
''We not only buy and collect the hair ourselves, but sell it directly to our customers. This makes us stand out,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''We're small, but considered one of the top brands.''
While hair extensions have been around for decades, they became a fashion craze in recent years, when stars like Paris Hilton and Britney Spears started using them to change their looks. A large proportion of Arjuni customers, like Ms. Wilson, are African-Americans seeking fuller styles for their tresses.
India has long provided much of the world's natural hair, sold to wholesalers mainly in China, which in turn marketed their products to retailers in Europe and the United States. But Ms. Wilson found that Cambodians have similar hair quality, long with cuticles in alignment.
''Probably 99 percent of the world's hair comes from India. Nobody had thought of Cambodia,'' said Ms. Wilson, 39, straddling piles of hair on the floor.
It is a small but potentially profitable niche. The hair extensions business generates annual revenue of $250 million.
Ms. Wilson said it was important to her to have a business serve a social purpose. Many of Arjuni's employees formerly worked in Cambodia's notorious sex trade.
That effort helped attract seed capital from a Japanese investment fund, Arun, formed in 2009 by Satoko Kono to help social enterprises in emerging nations. ''We like how Arjuni is employing women, and helping the needy,'' said Ms. Kono, who spent a decade with development organizations in Cambodia.
Additional money came from the Cambodian Export Market Access Fund, which is a World Bank-financed project that helps companies trying to develop exports. The rest came from her savings, friends and family.
A lawyer by training, Ms. Wilson has built her business by making customers feel engaged in the product via the Internet.
Customers eagerly describe their orders on home videos that they upload on YouTube, with segments on topics like hair design, delivery and grooming. Clients are encouraged to send in pictures of starlets they want to emulate, like Catherine Zeta-Jones or Beyonce. Arjuni also floods Facebook with testimonials and promotions.
''Our clients are fanatical about hair,'' said Tiyana Peters, who oversees social media for Arjuni. ''We get everything from wedding photos afterward to details on how the boyfriends react.''
By dealing direct with customers, Arjuni eliminates the added cost of working through another retailer or site. Extensions can cost thousands of dollars, but typically average around $500.
The Internet has helped with damage control, as well. After rumors spread online that Arjuni was stealing hair or forcing women to sell it, the company began regularly posting more information on its operations on networking sites.
''This was totally untrue. We buy the hair at fair prices, and tried to explain it, but there isn't much you can do,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''Our company grew up in the age of social media,'' she said. ''Social media is huge, and has helped us, but these accusations really stung.''
Her idea for the start-up was an evolution of sorts. Ms. Wilson, originally from Green Bay, Wis., was on vacation in Cambodia four years ago, she began thinking about opportunities to start a business here.
Cambodia was in the midst of an economic boom and had the fastest-growing economy in Asia, after China, for several years running. One of the hottest sectors was real estate. Ms. Wilson, who was working for a real estate firm in Colorado, decided to move to Cambodia, and with local partners, planned a development near the temples of Angkor, the country's top tourist attraction.
When Cambodia's property market suffered along with the global economy, she faced a grim challenge. ''I either had to give up and go back to America, or find something else to do,'' she recalled.
The collapse of Cambodia's textile industry largely as a result of cheap competition from China led to her idea. Cambodian workers with sewing skills were suddenly unemployed, and nobody had looked at Cambodian hair as a marketable material before.
''I was thinking, what is recession-proof?'' Ms. Wilson recalled. The answer: ''vanity.''
The best - and most expensive - hair extensions are made from natural human hair, which is cut, cleaned and sewn into individual pieces. ''It was low-tech, they just needed to learn how to make them, and we just needed sewing machines. We could use the skills already here,'' she said.
The business was also a way to help workers develop marketable skills. Ms. Wilson now provides employees with free English, computer and math classes. A third of workers come from troubled situations like sex trafficking or spousal abuse. ''But we run everything as a business,'' Ms. Wilson said.
Ms. Wilson acknowledged that she and her staff members were extremely ambitious at the outset, ''trying to do everything at once - collection, fabrication and distribution.'' But they have been able to keep up the frenzied pace as the company grew.
''It's definitely been difficult to scale up,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''But it does make us better quality.''
This spring, Arjuni added yet another facet to its operation - a series of in-person events in the United States called Halo, where her staff could meet and help groom customers.
''Do I feel I have aged a lot? Definitely,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''But I love being an entrepreneur. I love the challenges.''
''When I worked in a law office, I was bored out of my mind,'' she added. ''When you have this entrepreneurial spirit, you just have to do it.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Beer and Brotherhood, Marines Remember

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
PFLUGERVILLE, Tex. -- They had no plan, really, just memories. So after a few moments of awkward indecision, the young men ambled single file up to a simple gravestone to pay their respects. Each left behind a red or pale yellow rose, a mumbled word or a salty tear. Lance Cpl. Nickalous N. Aldrich, the stone read. Born Aug. 12, 1983, in Austin. Died Aug. 27, 2004, in Iraq.
A single Marine in dress uniform, sweating under the gauzy sun, raised his sword to his nose and said a silent prayer. Then, as everyone else turned to leave, another Marine wearing cargo shorts and a T-shirt poured the last of his Budweiser onto the grass, crushed the can and laid it beside the flowers.
Every ritual starts somewhere. And for the men of the Second Battalion, Fourth Marine Regiment, which fought in Ramadi, Iraq, this one began four years ago on Memorial Day weekend, when about a dozen veterans decided on the spur of the moment to visit the grave of one of their fallen comrades in a cemetery near Houston. 
Each Memorial Day weekend since, the event has grown via word of mouth, with Marines from the 2-4, most in their 20s, coming from across the country to spend a few days together near cemeteries in places like Nashville or Indianapolis. ''We decided we have to do this for everyone,'' said Richard Cantu, one of the event organizers.
This weekend, about three dozen men, some bringing girlfriends and wives, gathered at a campground along the Gaudalupe River in the hill country of Texas. They spent Saturday drinking beer and whiskey late into the night and telling stories, funny ones and horrible ones.
Other units may have lost more troops over 12- or 15-month deployments, but the 2-4 is widely thought to have taken more casualties -- 34 dead and more than 255 wounded -- than any other American unit during a six-month tour of either Iraq or Afghanistan.
Its 2004 fighting was largely drowned out by the bigger news from nearby Fallujah, where the killing of four contractors led to all-out offensives by other Marine Corps units. As battles raged in Fallujah, drawing intensive news coverage, many insurgents were slipping into Ramadi, where on April 6 they orchestrated a stunningly well-executed ambush on the Marines from the 2-4.
Though a military official told reporters that the fighting in Ramadi was over after a few hours, it continued episodically for days, with about a dozen Marines dying and scores more wounded. The situation would calm down, but the Marines of the 2-4 never really had a peaceful day for the rest of their deployment.
Gabe Henderson, one of the Memorial Day event organizers, said members of the battalion had arrived in Iraq expecting their tour to be about ''winning hearts and minds'' more than combat. They took unarmored Humvees bolstered anemically with sandbags and plywood. But after coming under fire on each patrol, they welded metal bars to the windows to protect drivers from being shot in the face.
''We thought we'd be shaking hands and handing out stuff and not wearing body armor,'' Mr. Henderson said. ''Instead, we were in a firefight every other day.''
The first man wounded that tour was Brian McPherson, who lost much of his jaw from a roadside bomb. Today, 13 facial reconstruction operations later, he raises rodeo bulls on his farm north of Austin. He came to the Memorial Day reunion this year for the first time, coaxing his best friend from the unit, Greg Coats, to come too.
Mr. Coats had gone to work in law enforcement in Oklahoma after leaving the Marine Corps, living an adrenaline-fueled life on the edge. He has crashed his motorcycle at least half a dozen times, and for years he drank to excess, he says. He also had nightmares almost nightly about death and dying in Iraq. A few months ago, he burned his diaries and photographs from Ramadi, hoping the nightmares would stop. They did not.
''I lost some good memories,'' he said of the lost photographs. The reunion helped restore a few, he said, sipping water instead of beer -- an indication, his wife says, that he is healing.
Also in attendance was the family of Lance Corporal Aldrich, who died when he was struck by a Marine Corps vehicle during a lights-out night patrol in Ramadi. His mother, Jonna, a long-haul truck driver, heard the news of his death while at a truck stop in Amarillo.
Standing against a wall at that truck stop, she slumped to the ground as she was given the news by cellphone, jagged stones tearing skin from her back. Years later, during the depths of the recession, she got by financially in part because of insurance and death benefits from Nickalous, the youngest of her three children. An acquaintance told her she was lucky.
''Seriously?'' Ms. Aldrich replied. ''I'd rather be living on the street and have him back.''
For all the unprogrammed qualities of the weekend's activities, the Marines of the 2-4 have begun forming a few of their own Memorial Day rites. Before visiting the cemetery on Sunday, they each autographed a black Jolly Roger flag, the unofficial banner of the 2-4, which since at least the Vietnam War has been known as ''the Magnificent Bastards.'' At the cemetery, they presented the folded flag to Ms. Aldrich.
At the campground, they also created a boozy memorial to Lance Corporal Alrdich: a camping chair adorned with a T-shirt bearing his photograph and empty bottles of Jameson whiskey and Smirnoff vodka.
Next to the chair, a knife with a six-inch blade had been jammed into the bark of a tree by the battalion's former command sergeant major, James E. Booker. From it hung dog tags bearing the names of all the Marines killed in Ramadi: Pfc. Christopher D. Mabry. Staff Sgt. Allan K. Walker. Lance Cpl. Pedro Contreras. And so many others.
Steve Rubeck gently fingered the engraved names as if they were orchid petals. ''This makes it all real,'' he said.
This was Mr. Rubeck's first 2-4 reunion. Hurt by a roadside bomb in Ramadi, he left the Marine Corps in 2005 and now lives in Salt Lake City, where he is an apprentice electrician. He has few friends there, he said, and talks to no one about the war. Yet rarely a day passes when he doesn't think about the friends he lost.
''It hurts, every day,'' he said.
But at this moment he was standing ankle-deep in a river among his old battalion-mates, a cold beer in his left hand, a warm one in the right. He liked this new Memorial Day tradition and was already thinking about attending next year's reunion in Minnesota.
''This helps,'' he said, sitting down in a lawn chair as the cool, replenishing waters of the Guadalupe rushed over his feet.

As another hot summer looms, consumers are once again stocking up on products that promise scientifically formulated sun protection. Only now, amid a steady drumbeat of bad-news stories about global warming, manufacturers are upping the ante with whole new categories of chemically treated products that purport to block ultraviolet light. The products range from clothing and shoes to makeup and umbrellas. There are even sunscreen bikinis that pledge to shield those patches of skin that they actually cover.
But consumers and dermatologists have their doubts. Among those doctors who view this new breed of products as just so much marketing is Dr. Naomi Lawrence, head of procedural dermatology at Cooper University Medical Center in Camden, N.J.
''When it comes to sun protection, you really can't beat a dark shirt with a tight weave and a good hat,'' she said. ''There is a lot you can do and not spend a lot of money.'' 
Which is not to say that many UV-protective products do not do what they promise. UV-protective clothing -- once the realm of specialty retailers catering to skin cancer patients, but now a hot seller for brands like the Gap, Izod, Uniqlo and Lands End -- add protection by infusing fabric with chemicals that absorb UV rays, like titanium dioxide or Tinosorb. Sunscreen-infused laundry additives work the same way. With the infusion, summer-ready materials like cotton and linen can keep harmful rays from reaching the skin, even if the fabric is white, yellow or light blue, for example.
Because standard clothing must be densely woven or dark colored to offer advanced UV protection, these specially treated clothes are ''good if you want something long-sleeved that is also lightweight,'' Dr. Lawrence said.
But as sun-protective clothing has made its way into the mainstream, seemingly obvious features like sleeves have occasionally been sacrificed, defeating part of the purpose. Lesser offenses include shorts and sleeveless shirts, while items like bikinis -- which claim to offer the maximum degree of sun protection -- might be a bit of a stretch.
Consumers seem understandably puzzled by these UV-protective wares, perhaps buying them with fingers crossed. ''I have used this product occasionally for several years with the hope that it works,'' said one reviewer on Amazon.com for Sun Guard, a laundry treatment that says it puts ''an invisible shield into clothing that helps block more than 96 percent of the sun's harmful rays from reaching your skin.'' The reviewer added, ''Preferring white shirts for outdoor activities, I trust that this dye is blocking UV radiation, but I can't say for sure.''
To some critics, introducing chemicals to a naturally sun-protective category like clothing seems wasteful. ''Our recommendation is that you stick to clothes with tighter weave and that will provide adequate UPF protection,'' said David Andrews, a senior researcher with the Environmental Working Group, which compiles an annual guide to sunscreens. ''Not to mention there's no need to do a full load of wash with all your undergarments and everything to make them UPF protected.''
The Food and Drug Administration briefly regulated sun-protective clothes in the early 1990s, classifying them as medical devices. While it no longer does that, the Federal Trade Commission does monitor marketing claims about garments and sun protection. A measurement called UPF, or ultraviolet protection factor, is the standard for UV-protective clothing. Developed in 2001 by ASTM International, a product-testing agency, a UPF ranges from 1 to 50, with 50 being the most UV light that is blocked by a garment.
The F.D.A. does continue to regulate claims made by traditional sunscreens, which will soon undergo the first significant changes in decades. Manufacturers will have to show that their products protect against both UVB rays, which cause burns, and UVA rays, which are linked to skin cancers. Gone will be labels of ''waterproof'' or ''sweatproof,'' and lotions will have to indicate how often they need to be reapplied. Originally slated to go into effect in June, the new labeling requirements have been delayed until December to give manufacturers time to comply.
Other products that are not traditionally associated with sun protection seem to be marketed to imply that they can do more than they can deliver. Sun-related claims are now common among hair products, like TRESeme's ''Climate Control'' shampoo and conditioner, which both use ingredients like olive oil, keratin and a UV-blocking chemical called avobenzone to prevent frizz and drying. Outside of those benefits, the products offer no actual UV protection, according to the company.
But keeping your hair bouncy and protecting your scalp from the sun are different things, dermatologists say. ''The UV-protection for your hair will obviously not prevent skin cancer,'' said Dr. D'Anne M. Kleinsmith, a dermatologist in West Bloomfield, Mich., ''but it will prevent hair color from fading and protect the hair so that it does not become dry and brittle from the sun.''
One risk to the proliferation of sun-protective marketing language (Pink Ladybug Water Shoes with UPF 50, anyone?) is that consumers may be lulled into a false sense of security, said Dr. Lawrence of Cooper University Medical Center. For example, cosmetics companies now sell foundation with SPF protection. Neutrogena's Healthy Skin Compact Makeup SPF 55, to use one example, includes avobenzone, the same chemical found in TRESemme's climate control line.
While these products may reflect UV rays, Dr. Lawrence said, rarely do women wear enough foundation for the protective properties to kick in. ''You have to put sunscreen on pretty thick,'' she said. So, to wear enough foundation as sunscreen, ''you'd look like you had it caked on.'' Better to apply an actual sunscreen, then foundation, she said.
While no one tracks sales of sun-protective products across categories, the market for them is clearly growing, said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst with the NPD Group, a research company.
''Coming out of the recession, consumers are looking at products with a greater level of scrutiny and greater expectations,'' he said. ''They want their products to do more than just one thing, not just to look good, but to travel well and to match their lifestyle and to protect them from the environment.''
Also fueling demand are new technologies that allow chemicals to be added to thinner fabrics. Dr. Heidi Waldorf, a dermatologist at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, recalls wearing earlier, less stylish UV-protective clothing.
''I looked like I escaped from a nuclear site,'' she said of the head-to-toe attire she wore on a bike trip through the Canadian Rockies 10 years ago. ''But I never got burned.''

HEADLINE: After Facebook, More Fear of Stock Market

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
The excitement surrounding Facebook's initial public offering was enough for Alex Tsesis, a law professor, to give the stock market one more try. But after the company's stock encountered technical problems then sputtered for three days, he sold his few hundred shares for a $2,200 loss and vowed to end his equity gambles for good.
''I'm just extremely skeptical about the ability of a retail purchaser to be able to play on a level field in the market,'' said Mr. Tsesis, who is 45 and lives in Chicago. ''I'm just trying to get out of stocks.'' 
Mr. Tsesis is part of a growing retreat from the stock market, a trend that began before the Facebook debut. The portion of Americans invested in the stock market dropped this year to its lowest level since Gallup started asking, every two years, in 1998 -- 53 percent said they were in the market in April, compared with a high of 67 percent in 2002 and 65 percent as recently as 2007, before the financial crisis. A Bankrate poll in April found that only 17 percent of respondents were more likely to invest in the stock market, even with the small amount of interest they earn on bank deposits.
The financial industry had hoped that Facebook, the highly anticipated and biggest-ever tech offering, would rekindle ordinary investors' excitement in stocks. Instead, first-day trading snags, a 16 percent decline in the new stock's price and suggestions that warnings were exchanged among professional investors about Facebook's prospects have stoked fears that the stock market may not be safe for everyone.
''This added gasoline to a fire that was already burning,'' said Craig Ferrantino, the president of the financial advisory Craig James Financial Services in Melville, N.Y. .
Mr. Ferrantino recounted a breakfast for his clients shortly after the offering in which the biggest topic of discussion was what the Facebook deal had revealed and the sense that ''the deck is stacked against them.''
Perhaps the best indicator of the broader movement away from stocks is an annual survey done by the Investment Company Institute, which has shown that the percentage of American households invested in domestic stocks, including directly or through any other vehicle whether through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, has fallen every year since the financial crisis to a low in 2011 of 46.4 percent, down from a high of 53 percent in 2001.
Stocks remain favored by millions of Americans who invest big parts of their retirement savings in them, and investors who have held the course have benefited from the 29 percent rise in the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since the beginning of 2009. This does not include the dividends that would have been earned.
For decades, participation in the stock markets increased as 401(k) retirement plans grew in popularity and retail brokers created easier access for small traders. The Dow Jones industrial average rose an average of 8.4 percent each year from 1950 to 2000, with some extended periods of little to no growth.
Since then, though, the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2001 followed by the financial crisis in 2008 have created a so-called lost decade in which broad stock indexes wound up not that far beyond where they started.
Small investors are part of a bigger flight from American stocks. Institutional investors like high-frequency traders have been drawn to other assets like currencies, and pension funds have shifted more money into alternatives, like private equity investments. This has led to a steady decline in the volume of trading in the American stock market and a drop in revenue for New York financial firms. But it has also raised broader questions about the prospects of a market that has long been the central cog for American companies raising money to grow and create jobs.
''If investors lose confidence then capital formation doesn't function as well,'' said David Weild, a former vice chairman of Nasdaq, and the founder of Capital Markets Advisory Partners.
Among the ordinary investors who are helping drive this shift, the motivations are varied. Some are retiring and making a conservative move to less risky assets like bonds. Others are put off by the economic uncertainty as Europe fails to find solutions to its debt problems. But there has also been a growing din of complaints about the flaws in the structure of the markets -- as displayed by the Facebook debut.
Robert Diepersloot, a dairy farmer in Madera, Calif., said that watching the Facebook offering confirmed all the fears and suspicions that led him earlier this year to take out the savings, in the five figures, that he and his wife had invested in stocks and stock mutual funds and move it into real estate investments.
''We just pulled out completely,'' Mr. Diepersloot said. ''We've lost trust in the whole scenario.''
Mr. Diepersloot's wife, Willemina, said that there was no one event that drove the family out of stocks, just a disappointment with recent returns and a slow erosion of faith in the reliability of the market.
Finance industry professionals are wondering what might persuade Mr. Diepersloot and others like him to change their minds, given that the stock market's rise over the last three years has not done the job. Many insiders say that may happen only if interest rates begin to rise, after years of falling, and drive down the value of bonds, which is where investors have shifted.
Facebook's stock offering appeared to be doing the job of drumming up interest before it went awry. At one discount broker, ShareBuilder, the number of new accounts opened was 20 times the average and trading activity was up about 50 percent on May 18 across all discount brokers, according to Richard Repetto, a Sandler O'Neill analyst who researches brokers.
Fuad Ahmed, the chief executive of the discount broker Just2Trade, said that by the end of Friday about 80 percent of the customers who had bought Facebook dumped it.
By Mr. Repetto's analysis, trading activity at the retail brokers on the Monday after the I.P.O. was back where it had been before Facebook began trading.

HEADLINE: The Role of Uncle Sam

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
From the dawn of the republic, the federal government has played a vital role in American economic life. Government promoted industrial development in the 18th century, transportation in the 19th, communications in the 20th and biotechnology today.
But the federal role has historically been sharply limited. The man who initiated that role, Alexander Hamilton, was a nationalist. His primary goal was to enhance national power and eminence, not to make individuals rich or equal. 
This version of economic nationalism meant that he and the people who followed in his path -- the Whigs, the early Republicans and the early progressives -- focused on long-term structural development, not on providing jobs right now. They had their sights on the horizon, building the infrastructure, education and research facilities required for future greatness. This nationalism also led generations of leaders to assume that there is a rough harmony of interests between capital and labor. People in this tradition reject efforts to divide the country between haves and have-nots.
Finally, this nationalism meant that policy emphasized dynamism, and opportunity more than security, equality and comfort. While European governments in the 19th and early 20th centuries focused on protecting producers and workers, the U.S. government focused more on innovation and education.
Because of these priorities, and these restrictions on the federal role, the government could be energetic without ever becoming gigantic. Through the 19th century, the federal government consumed about 4 percent of the national gross domestic product in peacetime. Even through the New Deal, it consumed less than 10 percent.
Meanwhile, America prospered.
But this Hamiltonian approach has been largely abandoned. The abandonment came in three phases. First, the progressive era. The progressives were right to increase regulations to protect workers and consumers. But the late progressives had excessive faith in the power of government planners to rationalize national life. This was antithetical to the Hamiltonian tradition, which was much more skeptical about how much we can know and much more respectful toward the complexity of the world.
Second, the New Deal. Franklin Roosevelt was right to energetically respond to the Depression. But the New Deal's dictum -- that people don't eat in the long run; they eat every day -- was eventually corrosive. Politicians since have paid less attention to long-term structures and more to how many jobs they ''create'' in a specific month. Americans have been corrupted by the allure of debt, sacrificing future development for the sake of present spending and tax cuts.
Third, the Great Society. Lyndon Johnson was right to use government to do more to protect Americans from the vicissitudes of capitalism. But he made a series of open-ended promises, especially on health care. He tried to bind voters to the Democratic Party with a web of middle-class subsidies.
In each case, a good impulse was taken to excess. A government that was energetic and limited was turned into one that is omnidirectional and fiscally unsustainable. A government that was trusted and oriented around long-term visions is now distrusted because it tries to pander to the voters' every momentary desire. A government that devoted its resources toward future innovation and development now devotes its resources to health care for the middle-class elderly.
I've taken this tour through history because we are having a big debate about what government's role should be, so, of course, we are having a debate about what government's role has been. Two of the country's most provocative writers have taken stabs at describing that history -- imperfectly in my view -- in order to point a way forward.
In his illuminating new book, ''Land of Promise,'' the political historian Michael Lind celebrates the Hamiltonian tradition, but, in his telling, Hamiltonianism segues into something that looks like modern liberalism. But the Hamiltonian tradition differs from liberalism in fundamental ways.
In his engrossing new book, ''Our Divided Political Heart,'' E.J. Dionne, my NPR pundit partner, argues that the Hamiltonian and Jacksonian traditions formed part of a balanced consensus, which has been destroyed by the radical individualists of today's Republican Party. But that balanced governing philosophy was destroyed gradually over the 20th century, before the Tea Party was even in utero. As government excessively overreached, Republicans became excessively antigovernment.
We're not going back to the 19th-century governing philosophy of Hamilton, Clay and Lincoln. But that tradition offers guidance. The question is not whether government is inherently good or evil, but what government does.
Does government encourage long-term innovation or leave behind long-term debt for short-term expenditure? Does government nurture an enterprising citizenry, or a secure but less energetic one?
If the U.S. doesn't modernize its governing institutions, the nation will stagnate. The ghost of Hamilton will be displeased.

HEADLINE: You Can Change the Channel, But the Local News Is Identical

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
SAN ANGELO, Tex. -- Call a reporter at the CBS television station here, and it might be an anchor for the NBC station who calls back. Or it might be the news director who runs both stations' news operations.
The stations here compete for viewers, but they cooperate in gathering the news -- maintaining technically separate ownership, but sharing office space, news video and even the scripts written for their nightly news anchors. That is why viewers see the same segments on car accidents, the same interviews with local politicians, the same high school sports highlights.
The same kind of sharing takes place in dozens of other cities, from Burlington, Vt., where the Fox and ABC stations sometimes share anchors, to Honolulu, where the NBC and CBS stations broadcast the same morning show. The changes have drawn the ire of critics, who charge that there are fewer and fewer journalists actually covering local news. The agreements behind this sharing are also attracting the attention of another group of viewers -- federal regulators.
Amid stiff competition for advertising revenue, these agreements are a ''survival strategy'' for weak stations, said Perry Sook, the chairman and chief executive of Nexstar, which owns the CBS station here, KLST. 
The rise of the agreements resembles the retrenchment of the American newspaper industry, but it has been far less publicized.
The Federal Communications Commission does not know how many agreements exist between stations, making it impossible to judge their effects. But Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman, indicated last week that the commission was beginning to study the issue. ''It's something we're taking a close look at the F.C.C.'' he said. He sounded especially curious about what he called behind-the-scenes cooperation between stations that collaboratively sell ads and negotiate contracts with distributors.
Even as Internet use rises, local television remains the No. 1 source of news for most Americans. There's an honored history -- parodied in the film ''Anchorman'' -- of competition between stations, just as there used to be between newspapers in some major cities.
But the owners of stations have gradually reduced costs and, arguably, competition. Building on the longtime sharing of cameras and helicopters by stations, the first ''shared services agreements,'' for newsrooms, and ''local marketing agreements,'' for ad sales, were put in place more than a decade ago.
They became more commonplace, according to local TV executives, during the recession, when stations suffered mightily and reduced their news staffs, even while adding newscasts to create more opportunities for advertisers. The agreements enabled some stations to carry out further layoffs, and they continue apace, most recently in Toledo earlier this spring.
A University of Delaware study last year found versions of the agreements in at least 83 of the nation's 210 television markets. (''It is remarkable that neither the F.C.C., nor any commercial media data company, has an accurate picture of the phenomenon,'' the study's authors wrote.)
The agreements are more prevalent in smaller markets, although even cities as large as Denver have them. There, the study found, newscasts on the Fox station and the CW station had the same stories, scripts and graphics more than half the time.
The sharing is evident, too, in San Angelo, a low-rise city of 93,000 where the market price of West Texas intermediate crude is shown before the Dow, and where hunting and fishing times are shown after the weather report.
The anchors are different at the NBC station KSAN and the CBS station KLST, but they read similar scripts in side-by-side studios. It's almost comical, for a viewer flipping the channel back and forth, to see identical segments about spot news and health. (The weather segments, however, have different graphics and hosts.)
The anchors and reporters at the stations declined interview requests, citing company policy. But Mr. Sook said the stations were a ''perfect example of the purpose of a shared services agreement.'' Without the agreement, he said, KSAN would have no local news at all, because it would not be profitable.
Together, the two stations employ about 35 people. They jointly decide what news stories to cover.
''I don't mean for this to be a criticism, but it really cuts down on competition,'' said Ty Meighan, a former reporter for The San Angelo Standard-Times who is now a spokesman for the city. ''Competition makes the media better.''
KLST and KSAN have the only local television news in town. The Fox station in town, KIDY, rebroadcasts the news from San Antonio, a four-hour drive away. On the bottom of the screen, headlines from local newspapers scroll by, the product of another kind of a shared services agreement -- this time with the E.W. Scripps Company, the owner of the papers.
DuJuan McCoy, the owner of KIDY, said he believed such arrangements were necessary in small markets. It can cost up to $1 million to run a TV news operation in a market the size of San Angelo's. ''It is very difficult, if not impossible, to generate enough revenue to justify the expense for a locally produced newscast,'' he said.
Advertisers, he and other television executives say, have new options nowadays, including their own Web sites and pages on social media sites, which cut out the TV middlemen. KLST and KSAN are like two flavors of ice cream, chocolate and mint chocolate chip -- intended to attract more people than just one flavor would.
Public interest groups have criticized the cutbacks at local newsrooms because they reduce the number of editorial voices in a given market. They assert that because TV stations hold licenses to the public airwaves, they have a responsibility to serve local communities. ''The same cookie-cutter content above a different graphic doesn't cut it,'' said Craig Aaron, the head of Free Press, a nonprofit media reform group that has gathered case studies of sharing by stations.
''Worst of all, maybe, is that we'll never know what's missing -- what dirt isn't being dug up, what questions aren't asked, what stories are going uncovered,'' Mr. Aaron said, calling the sharing ''covert consolidation.''
Some station owners say they would prefer to have more overt consolidation. They share, they say, because federal media ownership rules forbid them from outright ownership of more than one of the top stations in a single market. (Many exceptions exist, however, called duopolies.)
If Nexstar could own both KLST and KSAN in San Angelo, for instance, ''we could generate further efficiencies,'' Mr. Sook said, ''and some of that additional operating income would be reinvested into the local news product.'' That outcome, however, would still diminish the media diversity of the market, a major goal of the government's ownership rules, which are now undergoing a review.
Either way, for some people, the dearth of competition is an opportunity. For Mr. Meighan, the San Angelo city spokesman, having just one TV reporter at City Council meetings (rather than three or four) gives him more reason to reach citizens directly through a city-produced cable channel and YouTube channel.
''What we try to do -- what we've had to do, really -- is get our message out through other means,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Consumer: Waking Up to Major Colonoscopy Bills

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
Patients who undergo colonoscopy usually receive anesthesia of some sort in order to ''sleep'' through the procedure. But as one Long Island couple discovered recently, it can be a very expensive nap.
Both husband and wife selected gastroenterologists who participated in their insurance plan to perform their cancer screenings. But in both cases, the gastroenterologists chose full anesthesia with Propofol, a powerful drug that must be administered by an anesthesiologist, instead of moderate, or ''conscious,'' sedation that often gastroenterologists can administer themselves.
And in both cases, the gastroenterologists were assisted in the procedure by anesthesiologists who were not covered by the couple's insurance. They billed the couple's insurance at rates far higher than any plan would reimburse - two to four times as high, experts say.
Now the couple, Lawrence LaRose and Susan LaMontagne, of Sag Harbor, N.Y., are fending off lawyers and a debt collection agency, and facing thousands of dollars in unresolved charges. All this for a cancer screening test that public health officials say every American should have by age 50, and repeat every 10 years, to save lives - and money. 
''Doctors adopt practices that cost more, insurers pay less, and patients get stuck with a tab that in many cases is inflated and arbitrary,'' said Ms. LaMontagne, whose communications firm, Public Interest Media Group, is focused on health care. ''I work on health care access issues every day, so if I'm having a hard time sorting this out, what does that say for other consumers?''
More than 20 million outpatient endoscopy procedures are performed in the United States each year, and the number is growing. A few hardy patients decide that they do not need anesthesia at all. Most receive conscious sedation, a combination of drugs that block pain and help patients relax while remaining conscious; three gastroenterology societies recommend this option as adequate in cases where there are no complications.
Still, a growing number of patients appear to be receiving full anesthesia. Some gastroenterologists say that patients recover more easily after full anesthesia and that the exam is better. But there is no clear scientific evidence to support this, and critics say that an extra pair of hands in the room simply allows the doctor to perform more procedures.
According to a study by the RAND Corporation, published this year in The Journal of the American Medical Association, use of anesthesia administered by an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist during outpatient gastroenterology procedures, mostly colonoscopies, has more than doubled in recent years, to more than 30 percent in 2009 from 14 percent in 2003. Most of the increase occurred among low-risk patients who could do without the expensive service. But the practice varies from region to region: Only 13 percent of gastrointestinal procedures in the West involved an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist, compared with 59 percent in the Northeast, the study found.
As much as $1.1 billion spent on anesthesia for gastrointestinal procedures each year may not be medically necessary, the researchers concluded. Insurers often foot the bill for full anesthesia, but not always.
Mr. LaRose, 48, said that he did not want to have full anesthesia in the first place. After his first consultation with the doctor, he said, he called his gastroenterologist's office and told a staff member of his preference.
But when he showed up for the colonoscopy on June 24, 2010, his doctor, Dr. Kristin Patrick Naso, told him the procedure is normally done with Propofol, which requires an anesthesiologist. By then Mr. LaRose had already spent 24 hours fasting and going through the unpleasant cleansing preparation, he said.
Mr. LaRose said he relented after the doctors assured him that anesthesiology would be covered. ''You're starving and gaseous and you just want to get the whole thing over with,'' Mr. LaRose said.
In an interview, Dr. Naso said his office provided all patients with a notice saying that the anesthesiologist might not be covered by insurance and providing the anesthesiologist's phone number for more information.
Although Dr. Naso was in network and accepted payment from Mr. LaRose's insurer as payment in full, the anesthesiologist, Dr. Michael Rus, billed $1,600 for the procedure. He was reimbursed $588 by the plan and, after failing to collect the remainder from Mr. LaRose, sent the balance to bill collectors.
Dr. Rus did not respond to requests for comment.
It was a similar situation when Ms. LaMontagne went for her colonoscopy. She said she told Dr. Michael Krumholz in Manhattan about her husband's experience and her concerns about a lack of coverage for full anesthesia. She said she was not told about conscious sedation, which is not available at his practice. Instead, Ms. LaMontagne said, she was told that full anesthesia was standard practice. She went ahead with the procedure in February.
Dr. Krumholz accepted $192 from Ms. LaMontagne's insurance company, Freelancers Insurance Company, which is affiliated with the Freelancers Union. But the insurer rejected the bill from the anesthesiologist, Dr. Joanne Goldman, because she is out of network.
So Dr. Goldman's charge was sent to Ms. LaMontagne: $2,800. She called Dr. Krumholz's office to ask about this charge and any others of which she might be unaware. She said she was told there would also be an additional ''facility fee'' of $1,800 charged by the endoscopy clinic.
In an interview, Dr. Goldman said she did not do the billing herself and could not address questions about it.
In an e-mail, Dr. Krumholz said that he tells all of his patients about the risks and benefits of colonoscopy, as well as alternatives to the procedure, and of the benefits of and alternatives to anesthesia. He will perform the procedure without anesthesia if the patient so chooses, he said, but his practice does not offer conscious sedation, nor do ''most modern endoscopy facilities in New York.''
Jordan Fowler, chief executive of Frontier Healthcare and business manager of the endoscopy center where Dr. Krumholz practices, said Ms. LaMontagne ''should not lose sleep'' over the charges because the anesthesiologists in the group are about to become in-network providers.
Asked whether a $2,800 charge is reasonable for about 30 minutes of anesthesia, he said, ''You bill a high fee to negotiate with an insurance company.''
Sara Horowitz, founder and executive director of the Freelancers Union, said the trend toward using two doctors for a colonoscopy is ''outrageous, when we have another perfectly good kind of anesthesia, twilight sleep, that the GI can do him- or herself.''
But there's a bigger problem for consumers here, too. Many physicians who are not the primary contact with patients - like pathologists and radiologists as well as anesthesiologists - do not participate in health insurance plans. When they provide medical services at hospitals or outpatient centers, their charges may not be covered, or may be only partly covered, leaving even well-insured people with large, unexpected bills.
So, what to do if you need a colonoscopy?
CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES Other recommended colon cancer screening methods include the fecal occult blood test, which involves collecting stool samples at home, and sigmoidoscopy, in which a long, flexible tube with a tiny video camera is used to examine the lower colon. Indeed, a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last week found that patients who underwent sigmoidoscopy had lower rates of colon cancer and lower cancer death rates.
PLAN AHEAD You know when you'll be turning 50, so estimate your costs in advance and put money away in a health savings account, so at least you're not paying taxes on it. (Remember, you may lose the money if you don't use it.)
ASK QUESTIONS When speaking with your gastroenterologist about the procedure, find out what kind of anesthesia will be used and who is going to administer it. If he or she insists on an anesthesiologist or a nurse anesthetist, you have two options: find a gastroenterologist who administers sedation on his or her own, or make sure the anesthesiologist is covered by your plan.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Gunfire Is Heard And Pinpointed, But Technology Is Argued Over

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE

 BODY:
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- At 7:22:07 p.m. on a recent Thursday, an electronic alarm went off in the soundproof control room of a suburban office building here.
A technician quickly focused on the computer screen, where the words ''multiple gunshots'' appeared in large type. She listened to a recording of the shots -- the tat-tat-tat-tat-tat of five rounds from a small-caliber weapon -- and zoomed in on a satellite map to see where the gun had been fired: North 23rd Street in Milwaukee, 2,200 miles away.
At 7:23:48, the technician, satisfied that the sounds were gunshots, sent an alert to the Milwaukee Police Department. Less than two minutes later, or at 9:25:02 p.m. Wisconsin time, a tactical team arrived at the address to find five .22-caliber shell casings and a bleeding 15-year-old boy who had been shot in the arm. The casings, said Chris Blaszak, a detective assigned to the department's intelligence fusion center, were found within 17 feet of where the alert had placed the gunman. Total elapsed time: 3 minutes, 55 seconds. 
Milwaukee is one of an increasing number of cities around the country -- just under 70 to date, including some in the New York area -- that are using a gunshot detection system called ShotSpotter to pinpoint the location of gunfire seconds after it occurs. Last year, the company that developed ShotSpotter began offering a more affordable system, and that has brought in new clients and led other cities to consider trying it.
The detection system, which triangulates sound picked up by acoustic sensors placed on buildings, utility poles and other structures, is part of a wave of technological advances that is transforming the way police officers do their jobs.
But like other technologies, including license plate scanners, body cameras and GPS trackers, the gunshot-detection system has also inspired debate.
In at least one city, New Bedford, Mass., where sensors recorded a loud street argument that accompanied a fatal shooting in December, the system has raised questions about privacy and the reach of police surveillance, even in the service of reducing gun violence.
And with recession-plagued police departments having to cut personnel and services, some cities have questioned the system's benefits relative to its cost. The Detroit City Council last year rejected the Police Department's proposal for a three-year, $2.6 million contract, with one council member objecting that not enough officers were available to respond to the alerts.
Cities that installed ShotSpotter in the past bought the equipment and managed the alerts themselves, a model that often involved laying out hundreds of thousands of dollars. But the company now offers a subscription plan for a yearly fee of $40,000 to $60,000 per square mile that includes round-the-clock monitoring of alerts by trained reviewers here in Mountain View.
Many police officials say the system has significantly improved response time for crimes involving firearms and has increased community confidence and helped deter gun crime by demonstrating that the police can show up quickly at the right place.
The technology, they say, has given officers critical information about what to expect upon arriving at a crime scene -- like whether a gun was fired from a car and if so, how fast and in what direction the car was traveling -- and has offered a level of precision in locating gunfire rarely afforded by 911 calls.
Sgt. Chris Bolton of the Oakland, Calif., Police Department, which has installed ShotSpotter in high-crime neighborhoods in East and West Oakland, said that before the system was in place, ''a patrol officer would receive a gunshot call from the community and you could spend up to 30 minutes driving within, I would say, three to four blocks of that location, just to make sure there isn't a victim in need of assistance, a crime ongoing or any evidence.''
If nothing else, ShotSpotter has made it clear how much unreported gunfire takes place on city streets. In many high-crime urban neighborhoods, gunshots are a counterpoint to daily life, ''as common as the birds chirping,'' as Cmdr. Mikail Ali of the San Francisco Police Department put it.
But whether out of apathy, fear or uncertainty, people call the police in only a fraction of cases.
In the Bayview-Hunter's Point neighborhood of San Francisco, for example, where one square mile is covered by ShotSpotter sensors, only 10 percent of the verified incidents of gunfire detected by the system were accompanied by 911 calls, Commander Ali said. In Oakland, Sergeant Bolton said, only 22 percent of the verified gunfire the system detected over a three-month period was also reported by residents.
Chief Chris Magnus of Richmond, Calif., a community of 120,000 north of Berkeley that routinely ranks among country's most violent cities, recalled listening to a ShotSpotter recording of a gun battle in 2010 that involved more than 100 rounds fired from four guns.
''It was just mind-boggling,'' he said. ''This is like 11 at night on a summer night, and nobody even called it in.''
The technology was developed in the 1990s by Robert Showen, an engineer who hoped it might help address an increase in gun-related homicides in East Palo Alto, Calif. As it has evolved, it has become more accurate, the company says, with fewer false positives and false negatives. The challenge for the system is to distinguish rounds of gunfire from other sharp noises like backfires, firecrackers or the thwap-thwap-thwap of a helicopter's propeller. ShotSpotter's alerts label the recorded event and attach a probability that the identification is correct.
A 2006 study of test shots fired at the Charleston Navy Yard, conducted at the company's request and financed by the National Institute of Justice, found that ShotSpotter correctly detected 99.6 percent of 234 gunshots at 23 firing locations. The system also located 90.9 percent of the shots to within 40 feet.
Still, some criminal justice experts say that how well the technology works and how essential it is to police departments has yet to be proved.
''Whether this will be seen long-term as a short-term law enforcement fad or fundamental to the way police work, that, I think, is the question,'' said Peter Scharf, a criminologist at Tulane University. ''I don't think the effectiveness or efficiency arguments have been settled quite yet.''
But Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit group in Washington, said that especially in cities like Richmond, where gun violence is frequent and police response time can make a difference, the use of ShotSpotter makes sense. ''I think it's a real advantage,'' he said.
Over the course of several hours on two recent evenings in the control room here in Mountain View, reviewers listened to recordings identified as gunfire, backfire or firecrackers in 13 cities, including Oakland; Panama City, Fla.; Wilmington, N.C.; and Milwaukee. In each case they decided whether an alert was accurate, and those judged to be valid were sent on to the cities' police departments.
Sgt. Eric Smith of the Richmond Police Department said that in ShotSpotter alerts, he has heard in the background ''doors slamming, birds chirping, cars on the highway, horns honking.''
In New Bedford, the ShotSpotter recording of the street argument is likely to play a role in the case against two men, Jonathan Flores and Jason Denison, who are charged with murder in the killing of Michael Pina on Dec. 2.
At a bail hearing in January, an assistant district attorney said the system had recorded arguing and yelling on the corner of Dartmouth and Matthew Streets.
Frank Camera, the lawyer for Mr. Flores, said that if the prosecution used the recording as evidence, the issue of privacy could be raised under the state's wiretapping statute. Mr. Denison's lawyer, Kathleen Curley, said she planned to file a motion to that effect on behalf of her client.
Mr. Camera said that whether he, too, would argue that the recording constituted a privacy violation depended on what is on the tape.
In one section, he said, a voice can be heard saying ''No, Jason! No, Jason!'' -- a statement that could help his client -- but in other parts the words cannot be easily distinguished. He said he was having the tape enhanced to try to clarify it.
In any case, Mr. Camera said, the new technology is ''opening up a whole can of worms.''
''If the police are utilizing these conversations, then the issue is, where does it stop?'' he said.
Sam Sutter, the district attorney in Bristol County, Mass., called ShotSpotter ''an extremely valuable tool'' that had helped his office bring charges in four nonfatal shootings.
''In my view legally,'' he said, ''what is said and picked up by the ShotSpotter recording does not have the expectation of privacy because it's said out in public, and so I think that will turn out to be admissible evidence.''
James G. Beldock, a vice president at ShotSpotter, said that the system was not intended to record anything except gunshots and that cases like New Bedford's were extremely rare. ''There are people who perceive that these sensors are triggered by conversations, but that is just patently not true,'' he said. ''They don't turn on unless they hear a gunshot.''

HEADLINE: Euro Isn't Loved, but Few Want to Drop It, Poll Says

BYLINE: By PAUL GEITNER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- More than two years into a euro crisis that has toppled governments and sown economic pain, citizens of five euro zone countries -- including Greece -- say the euro has not been a good thing for them, but nevertheless do not want to go back to their old currencies, according to a survey to be released Tuesday.
Greece, the country most at risk of falling out of the euro, typified the contradiction. There, people were most likely to say that their country had been weakened by European economic integration. Yet support for the euro was highest, the poll found, perhaps showing Greek preferences as they head into new parliamentary elections on June 17 that could determine their future in the currency union. 
In fact, despite the financial troubles currently facing Europe, majorities in the five euro zone countries in the survey favored keeping the single currency, ranging from 52 percent in Italy to 71 percent in Greece, according to the poll, which was carried out by the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project.
The survey did not explain the seeming contradiction in people's attitudes, but Bruce Stokes, director of global economic attitudes at the Pew Research Center in Washington, suggested that risk aversion might play a role.
''They realize it would be a leap into the dark'' to lose the euro, he said.
The survey covered the eight countries in all with 75 percent of the 500 million people in the European Union: Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Greece, which are part of the euro area, and Britain, Poland and Czech Republic, which are not. Questions were asked from March 17 to April 16 of about 1,000 people in each country; the margin of sampling error ranged from plus or minus three to four percentage points.
The poll also showed Germany to be the most admired country and its leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel, to be the most respected, despite her unrelenting push for more fiscal rectitude across the Europe. Least admired was Greece.
And support for providing bailouts to crisis-stricken countries diverged in what seemed to be a reversal of popular perceptions.
The poll found that 49 percent of Germans were in favor of providing aid, up from 42 percent when the question was asked two years ago. Mr. Stokes noted that the opposition Social Democrats and the Greens, who have been rising in opinion polls there, have been largely supportive of European integration and rescuing the euro, something that is not generally reflected in statements by Ms. Merkel and her center-right government.
In France, where concern about that country's economic situation has grown, support for bailouts slid to 44 percent, from 53 percent in spring 2010.
''There's a direct connection between your perception of the economy and your perception of integration,'' Mr. Stokes said. ''Right now, people are in the midst of a declining economy and very upset about it, and it appears that it influences their willingness to help each other, which has consequences.''
Doubts about the benefits of membership in the European Union seem to be growing almost everywhere as the euro crisis drags on, indicating fresh political risks for European leaders debating how to stabilize the currency and secure the bloc's future.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the exception to the trend was Germany, where the economy has held up relatively well and unemployment is at a post-unification low.
Despite the virtual collapse of the Greek economy, the percentage of Greeks who said having the euro has been a ''good thing'' for their country was 46 percent, with the rest roughly divided between ''bad thing'' or ''neither.'' In Italy, just 30 percent called it a good thing, and just 31 percent in France.
For a rough comparison, the autumn 2011 Eurobarometer, done for the European Commission, found 53 percent of people across the Europe in favor of the single currency, down from 63 percent in the spring of 2007, before the global financial crisis began.
Asked what kind of threat the economic problems in countries like Greece and Italy posed to them at home, 71 percent in Germany and 64 percent in France said it would be major. (The question was also asked in the United States, where only 41 percent called the threat major, Pew found.)
How to address the crisis has become a dividing point in Europe. Nicolas Sarkozy, who formed a close partnership with Ms. Merkel in directing Europe's response to the euro crisis response, lost his bid for re-election as president of France this month to the Socialist candidate, Francois Hollande, who emphasized growth over austerity.
Ms. Merkel got higher marks from the French in the Pew survey for her handling of the economic crisis than Mr. Sarkozy, 76 percent compared to 56 percent. She came in on top in seven of the eight countries, and the lowest in Greece, where only 14 percent approved of her performance (Mr. Sarkozy got 17 percent there).
Ms. Merkel ''seems to be the only point of reference when it comes to stability,'' Rafal Trzaskowski, a Polish member of the European Parliament and lecturer on European affairs, said by e-mail. ''But the criticism of Merkel is also on the rise -- she should have reacted earlier, with more zest, and shoulder the burden in a more decisive way.''
Many people in Greece are aware that the German economy has benefited most from the euro and that German banks played a role in getting Greece into the mess it is in, he said, but now people can hear the same in France and ''sometimes even in Poland.''
The strains of the last few years have taken the shine off European Union membership even in the new member states. In Poland, only 48 percent said it was a ''good thing,'' compared with 63 percent in 2009. In the Czech Republic, support fell to 28 percent from 45 percent in 2009.
''In times of crisis'' people in general trust the European Union less, Mr. Trzaskowski said. In Poland, support for adopting the euro has also dropped because people see its construction as having been flawed and also believe that the Poland's currency, the zloty, has played a role in cushioning the impact of the global financial crisis on the Polish economy, he added.

HEADLINE: Crippled Firm In Bankruptcy Proceedings

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Dewey & LeBoeuf, the law firm crippled by financial miscues and partner defections, filed for bankruptcy on Monday night, punctuating the largest law firm collapse in United States history.
The filing, made in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan, is the final chapter in a turbulent period for Dewey, which came apart after disappointing profits and prodigious debt forced it to slash partners' salaries. The partners, already owed millions from previous years, grew concerned over the firm's finances and their ability to get paid. A partner exodus destroyed the firm.
Dewey announced Monday that the firm planned to liquidate. It said it would ask about 90 employees to remain on staff to assist in the wind-down of its business. The firm has $315 million in liabilities, of which $225 million is owed to its banks, according to the court filings. Other creditors include the firm's landlords and former partners owed money.
''This is a very sad day for the legal profession,'' said Richard J. Holwell, a former federal judge in Manhattan now in private practice. ''Dewey is a fabled firm with a lot of great lawyers and a demise of this magnitude is unprecedented.'' 
With historical roots stretching back a century, Dewey - the product of a 2007 merger between Dewey Ballantine and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae - employed at its peak more than 2,500 people, including roughly 1,400 lawyers in 26 offices across the globe.
Dewey's dissolution has generated a debate across the legal profession: Was its failure an isolated event or emblematic of bigger problems in the corporate-law industry?
Many observers say the root causes of Dewey's fall are not unique. Several of the largest firms have adopted business strategies that Dewey embraced: unfettered growth, often through mergers; the aggressive poaching of lawyers from rivals by offering outsize pay packages; and a widening spread between the salaries of the firm's top partners and its most junior ones.
These trends, they say, have destroyed the fabric of a law firm partnership, where a shared sense of purpose once created willingness to weather difficult times. Many large firms have discarded the traditional notions of partnership - loyalty, collegiality, a sense of equality - and instead transformed themselves into bottom-line, profit-maximizing businesses.
''Because the partnership lacks any shared cultural values or history, money becomes the core value holding the firm together,'' said William Henderson, a law professor at Indiana University who studies law firms. ''Money is weak glue.''
Some industry experts say that, in many ways, the turmoil at Dewey reminds them of Finley Kumble, a large, fast-growing New York firm that imploded in 1987. The causes of Finley Kumble's failure - expanding too quickly, borrowing heavily, and paying dearly for prominent talent - mirror the reasons for Dewey's woes.
''Finley Kumble was the canary in the coal mine that now seems forgotten,'' said Steven J. Harper, a retired partner at Kirkland & Ellis and adjunct law professor at Northwestern University.
Dewey's bankruptcy follows a handful of other big law firm collapses in recent years. In 2008, two large firms in San Francisco, Thelen and Heller Ehrman, imploded in part because of a business slowdown. Last year, Howrey, a Washington firm with more than 500 lawyers, disintegrated after financial difficulties.
''Some big law firm whose leaders think that disaster can never befall it will be next,'' Mr. Harper said. ''We'll be talking about that firm next year.''
This year, everybody is talking about Dewey, whose origins date to 1909. Thomas E. Dewey, the former New York governor, came on board in 1955. LeBoeuf, Lamb, started in 1929, was best known for its representation of insurers and utilities. About a decade ago, LeBoeuf began expanding rapidly under the leadership of Steven H. Davis.
In 2007, Mr. Davis approached the leadership of Dewey Ballantine about a merger. The combination created one of New York's largest firms with a powerful global business, but it was struck just as the booming economy started to turn. The 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession crushed Dewey's results. Adding to its woes was a heavy debt load.
Even as Dewey's performance flagged, the firm doled out lavish multiyear, multimillion-dollar guarantees to its top partners and star recruits. The guarantees - there were about 100, with several over $5 million a year - created compensation obligations that the firm could not meet.
The firm had success in the legal arena despite its financial issues.
It represented the players' unions in their court battles with the National Football League and National Basketball Association. The firm advised MetLife in its $12 billion acquisition of Travelers Life and Annuity. Dewey's real estate group represented the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in the World Trade Center redevelopment.
Dewey's collapse has devastated its employees. Hundreds of junior lawyers and support staff are looking for work in a difficult market.
The partners are collectively expected to lose tens of millions of dollars they had tied up in the firm, and could face ''clawback'' suits from creditors seeking to recover money.
Law firms have seen a decline in demand for legal services since the financial crisis. Large corporate clients, also buffeted by the volatile global economic conditions, have become vigilant about reducing legal expenses. They frequently ask for discounts from their outside law firms, which charge, at the high end, more than $1,000 an hour for a top partner's services.
Yet nearly all of Dewey's partners - about three-quarters of its roughly 300 - have landed at other firms. Thirty-six, for example, have joined DLA Piper, the world's largest firm by head count with more than 4,200 lawyers. DLA is the result of numerous mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures over the last dozen years. It has also been a leader in recruiting top producers away from other firms.
DLA Piper is the biggest of a handful of megafirms that, over the past decade, have transformed themselves from regional practices into global behemoths. These include Greenberg Traurig, a firm with 1,800 lawyers in 35 offices worldwide that was started in Miami. A decade ago, Greenberg had 17 locations and about 800 lawyers. Greenberg has picked up dozens of Dewey lawyers in recent weeks.
The managing partners of these firms are quick to differentiate themselves from Dewey. Frank Burch, the chairman of DLA, said that, unlike Dewey, the firm has not extended any multiyear salary guarantees to its partners, whose pay floats up and down with the performance of the firm. DLA also does not have any long-term debt, he said.
''We have conservatively managed our finances so that we can sustain and grow our business,'' Mr. Burch said. ''Our strategy is to have a presence in key practices and sectors across the globe where our clients need us to be. Growth isn't the strategy; it's a consequence of the strategy.''
Not every corporate law firm has embraced these prevailing ''Big Law'' trends. There remains an elite tier of firms - a group including Davis, Polk & Wardwell and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz - that adheres to a so-called lock-step model of compensation, meaning partners are paid based on seniority, and within a narrow band. These firms also rarely recruit from other firms, but groom talent from within. This group also remains among the most profitable in the country.
''Cravath and others succeed in part because corporate clients are always going to want the opinion of the leading expert in the field and they will be willing to pay top dollar for it,'' said Michael H. Trotter, a lawyer in Atlanta who has written two books about law firm economics. ''They're also culturally strong institutions with partners who are loyal to the firm.''
Other successful practices have remained decidedly small. The grandson of Thomas E. Dewey, for example, has his own firm, Dewey Pegno Kramarsky, a litigation boutique in Manhattan that he started in 1998. Thomas E.L. Dewey's 14-lawyer shop, which represents large corporate clients like Credit Suisse and Time Warner, markets itself as a cost-effective alternative to large, expensive firms.
Mr. Dewey, 48, and his relatives no longer have any ties to the firm. Reached this month, he declined to comment on the disaster that befell the firm bearing his grandfather's name.
''Sorry,'' Mr. Dewey said. ''I know you will understand.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall In Europe, Gain in Asia

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- European stocks mostly fell on Monday, dragged down by worries about Spain and its banking bailout that caused Madrid's benchmark index to slide more than 2 percent. 
In contrast, Asian stocks posted modest gains on what started out as a quiet day. In the United States, markets were closed in observance of Memorial Day.
Even with Greece the main cause of concern in Europe, investors are keeping a wary eye on Spain, which is struggling to clear the bad loans in its banking sector after the collapse of the credit bubble. On Friday, the board of Bankia, the country's biggest mortgage lender, called for additional bailout of 19 billion euros ($24 billion) for a total of 23.5 billion euros ($29.5 billion), far beyond what the government estimated when it seized most of the bank and its portfolio of delinquent real estate loans.
Bankia shares, suspended Friday, fell by nearly one-third in early trading before paring their losses to 15.3 percent in Madrid.
European stocks had risen earlier in the day, reacting to Greek opinion polls published over the weekend that suggested that parties favoring the country's contested bailout agreement would be able to form a government after June 17 elections.
There is ''relief in the markets given the opinion polls from Greece over the weekend,'' Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi U.F.J. in London, wrote in a research note.
European Union leaders had long said there was no chance of Greece leaving the euro, but they have now come to view that possibility as increasingly likely, as the June 17 election could bring a government that repudiates the country's bailout agreements. That would set up an immediate crisis, because the government will run out of cash within weeks without new aid. The legal basis for any Greek exit is not clear, though, and it is possible that the country would muddle on as a euro member in some form.
On Monday, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, fell 0.7 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London held on to a 0.1 percent gain. The Ibex 35 index in Madrid fell 2.2 percent.
Asian shares gained. The Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average ticked up about 0.2 percent. The Sydney market index S.&P./ASX 200 rose about 1 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index rose 0.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Ruling Looms At Health Fund On 9/11 Cancer

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
About five years ago, Patricia Workman's bones started breaking, and she was found to have multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow. At the same time, her skin cancer started to proliferate, leaving her face so scarred that she needed reconstructive surgery and still hides it with dark glasses.
Ms. Workman had been a volunteer at ground zero for about two years after the Sept. 11 attacks. ''They've asked me a thousand times since then, didn't they give you masks, gloves or anything?'' she said of her doctors and friends. ''They didn't.''
Ms. Workman and others who believe their cancers were caused by toxic substances released by the fall of the World Trade Center are due to learn this week whether they may be treated and compensated from a $4.3 billion fund set aside by Congress. 
An advisory committee in March found justification for covering 14 broad categories of cancer, raising expectations that the fund would cover at least some of them. But such a decision would create a logistical quagmire, advocates for patients and government officials conceded, and could strain the fund's resources.
''Depending on the numbers of cancers and the criteria for those cancers, we would certainly be getting more and different claims than we were receiving previously,'' said Sheila Birnbaum, the special master overseeing the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund. ''We cannot add any more money to the fund, so we would have to prorate what we're giving to people depending on the amount of people that apply, the seriousness of their injuries, the economic loss that they've sustained.''
The advisory committee found some evidence linking Sept. 11 to increased rates of cancer, but existing studies are far from conclusive. And since there is probably no way to distinguish those who developed cancer from ground zero from those who might have developed it anyway, anyone who can prove sustained exposure could potentially be eligible for payment.
''There's tens of thousands of people that are potentially eligible, so how do you sort through that?'' said Dr. James Melius, administrator of the New York State Laborers' Health and Safety Trust Fund, who has closely monitored the research. ''Will it be everybody with lung cancer in Lower Manhattan who was there around Sept. 11?''
And many cancers may develop long after the fund expires in 2016. ''You know they're going to continue for 10, 20, 30, 40 years, and you have a victim compensation fund that runs out of money and that ends in about five years,'' Dr. Melius said.
After heavy lobbying by the Bloomberg administration, Congress in 2010 approved the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, named after a police officer who died years after working at ground zero. It allocated $2.8 billion for compensation for those sickened by World Trade Center dust, smoke and fumes, or their survivors. It also set aside $1.5 billion for treatment and monitoring.
The law listed certain ailments that could be covered by the fund, almost all of them respiratory. It did not cover cancer but said evidence would be periodically reviewed to determine if it should.
Dr. John Howard, director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, is expected to rule by Saturday on whether to accept the advisory committee's recommendation. If he does, no one knows for sure how many more people will become eligible for the fund.
So far, more than 5,000 people have registered for the fund, but fewer than 400 of them have actually submitted claims, according to Ms. Birnbaum, the special master. Many, she presumes, are still gathering documentation to prove they meet the eligibility rules. Federal officials have estimated that up to 35,000 people could ultimately sign up, even without cancer's inclusion.
Ms. Workman's cancers, myeloma and melanoma, are on the list of cancers that the World Trade Center Health Program Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee has recommended for coverage, though if Dr. Howard approved those cancers, whether Ms. Workman would be covered would depend on her individual circumstances as well.
Many of the categories on the list involve parts of the body that would have been directly exposed to dust, like the digestive system, mouth, eyes and respiratory system. Childhood cancers, because of the ''unique vulnerability of children to synthetic chemicals commonly found in the environment,'' are on the list, as are rare cancers. So is breast cancer, in part because it has been linked to disrupted circadian rhythms from shift work, and long shifts were common in rescue and recovery work.
The committee made its recommendations primarily by correlating substances found in the dust, smoke and fumes at ground zero with the types of cancer they are known to cause.
The panel used reviews of evidence on carcinogenic substances from the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, part of the World Health Organization, and from the National Toxicology Program, under the Department of Health and Human Services. The 17-member committee includes an epidemiologist, physicians, a toxicologist, environmental health specialists, neighborhood activists and union officials.
Elizabeth Ward, an epidemiologist and chairwoman of the advisory committee, acknowledged that its recommendations ''are based on published research, but not epidemiologic studies of people who were exposed to the material at the World Trade Center, because it takes a long time between when the exposure occurs and when you may see the cancer outcome.'' But Dr. Ward, who is also head of intramural research at the American Cancer Society, said it would be hard to tell people now receiving cancer diagnoses ''that they have to wait another 20 years,'' long after the money has run out, for scientific proof of a link to Sept. 11.
The committee did look at a New York Fire Department study that found that cancer was 19 percent higher than expected among exposed firefighters.
Paul Gerasimczyk, a police officer working a morning tour, was sent downtown as the first tower collapsed. He served 12-hour shifts six days a week for ''a very long time,'' he said. He retired in 2005, and then got what has become known as the World Trade Center cough. In 2007, he was told that he had renal cell cancer, which is also on the committee list.
''People who have yet to get sick, I imagine a lot of them will end up indigent,'' Mr. Gerasimczyk, 53, said.
Dr. Howard declined to be interviewed in advance of his decision. A spokeswoman said that he would consider not only the advisory committee recommendations but also other peer-reviewed scientific evidence. But his decision, epidemiologists say, will inevitably be colored by a mix of social policy and science.
Epidemiologists note that cancer is a common disease, and that it will be hard, if not impossible, to separate who would have gotten it anyway from those who got it from their exposure to World Trade Center dust.
''The chemicals in the report are common, and who's not exposed to these things?'' said Dr. Alfred I. Neugut, an oncologist and professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. ''You go to the gas station, there's petroleum around. When you do an airplane model, what do you think the solvent is? We are all exposed to the carcinogens in the report.''
Dr. Neugut, who is a principal investigator with the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project, which was set up to look at environmental causes of breast cancer on Long Island, added that most studies of cancer risks ''are based on workers exposed for eight or nine hours a day to mammoth amounts of these things for 30 years. Even then it is hard to demonstrate a clear excess in cancer risk.''
That cancer could have arisen from Sept. 11 is biologically plausible, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California. He is no stranger to such controversy. He was chairman of a committee of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the organization whose data the Sept. 11 advisory panel relied on, and which concluded a year ago that cellphones were possibly carcinogenic.
''Some of it is in a sense a societal judgment, if you will,'' Dr. Samet said. ''These are all reasonable people, and I'm sure they're trying to make a reasonable decision in the face of incomplete evidence.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Winds Down Longer Benefits For the Jobless

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans are receiving their final unemployment checks sooner than they expected, even though Congress renewed extended benefits until the end of the year.
The checks are stopping for the people who have the most difficulty finding work: the long-term unemployed. More than five million people have been out of work for longer than half a year. Federal benefit extensions, which supplemented state funds for payments up to 99 weeks, were intended to tide over the unemployed until the job market improved.
In February, when the program was set to expire, Congress renewed it, but also phased in a reduction of the number of weeks of extended aid and effectively made it more difficult for states to qualify for the maximum aid. Since then, the jobless in 23 states have lost up to five months' worth of benefits.
Next month, an additional 70,000 people will lose benefits earlier than they presumed, bringing the number of people cut off prematurely this year to close to half a million, according to the National Employment Law Project. That estimate does not include people who simply exhausted the weeks of benefits they were entitled to. 
Separate from the Congressional action, some states are making it harder to qualify for the first few months of benefits, which are covered by taxes on employers. Florida, where the jobless rate is 8.7 percent, has cut the number of weeks it will pay and changed its application procedures, with more than half of all applicants now being denied.
The federal extension of jobless benefits has been a contentious issue in Washington. Republicans worry that it prolongs joblessness and say it has not kept the unemployment rate down, while Democrats argue that those out of work have few alternatives and that the checks are one of the most effective forms of stimulus, since most of it is spent immediately.
After the most recent compromise reached in February, another renewal seems unlikely.
The expiration of benefits is one factor contributing to what many economists refer to as a ''fiscal cliff,'' or a drag on the economy at the end of this year when tax cuts and recession-related spending measures will all come to an end unless Congress acts. The Congressional Budget Office warned last week that the combination could contribute to another recession next year.
Candace Falkner, 50, got her last unemployment check in mid-May, when extended benefits were curtailed in eight states. Since then she has applied for food stamps and begun a commission-only, door-to-door sales job. Since losing her job two years ago, Ms. Falkner said, she has earned a master's degree in psychology and applied for work at numerous social service agencies as well as places like Walmart, but no offers came.
Ms. Falkner, who lives on the outskirts of Chicago, said she was grateful for the checks she received. But when they ended, she said, ''They should have had some program in place to funnel those people back into the job market. Not to just leave them out there cold, saying, 'The job market has improved, but there's still 60,000 people in the city who can't find one.' ''
Unemployment is lower than it was when the emergency unemployment extensions were ramped up in November 2009. Now, it is 8.1 percent, down from 9.9 percent then. But it is still far higher than pre-recession norms, and there are more than three job seekers for every opening.
Proponents of extended benefits say the cuts are premature. Chad Stone, the chief economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Congress had never before put the brakes on extended benefits when the labor market was so weak. ''It's moving in the wrong direction, and it's occurring at a time when unemployment is very high,'' he said.
Conservative economists and political leaders have argued that unemployment benefits prolong joblessness and simply transfer wealth from one area of the economy to another without contributing to growth.
Kevin A. Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, ''I haven't liked the 99-week solution from the beginning because it creates an environment where people are subsidized to become a structural unemployment problem.''
Still, he is troubled by the latest developments. ''If you just reduce the weeks of unemployment for people already unemployed but don't do anything else, it's a bad deal,'' he said, ''because they're already about the worst-off people in society.''
He points to alternatives like using unemployment money to encourage entrepreneurship or paying benefits in a lump sum, rather than over time, to encourage people to find work faster.
Most states offer 26 weeks of unemployment benefits, plus the federal extensions that kicked in after the financial crash.
The number of extra weeks available by state is determined by several factors, including the state's unemployment rate and whether it is higher than three years earlier. So states like California have had benefits cut even though the unemployment rate there is still almost 11 percent.
''Benefits have ended not because economic conditions have improved, but because they have not significantly deteriorated in the past three years,'' Hannah Shaw, a researcher at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote in a blog post. In May, an estimated 95,000 people lost benefits in California.
After the recession, 99 weeks became a symbol of the plight of the jobless, with those who exhausted their benefits calling themselves ''99 weekers'' or ''99ers.'' But by the end of September, the extended benefits will end in the last three states providing 99 weeks of assistance -- Nevada, New Jersey and Rhode Island.
Some states have tightened eligibility as well. Nationwide, most people apply for benefits by phone. Last August, Florida began requiring people to apply online and to complete a 45-minute test to assess their job skills, according to a complaint submitted to the federal labor secretary by the National Employment Law Project and Florida Legal Services.
The complaint said that applicants with limited Internet access or English skills, disabilities or difficulty reading had effectively been shut out, and that failure to complete the assessment was illegally being used to deny benefits. Denials have soared; now just over half of applicants are rejected. Nationally, 30 percent of applicants are rejected, according to the law project.
The changes have saved the state $2.7 million, according to James Miller, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity. The state's unemployment rate, he pointed out, has declined for 10 straight months. ''The Department of Economic Opportunity provides accommodations to individuals with barriers to filing their claims,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''D.E.O. welcomes any review and is certain that Florida's statutory changes are in full compliance with federal law.''
The Labor Department is reviewing Florida's unemployment program in response to multiple complaints, a spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Investor Doubts Constrain A Russian Oil Powerhouse

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- The Russian oil company Surgutneftegaz owns refineries and gas stations, sells a valuable product and makes a profit. But it sometimes fails another test of the capitalist world.
The company is valued by the Russian stock market at even less than its cash and easily sold assets. That astonishing fact suggests that investors see no real value in the business.
Surgut, as it is known for short, is Russia's fourth-largest oil company after Rosneft, Lukoil and TNK-BP. Its sprawling oil fields, pipelines and drilling rigs should be highly valued in the investment arena. It pumps 1.1 million barrels of oil a day. So the struggle to raise its stock value in the eyes of portfolio managers, while more extreme than many of its Russian peers, is emblematic of investors' broad lack confidence in the country's economy. Outsiders view Russia's companies, however cash-rich, with an incredible degree of skepticism.
Shares in Surgut have fallen in recent weeks to a level where the market value of about $28.5 billion for its common shares on the Russian Micex stock exchange is now lower than the $31.4 billion in cash and liquid assets on its balance sheet, according to Troika Dialog bank in Moscow. 
''It's an illogical valuation,'' Chris Weafer, the chief strategist at Troika Dialog brokerage in Moscow, wrote in a research note last week about the company.
The Russian market this spring fell faster than other so-called BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China and since mid-March is down 18.8 percent. Global oil prices have slumped, reducing expected earnings.
But even taking earnings into account, investors take a dim view of Russian equities. The Russian stock exchange now trades at an average price to estimated earnings ratio of 4.28, compared with the MSCI Emerging-Markets Index average.
It is a glum statistic for Russia, particularly as President Vladimir V. Putin is planning a wide-ranging sale of state assets to raise money for increased military and social spending promised during his campaign. The price-to-earnings ratio comparison means that, statistically, a company that mines gold or pumps oil in Russia is worth less than half as much as a company that extracts the same amount of gold or oil just as efficiently in Brazil or Indonesia.
For all the value in the Russian economy, this wealthy industrial superpower cannot convince investors that it is safe place to put money -- even an oil company is a hard sell.
Surgut shares trade in Moscow and on the over-the-counter market in New York. The company has not reported results to international standards since 2002, though a new law intended to make Russia more investor-friendly will require it to do so next year.
The company is so opaque that investors did not even know it had financed the construction of a submarine base in Siberia for the Russian navy. The disclosure did little to dispel rumors that the company is at least, in part, a slush fund for the Kremlin, though a publicly listed one.
The company declined to make an executive available to discuss the expenditure, or answer written questions.
Mr. Putin wrote in an article published during his election campaign that, in 2002, Surgut and another oil company helped retool the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky-50 nuclear submarine base for a new class of missile submarines known as the Borei, or North Wind. ''We had to ask private companies for help,'' Mr. Putin wrote in the article published in Rossiiskaya Gazeta, the state newspaper. ''I would like to thank them for that.''
It remains unclear how the favor slipped passed investors in the United States and elsewhere who did not know they were financing a Russian strategic nuclear site.
In the company's annual report, the outlay for the base may have been noted as a ''nonoperating expense'' or ''social responsibility expense,'' according to a senior accountant at a Big Four firm in Moscow, who did not want to be cited discussing a potential client's affairs.
Sergei Aleksashenko, a former deputy finance minister, said in an interview that Russian energy companies are routinely subjected to this ''system of unofficial requests,'' from the Kremlin -- for financing everything from presidential palaces to ski resorts to military installations.
''It doesn't really matter what it is for,'' Mr. Aleksashenko said. ''You receive a request and you cannot refuse.''
More recently, Russia's leading business newspaper, Vedomosti, revived speculation about another possible reason for Surgut's low valuation. Citing oil analysts, it said the Kremlin is setting it up for a takeover by the state oil company, Rosneft, which has been bulking up on oil assets during Mr. Putin's time in power. The report came after a powerful aide to Mr. Putin, Igor I. Sechin, became chief executive of Rosneft this month.
Based in the Siberian city of the same name, Surgut is a private company but managed by a Soviet-era director who is close to Mr. Putin. It produces about $127 million worth of oil a day, based on average prices last year for Russia's export blend oil, Ural Crude, and sells some of it to a similarly opaque commodities firm called Gunvor based in the Netherlands and co-owned by Gennady Timchenko, another longtime acquaintance of Mr. Putin.
The company has emphasized other measures of success than stock price, including high salaries for employees and a favored statistic of Soviet oil ministers but not modern petroleum analysts: the number of meters of well bore drilled. Surgut has yet to publish its 2011 annual financial report on its Web site but, in a press statement, made public that it had drilled 4.75 million meters last year.
The owners of 70 percent of the company remain a mystery. In conference calls with analysts, the company has said its own executives own a majority of the shares.
One hedge fund that tried to unlock some hidden value was Hermitage Capital. Its chief executive, William F. Browder, sued Surgut in Russian court in 2004 and 2005 to compel the company to adhere to Russian securities law, something that could have led to a disbursement of the cash reserves, which were smaller at the time but still significant, as dividends. In November of 2005, authorities revoked Mr. Browder's visa to Russia; a week later, the Russian Supreme Court ruled against him in the Surgut lawsuit. Mr. Browder said in an interview that conflict with either Surgut or Gazprom, the state gas monopoly, led to his expulsion from Russia. And Surgut, he said, is ''the most profitable but least valuable company in Russia.''
Correction: June 13, 2012, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on May 29 about the Russian oil company Surgutneftegaz referred imprecisely to the overall value and sale of the oil it extracts. Surgutneftegaz produces oil valued at about $127 million a day; that is not the amount sold to an oil-trading firm, Gunvor. Although past reports have indicated that Gunvor is a primary purchaser of Surgutneftegaz's oil, Surgutneftegaz said in 2011 that about 9 percent of the oil it sold for export went to Gunvor.

HEADLINE: Distractions Ahead In Capital and on Trail

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Presidential campaigns rarely run in a predictable, straight line, and this week will be no exception.
President Obama and Mitt Romney will no doubt continue their sparring over Mr. Romney's experience at Bain Capital -- a debate that both campaigns seem eager to continue in speeches and television commercials.
But there will be other issues and distractions as well, including the following: 
JOBS Both campaigns are eagerly awaiting the release of new job numbers on Friday, an event that is certain to fuel the already intense discussion over the pace of job creation.
Last month, a disappointing report showing that only 115,000 jobs had been created in April gave a boost to Mr. Romney's criticism that the president's economic policies have not worked.
Mr. Obama has responded with a concerted attack on Mr. Romney's history at Bain Capital, challenging his credentials as a job creator. ''There may be value in that kind of experience, but it's not in the White House,'' Mr. Obama said last week.
But another anemic report could provide Mr. Romney with more ammunition. It might also prompt a new round of anti-Bain advertisements as the Obama campaign tries to change the subject by undermining Mr. Romney's record.
REPUBLICANS For a while this year, it looked as if the Republican primary in Texas might have been the climax to the contentious intraparty feud. Now it is mostly an afterthought.
But the primary on Tuesday could give Mr. Romney the 1,144 delegates he needs to officially become the Republican Party's nominee.
Before Rick Santorum dropped out of the race, he had looked to Texas as a place where he could make a significant dent in Mr. Romney's delegate total.
Mr. Santorum never made it that far. With all of Mr. Romney's rivals out of the hunt, there has been no campaigning in Texas. The Houston Chronicle estimates that Mr. Romney needs to win 70 percent of the vote on Tuesday to collect enough delegates to put him over the top.
If he does not, he will probably have to wait until June 5 -- when California and four other states vote -- to clinch the nomination.
BIPARTISANSHIP True moments of bipartisanship are rare in Washington at any time. And they are almost impossible to find during the final six months of a presidential campaign.
But there will be two hug-it-out moments this week at the White House.
On Tuesday, Mr. Obama will present the Presidential Medal of Freedom during a ceremony in the East Room to recipients including the author Toni Morrison and Pat Summitt, who recently stepped down as the women's basketball coach at the University of Tennessee. The presentation of the award -- the highest civilian honor -- is an event typically devoid of the partisan rancor so common in the capital.
And on Thursday, Mr. Obama will welcome his predecessor, George W. Bush, and his wife, Laura, to the White House for the unveiling of their official portraits.
The last time a presidential portrait was unveiled, Mr. Bush was on the other side of the equation: attending the unveiling of Bill Clinton's portrait during a ceremony at the White House on June 14, 2004.
That day, Mr. Bush welcomed Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and sang their praises, putting aside their very deep political differences even as the presidential campaign of that year raged on.
Mr. Bush said Mr. Clinton possessed a ''deep and far-ranging knowledge of foreign policy'' and a ''great compassion for people in need.'' He added: ''Bill Clinton could always see a better day ahead. He filled this house with energy and joy. He's a man of enthusiasm and warmth.''
Expect similar accolades of Mr. Bush by Mr. Obama on Thursday.
CAMPAIGNING The nice words for Mr. Bush will not linger for long. On Friday, Mr. Obama will head to Minnesota for an economics event at which he will urge Congressional action on his ''to do'' list of legislation. And then he will attend several campaign events where criticizing Mr. Bush's economic legacy will again be front and center.
Mr. Obama's campaign speeches are increasingly laced with derision for the economic policies of Mr. Bush and warnings that the country should not repeat them.
Look for those warnings again at campaign stops in Minnesota and Chicago.

HEADLINE: Asking About Big Joe Turner, Suzy Q and Black Dahlia

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
IT is time again to ask 20 questions about advertising, the media and popular culture.
Did Jon Hamm, who provides the voice-overs in commercials for Mercedes-Benz, have to tell the brand's marketing executives how much he would be talking about Jaguar on ''Mad Men'' this season?
How many cable viewers turn on Outside Television when they want to watch a show on the Outdoor Channel, and vice versa? 
As annoying as the twee Apple iPhone commercial with Zooey Deschanel can be, isn't it nice that the version of ''Shake, Rattle and Roll'' heard in the spot is the original by Big Joe Turner rather than the cover by Bill Haley & His Comets?
Speaking of Ms. Deschanel, did anyone putting together the December issue of Bon Appetit magazine realize that an interview with her -- in which she advised readers against making ''classic Christmas cookies'' because they are ''really time-consuming'' -- was followed four pages later by an ad for McCormick's Roasted Saigon Cinnamon that featured a recipe for ''McCormick Gourmet Collection Chocolate Crackled Cookies''?
Now that commercials for Verizon Wireless and Wells Fargo have featured imaginary businesses named Susie's Lemonade and Susie Mae's Ice Cream, will actual businesses run by real-life Susies and Susie Maes start attracting more customers -- or will it just stimulate sales of the Suzy Q's snack cakes sold by Hostess?
Will drivers listen to ads asking them to buy BP gasoline ''so you can go a little farther between fill-ups'' or to ads from Ford Motor asking them to ''Go further''?
Now that Givenchy has brought out a fragrance called Dahlia Noir (Black Dahlia), could shoppers expect to find other scents that share names with notorious unsolved murder cases?
When a recent article on The Huffington Post, sponsored by I.B.M., asked readers, ''Are consumers leading the retail revolution?'' how many readers replied, ''You were expecting maybe monkeys?''
With major newspapers in cities like New Orleans and Birmingham, Ala., scaling back their printed editions to three days a week, will watching a movie in which a journalist character shouts ''Stop the presses'' ever seem the same again?
When executives at the Interpublic Group of Companies decided to name a new media agency Brand Programming Network, or B.P.N., did anyone notice that an agency in Portland, Ore., called Borders Perrin Norrander goes by B.P.N.?
Is there a correlation between the increasingly robust sales of Greek yogurt in the United States and the increasingly dire economic situation in Greece?
Why would Zurich Financial Services run an ad bragging about its role in insuring the construction of Madison Square Garden when pretty much everyone agrees it is one of the ugliest buildings in New York City and, even worse, it replaced the old Pennsylvania Station, one of the most beautiful?
Do advertisements for the Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day line of ''green'' cleaning products still list its parent as the Caldrea Company because shoppers might pause if they knew that Caldrea was acquired in 2008 by the cleaning products behemoth S. C. Johnson & Son?
Was the copywriter of a magazine ad for Neutrogena cosmetics, which carried the headline ''Is your makeup your friend or frenemy?,'' inspired by the many times that Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, has described Google as a ''frenemy'' of Madison Avenue?
Do women who buy the Kardashian Kolor line of nail polishes from Nicole by OPI, which are billed as ''inspired by everyone's favorite TV family,'' run the risk of their friends who disdain talentless reality stars, kalling them kompletely krazy?
When the HBO Comedy channel showed the movie ''Due Date,'' followed by the movie ''Date Night,'' how many viewers were hoping for the string to continue with, say, ''Night Shift,'' ''Night at the Museum'' or ''A Night at the Opera''?
After Good Housekeeping magazine joined with Tulocay & Company to introduce a line of Good Housekeeping Good Food pantry products, did anyone recall that Good Food was once the name of a magazine, published by Triangle Publications and Murdoch Magazines?
Could a new cereal from the Kellogg Company, Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites, be the most redundantly named product in the supermarket?
When an issue of People magazine spelled Steven Spielberg's given name as ''Steven'' on Page 26 and ''Stephen'' on Page 60, was it an example of the magazine's copy desk playing catch me if you can?
Would executives of Wells Fargo tell a reporter wondering how many customers notice that the last two words of the company's ad theme, ''Together we'll go far,'' are an anagram of ''Fargo,'' ''You ask a lot of questions for someone from Brooklyn''?

HEADLINE: Congressman Endorses Assemblywoman as Successor

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Representative Gary L. Ackerman, who unexpectedly announced in March that he would not seek re-election to Congress, is venturing into the primary contest to succeed him, backing the candidate he says best embodies his values: Assemblywoman Grace Meng.
Mr. Ackerman's decision, to be announced Tuesday morning at the Pomonok Senior Center in Flushing, Queens, was hardly assured, given his reputation as an eccentric politician not known for regularly making endorsements. And while some political analysts assumed that Mr. Ackerman favored Ms. Meng, the choice of Representative Joseph Crowley and the Queens Democratic establishment, his pledge to campaign vigorously on her behalf could help sway constituents who have supported him during his nearly 30-year career. 
Mr. Ackerman, in an interview, praised Ms. Meng's chief competitors in the June 26 primary, Assemblyman Rory I. Lancman and City Councilwoman Elizabeth S. Crowley. Indeed, Mr. Ackerman said that all three were ''philosophically close to the same place'' on key issues like Israel and economic advocacy for the middle class.
But in what could be viewed as critiques of Mr. Lancman, an aggressive legislator who once mulled challenging Mr. Ackerman, and Ms. Crowley, whose candidacy has soured her relationship with her cousin, Congressman Crowley, Mr. Ackerman, 69, said that Ms. Meng's self-effacing style and background as a fellow child of immigrants had won him over.
''Looking at the candidates, there was only one choice,'' he said. ''It's not a matter of being the most flashy or the most self-promoting, but the ability to bring people together. She's a very likable person and she's a very quick study. She understands that it's not about her, but the people who sent her there.''
Ms. Meng, 36, is vying to be the first Asian-American member of New York's Congressional delegation. The primary (which also includes a libertarian-leaning long shot, Dr. Robert Mittman) will probably hinge on turnout in what is expected to be light voting.
Whoever prevails will most likely be favored, based on demographics, in the November general election against the Republican candidate, City Councilman Daniel J. Halloran III. The victor will represent eastern and central Queens in what will be known as the Sixth Congressional District, which is about 40 percent Asian-American.
Mr. Lancman, 43, has collected many key labor endorsements, including unions representing health care aides and municipal workers, and the vocal backing of former Mayor Edward I. Koch. He has also performed strongly in candidate forums.
Ms. Crowley, 34, chairwoman of the City Council's Fire and Criminal Justice Services Committee, has the support of several police and fire unions.
Ms. Meng, whose father, Jimmy Meng, was an assemblyman in the early 2000s, has picked up crucial support from groups like teachers' and hotel workers' unions.
In an interview, Ms. Meng said that she was grateful for Mr. Ackerman's support, and vowed, if elected, to continue his work on transportation, infrastructure and issues affecting older New Yorkers.
She said Mr. Ackerman had always been a presence in her home while she was growing up, in Corona, then Bayside and Flushing, because of the annual calendar he sent to constituents featuring tidbits about American history.
''He just gives the impression that he's so patriotic and so proud of American history,'' Ms. Meng said. ''As a daughter of a first-generation, middle-class family, that was really special.''

HEADLINE: Canadian Official Offers Bill to End Railway Strike

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- Canada's labor minister introduced legislation on Monday to end a strike by about 4,800 workers at the Canadian Pacific Railway. Lisa Raitt, the minister, said the move was necessary to prevent more economic damage from the six-day walkout.
''Our government is really concerned that a disruption at Canadian Pacific will damage Canada's fragile economic recovery,'' she said outside of the House of Commons. Ms. Raitt added that she estimated the strike could cost the Canadian economy about $500 million a week, although neither she nor the government offered specifics about how that amount had been calculated. 
Whatever the exact cost, the railway shutdown has clearly affected several industries.
Mark A. Nantais, the president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, which represents the Canadian arms of Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, said that thousands of new cars were stranded on Canadian Pacific's tracks and factories have started stockpiling vehicles because of a lack of shipping options. Switching shipments of parts to trucks from trains, he said, has increased the industry's costs by ''hundreds of thousands of dollars a day.''
Canadian Pacific has an effective duopoly with the Canadian National Railway on rail service in Canada. In several regions Canadian Pacific is the only carrier.
Unlike in the auto industry, the mining and forest products industry cannot use trucking as an alternative for most shipments. And Ian White, the president and chief executive of the Canadian Wheat Board, said the strike had already created a backlog of about $50 million worth of wheat. Keeping ships waiting at ports for grain, he added, may cost farmers $1 million a week in extra charges.
Although the railway's lines in the United States continue to operate, some American shippers have been forced to change plans. A considerable amount of merchandise from Asia ultimately destined for the United States arrives by ship in Vancouver, British Columbia before traveling on Canadian Pacific's trains to American cities.
Because the Conservative government holds a majority of the seats in the House of Commons, it will be able to force the legislation through swiftly. Ms. Raitt said she hopes that the railroad can resume operations by Thursday.
The legislation will impose binding arbitration on the railroad and the union to end the dispute which appears focused on Canadian Pacific's desire to reduce pension costs as well as its proposed changes to work rules.
The Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, which represents the rail workers, said that the government had violated its members' right to strike and was favoring the company by ending the walkout.
''The company is delighted the government is tabling back-to-work legislation,'' Doug Finnson, the chief union negotiator said. ''What they're doing is outrageous.''
Some union members have noted that the legislation follows a successful proxy bid for control of the company by the American investor William A. Ackman. Mr. Ackman has made lowering the railway's costs a priority.
Ed Greenberg, a spokesman for Canadian Pacific, rejected the union's contention that the company had sought the legislation.
''The union constantly refused to consider the various options the company was agreeable to that could have minimized the strike and prevented the damage to our customers' businesses and employment levels,'' he said.
George C. B. Smith, a former vice president of industrial relations at Canadian Pacific who now teaches labor relations at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, said the government doomed the negotiations when it signaled that it would legislate an end to any strike even before the walkout began.
''All the back-to-work legislation does is sweep this under the carpet,'' he said. ''I'm guessing that the C.P. employees are not going to be happy going back to work. These people can impact the efficiency of the railway in many different ways.''

HEADLINE: New York's Tech Boom: Here to Stay This Time?

BYLINE: JOSHUA BRUSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: As New York's technology industry booms, it might be wise to recall that this has happened before. In the dotcom boom, New York's tech scene flourished. And then collapsed. The question is whether New York's industry will be better placed to handle it this time. What has made Silicon Valley so resilient is that it is a good place to go out of business. Can New York learn that? 

 BODY:
 These are heady times for New York City's tech scene, as I wrote about in Monday's newspaper. But as local businesses find success and the city government talks about the flourishing industry as a firewall against finance's boom and bust cycle, it is worth remembering one thing: this has happened before. 
During the tech bubble in the late 1990s tech companies in New York found easy money, and talk of a new tech center based around "Silicon Alley" began heating up. Measured in terms of the amount of investment from venture capital firms, the city's tech boom a decade ago dwarfs what is happening now. 
Then the bubble burst. 
The downturn hit New York hard. By 2002, venture funding in information technology companies in New York had fallen 94 percent from the level of two years before, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association. There was little change until 2006, when the beginning of the current upswing started. 
To be sure, Silicon Valley saw a massive contraction as well, but it was not nearly as extreme as what happened on the East Coast. And while things got tough for start-ups, the framework of California's tech industry remained in place. The valley still had a major university that cranked out engineers, huge companies where potential entrepreneurs could weather the storm and a network of tech-savvy investors who ready to open up their wallets again when prospects looked brighter. 
Eventually there will be another slow-down. The question is whether New York's industry will be better placed to handle it this time. People within the technology industry, and the Bloomberg administration, are confident they will be ready. At the center of the city government's optimism is a plan by Cornell and Technion universities to build a new graduate school on Roosevelt Island focused on computer engineering. Last week the school hired Greg Pass, the former chief technology officer at Twitter, to set the school's course as a place that creates entrepreneurs, not just engineers. 
But the idea is not just to start new companies. In fact, some investors are already voicing concerns that too much capital is flowing into early stage companies in New York. Indeed, small companies make up the lion's share of the city's technology industry, with almost 80 percent of start-ups having received less than $10 million in funding. Many of these companies are at risk to fail once the overall industry stops expanding so rapidly. If the money flees to other industries, this tech boom could prove temporary. If the engineers and designers cycle into new jobs within tech, the scene will be in much better shape. What has made Silicon Valley so resilient is largely that it is a good place to go out of business. Failed entrepreneurs cycle back through the larger technology companies, or quickly jump to other start-ups. 
Seth Pinsky, the head of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said that the local industry needs a number of large companies that can serve both as role models and places for people to fall back on when their own start-ups fail. 
"What I think the city did not have enough of was those anchor institutions, the things that when the market starts to decline, keep the level of activity at a certain minimum threshold," he said.
A number of New York companies are emerging as the leaders of the local industry -- Foursquare, the Gilt Groupe and Tumblr, to name a few. Google and Facebook have built large outposts here. Now some people believe it will take a large public offering from a New York-based company to cement the industry's role in the city's economy. Warren Lee, a partner at the venture capital firm Canaan Partners, said he believes that several companies could go public later this year or early next year, starting the same self-perpetuating cycle of success that PayPal's success sparked on the West Coast.
"It is important for New York to prove that we're able to produce some of these stand-alone, multi-billion dollar, publicly traded companies," he said. "Wealth does flow downhill."

HEADLINE: Dim Prospects for Financial Crisis Prosecutions

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: Two items in the news last week underscore that the likelihood for a signature case arising out of the financial crisis is near zero. 

 BODY:
As has been noted many times, the lack of criminal prosecutions arising out of the financial crisis has been painfully obvious. And two items in the news last week underscores that the prospect for a signature case is growing even more distant.
First, Reuters reported on Thursday that Securities and Exchange Commission staff members wrote in a memo that fraud charges "will likely not be recommended" against Lehman Brothers executives.
Then, the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said that the federal-state mortgage fraud working group announced in President Obama's State of the Union address in January needed more resources -- an indication that the group was still trying to digest evidence from transactions made more than four years ago.
 The collapse of Lehman seemed to be the most likely source of criminal prosecutions, or at least civil enforcement actions. The firm's examiner, Anton R. Valukas, issued a report in 2010 castigating senior management for shifting up to $50 billion off the balance sheet through the so-called Repo 105 transactions.
The S.E.C.'s chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro, testified on April 25 before a House Financial Services subcommittee that the investigation of Lehman "is still under review." DealBook reported that people close to the investigation cautioned that "the memo was months old, had been updated since and did not necessarily reflect how more senior agency officials viewed the case."
But unless the earlier assessment of the evidence has changed significantly, the likelihood of an enforcement action this long after Lehman's failure looks fairly low. A securities fraud case would be led by trial lawyers from the S.E.C.'s enforcement division, and their view of the viability of any proposed charges will have a significant impact on the final determination.
Senior officials often get the credit - and blame - for an agency's enforcement actions, but it is the staff members who are responsible for gathering the evidence and bringing the matter to trial. If they are not committed to pursuing a case, then their superiors are unlikely to second-guess them. 
At this point, it is not clear whether the S.E.C. has obtained any new information or cooperating witnesses to show that Lehman executives had any intent to defraud or at least acted recklessly - the standard required to prove civil securities fraud. If the S.E.C. is struggling to decide whether to pursue charges, the likelihood of a criminal case is even less because of the higher standard of proof prosecutors must meet.
In its defense, the S.E.C. has argued that it has been aggressive in pursuing banks and Wall Street firms over their role in possible fraud in the mortgage-backed securities market. But it does not seem that any of those cases will have a major impact on the public's perception that individuals have been held accountable.
The S.E.C.'s most prominent cases against individuals for actions related to the mortgage market collapse are those it is pursuing against the former chief executives and senior officers at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two erstwhile mortgage giants. But the charges claim the executives misled investors in the companies about their exposure to subprime mortgages, and are largely unrelated to the role of Fannie and Freddie in the foreclosure crisis. 
Mr. Schneiderman, a co-chairman of the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, said in an interview last week with The Wall Street Journal, "Do I want more resources, and want things to go faster? Yes, Am I asking for more? Yes. Do I believe we'll get that? Yes."
His statement is hardly a ringing endorsement of the working group's effort because it is a common refrain to blame a lack of resources for the absence of any real progress on cases. 
The fact that the transactions under investigation took place four to seven years ago does not bode well for pursuing cases against any individuals because evidence, like memories, tends to not get better with age.
The working group has issued a number of civil subpoenas as part of its effort, but apparently none have been issued on behalf of a grand jury, which is the primary vehicle for a criminal investigation. The absence of any involvement by a grand jury is another indication that criminal charges are unlikely.
Unlike criminal cases, which are subject to strict time constraints, civil cases tend to take years to resolve because of the extensive discovery rights provided. For example, the charges against the former Fannie and Freddie executives that were filed in late 2011 are unlikely to see the inside of a courtroom before 2014, if the cases are not settled before then.
So it is the same refrain: the likelihood of a prominent criminal case against a corporate or Wall Street executive in the near future looks to be nearly zero at this point.

HEADLINE: A Prize-Winner's Personal Insight

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: Ross Taylor learned how personal experience gave him insight into the lives of his subjects. On Tuesday, he was named a Photojournalist of the Year in the National Press Photographers Association awards. 

 BODY:
The National Press Photographers Association announced on Tuesday its final group of Best of Photojournalism 2012 winners. Ross Taylor of The Virginian-Pilot was chosen Photojournalist of the Year (Larger Markets), and David Weatherwax of The Herald, in Jasper, Ind., was named Photojournalist of the Year (Smaller Markets).
The freelance photographer Donald Miralle was chosen as the Sports Photojournalist of the Year, and Brad Vest - who started on Tuesday as a summer intern at The New York Times - won the Cliff Edom "New America Award."
In the Photojournalist of the Year (Larger Markets) category, second place went to David Guttenfelder of The Associated Press, and third place to Mauricio Lima for the New York Times. .
Mr. Taylor's winning portfolio included a story about the economic hardship facing many residents of the Norfolk, Va., area. It was a topic to which he brought a personal sensitivity: in 2005, he was laid off from The Herald-Sun in Durham, N.C., and was out of work for 15 months.
"The people in the story are much more like me than they are different," said Mr. Taylor, 40. "You have a shared language which provides more immediacy, more connection. You're not just pretending to sympathize."
By coincidence, Mr. Taylor shared a home with Mr. Vest, the winner of the New America Award, when Mr. Vest was an intern at The Virginian-Pilot last summer.
Mr. Vest says his story is about a "father who's trying to escape his past and be a better man than he has been." Travis Simmons, the subject of the project, was a single father just getting out of jail when Mr. Vest started photographing him in 2009. He struggled to raise his two children and stay off drugs. Mr. Simmons married last May, and according to Mr. Vest, is undertaking "a new start."
Mr. Vest, 27, is a graduate student at the University of Ohio. The winning project is his master thesis.
The editing and Web awards were announced earlier this year. The New York Times won for Best Use of the Web for "Punched Out: The Life and Death of a Hockey Enforcer."
The Times also won for Best Use of Photography by Newspapers with circulations of 75,000 and greater. The Virginian-Pilot came in second. The Herald (Jasper, Ind.) won for Best Use of Photography in smaller markets.
Bruce Moyer of the Tampa Bay Times won the 2012 Newspaper Picture Editor of the Year. In Documentary Multimedia Story, first place went to Raymond McCrea Jones for "Love Endures Even Cancer"; second place to Maisie Crow for "Half Lives: The Chernobyl Workers Now"; and third place to "Punched Out" by the New York Times video journalist Shayla Harris, the reporter John Branch, the multimedia producer Josh Williams, the photographer Marcus Yam, the picture editor Becky Lebowitz Hanger and the multimedia producer Jacky Myint.
For the second year in a row, the awards were completed months after Pictures of the Year International, the other major national photojournalism contest.

HEADLINE: What Cuts Should Cash-Strapped Schools Make?

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE


HIGHLIGHT: Student Opinion | How should schools deal with budget cuts? 

 BODY:
In "Curtailing a Service That Parents Depend On," Michael Winerip writes about New York after-school programs slated to be cut:
Currently, New York finances enrichment programs that run from 3 to 6 p.m. at 454 sites, serving 53,000 elementary, middle and high school students and costing $90 million; the proposal is to reduce that to 261 sites, serving 27,000 children for $71 million.
This would save $19 million in a budget of $67 billion, or about a quarter of 1 percent.
The program enables parents who can't afford child care to hold jobs knowing that their children are safe and learning.
What adds to the budget drama is that some of the sites scheduled to be shut are among the city's best.
So not only is the process painful, but it is also inscrutable.
One program that is marked for closing, at Public School 24 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, is considered so good that city officials take visitors there to see how after-school services are supposed to work. In November, Michael Dogan, a senior director at the Department of Youth and Community Development, escorted two colleagues from another city agency. "We wanted to show them a quality program" that exemplified our model, he wrote in an e-mail to Yadira Garcia, the director of the P.S. 24 after-school program.
Another program slated for closing is at Intermediate School 318 in Williamsburg. This program produced the best middle school chess team in America, which recently won the national high school championship. Team members - who learned chess at the after-school club - were featured on the front page of The New York Times last month and are the subject of a new documentary.
... Cathleen Collins, a spokeswoman for the city, wrote in an e-mail that just because programs were scheduled to be closed, it was "not a reflection of their quality or success, but rather a factor of limited resources and high level of competition."
... The mayor is committed to balancing the budget without raising taxes, Ms. Collins said, and even with the cuts, more children would be accommodated than when Mr. Bloomberg was first elected a decade ago. "We are hopeful that the initiative will grow and thrive when more prosperous economic times return," she said.
Students: Tell us how you think budget cuts should be handled. What should the priorities be for a school or municipality? Should programs that help low-income families be saved first? Why or why not? Should well-known or successful programs be spared from cuts? Why or why not? What would you do if you were in charge of a school or municipal budget?

HEADLINE: Give Me Your Tired, Your Over-Taxed

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The Tax Foundation suggests New Yorkers are moving to Florida to escape taxes. 

 BODY:
A couple of conservative newsoutlets reported today that New York State shed 1.3 million residents on net over the last ten years, with more than 600,000 leaving for Florida. During the same period, more than 200,000 Pennsylvanians also moved to Florida.
Sounds like a dog bites man story, no? New York and Pennsylvania get cold in the winter time. Florida does not. That's always struck me as a sufficient explanation for why Northerners retire to Florida (or that and savvy marketing). But the Tax Foundation, which dug up these figures, thinks it knows what's really behind the southward migration.

"Many of these New York and Pennsylvania residents no doubt moved to Florida for the warm weather," writes the Tax Foundation's Scott Hodge. "[B]ut many more may have moved because the state does not have an individual income tax, an estate tax, nor an inheritance tax."
Picking up on Mr. Hodge's suggestion, CNSNews chose this headline: "Escape From New York? High-Taxing Empire State Loses 3.4 Million Residents in 10 Years." (The state gained 2.1 million, hence the net loss of 1.3 million.)
And yet there's no reason to think that taxes played a part in a single person's decision to leave New York-let alone that taxes "may have" spurred "many more" departures than weather. The Tax Foundation did not commission a poll on the topic, and does not present any evidence to support that assertion. Not even anecdotal evidence.
The idea that New York's high tax-burden places the state at a competitive disadvantage is a frequent conservative talking point-and one that's debunked as often as it's trotted out. In 2011, the Partnership for New York City claimed that the so-called "Millionaire's Tax" had forced out some of the state's highest earners-but somehow overlooked the fact that the number of millionaires in New York actually increased in 2010 (while the tax was in place).
I'll give the last word to Mayor Mike Bloomberg, also known as the richest man in New York City. Asked in 2008 if state tax hikes on the wealthy would cause them to leave, he said, "I can only tell you, among my friends, I've never heard one person say I'm going to move out of the city because of the taxes. Not one. Not in all the years I've lived here. You know, they can complain, 'Ugh, I got my tax bill, it's heavy.' But my friends all want to live here."

HEADLINE: Answers About How to Deal With Pests, Part 2

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Here is the second set of answers from our guest expert to questions on roaches, mice, ants and other creepy crawlies. 

 BODY:
What questions should one ask when hiring a pest control service? How can I tell if it is good or just going to spray around a bit - as the last company I hired seemed to do? - X, New York City 
Often the best way to find a quality pest control firm is to use one that has been referred to you by a family member or friend. Also, ask if the company is a member of its local or state pest control association, or the National Pest Management Association (N.P.M.A.). I'd recommend visiting the N.P.M.A. Web site for help in making a decision.
Be sure that the company you hire is licensed and insured, and that the technician doing your work is certified in the proper use of pesticides. Ask if it guarantees its work. Does it provide services based on integrated pest management (I.P.M.)? Experts agree that this is the best approach to solving pest problems, as it includes inspection and nonchemical and chemical treatment options. Finally, it's often a good idea to contact several companies before making your final decision.
Perhaps not technically a pest, brown recluse spiders seem to be ubiquitous in older homes. It's not uncommon to find a large one in the tub at least once a week. My guess is that they climb in there and then can't climb out, not coming up from the drain. Do they live in the attic? Or the basement? I don't like killing spiders, but this is one I won't handle. Is it true that unless pinched, they won't bite? - Warrior Ant Press, Kansas City, Mo.
Many spiders are simply a nuisance and even beneficial as they feed on insects. However, the brown recluse spider is considered a medically important spider because of its toxic venom. These spiders can be in large numbers in homes. There was a home near Kansas City where more than 2,000 brown recluse spiders were removed over a six-month period. The spiders are not aggressive, but will bite when disturbed. Symptoms of bites range from minor to severe skin lesions. They can be found in many areas inside a home and also outdoors during warm months. You are correct: they are not coming up the drain, just unable to make their way out of the smooth surface of the tub. For helpful information on spiders visit spiders.ucr.edu.
I remember reading about a pesticide for cockroaches that was so effective that widespread use of it could bring them to the point of extinction. What has become of it? Also, when I had a sailboat I was told that if it became infested with cockroaches, sprinkle borax all over and that would eliminate them. The thinking was that as the cockroaches walked through the borax the stuff would stick to their legs, and when they preened they would ingest the borax and die off. At any rate, what's the latest in the battle against cockroaches? - John Brady, Canterbury, CT
I believe you are referring to cockroach baits. When these baits were first introduced and began to be widely used by professionals, some thought that they would eliminate cockroaches as a significant pest. For many years, cockroaches were the No. 1 pest problem. After the introduction of these baits they lost their top ranking to other pests. However, have no fear, cockroaches will not become extinct anytime soon.
When applied properly, these baits - which include several insecticide active ingredients and highly palatable foods that encourage consumption - are very effective in controlling cockroaches.
Dusts that contain boric acid are effective in controlling cockroaches, but should not be placed in exposed areas. They are most effective against cockroaches when placed in wall voids.
Much of the research into household pests is now focused on bed bug management. An interesting and promising area in cockroach research is work on better understanding the role of German cockroach control and the reduction in cockroach allergens that trigger the onset of asthma in children. Elimination of German cockroaches in apartments has been shown to be more important than any other factor in reducing the incidence of asthma.
I live in the suburbs. Last fall I had an infestation of ants in the kitchen. I have never had insects before. However, I called an exterminator and he resolved the issue. I live in a private house. Everything is clean (no garbage, etc.). Just recently I saw one ant in the kitchen. What is the cause of this? Is this the beginning of a problem again? - Carol, Westbury, New York
Across the U.S., ants are considered the top nuisance pest in and around structures. According to a recent survey sponsored by the National Pest Management Association (www.pestworld.org), the number of ant infestations is on the rise. Ants are most active during the warm months of spring through fall. It's not at all unusual to see a few ants indoors. The movement of ants and other pests indoors often occurs during changes in environmental conditions like heavy rain, drought, and temperature extremes. 
Continue to keep the inside of your home clean. Keep foods that are attractive to ants in sealed containers. Ants are especially attracted to the kitchen and bathroom areas of homes. This is where they have access to food and moisture. They are also attracted to areas where pet food is available. Check around your home for any moisture problems (leaky pipes, poor drainage, clogged gutters, etc.) and correct these problems. Ants will make nests outdoors under steppingstones or other objects next to your home and will move from these sites to inside your home. It may be helpful to have another service this season to keep the ants out and prevent other pests from moving inside.
Ants, ants, ants! They seem to be coming from behind the oven, making their way along the top edge of the tile backsplash (in a single-file line, of course) before arriving at last near the sink, where they idle about and cavort in their antlike way on the countertop in large (unwelcome) numbers. I went away on a weeklong vacation, and they left. too. But within a few days of my return, they were back to hang out with me! Is there any nontoxic liquid or substance I could use to block their path, or is a commercial poison called for? If so, which one, and how should I apply it most safely? Jon Greene, Brooklyn
Apparently, the ants really like you. I would do all the nonchemical approaches first and then set out ant baits if the ants persist. First, try sealing all entryways for the ants. I should point out that because of the small size of many common pest ants, it's often difficult to seal all the entryways. Repair leaky plumbing and correct any drainage problems. Keep foods that are attractive to ants in sealed containers. Clean your kitchen and do not leave dirty dishes out overnight. This includes running the dishwasher. There are several effective ant baits available for use by homeowners. For best results, place the baits where ants are trailing. Also, put the bait in out-of-way places, like behind the refrigerator or cabinets. Always read and follow all label directions. If these steps fail to stop the ants you may want to call a professional.
What is the reason for a sudden explosion of ants in the house at the end of the day? The ants are black and some of them have wings. They are not carpenter ants. But they tend to arrive later in the afternoon, they cluster on the windows, and there's a lot of them. - Barbara Rudolph, New York, N.Y.
The ants you are referring to may actually be swarming subterranean termites. They are often confused with ants. The following characteristics can be used to distinguish termite swarmers from swarming ants: Termite swarmers - two pair of wings of equal size and shape (also, the wings easily detach from the swarmers and accumulate on window sills), broad waist and straight antennas. Swarming ants - two pairs of wings with the hind pair much smaller, narrow waist and elbowed antennas. If you determine that these are termites, you should contact a professional for a termite inspection.
Do you think the high decibel sound systems (that plug in any outlet) are an effective and efficient detour to mice coming into apartments? - Joanne, New York City
NO. Numerous studies have been conducted that clearly show that these devices have no effect in deterring mice or other pests. Save your money - do not buy these devices.
I put a thin line of boric acid along the entryway of my apartment door because I've heard this works to keep out/kill roaches. Is this true? If it is true, do you have any suggestions for other places I should use the boric acid? - BK, Queens
Boric acid is an inorganic insecticide that has been used for many years to control pests. It is effective against cockroaches when used properly, but is slow acting. In the dust formulation, which I believe you are describing, it is most effective when applied in wall voids or other undisturbed areas. The dust should not be applied to exposed surfaces, and therefore I recommend against placing it along your entryway. A better solution for your entryway is to ensure that you have a tightfitting door. Good places to apply the boric acid dust would be around plumbing lines and other openings that penetrate the wall. After treating these sites with the dust, it would be helpful to seal up the openings. You can also remove electrical and light switch outlets and apply dust behind the electrical boxes in the wall void. The dust can also be applied below the floor-level cabinets in the kitchen. A small amount of dust (just a light coating) in these areas will provide long-lasting control. Read and follow all label directions on the boric acid label.
Two weeks ago I was in a four-star hotel on Harbor Island in the Bahamas - not a third-world country, but not first-world either, although the one-bedroom suite was expensive. The first night I opened the bathroom door to find a cockroach over 1\xC2 inches long with antennas about the same length, and about 12 to 15 small cockroaches under an inch in length. The large one didn't scurry away, but stood its ground.
No way was I smashing that large bug; if I didn't kill it on first stomp it could have crawled onto my foot. I stomped the floor, though, and after four stomps getting closer and closer to it, it crawled a little way under the baseboard. The next morning I called the desk and reported it and also said they were getting in because the baseboard was not flush with the floor.
The hotel sprayed but did not repair the space (I asked it to caulk the space). Two nights later, a new, but smaller group of cockroaches were on the bathroom floor.
What type of pest deterrent should I carry with me on second- and third-world trips? Spray, caulk, masking tape? - ILM, Los Angeles
You should not have to share your room with pests. Quality hotels take pest problems seriously and should have a professional pest service. When checking into a hotel room, I'd suggest you take a moment to look around for possible pest activity. To help you with your inspection, you might take a small flashlight with you when you travel. Inspect the bathroom, especially in and around cabinets. Check the closet and open the clothing drawers or any other cabinets in the room and look for live pests or their evidence. Check around the bed and the headboard for possible bed bug activity. You might also check the door to see if it is tight fitting and if the windows have screens that are in good repair. If pests or their evidence are seen, ask to be moved to another room or change hotels.
What is the nature and toxicity of chemicals used to treat termites? In particular, if an exterminator suggests completing treatment inside the home. On that same note, how successful is vinegar as a treatment for termites, and how is it most effectively used? - IDvolksvan87, New York
There are many good termiticides (chemicals used to treat termites) available today that are low in toxicity when applied according to label directions. Most have the signal word CAUTION on their labels, indicating that the product is low in toxicity. Termites can be treated using termite baits, liquid treatments or a combination of the two. 
Before treating, the pest management professional will inspect your home for termites and their damage. Indoor treatment for termites is generally only needed if termite activity is found indoors. Since most termite infestations originate from outside the home, the emphasis on termite treatment is around the outside perimeter. If a liquid treatment is used, it will be applied to the soil in a trench around your building's foundation. If the area is covered by cement, it will be drilled and then chemical applied to the soil through the drill holes. These drill holes must be plugged after the application. When termite baits are used, they are placed in the soil next to the building's foundation. The number of bait placements will depend on the size of your home. Baits are also available for use inside homes if an infestation is found indoors. Vinegar is not an effective product for termite control. A professional service is needed if you have termites.

HEADLINE: Energy Agency Finds Safe Gas Drilling is Cheap

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Cutting environmental risks from gas drilling is cheap. 

 BODY:
The International Energy Agency has issued a report that is essential reading for anyone interested in ensuring that the global boom in gas production facilitated by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is carried out with environmental integrity. The report, "Golden Rules for a Golden Age of Gas," builds an economic case for adopting practices and technologies that limit chances of water or air pollution and produce adequate transparency to gain public confidence. 
Pursuing this approach, the report concludes, would add just seven percent to drilling costs. Unchanged practices could, by generating public distrust and resistance, limit the potential harvest.
As the agency's chief economist, Fatih Birol (also the report's lead author) put it in a statement, "If this new industry is to prosper, it needs to earn and maintain its social license to operate.

Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations notes the report is a rough sketch, and the costs of best practices and regulations could be higher or lower. But he largely endorsed its findings, as do I. [2:00 p.m. | Updated Brad Plumer* at the Washington Post has now weighed in, as well.]

HEADLINE: Why S.E.C. Settlements Should Hold Senior Executives Liable

BYLINE: CLAIRE A. HILL and RICHARD W. PAINTER


HIGHLIGHT: Claire Hill and Richard W. Painter say bankers should pay a portion of any fine imposed on their bank for alleged misconduct, whether or not the bank admits wrongdoing. 

 BODY:
A federal judge rejected a proposed settlement last year between Citigroup and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The S.E.C. had alleged that Citi had defrauded investors by selling them collateralized debt obligations that included assets the bank handpicked and then bet against. In rejecting the settlement, the judge, Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, cited in particular a lack of admission of guilt by Citigroup, even as it agreed to pay $285 million and promised not to violate securities laws in the future. The S.E.C. and Citi appealed the rejection; an appeals court sided with them, and stayed Judge Rakoff's order. 
Whether or not Citi's behavior was illegal, it is clearly behavior that should be discouraged. But how should this best be accomplished? A recent hearing of the House Financial Services Committee focused on the role of settlements and particularly, whether the S.E.C. and other regulators should insist on an admission of wrongdoing in their settlements. Most witnesses testified that settlements should not require such admissions. Defendants would almost always refuse to settle on such terms, in part because an admission of a violation invites an onslaught of private securities suits seeking enormous damages. Regulators would be forced to litigate far more cases, often against adversaries with far greater resources.
Requiring settlements to include an admission of guilt is not the best way to proceed. A more effective approach would be to make senior, highly compensated officers of the bank pay some portion of the fine.
The Congressional hearing addressed the fact that a penalty assessed against an entity is effectively paid by its shareholders. The shareholders neither caused the behavior that led to the fine nor were they responsible for preventing it. By contrast, the Citigroup officers who were responsible do not bear a significant portion of the penalty, except to the extent they are shareholders or their bonuses are tied to earnings, now reduced by the penalty. They thus have little incentive to change their behavior.
To change that incentive, all of a bank's most highly compensated officers - those making more than $1 million a year - should be personally and collectively liable for paying a significant portion (perhaps 50 percent) of S.E.C. fines levied against their bank, a liability that could not be waived by the commission. Officers should be liable for an amount in proportion to the size of their compensation that year.
We need to prevent banks from avoiding settlements in order to dodge this personal liability. Indeed, independent directors should supervise the negotiations of, and approve the terms and entry into, settlements. Independence should be judged not just by looking at familial and business relationships, but also by looking at the real-world ties between board members and officers. Moreover, if the case was litigated rather than settled, the officers should be personally and collectively responsible for a portion of the bank's legal bills incurred in the litigation. And banks should be prohibited from reimbursing officers for the amounts the officers paid in connection with any settlement or litigation, and from increasing their pay for the two years thereafter.
The idea of personal liability for bank executives is not as novel as it might seem. Before the 1980s, many investment banks were organized as general partnerships, with each partner's capital tied up in the partnership and each partner personally liable for debts the partnership incurred. Any loss to the partnership - including a fine imposed by a regulator - was borne by the entire partnership in proportion to each partner's share in the firm.
When there was a loss, the most highly paid and most powerful partners suffered the most. There were no outside shareholders to absorb fines and other costs of the partners' wrongdoing. The partners enjoyed the fruits of their labors, but they also paid for their mistakes.
In the period between enactment of the federal securities laws in the 1930s and the 1980s, when many of the investment banking partnerships became public companies with shareholders, wrongdoing in the industry was probably less frequent and certainly of smaller magnitude than it is today. The partnership model of investment banking thus helped prevent excessive economic and legal risk-taking ---risk-taking that led to the Great Recession.
While it is not realistic to require investment banks to become general partnerships, bankers should be subject to some personal liability, as they would have been had they been partners. We have already suggested imposing on the most highly paid investment bankers some measure of personal liability for the debts of their firms in the case of insolvency - although stopping short of full joint and several liability. We suggest making these same bankers pay a portion of any fine imposed on their bank for alleged misconduct, whether or not the bank admits to wrongdoing.
Some might object that imposing personal liability for a firm's debts would curtail risk-taking. Indeed it would, but this is an advantage of personal liability, not an objection. We need less risk-taking in investment banking these days, not more, whether the risks at issue are legal, those involving the solvency of financial institutions or, as is often the case, both. Bankers will continue to take big risks as long as the benefit they get from doing so is far higher than the costs they may incur. We need to increase the personal costs to bankers of unreasonable risk-taking; personal liability is the way to do it.
Regulatory solutions too often focus on institutions. Regulators, and the private sector, should be thinking more about individuals. Senior bankers make a great deal of money; they can do a great deal of good, but their actions also can cause enormous harm. We need to focus our attention on how to make bankers be more mindful of the consequences of their actions.

HEADLINE: P.&G. Takes Center Stage at Gupta Trial

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED and PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The testimony of a former trader for the Galleon Group who has pleaded guilty to insider trading took center stage at the trial of Rajat K. Gupta, a former board member of Goldman Sachs and Procter &#038; Gamble who is accused of passing corporate tips. 

 BODY:
8:40 p.m. | Updated 
Michael Cardillo was a low-level trader barely known outside of his firm before he was accused of insider trading. Now, he could end up playing a major role in the trial of Rajat K. Gupta, a member of the global business elite who has been charged with passing corporate tips for profit.
Mr. Gupta, a former board member of Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble, has been charged by the government with leaking secret information about the companies to Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group co-founder convicted of insider trading last year.
While the closely watched trial in United States District Court in Lower Manhattan has largely focused on Goldman, Mr. Cardillo's testimony on Tuesday put P.& G. center stage.
 Prosecutors have accused Mr. Gupta of leaking two crucial secrets about the consumer-products giant: the company's sale of its Folgers coffee business to the J. M. Smucker Company in 2008, and P.& G.'s announcement about disappointing sales growth in 2009.
Mr. Cardillo, 35, a former trader at Galleon, is crucial to convincing the jurors of these two charges. On Tuesday, Mr. Gupta's defense team tried to discredit his testimony by depicting him as beholden to prosecutors.
Mr. Cardillo pleaded guilty to insider trading last year and has been cooperating with the government since 2009. Unemployable on Wall Street, he now spends his days trading for his personal brokerage account.
Last week, Mr. Cardillo told the jury that he made big profits betting against P.& G. after a conversation with R. K. Rajaratnam, the brother of Raj Rajaratnam and the head of Galleon's consumer-products investment team. Mr. Cardillo testified that R. K. Rajaratnam told him in early 2009 that his brother had heard from a P.& G. board member that the company was going to lower its sales forecast.
Mr. Cardillo also testified that R. K. Rajaratnam told him in 2008 that P.&. G. was planning to sell the Folgers coffee business to J. M. Smucker before the information was released publicly.
"He told me the information was coming from Raj's guy at P.& G.," Mr. Cardillo said.
Much of the government's case relies on circumstantial evidence, and Mr. Cardillo's testimony is no different. While his recollections of both the Folgers deal and P.& G. earnings are specific, the information came to him third hand rather than directly from Mr. Gupta.
Out of earshot of jurors, Mr. Gupta's defense team fought to exclude certain testimony by Mr. Cardillo as unreliable hearsay. But Judge Jed S. Rakoff, a lively presence behind the bench, said that he would allow Mr. Cardillo's recollections because they were statements made in furtherance of an insider trading conspiracy and that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to allow for their admission.
Mr. Gupta's lawyers also sought to exploit the fact that Mr. Cardillo had not known the identify of the P.& G. source, and had never met or spoken with Mr. Gupta. Lawyers argued that Mr. Rajaratnam had sources across corporate America and that the person who provided the tip could have been anyone.
Judge Rakoff denied their request, while acknowledging that the case posed broader ethical issues.
"The most disturbing part of this case is what it says about business ethics," said Judge Rakoff, speaking of Mr. Rajaratnam's many of sources. "It's not just one bad apple, but a whole bushel full."
To support Mr. Cardillo's testimony, prosecutors offered up Galleon documents showing heavy trading in J. M. Smucker before the public announcement of the sale.
They also produced documents to offer a timeline of when certain information had become available to Mr. Gupta, and when it became available to the public.
Barring a few moments in court, the testimony on Tuesday largely involved witnesses reviewing an endless stack of documents - the minutes of board meetings, letters, e-mails and a handful of news articles.
At one point, even judge Jed S. Rakoff admonished the lawyers to liven it up.
"Counsels, I am in awe of our jury because they have managed to remain attentive even though the vast bulk of the day could be described as 'Mr. Witness, I show you document X. Let's put it up on the screen,' " he said. "The notion that the jury is going to peruse carefully several thousand documents shows a naïveté."
On Tuesday, a second juror was replaced by an alternate. Judge Rakoff said the juror, an executive assistant at a Manhattan hospital, had to travel to South Carolina to visit a sister who had been injured in a car accident. Her replacement is a man who works as a marketing manager in Rockland County, N.Y. Another juror was replaced last week, because of a family emergency.
While the less-than-exciting day prompted some jurors to yawn repeatedly and stare around the courtroom, it was not without its moments of tension and levity.
As Richard Tarlowe, a prosecutor, questioned Mr. Cardillo, a defense lawyer, Gary Naftalis, repeatedly objected. Mr. Tarlowe grew frustrated at the constant interruptions.
After haggling over the admission of a document, Judge Rakoff joked: "I see that you and the defense are agreed on the font size."
Mr. Tarlowe fired back: "Is there a font size less than zero?"

HEADLINE: This Week, Talk of Bain, Jobs and Bipartisanship

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: What Mitt Romney and President Obama are likely to spar over this week. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Presidential campaigns rarely run in a predictable, straight line, and this week will be no exception.
President Obama and Mitt Romney will no doubt continue their debate over Mr. Romney's experience at Bain Capital - a debate that both campaigns seem eager to continue in speeches and television commercials. 
But there will be other issues and distractions as well.
JOBS Both campaigns are eagerly awaiting the release of new job numbers on Friday, an event that is certain to fuel the already intense debate over the pace of job creation.
Last month, the disappointing report, which showed that only 115,000 jobs had been created in April, gave a boost to Mr. Romney's criticism that the president's economic policies have not worked.
Mr. Obama has responded with a concerted attack on Mr. Romney's history at Bain Capital, challenging his credentials as a job creator. "There may be value in that kind of experience, but it's not in the White House," Mr. Obama said last week.
But another anemic report could provide Mr. Romney with more rhetorical ammunition. It might also prompt a new round of anti-Bain advertisements as the Obama campaign tries to change the subject by undermining Mr. Romney's record.
REPUBLICANS For a while this year, it looked like the Republican primary in Texas might have been the climax to the contentious intraparty feud. Now, it is mostly an afterthought.
But the primary on Tuesday could give Mr. Romney the 1,144 delegates he needs to officially become the Republican Party's nominee. 
Before Rick Santorum dropped out of the race, he had looked to the state as a place where he could make a significant dent in Mr. Romney's delegate total. 
Mr. Santorum never made it that far. With all of Mr. Romney's rivals out of the hunt, there has been no campaigning in Texas. The Houston Chronicle estimates that Mr. Romney needs to win 70 percent of the vote on Tuesday to collect enough delegates to put him over the top.
If he doesn't, he will probably have to wait until June 5 - when California and four other states vote - to clinch the deal.
BIPARTISANSHIP True moments of bipartisanship are rare in Washington at any time. And they are almost impossible to find during the final six months of a presidential campaign.
But there will be two hug-it-out moments this week at the White House.
On Tuesday, Mr. Obama will present the Presidential Medal of Freedom during a ceremony in the East Room to recipients including the author Toni Morrison and Pat Summitt, who recently stepped down as the women's basketball coach at the University of Tennessee. The presentation of the award - the highest civilian honor - is an event typically devoid of the partisan rancor so common in the capital. 
And on Thursday, Mr. Obama will welcome his predecessor, George W. Bush, and his wife, Laura, to the White House for the unveiling of their official portraits. 
The last time a presidential portrait was unveiled, Mr. Bush was on the other side of the equation: attending the unveiling of Bill Clinton's portrait during a ceremony at the White House on June 14, 2004. 
That day, Mr. Bush welcomed Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and sang their praises, putting aside their very deep political differences even as the presidential campaign of that year raged on.
Mr. Bush said Mr. Clinton possessed a "deep and far-ranging knowledge of foreign policy," a "great compassion for people in need" and said that "Bill Clinton could always see a better day ahead. He filled this house with energy and joy. He's a man of enthusiasm and warmth."
Expect similar accolades of Mr. Bush by Mr. Obama on Thursday.
CAMPAIGNING The nice words for Mr. Bush will not linger for long. On Friday, Mr. Obama will head to Minnesota for an economics event at which he will urge Congressional action on his "to do" list of legislation. And then he will attend several campaign events where bashing Mr. Bush's economic legacy will once again be front and center.
Mr. Obama's campaign speeches are increasingly laced with derision for the economic policies of Mr. Bush and warnings that the country should not repeat them.
Look for those warnings again at the campaign stops in Minnesota and Chicago.

HEADLINE: In a Town on an Upswing, Romney Brings a Message of Economic Woe

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney made his case that the Obama White House had hobbled local economies that rely on energy production. Local officials did not exactly cooperate. 

 BODY:
CRAIG, Colo. - Mitt Romney chose this rural community to make his case on Tuesday that the Obama White House had hobbled local economies that rely on energy production.
But local officials attending his campaign event did not exactly cooperate.
They said that Craig, home to a coal-fired power plant, had weathered the recession better than many of its neighboring cities and towns, largely because of the health of the local energy industry over the past few years. 
"The economy here in Craig and in Moffat County does seem stronger than a lot of our Western Slope communities," said Ryan Call, the chairman of the state Republican Party. "And that's good. That's a good thing."
Unemployment in Moffat County, which contains Craig, was at 8.3 percent in April, slightly above the national average, according to the State Department of Labor and Employment. That is down from a high of about 11 percent in 2010.
The city's finance director, Bruce Nelson, said that tax revenue had bounced back strongly since last late year. "We are holding our own," he said.
Terry Carwile, the mayor of Craig and a retired coal miner, went further, saying that the economy was "getting better" in the town of 9,500 as oil speculation intensified. He played down the suggestion that federal regulations had wounded the local coal industry.
"The policies of the federal government really aren't that impactful to us so far," he said. He acknowledged that they were "a concern," though, and that residents were ever wary of government meddling in their biggest industry.
That was not the message from Mr. Romney, who spoke to about 1,000 residents in a park near the town's center.
"I'm not going to forget Craig, Colo.," he said. "I'm not going to forget communities like this across the country that are hurting right now under this president."
Mr. Romney suggested that he had been motivated to visit Craig by Frank and Kerrie Moe, owners of a Best Western hotel, who appeared in a video that depicted the difficulties facing the town.
The video was a joint project of the American Energy Alliance and Americans for Prosperity. Financing for Americans for Prosperity comes from the Koch brothers, who have significant oil and gas holdings and have spent heavily to defeat Mr. Obama.
The video's focus, though, was a recent state statute requiring that 30 percent of Colorado's electricity be generated by renewable sources like wind and solar power by 2020.
Mr. Romney seemed to refer to the video in his remarks, as he appeared onstage with the Moes. "That's something I saw, and I said we gotta come here and let you know that we care about what's happening in Craig," he said.

Dewey & LeBoeuf Files for Bankruptcy | Dewey & LeBoeuf, the law firm crippled by financial miscues and partner defections, filed for bankruptcy on Monday night, punctuating the largest law firm collapse in United States history.
The filing, made in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan, is the final chapter in a turbulent period for Dewey, which came apart after disappointing profits and prodigious debt forced it to slash partners' salaries. The partners, already owed millions from previous years, grew concerned over the firm's finances and their ability to get paid. A partner exodus destroyed the firm.
Dewey announced on Monday that the firm planned to liquidate. It said it would ask about 90 employees to remain on staff to assist in winding down its business. The firm has $315 million in liabilities, of which $225 million is owed to its banks, according to the court filings. Other creditors include the firm's landlords and former partners owed money.
"This is a very sad day for the legal profession," said Richard J. Holwell, a former federal judge in Manhattan now in private practice. "Dewey is a fabled firm with a lot of great lawyers, and a demise of this magnitude is unprecedented." DealBook »

Ms. Keegan once wrote a guest column for DealBook, arguing that college students should try to resist the allure of a high-paying job in finance after graduation. Drawing on interviews with her peers, she tapped into a national debate on the financial services industry.
"Maybe I'm overly optimistic, but I think most young, ambitious people want to have a positive impact on the world. Whether it's through art or activism or advances in science, almost every student I spoke to had some kind of larger, altruistic goal in life," she wrote. DEALBOOK | YALE DAILY NEWS

HEADLINE: Younger Investors Jaded About the Stock Market, Survey Finds

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A surprising number of younger investors plan to pull money from the stock market soon. Why would they do that? 

 BODY:
The market downturn of 2008 may have had an especially chilling effect on younger Americans, a quarterly retirement survey suggests.
About a third of Americans aged 18 to 34 said they planned to pull money out of the stock market and were most likely to "sit on the sidelines" in the next six months and move assets into money market and savings accounts, according to a survey from Charles Schwab & Company (Just 11 percent of older Americans said they would do the same).
The telephone survey was conducted for Schwab by Koski Research from May 3 to 7. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
The survey found that 35 percent of Americans over all considered protecting retirement assets more important than growing those assets, and just 6 percent planned to take additional risk with their retirement accounts in the next six months.
Younger Americans, in particular, have seen their parents' retirement savings, as well as their own, suffer with recent market swings and have become more risk averse, said Bill Allen, vice president of Schwab Private Client Investment Advisory.
"Our younger investors have seen some pretty remarkable things," said Mr. Allen, and one result is that "they're jaded very early on."
While younger investors have a longer time horizon to save for retirement that may allow for moderate or even aggressive risk taking, many are becoming more conservative, given what they have seen in recent years. And that is understandable, he said; just because conventional wisdom says you should be able to take more risk doesn't mean you as an individual can stomach severe market ups and downs.
"Another side is your emotional tolerance," he said.
So what is a younger investor to do? If you don't feel you can handle the stress of putting a lot of money at risk in the stock market, "just put some there," Mr. Allen advises. "Put an amount that makes you comfortable, and don't worry about what you hear at cocktail parties or the water cooler."
Another way to reduce the stress of market swings is to focus on how much you save, he said. Investors can't control the market, he notes, but "you can control the amount that you save."
Are you saving more, but putting less money into the stock market?

HEADLINE: It's Not Just Lunch; There's Tennis, Too

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

 BODY:
PARIS
SOME people go to the French Open for the tennis; others go for the food.
The strongest memory of my first visit to Roland Garros nearly a decade ago does not involve the fate of a match. It revolves around the sweet aromas that hit me as I entered the stadium: the vanilla and butter of a fresh waffle mingled with the hazelnut and cocoa of the Nutella topping.
''We're a long way from Forest Hills,'' I said to my husband, who grew up close to the site of the United States Open before it moved to Flushing Meadows.
Wimbledon may have its strawberries and cream. But for 15 days every spring, the Roland Garros complex on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne becomes the place to power lunch in Paris. 
These days, in this economy, fewer French business executives dare to be caught on television sitting in a box seat and watching tennis balls fly over a net at 4 in the afternoon.
But lunch is different. ''I have to go to Roland Garros for lunch'' signals serious networking and hard work a la francaise.
''I'm not proud to admit that some guys come here only to eat,'' said Gilbert Ysern, chief executive of the French Tennis Federation. ''But our signature is that we can offer you a meal as great as any great restaurant in Paris. You know you'll see and be seen. You'll shake interesting hands and have interesting encounters.
''And the ambience! It's the ambience of spring, of seeing pretty women dressed with flair.''
It's no accident that Roland Garros is the only one of the four Grand Slam tournaments to be played on clay courts, which traditionally have created a higher bounce and a slower game than matches played on hard courts or grass. It is more important here to keep the rallies going with style and panache than to go straight for the kill. Pleasure comes with prolonging, not concluding.
As for the real Roland Garros, he was a record-breaking aviator and inventor who knew how to enjoy himself. On the ground between missions during World War I, he would sip Champagne as he played the piano to drown out the sound of bombing raids. Although never much of a tennis player, he was such a popular hero that France named its international tennis tournament and stadium after him.
And lunch at Roland Garros? Like the royal French courts, there is a hierarchy of who eats where and what. At the very bottom there is American-style fast food for the grand public -- the general public. (As an American, I am embarrassed that the hamburgers and hot dogs introduced last year give a bad name to what can be decent sports stadium fare.) In the middle there are respectable venues like a self-service sit-down restaurant.
But at the top, the very top, there are coveted dining experiences reserved for the chosen few. On the first day of the tournament on Sunday, I tried both haute-cuisine sites.
I started in late morning at the Grand Chelem -- the Grand Slam -- a group of intimate, temporary tented dining rooms on the fringe of the stadium run by the caterer Lenotre. The rooms spill out onto a deck with a bar, chaise longues and orchids and palm trees.
Here, corporations and private individuals rent rooms or tables for their clients. ''All year I'm in nothing but business, and here's my one chance to mix it with pleasure,'' said Valery Safarian, head of the Belgian-Armenian Chamber of Commerce in Brussels, who was hosting 10 guests for lunch and tennis-watching at 700 euros a head. (About $862 at $1.23 to the euro.) I kept an eye on the tennis matches shown on televisions hung from the walls as I sampled the rich fare -- a bit too rich for an 85-degree day in an un-air-conditioned outdoor space: duck layered with foie gras and decorated with asparagus and pickled peach slices; beef fillet with stuffed baby vegetables and an assortment of cheeses.
The prettiest creation was the dessert: a martini-shaped glass with crunchy chocolate ''diamonds'' on the bottom and layers of dark chocolate, milk chocolate and raspberry mousse that seemed suspended in air. Guy Krenzer, the chef, showed me his trick: he cut a circle of dark chocolate to fit midway down the glass and layered the three mousses on top, finishing them off with a raspberry and a piece of gold leaf.
I asked to see his kitchens, but there were none. Dishes are prepared at Lenotre's off-site locations and only finished or heated here.
That robs Lenotre of the cachet of Potel et Chabot, its Roland Garros rival. Potel has been in business for more than 190 years. In 1900, it served 25,000 meals at a banquet in the Tuileries Garden in honor of the mayors of France. After that, no mission was impossible.
Every season, on the site of a parking lot, Potel builds an ephemeral restaurant complex with a staircase, an elevator and 18 industrial white cube-rooms that stack up to three stories high. Potel boasts a staff of 800, including 250 chefs, who work in six on-site kitchens. Every day, it prepares and serves from 4,500 to 5,000 meals at various sites, compared with about 600 for Lenotre.
I was led up to the Village de Roland Garros on the second level, where Potel accommodates 19 corporations, among them Perrier, Peugeot, I.B.M., Longines and Lacoste, which rent and decorate reception rooms for their best clients. The rooms open out onto a central avenue lined with white petunias and gold and orange marigolds, where clients mingle and sip cocktails.
One level above is an invitation-only restaurant called Club Potel et Chabot. There I was greeted with a flute of pink Champagne and an amuse-bouche of foie gras on long, paper-thin leaf-shaped toast.
Lunch started with ceviche of dorade in an iced sorrel base with tiny bits of crisp green zucchini. Then came Bresse chicken, the king of fowl, in a sauce of pungent vin jaune from the Jura, accompanied by thin layers of potato on one side and a savory cake of finely diced morel mushrooms and chicken on the other. The morels had been reconstituted from dried, because fresh ones, alas, were out of season. A 2010 Laporte Le Grand Rochoy Sancerre (white) and a 2011 David Reynaud Crozes-Hermitage (red) were served.
As this was my second lunch of the day, I skipped the cheese course and went straight to the mini cream puffs served atop a bed of cherries in hibiscus water.
Every culinary whim was taken as a command. When one guest at my table casually noted that vin jaune has a strange taste on its own but is perfect when married with Comte cheese, a 2005 Arbois Vin Jaune Stephane Tissot and thick slices of fruity 18-month-old Comte suddenly appeared.
Diners can't buy just lunch. The French federation sells a one-day package with a ticket to the open, a Potel lunch and a souvenir gift for 480 to 3,000 euros, depending on the category of ticket and the day of play. Normally too rich for my blood, so I went looking for waffles. Sad to say, the ones I found were limp, delivered precooked early that morning. And Nutella was no longer offered.
But you can't take away the memory.

HEADLINE: Ex-Galleon Trader Plays Big Role in Insider Case

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED and PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
8:40 p.m. Updated
Michael Cardillo was a low-level trader barely known outside of his firm before he was accused of insider trading. Now, he could end up playing a major role in the trial of Rajat K. Gupta, a member of the global business elite who has been charged with passing corporate tips for profit.
Mr. Gupta, a former board member of Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble, has been charged by the government with leaking secret information about the companies to Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group co-founder convicted of insider trading last year. 
While the closely watched trial in United States District Court in Lower Manhattan has largely focused on Goldman, Mr. Cardillo's testimony on Tuesday put P.& G. center stage.
Prosecutors have accused Mr. Gupta of leaking two crucial secrets about the consumer-products giant: the company's sale of its Folgers coffee business to the J. M. Smucker Company in 2008, and P.& G.'s announcement about disappointing sales growth in 2009.
Mr. Cardillo, 35, a former trader at Galleon, is crucial to convincing the jurors of these two charges. On Tuesday, Mr. Gupta's defense team tried to discredit his testimony by depicting him as beholden to prosecutors.
Mr. Cardillo pleaded guilty to insider trading last year and has been cooperating with the government since 2009. Unemployable on Wall Street, he now spends his days trading for his personal brokerage account.
Last week, Mr. Cardillo told the jury that he made big profits betting against P.& G. after a conversation with R. K. Rajaratnam, the brother of Raj Rajaratnam and the head of Galleon's consumer-products investment team. Mr. Cardillo testified that R. K. Rajaratnam told him in early 2009 that his brother had heard from a P.& G. board member that the company was going to lower its sales forecast.
Mr. Cardillo also testified that R. K. Rajaratnam told him in 2008 that P.&. G. was planning to sell the Folgers coffee business to J. M. Smucker before the information was released publicly.
''He told me the information was coming from Raj's guy at P.& G.,'' Mr. Cardillo said.
Much of the government's case relies on circumstantial evidence, and Mr. Cardillo's testimony is no different. While his recollections of both the Folgers deal and P.& G. earnings are specific, the information came to him third hand rather than directly from Mr. Gupta.
Out of earshot of jurors, Mr. Gupta's defense team fought to exclude certain testimony by Mr. Cardillo as unreliable hearsay. But Judge Jed S. Rakoff, a lively presence behind the bench, said that he would allow Mr. Cardillo's recollections because they were statements made in furtherance of an insider trading conspiracy and that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to allow for their admission.
Mr. Gupta's lawyers also sought to exploit the fact that Mr. Cardillo had not known the identify of the P.& G. source, and had never met or spoken with Mr. Gupta. Lawyers argued that Mr. Rajaratnam had sources across corporate America and that the person who provided the tip could have been anyone.
Judge Rakoff denied their request, while acknowledging that the case posed broader ethical issues.
''The most disturbing part of this case is what it says about business ethics,'' said Judge Rakoff, speaking of Mr. Rajaratnam's many of sources. ''It's not just one bad apple, but a whole bushel full.''
To support Mr. Cardillo's testimony, prosecutors offered up Galleon documents showing heavy trading in J. M. Smucker before the public announcement of the sale.
They also produced documents to offer a timeline of when certain information had become available to Mr. Gupta, and when it became available to the public.
Barring a few moments in court, the testimony on Tuesday largely involved witnesses reviewing an endless stack of documents - the minutes of board meetings, letters, e-mails and a handful of news articles.
At one point, even judge Jed S. Rakoff admonished the lawyers to liven it up.
''Counsels, I am in awe of our jury because they have managed to remain attentive even though the vast bulk of the day could be described as 'Mr. Witness, I show you document X. Let's put it up on the screen,' '' he said. ''The notion that the jury is going to peruse carefully several thousand documents shows a naivete.''
On Tuesday, a second juror was replaced by an alternate. Judge Rakoff said the juror, an executive assistant at a Manhattan hospital, had to travel to South Carolina to visit a sister who had been injured in a car accident. Her replacement is a man who works as a marketing manager in Rockland County, N.Y. Another juror was replaced last week, because of a family emergency.
While the less-than-exciting day prompted some jurors to yawn repeatedly and stare around the courtroom, it was not without its moments of tension and levity.
As Richard Tarlowe, a prosecutor, questioned Mr. Cardillo, a defense lawyer, Gary Naftalis, repeatedly objected. Mr. Tarlowe grew frustrated at the constant interruptions.
After haggling over the admission of a document, Judge Rakoff joked: ''I see that you and the defense are agreed on the font size.''
Mr. Tarlowe fired back: ''Is there a font size less than zero?''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: More Room for Ideas In a Smaller Office

BYLINE: By J. MICHAEL WELTON

 BODY:
Ever since the economy started to slow down about five years ago, companies have been looking for ways to reduce their office space costs. One option that has become more popular is reconfiguring the office to fit the same number of workers in a smaller space, and either subleasing the leftover square footage or returning it to the landlord.
Certainly, the primary motive is saving money. But some companies and architects say that having employees in closer proximity makes for a more collegial and collaborative environment -- and a more productive and profitable one.
''We wanted people to be able to work wherever the work is, in whatever style,'' said Mike Grindell, the executive vice president and chief administrative officer of 22squared, an advertising agency in Atlanta that recently completed a renovation. 
The agency originally had three floors at 1170 Peachtree Street NE, and was subletting two-thirds of one of the floors in 2009 when it hired the large architecture company Gensler to redesign its quarters and ensure it met LEED gold energy standards. Gensler teamed with Carter USA, an Atlanta-based commercial real estate company, as project manager and Humphries & Company from nearby Smyrna, Ga., as general contractor.
At 22squared, a privately held agency with $64.7 million in 2011 revenue, the team ended up with a 50,000-square-foot space on two floors that went from an emphasis on hierarchy to one about equality. Before the renovation, natural light was reserved for private offices and conference rooms; now sunlight reigns for all.
Walls were dismantled. Employee work stations are now by windows. Private offices are at the center of the firm's two floors. Small collaborative spaces are prevalent. White boards and glass walls for writing are everywhere. Work groups come together, dissolve, then come back together again.
By Gensler's own measure, the revised space has delivered favorable results. Collaboration has increased by 22 percent, according to Gensler's Workplace Performance Index, which rates workplaces and employees before and after renovations. That score brings 22squared's rating up to par with the top performers in the advertising industry.
''You see and feel work happening all over the space,'' Mr. Grindell said. ''There's better density, energy and productivity on two floors now than on two and a third before.''
Kevin Parker, the president and chief executive of Deltek, a software engineering company in Herndon, Va., said consolidation solved a number of problems at once for his company.
''We were spread out on seven floors in four buildings,'' Mr. Parker said. ''There was friction from meetings and driving -- the buildings were within 10 square miles. With the traffic here, that's a lifetime.''
Deltek moved into a newly configured space in an existing building last November with the goals of consolidating the company, and taking advantage of cost savings, higher productivity, and more idea generation and sharing.
Now, about 700 Deltek headquarters employees, a diverse group resulting from 11 acquisitions since 2005, are all in one redesigned, six-story building. Employees from two of the acquired companies, once archrivals who competed fiercely to provide information and analysis to companies seeking government contracts, now work side by side.
''The us-versus-them went away,'' Mr. Parker said. ''It's one team, one floor. Now we've got some mojo.''
Because Deltek's corporate culture is focused around special events like celebrating new sales, the new building has a vertical and horizontal hub. Circular spaces feed into it to create a sense of community.
''They can bring people together for big announcements,'' said Catherine Haley, a senior principal at HOK and Deltek's architect. ''It creates visibility and the ability to network with each other.''
Even some of the country's largest companies are cutting space. Christian Bigsby, the senior vice president for worldwide real estate and facilities at GlaxoSmithKline, said the company was engaging in what it called an opportunistic ''footprint reduction program.'' It began to make the investment, based on vacancy, relocations, or lease terminations, about six years ago.
Located in 90 countries with primary administrative centers in Britain, the United States and Belgium, GlaxoSmithKline is enacting the program globally.
''We can move to a smaller building with a smarter, improved working environment for reduced S.G.A. costs,'' Mr. Bigsby said, using an accounting abbreviation for selling, general and administrative expenses -- essentially, the overhead and indirect costs.
Before the program began, 35 percent of GlaxoSmithKline's work activities were taking place in cubicles or offices. But those spaces took up 85 percent of the company's office space, what Mr. Bigsby called a significant misallocation of resources. The question became: if the company provides 85 percent of its space for 35 percent of its work, where was the rest happening?
The answer: in meeting rooms, corridors, coffee stations and during travel. ''Our solution is to press down the 85 percent dedicated space and increase the variety of alternative work spaces, because people's activities did not align to the traditional spaces.'' Mr. Bigsby said. ''The desk space is now about half of our footprint.''
The arrangement of the workplace into neighborhoods and communities, in the form of benching for six people at a stretch, is not without a down side. On what the company calls bonus day earlier this year, Mr. Bigsby scurried to find a private space to review his salary with his superior.
''Everyone was trying to get a one-on-one,'' he said. He had to settle for talking to his boss at a video conference out on the floor.
GlaxoSmithKline provides eight seats for every 10 employees, so it is possible that people might work in a different space every day.
''You get what's available,'' said Ms. Haley of HOK, who was also responsible for the Glaxo design. ''If you can work on a computer in the middle seat of an airplane on a flight to Europe, then you can work at a different desk every day. It's a hotelling desk -- it's not assigned to you.''
Bottom line, the clients say, is that the compression pays off.
''Our contract cycle used to take three to four days,'' said Mr. Parker of Deltek. ''Now we've cut it to hours.'' Better yet, the firm has saved $1.5 million in rent.
At 22squared, the savings came during midnight of the recession, when the firm signed a new lease on its Atlanta office. ''Let's just say that over 11 years, it's 15 to 20 percent better than what we had, plus a top-to-bottom total renovation,'' Mr. Grindell said.
For a firm like GlaxoSmithKline, employing about 100,000 people globally, there are certain economies of scale. ''We've reduced costs by $50 million a year just in our administrative spaces,'' Mr. Bigsby said.

HEADLINE: Educated, but Not Fitting In

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Ronan Sato, a graduate student in applied statistics at Oxford, has always been keen to work in his native Japan. But at a careers fair for overseas Japanese students, he found that corporate Japan did not return his enthusiasm.
In meetings with a handful of Japanese financial trading firms at the forum in Boston last November, none would offer him a job without further interviews in Tokyo.
So Mr. Sato, who received three offers on the spot from non-Japanese corporations, accepted a position in Tokyo with a big British bank.
''I really wanted to gain experience at a Japanese company, but they seemed cautious,'' he said. ''Do Japanese companies really want global talent? It seemed to me like they're not really serious.'' 
Notoriously insular, corporate Japan has long been wary of embracing Western-educated compatriots who return home. But critics say the reluctance to tap the international experience of these young people is a growing problem for Japan as some of its major industries -- like banking, consumer electronics and automobiles -- lose ground in an increasingly global economy.
Discouraged by their career prospects if they study abroad, even at elite universities, a shrinking portion of Japanese college students is seeking higher education in the West. At the same time, Japan's regional rivals, including China, South Korea and India, are sending increasing numbers of students overseas -- many of whom, upon graduation, are snapped up by companies back home for their skills, contacts and global outlooks.
''Japanese companies here are missing out on the best foreign talent, and it's all their fault,'' said Toshihiko Irisumi, a graduate of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and former Goldman Sachs banker. He runs Alpha Leaders, a Tokyo-based consulting firm that helps match young talent with employers based in Japan. ''They really need to change their mind-set.''
A United States-born graduate of Brown University who has a dual citizenship in Japan, one of about 12 foreign-educated Japanese nationals interviewed for this article, said she was told she ''laughed too much'' in interviews for a technology job in Tokyo.
Others with Western educations recall being treated with suspicion by Japanese recruiters, who referred to them openly as ''over spec'' -- too elite to fit in, too eager to get ahead and too likely to be poached or to switch employers before long.
What is more, Japanese students who study overseas often find that by the time they enter the job hunt back home, they are far behind compatriots who have already contacted as many as 100 companies and received help from extensive alumni networks. And those who spend too long overseas find they are shut out by rigid age preferences for graduates no older than their mid-20s.
In a survey of 1,000 Japanese companies taken last June on their recruitment plans for the March 2012 fiscal year by the Tokyo-based recruitment company Disco, fewer than a quarter said they planned to hire Japanese applicants who had studied abroad. Even among top companies with more than a thousand employees, less than 40 percent said they wanted to hire Japanese with overseas education.
That attitude might help explain why, even as the number of Japanese enrolled in college has held steady at around three million in recent years, the number studying abroad has declined from a peak of nearly 83,000 in 2004 to fewer than 60,000 in 2009 -- the most recent year for which the figures are available from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
In some ways, the Japanese snubbing of Western graduates is a testament to the perceived strength of their own universities, seen by many here as more prestigious than even the best American and European schools -- despite mediocre showings in various global college rankings.
At American universities, 21,290 Japanese students were registered last year, fewer than half the number a decade ago -- even though the overall number of Japanese enrolled in college has been constant, at around 3 million. American universities last year had 73,350 students from South Korea, which has less than half of Japan's population,
''There is an awareness that Japan's competitiveness is falling, and we need a more global work force,'' said Kazunori Masugo, head of the Senri International School in western Japan and a member of a central government committee on education and training. Lessons at Senri are taught mostly in English and the school sends a handful of students to colleges in the United States and Europe each year.
''But the environment in Japan is such that if you go overseas to study, you have to be prepared to go your own route, find your own way,'' he said.
Ryutaro Sakamoto, who paid his way through the University of Toronto and returned to Japan at age 30 with a business degree, found he was too old to apply through standard recruitment programs. He sent resumes to the likes of Panasonic and Sony, anyway, but never heard back. Eventually, the Japanese unit of the American insurance company Prudential was happy to put his bilingual skills to use.
''In Japan, taking the time to study overseas sets you back in the shukatsu race,'' he said.
''Shukatsu'' refers to the system in which Japanese companies typically hire the bulk of their workers straight from college and expect them to stay until retirement. Not getting a job upon graduation is seen as a potential career killer.
So competition is fierce. In the last three years, the percentage of new graduates in Japan who found work was the lowest since the government started collecting comparable data in 1996. As of Feb. 1, with two months left in the recruiting season, a fifth of students in their final year at college had yet to find jobs.
''Shukatsu is like Kabuki theater,'' said Takayuki Matsumoto, an Osaka-based career consultant. ''It's difficult when you don't fit the template.''
His advice to returnees: don't be too assertive or ask too many questions.
Kenta Koga, one of only a handful of Japanese undergraduates to enter Yale in 2010, violated many unwritten rules last summer as an intern at a big Japanese advertising agency in Tokyo. On client rounds with his boss, who was advising on trends in technology or social media, Mr. Koga, a computer science major, felt the urge to speak up.
''Some of what they were discussing was old or plain wrong,'' he said. But he was careful to steep his language in the appropriate honorifics reserved for elders. ''I'm terribly sorry to interrupt,'' he said he would murmur. ''My deepest apologies if you already knew this.''
Still, his supervisors were annoyed. ''You are being too scary and preventing other people from speaking,'' one boss said, according to Mr. Koga. On another occasion, he said, he was censured for crossing his arms in front of senior colleagues. He was eventually excluded from meetings and assigned seemingly dead-end tasks. He now says he would never work for a Japanese company.
Some Japanese companies have made a point of reaching out to returnees. U-Shin, an auto parts maker, attracted attention in February when it placed a prominent ad in Japan's largest business daily offering twice the normal starting pay to candidates with overseas degrees.
''We plan to expand aggressively overseas, so we need recruits who were themselves bold enough to go overseas,'' said Koji Tanabe, U-Shin's chief executive.
But U-Shin seems the rare exception. The Japanese financial giant Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi more closely fits the norm. Each year, it hires about 1,200 fresh graduates. Usually, fewer than 20 have studied overseas or are non-Japanese, said Keiichi Hotta, a recruiter for the bank.
''We're cautious because we emphasize continuity and long-term commitment to the company,'' he said. ''Especially in finance, we don't want people who are focused on short-term gains.''
No wonder some returnees play down their exposure to Western ways. Norihiro Yonezawa, who studied for a year at the University of Maryland, said he did not emphasize overseas experience or English skills when he interviewed -- successfully -- for a coveted job at Panasonic.
''I didn't want to come across as a show-off. So I stressed how I worked hard and overcame that,'' he said. ''And I made sure to emphasize that I would still fit in.''

HEADLINE: Home Prices Show Mixed Improvement

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Home prices rose in March from February in most major American cities surveyed, according to a private housing report on Tuesday, marking the first increase in prices in seven months. 
A separate economic report, however, showed that Americans' confidence in the economy in May had its biggest drop in eight months.
The Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home price indexes showed that prices increased in 12 of the 20 cities it tracks. The overall index was essentially unchanged from February, after falling 0.8 percent from January, and it was down 2.6 percent from March a year ago.
Three of the weakest markets reported signs of improvement: prices increased in Tampa and Miami, while prices in Las Vegas were unchanged.
The biggest month-over-month increases were in Phoenix, Seattle and Dallas. Prices dropped sharply in Detroit, Chicago and Atlanta.
The increases partly reflect the beginning of the spring selling season. The month-to-month prices aren't adjusted for seasonal factors.
The Conference Board says its Consumer Confidence Index now stands at 64.9 points, down from a revised 68.7 in April. It was the biggest drop since October 2011.
Economists were expecting a reading of 70 points, according to a FactSet poll of analysts. The current level is below February's level of 71.6, which was the highest level it had been in a year.
Consumer confidence is widely watched because consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity in the United States. The measure is significantly below the 90 reading that indicates a healthy economy. But the current level is well above the 40 it hit last October.

HEADLINE: India's Economy Slows, With Global Implications

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY and VIKAS BAJAJ; Jim Yardley reported from New Delhi, and Vikas Bajaj from Mumbai, India.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- India's coalition government just celebrated the third anniversary of its tenure with a self-congratulatory banquet that could not have been more poorly timed: India's currency, the rupee, is falling; investment is down; inflation is rising; and deficits are eating away at government coffers.
While short-term growth has slowed but not ground to a halt, India's problems have dampened hopes that it, along with China and other non-Western economies, might help revive the global economy, as happened after the 2008 financial crisis. Instead, India is now facing a political reckoning, as the country's elected leaders must address difficult, politically unpopular decisions -- or risk even deeper problems.
''When India was being run comparatively well in 2008, they seemed to cope with these external shocks, at least from a financial perspective,'' said Glenn Levine, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in Sydney, Australia. ''I think people are starting to question the long-term Indian story. That is the difference now.'' 
India's difficulties come as the global economy is wobbling once again. Europe is grappling with a sovereign debt crisis that could shatter the continent's economic and political union. The United States is still not producing enough new jobs. China's growth has weakened, with a real estate downturn and stalling exports, while important emerging economies like Brazil are slowing down, adding to pessimism about the world economy at a critical time.
India is often viewed as a rising global powerhouse and, not too long ago, Indian officials were predicting growth rates of 9 percent or higher. The Obama administration, eager to tap into such a booming market and envisioning India as a regional counterweight to China, trumpeted the United States-India partnership. Some analysts even saw the global downturn as an opportunity for India, making it more attractive for foreign investors wary of putting money into declining advanced industrial countries.
Today, India's economy is still expanding, with growth projected between 6 percent and 7 percent this year. And analysts say India's long-term strengths remain significant. It has one of the world's youngest populations, and polls consistently show they are overwhelmingly optimistic about their future. Meanwhile, India's businesses are competing more aggressively on the global stage.
But the slowdown has punctured the once bubbly mood in the business and political classes and brought sharp criticism of the government. Indian business leaders, foreign investors and analysts say India's strengths are being undermined by growing political dysfunction: the populist tendencies of Indian politicians, a lack of action by top leaders and allegations of corruption that have undermined the authority of policy makers.
India is desperate for investment in mining, roads, ports, urban housing and other areas, but Indian businesses and foreign investors are starting to shy away. Indian corporations, unable to obtain governmental licenses or permissions for projects, are investing overseas instead. Foreigners are also pulling back; their investment in Indian stocks and bonds totaled only $16 billion in the last fiscal year, compared with $30 billion the year before. The trend accelerated in recent months after the Finance Ministry, trying to stem a rising budget deficit, proposed a raft of new taxes on foreign institutions doing business in India.
''A quiet crisis of confidence is building up,'' said Pratap Bhanu Mehta, president of the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. ''There is no certainty over the regulatory regime. There is no certainty over the tax regime.''
Indians have long thrived amid adversity, often by creatively -- at times, illegally -- subverting onerous regulations with a workaround ethos that has spurred economic activity. Even today, industries like pharmaceuticals, information technology and consumer goods, which do not need many licenses and official approvals, are prospering. But those sectors tied to the government, including mining, construction and manufacturing, are struggling.
''We have consciously kept away from businesses where we would have needed lots of permissions,'' said Ajay Piramal, who heads a Mumbai-based conglomerate focused on pharmaceuticals.
At the core of the political uncertainties is the weakened status of the Indian National Congress Party, which leads the coalition government, known as the United Progressive Alliance. Since 2004, the government has operated under an unorthodox partnership between Sonia Gandhi, president of the Congress Party and the governing coalition, and Manmohan Singh, her handpicked prime minister.
The division of duties worked during the government's first term. Mrs. Gandhi managed the coalition partners, rode herd on the Congress Party, championed safety net programs for the poor and oversaw election strategy; Mr. Singh, a quiet economist considered a father of India's reform era, moved India closer to the United States and oversaw a booming economy where growth topped 9 percent.
In 2009, voters returned the U.P.A. to power amid expectations that India, having shrugged off the 2008 global recession, was on an inevitably upward growth track. But analysts say the contradictions in the Singh-Gandhi partnership have since been exposed. Mr. Singh holds the most politically powerful job in the country, yet is seemingly reluctant to wield power and often must seek approval on policy questions from Mrs. Gandhi. She oversees an advisory panel largely consisting of social activists that her critics regard as a shadow government.
The result has been a lack of a clear political agenda emanating from the top, analysts and business leaders say, allowing the bureaucracy to fall back into its traditional resistance to making decisions. When officials do act, they often change course after encountering political opposition.
''The last year was wasted,'' said Sanjaya Baru, a former spokesman for the prime minister who is now at a research institute. ''We've had a crisis of leadership on the economic side.''
Moreover, the government has been on the defensive since a series of corruption scandals, dormant for several years, exploded into public view. Attempts by technocrats to push through a so-called ''second generation'' of deeper economic changes were undermined by the inability of the Congress Party to corral its coalition partners.
In December, Mr. Singh's cabinet announced that foreign retailers like Walmart would be allowed for the first time to open stores in the country with local partners. But Mr. Singh was forced to reverse course after an ally, Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of the state of West Bengal, balked and threatened to bring down the government.
Then in March, facing pressures to raise revenues and stem the rising fiscal deficit, Pranab Mukherjee, the finance minister, released a budget that proposed new taxes on foreign entities in India, including levies on past deals that the Indian Supreme Court had ruled were not taxable in the country. Foreign investors were stunned, and analysts say the outflow of capital is one reason the rupee has tumbled 13 percent since the end of February.
''We are fed up and our investors are not keen to even talk about India,'' said a senior executive at an American bank in Mumbai, asking not to be identified so he could speak bluntly. ''They are sick and tired.''
Kaushik Basu, the government's chief economic adviser, acknowledged that the government had made mistakes and had missed opportunities to better position India as the global economic landscape shifts. Yet he said that the rising pessimism was unwarranted and that India was still growing, still had high investment and savings rates, and should take advantage of the depreciation of the rupee to push exports. He said India's problems were no worse than those in other emerging economies.
''It is a difficult stage,'' Mr. Basu said in an interview. ''But I do remain very, very optimistic. Six months and we will pull up.''
In the meantime, the immediate challenges are piling up. This month, in a move to raise revenues, the government raised gasoline prices, drawing public fury. Now the question, analysts say, is whether the administration can muster the political courage to trim the bigger subsidies affecting diesel fuel and cooking gas.
Mr. Singh warned last week that the government would have to make some unpopular decisions. Many experts, however, say they expect more stalemate.
''It has always been tough,'' said Mr. Levine, the Moody's economist, ''but there is a sense, at the moment, that it's too difficult. For the time being people are just giving up on it.''

HEADLINE: After Seeing a Dismal Reflection Of Itself, a City Moves to Change

BYLINE: By JESS BIDGOOD

 BODY:
LAWRENCE, Mass. -- There is a litany of reasons one might avoid this city: double-digit unemployment, high crime rates, struggling public schools and, at the top, enduring suspicions of chronic mismanagement.
The city's dismal finances have led to a state-appointed fiscal overseer, and its school system is the first in Massachusetts to be placed in receivership. The former superintendent, Wilfredo Laboy, was recently convicted of embezzlement. According to The Boston Globe, Mayor William Lantigua is the subject of corruption investigations by local and federal authorities, as well as a campaign finance investigation by the state attorney general.
''It is tough when you're looking from the outside in,'' said Officer Angel Lopez, a patrolman on the city's police force, which has shrunk to about 120 today from 151 in 2010.
So bleak is Lawrence's image that a recent article in Boston magazine, highlighting the city's busy drug trade and controversial politics, proclaimed it to be the ''most godforsaken place in Massachusetts.'' 
For many who live here, those were fighting words.
''I was shaking, scrambling to get my words together,'' said Aliali Belkus, who grew up here and now teaches at Lawrence High School, describing her response to the magazine article. ''Not because it wasn't true, but because it was a very one-sided image of the city,'' she continued. ''We've become the punching bag.''
So on a recent Friday afternoon, several dozen residents gathered at a refurbished mill, ready to draw up a battle plan for a war of words and actions that they hope will help reshape Lawrence's battered image.
''We need to be ready, willing and able,'' Eduardo Crespo, a public relations professional and longtime resident, said to the diverse group. ''Anyone for press releases? Community relations?''
The effort is an attempt to retell the city's story as a tale of hope and success alongside its difficulties, using conventional public relations, social media and small civic projects. But the first challenge of the campaign, which is called We Are Lawrence, may be ensuring that its message resonates at home in the face of the city's street-level reality.
Lawrence, a city of 76,000 squeezed into about seven square miles, rises up in brick out of the more comfortable suburbs that surround it. It was a battleground for America's labor movement, having been the site of the Bread and Roses labor strike, which celebrates its centennial this year. ''Ellis Island of the Merrimack Valley,'' as some local people call it, has long drawn immigrants -- and has continued to, even as manufacturing collapsed here in the second half of the 20th century.
According to the 2010 census, people of Hispanic origin make up 73.8 percent of the city's population; Hispanics make up only 9.6 percent of the statewide population. Manufacturing's decline gutted the city's main economic engines, and today Lawrence has the state's lowest median income, according to the census, at $31,631.
''You have to have places where people are allowed to struggle,'' Ms. Belkus said. ''People don't want places like this to exist anymore. And they need to.''
That struggle manifests itself, in part, on the streets. Chief John Romero of the Police Department said the cuts to the force preceded an increase in violent crime of about 63 percent, to 2,790 felonies in 2011 from 1,770 in 2009.
''Crime is probably the biggest thing,'' Officer Lopez said of the city's problems. ''Lawrence is the magnet, the place to go where they can feel comfortable. Maybe because you have all the rooming houses, pawn shops, methadone clinics.''
We Are Lawrence cannot put more officers on the streets. But the group's organizers say they can take small steps that might revitalize the city, fostering pride and economic development by highlighting its robust history, successful charter schools and the nonprofit groups that are working to bring new life to street corners and empty textile mills.
In March, a boisterous rally drew hundreds of people to a downtown park, many wearing signs that sought to reclaim a word the article used to describe the town: ''Damned educated,'' read one. ''Damned orgulloso,'' or 'proud,' read another. ''Are we damned? No!'' the crowd shouted as it began a parade around the city.
Mr. Lantigua hung back, standing with a small group of aides. His 2010 election as the city's first Latino mayor was a landmark moment, but the excitement was short-lived as his tenure has been plagued with accusations of corruption.
''Drug trafficking, dealing, money laundering, suspicious travel, what else?'' Mr. Lantigua said, casually listing the suspicions people have raised about him.
He has not been charged and steadfastly maintains his innocence. Still, he is fully aware that a fair chunk of Lawrence's negative news media attention is about him. ''I'd like to be on the forefront,'' he said of the rally, ''but I respect their opinion. I'm being very careful.''
After the rally, several dozen group members began to meet, reaching out to local news organizations and planning additional actions. One group marched on Boston magazine, meeting with its editors. Some members have created an active social media presence, meant to keep followers informed of community events and projects through the city. Others have met with the local newspaper, The Eagle-Tribune, to plan a forum about the city.
''I've been working with parents and students in Lawrence for 30 years, and I've never seen activism like this,'' said Lou Bernieri, an educator.The group is staunchly apolitical, and has been criticized for being so.
''People who are fed up with Lawrence and its politics need to get politically active, to run for office themselves and build new leadership that works,'' read an editorial in The Eagle-Tribune, shortly after We Are Lawrence was formed.
But organizers say the effort is about what residents can do as neighbors, not as politicians.
''There are ways to operate in a political environment without being explicitly political,'' said Maggie Super Church, a planner at the nonprofit Lawrence CommunityWorks and a resident of the city. ''This is about changing the narrative, empowering people to celebrate and encouraging them to work together on the challenges.''
It is an incremental approach, one that was on display one recent Friday at a ''cash mob,'' when members of We Are Lawrence encouraged residents to buy something at a family-owned hardware store called Bruckmann's. Customers bought birdseed, fertilizer and cleaning supplies at about three times the rate of a normal Friday, the store's owner said. Two more cash mobs are planned -- one at a new Guatemalan bakery in June and ''lunch mobs'' at various independently owned restaurants in July.
''It's going to create conscience, little by little,'' Ana Medina, a school administrator who is part of We Are Lawrence, said of the cash mob and efforts like it. ''We have been told for so long that our city is not great, but it has been great to all of us. It's time for us to say that our city is great.''

HEADLINE: Loyal and Loving Beyond Reason, And That's Just the Owners

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Dogs are having a television moment, with three very different programs about them turning up in the next few weeks on three very different outlets. Together they provide a dizzying display of reprehensible behavior, inordinate neediness and striking devotion. By humans.
CBS brings its version of dog whispering to prime time on Wednesday night with a series called ''Dogs in the City,'' which features a personable young man named Justin Silver, who has a keen sense of what is going on inside the canine head. There are other dog behaviorist shows, of course; this one's gimmick is that all of its dogs are in New York City. 
Do you have to be crazy to own a dog in a heavily paved, exceedingly crowded place like New York? Apparently not, because, Mr. Silver says, one out of eight New Yorkers owns a dog; that many people can't be wrong. In the premiere Mr. Silver finds himself counseling a few who may not have lost their minds but have clearly lost their perspective.
For instance, a businesswoman named Elli insists on taking her dog, Charlotte, to work, even though the animal tries to attack anyone who walks through the door, and not in that friendly lick-your-face way. This is particularly problematic because ''work'' is some kind of talent agency, and models with dog bite scars are probably not all that marketable.
One of Mr. Silver's most amusing tricks is to go off somewhere with the misbehaving dog and have a private chat.
''I know exactly what's going on up there,'' he tells Charlotte during their one-on-one. ''You think I don't know what it's like to have a codependent mother?''
Charlotte genuinely looks as if she were taking it in.
The problem, naturally, is usually in the owner, not the animal.
''What I do is, I pay more attention to the people, and I'm watching the way the dog is reacting to what the person is telling me,'' Mr. Silver explains while working another case, in which a man is giving his dog more attention than he gives his new wife. ''So my job, I'm really more of an interpreter between the dog and the person.''
''Dogs in the City,'' with its inherent reminder that it takes work to be a competent owner, serves as a useful counterpoint to ''Shelter Me,'' a film by Steven Latham that is showing on PBS stations in May and June (check local listings). ''Shelter Me'' is single-minded in its goal: It wants people to consider adopting a dog from a shelter.
Shelters, the program says, are overwhelmed with animals, especially now, when people are abandoning pets in a bad economy. Early on, Mr. Latham's camera lingers on a blunt sign at a Los Angeles shelter: ''Los Angeles Animal Services cannot guarantee placement of your animal. Animals turned into the shelter may be euthanized (killed) after the legal holding period.''
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals says that is the fate of three million to four million dogs and cats each year. ''Shelter Me'' aims for the heartstrings in trying to change the numbers, showing shelter dogs that have been trained to help people with disabilities, and others that are filling an emotional void for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.
''A lot of people think that dogs from a shelter are there because they're bad dogs, because they've done something wrong, and that is a complete misconception,'' Cassian Sandeberg, an animal behaviorist, says in the film. ''A lot of these dogs are great dogs that people just can't look after anymore.''
The film is so eager for people to adopt dogs that it doesn't address its own contradiction: that shelters are jammed partly because not everyone can be a successful owner. A more nuanced approach is used in ''One Nation Under Dog,'' a riveting film showing June 18 on HBO.
This film also encourages dog adoption, but the first of several factoids it displays on the screen is this: ''There are 4.7 million dog bite victims each year in the U.S.'' That introduces an unsettling segment about a New Jersey dog owner who fought draining legal battles in defense of his dogs after they were involved in several biting incidents. In one, a girl's ear was ripped off.
From this cautionary tale, the film grows even more stark, showing hard-to-watch footage of shelter dogs being thrown into large bins and gassed, then even harder-to-watch images from a raid on a wretched puppy mill in Tennessee.
''We found dogs living with dead dogs,'' Scotlund Haisley, one of the animal rescuers at the scene, says. ''One dog was using the two dead dogs as a blanket.''
The rescuers at the puppy mill, like the animal advocates in ''Shelter Me,'' seem somewhat overwhelmed by the cruelty they witness and the scope of the pet overpopulation problem. But it's heartening to see them keep plugging away. A special prize should go to John Gagnon of the rescue group PAWS New England, who in ''One Nation Under Dog'' visits a shelter and specifically asks to look at the dogs with behavior and health problems.
The joy on these animals' faces after he plucks them from the shelter, fixes what ails them and places them with new owners is undeniable and unrestrained.
''Once you bring a dog like that into your home and into your life, they appreciate it,'' he says. ''They know what they've got, because they've been without.''

HEADLINE: Nomination His, Romney Steps Up Attack on Obama

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney, having initially weathered the first sustained general election attack, is entering a critical 90-day stretch to the Republican convention on relatively equal footing with the White House and is unleashing a new offensive to win over independent voters and further undermine confidence in President Obama's stewardship of the economy.
Mr. Romney, who formally secured the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday by winning delegates in the Texas primary, introduced a new line of criticism: accusing the president of squandering taxpayer money on companies like Solyndra, which declared bankruptcy last year after receiving $528 million in federal loan guarantees. It amounted to a counterpunch to the White House's assault on Mr. Romney's tenure as head of Bain Capital, which Mr. Obama has portrayed as evidence that Mr. Romney would not look out for the middle class.
Mr. Romney was dogged Tuesday by his decision to attend a Las Vegas fund-raiser with Donald J. Trump, who spent much of the day in television interviews pressing the long-discredited view that the president is not a United States citizen. The Romney campaign rejected that view and conceded it was an unnecessary distraction. 
But the resilience of the Romney campaign, at least in the first six weeks since he emerged as the party's likely nominee, has proved frustrating to some Democrats who predicted that he would be deeply wounded by the combative primary race. For a candidate who is not naturally beloved by many conservatives, Mr. Romney has faced little resistance unifying party activists, donors and elected officials who want to keep Mr. Obama from winning a second term.
With the party quickly coalescing behind him, Mr. Romney met in Las Vegas on Tuesday with Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate whose family provided $20 million to the ''super PAC'' that supported Newt Gingrich.
Last week, Mr. Romney participated in a fund-raising call with Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, whose formidable network of donors had been a source of concern to Mr. Romney's team during the primary season. Mr. Perry, who had vigorously questioned Mr. Romney's ability to beat Mr. Obama, said his former rival had emerged stronger from the primaries.
''He's a better candidate today than he was four years ago and four months ago,'' Mr. Perry said in an interview. ''He has shown improvement all along the way, and that is always the sign of a good competitor who continues to take lessons learned.''
Mr. Romney still faces a dual challenge of overcoming tepid favorability ratings and persuading voters why they should support him and not simply vote against Mr. Obama. Even though Election Day is five months away, strategists in both campaigns see the phase from Memorial Day to Labor Day as crucial, particularly for defining Mr. Romney.
''They've had a hard time trying to paint Governor Romney as somehow sinister,'' said Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign. ''The fact is every time they attack Mitt Romney for his experience in the private sector, they reinforce the idea that President Obama is hostile to the private sector.''
At the Romney campaign headquarters in Boston, his advisers exuded a palpable sense of relief and a growing air of confidence after surviving the first phase of artillery from Mr. Obama's team in Chicago.
Following a run of television advertisements and Web videos attacking Mr. Romney's work at the private equity firm Bain Capital, most major polls show that the two candidates are statistically tied. While polls at this stage of an election can be unreliable indicators of the outcome in the fall, they underscore that the race is likely to be close.
Mr. Romney's campaign has been particularly buoyed by surveys showing that he is competitive with Mr. Obama when voters are asked whom they trust most to handle the economy. His aides said in interviews that they were keeping a wary eye on Mr. Obama's efforts to undercut that perception by sowing doubts about Mr. Romney's work at Bain and his claims that he created tens of thousands of jobs.
But they are hoping his strong ratings on the economy will help them meet their main imperative before the party conventions: to solidify perceptions of Mr. Romney as an adequate replacement for Mr. Obama among swing voters who like the president but are ready to ''fire him'' -- as one aide put it -- if they can bring themselves to trust Mr. Romney.
In an interview, former Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a Democrat, called the Romney campaign's ''rapid response'' operation -- tasked with conducting the minute-by-minute fight against Mr. Obama -- as ''very, very impressive.'' Though Mr. Richardson said he believed that Mr. Romney's stance on immigration would hobble him with Hispanics in important swing states like Nevada and Colorado, he added, ''We've got to fight for every vote.''
''I am amazed at how rapidly the Republican Party has united around Romney,'' he said. ''I thought it would take longer.''
In interviews, Mr. Obama's aides say they are unfazed by Mr. Romney's quick rise to campaign parity, arguing that he still faces a challenge in reversing a primary season polling trend in which more people viewed him unfavorably than favorably.
The Romney campaign is still expanding its operation for the fight with Mr. Obama, who has been building a team for more than a year in battleground states. A presentation made to top Republican donors last week in Boston shows that the campaign is placing a priority on winning Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia and then picking up one ''wild card'' state from a group that includes Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire and Wisconsin.
For his part, Mr. Romney is trying to get voters to envision him as president. His debut television advertisements present what a ''President Romney'' would do on ''Day 1,'' with an announcer saying: ''President Romney issues order to begin replacing Obamacare with common-sense health care reform -- that's what a Romney presidency would be like.''
At Romney headquarters in Boston, strategists are now running the campaign they began preparing for not long after Mr. Obama took office. They have extensively studied his record and for the next several weeks intend to raise issues, like Solyndra, in hopes of putting the president's team on defense.
The increasingly intense exchanges between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney in recent weeks have overshadowed another challenge that Mr. Romney has seemed to overcome: his fellow Republicans are no longer complaining about him or questioning his conservative record.
''I was very involved in the McCain campaign, and I love McCain a lot,'' said Brian Ballard, a Florida contributor who is a co-chairman of Mr. Romney's finance team. ''But I never felt this good about our chances four years ago.''

HEADLINE: The Massacre at Houla

 BODY:
The decision on Tuesday by the United States, Britain, France and at least five other major nations to expel senior Syrian diplomats was a powerful sign of international revulsion at the massacre of more than 100 Syrians in the village of Houla. But it was still short of the tougher diplomatic and economic sanctions needed to put real pressure on President Bashar al-Assad and his cronies. Russia, in particular, can finally help, or continue to be a roadblock to tougher action. 
Mr. Assad is responsible for killing an estimated 12,000 people during his reign of terror, now in its 14th month. Kofi Annan, the special envoy for the United Nations and the Arab League, was in Damascus on Tuesday trying to keep alive a peace plan under which Mr. Assad promised six weeks ago to end the violence. The massacre on Friday was just the latest evidence that he never intended to follow through.
According to a United Nations count, the victims included 49 children and 34 women. The government tightly controls access to the country, so there is some uncertainty about what happened. A spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner for human rights said fewer than 20 of the Houla victims were killed by artillery -- weapons the government possesses and the opposition does not.
Syrian officials blamed ''terrorists'' for the attacks. We assign far more credibility to villagers who told United Nations monitors that ''shabiha,'' or government thugs associated with Mr. Assad's Alawite sect, committed at least some of the killings by shooting people -- including entire families -- at close range.
It is significant that the United Nations Security Council acted quickly and unanimously on Sunday to condemn the bloodshed and censure the Syrian government for using heavy artillery against civilians, even though it did not actually assign blame. Too often in the past, China and Russia, Syria's main enablers, delayed Council action and twice they vetoed sanctions. Officials from both countries complain that Council action could lead to foreign intervention in Syria, as in Libya.
But Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned on Sunday that it is continued atrocities that could make intervention more likely. Any outside intervention risks fueling a wider war. Iran is already meddling, and the increasingly sectarian conflict has begun spilling into Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq.
Sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union and others are having an effect. Still, a United Nations arms embargo and the toughest possible comprehensive economic sanctions are long overdue. Russia has the most leverage, but, inexcusably, it still sells arms and coal to Syria and uses its Mediterranean port of Tartus.
We can see no easy solutions to Syria, despite Mitt Romney's facile criticism of President Obama. In a campaign statement issued on Tuesday, Mr. Romney called for ''more assertive measures to end the Assad regime.''
But he fails to say how he could be more successful at getting Russia to ''cease selling arms to the Syrian government'' or how arming a fractious opposition could be effective. And there's not a hint of what it means to ''end the regime'' and whether that would require American troops. Could he possibly be eager for another war? If Mr. Romney has good ideas, everyone would like to hear them.

HEADLINE: Planned Parenthood Enters the Fray

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
In the course of the Republican primary campaign, Mitt Romney took pains to convince socially conservative activists that he believes in them, understands their passions and would be an advocate for their causes in the Oval Office.
Now, Planned Parenthood is unveiling one of its biggest-ever political advertising campaigns aimed at using Mr. Romney's own words to undermine his support among women - a critical voter group among whom he already trails President Obama.
In a new ad that will run in three battleground states, the political arm of the women's health care organization accuses Mr. Romney of wanting to deny women access to birth control, abortions and equal pay for the work they do. 
''When Mitt Romney says, 'Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that,''' the ad says, ''Romney is saying he'll deny women the birth control and cancer screenings they depend on.''
That statement can be misleading. Mr. Romney was answering a question about what federal funding he would target for elimination or reductions if he is elected. His campaign has said he wants to end federal funding of Planned Parenthood, not the organization itself.
But officials at the Planned Parenthood Action Fund said women understand the context of his remarks. They said the group is spending $1.4 million to run the ad in West Palm Beach, Fla., Des Moines, Iowa, and the suburbs of northern Virginia, as well as in Washington. That represents a threefold increase over the group's total spending during the 2008 campaign.
''This is just the beginning,'' said Dawn Laguens, the group's executive vice president for communications. ''This is a very small down payment on what we intend to do to make sure people are very clear where the candidates stand.''
The campaign comes in the wake of Planned Parenthood's successful pressure campaign to win reversal of a cut in funding by the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation earlier this year. And it comes as Planned Parenthood and other liberal organizations see an opportunity in the statements Mr. Romney made during the primary.
Mr. Romney opposed the president's efforts to compel religious institutions to provide insurance coverage for contraception. He supported a ''parenthood'' measure in Mississippi that critics contend would ban birth control. And he has said he believes Roe v. Wade should be overturned.
Mr. Obama's campaign has seized on Mr. Romney's statements to try and drive a wedge between the Republican and women, many of whom live in battleground states that will decide the election this November.
Buoyed by polls that show Mr. Obama already has a significant edge over Mr. Romney among women, the Democratic campaign and its allies are hoping to maintain or even extend that lead. The Planned Parenthood ad fits into that strategy. The group will officially endorse Mr. Obama on Wednesday.
''Mitt Romney has been much clearer and more direct even than John McCain in his interest in dismantling women's health care,'' Ms. Laguens said. ''The threats have intensified. The Republican primary laid bare and made clear what their agenda is.''
Mr. Romney's campaign has responded by focusing its efforts on the economic plight that confronts many women. Mr. Romney has argued that 92 percent of the people who lost jobs under the president's watch were women.
That statistic ignores the fact that the economic downturn affected men more severely in the months before Mr. Obama took office. But Mr. Romney's advisers believe he can appeal to women by appealing to their sense of dismay about their financial futures.
''They go for security. They are looking for security more so than men,'' Bay Buchanan, an adviser to Mr. Romney, said of women in a conference call with reporters in March. ''I think that Mitt Romney is going to be able to make a very strong case that we need these jobs. Women will understand that more than anybody.''
Officials at Planned Parenthood dismiss those arguments. The organization conducted several focus groups with women during the past several months to fine-tune their political message. Geoff Garin, the group's pollster, said showing the ad had ''jaw-dropping'' effects on the women.
''They thought he was far more extreme and ideological than they suspected that he might be,'' Mr. Garin said. ''In an election that is very likely to be won or lost with the votes of women, this ad and this whole campaign is very powerful.''
In the focus groups of 500 swing women voters in battleground states, Mr. Garin said many voters did not know much about Mr. Romney's positions on issues of particular interest to women. After viewing the Planned Parenthood ad, the women were twice as likely to say Mr. Romney was ''out of step'' with women's issues, Mr. Garin said.
''There's a feeling that the election hangs in the balance based on the women's vote, beyond what was true even in 2008,'' he said. ''The stakes are much higher.''
The stakes are high for both presidential campaigns as well. Efforts by groups like Planned Parenthood will be especially important for Mr. Obama if they help him maintain his lead among women by warning that Mr. Romney represents a threat to their issues.
But Mr. Romney's campaign will be just as aggressive in the days ahead, pushing its own narrative about how women have fared during Mr. Obama's presidency. And ''super PACs'' backing Mr. Romney will no doubt join the fight.
The women ad wars are just beginning.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Challenges Mount for Chinese Maker of Electric Cars

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Four years ago, the BYD Company promoted the electric battery technology it was developing as a way to help China transform the automobile. No less an investor than Warren E. Buffett, one of the world's richest men, boasted about the company's prospects and bought a 10 percent stake.
But recently, nothing has gone right. BYD's stock is down 43 percent from its high on Feb. 8 as investors and analysts have questioned whether the company has the technology or the manufacturing quality to be an enduring competitor in the Chinese market. 
BYD's sales of gasoline-powered cars, the company's commercial mainstay, have wilted this spring as Chinese buyers have moved toward more expensive but better-quality cars from its rivals. At the same time, BYD now accepts that the future of the auto industry is more likely to lie in hybrid gasoline-electric cars, a technology in which it lags Japanese manufacturers, and not in all-electric cars, which still face issues of battery range and recharging time.
And on Sunday, new questions arose about the company's battery technology when a Nissan GT-R sports car traveling at more than 110 miles an hour slammed into the back of one of BYD's electric taxis in southern China and set the vehicle aflame.
The taxi, an e6 battery-electric sedan, spun across three lanes of traffic, hit a tree and turned into an inferno, killing all three occupants. Photos of the blazing wreck quickly spread on the Internet in China and sent the stock down sharply on Monday, prompting BYD to issue a long statement on Tuesday emphasizing that no car, electric or otherwise, would have been likely to survive such an impact.
''We don't know what happened -- the battery pack burned or the high-voltage gear burned or the fabric was lit or maybe some other reason,'' said Paul Lin, the company's marketing director, adding that neither the police nor the company had determined yet whether the high-speed impact or the ensuing fire caused the deaths.
Chinese news media reported that the sports car driver was a drunken man accompanied by three women. The occupants of the sports car were not seriously hurt and the driver fled.
Although BYD's shares bounced back on Tuesday as investors appeared to accept the company's explanation, BYD's longer-term challenges remain.
When Mr. Buffett bought 10 percent of the company in September 2008, using a subsidiary of his main company, Berkshire Hathaway, BYD had plans to start exporting electric cars to the United States within two years. Those plans quickly stalled, partly because of the global economic slowdown, but also because BYD, like many automakers, has since concluded that gasoline-electric hybrids are more promising.
''More and more companies are certainly going to do it like this,'' Wang Chuanfu, BYD's founder and chairman, said in an interview last autumn at his company's headquarters in Shenzhen, while not ruling out a future for electric cars in China.
BYD's biggest troubles in the last few months have been in the market for gasoline-powered cars. The company had grown rapidly over the last five years as a manufacturer of cheap, very basic cars for China's rapidly expanding middle class.
But over the last year, middle-class car buyers in China have become a lot more discerning -- and more prone to choose multinationals' offerings than locally designed cars. Although other Chinese automakers are also struggling, BYD has been among the hardest hit.
BYD's car sales fell 8 percent in the first four months of this year even as the overall Chinese car market grew 6 percent. In April alone, the company's sales slid 19 percent as the market grew 18 percent.
Part of the problem is a sharp shift in government policies.
The city of Beijing, which had been the country's largest municipal car market, cut by two-thirds last year the number of license plates it issues annually and created a lottery for distributing them. With license plates in short supply, buyers have tended to put them on expensive foreign-brand cars instead of locally manufactured economy cars.
The national government, in December 2010, ended two separate programs that had stimulated sales in 2009 and 2010. One policy had sharply reduced the sales tax on cars with very small engines, while the other had subsidized vehicle purchases by residents of rural areas.
Chinese manufacturers, particularly BYD, tend to make cars with small engines, and sell them disproportionately to rural buyers and other customers with relatively low incomes.
The Chinese government hinted on Monday that it might help the auto industry with a ''cash for clunkers'' program, providing government subsidies for people who trade in used cars for new cars, as part of a broader move by Beijing officials to stimulate the country's faltering economy.

HEADLINE: Even in Coal Country, the Fight for an Industry

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON; John M. Broder contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
LOUISA, Ky. -- For generations, coal has been king in this Appalachian town. It provided heat, light and jobs for the hundreds of people who worked in the nearby coal mines and the smoke-coughing Big Sandy power plant that burned their black bounty.
But now, coal is in a corner. Across the United States, the industry is under siege, threatened by new regulations from Washington, environmentalists fortified by money from Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of New York City, and natural gas companies intent on capturing much of the nation's energy market.
So when the operator of the Big Sandy plant announced last year that it would be switching from coal to cleaner, cheaper natural gas, people here took it as the worst betrayal imaginable.
''Have you lost your mind?'' State Representative Rocky Adkins, a Democrat and one of Kentucky's most powerful politicians, thundered at Michael G. Morris, the chairman of the plant's operator, American Electric Power, during an encounter last summer. ''You cannot wave the white flag and let the environmentalists and regulators declare victory here in the heart of coal country.'' 
Coal and electric utilities, long allied, are beginning to split. More than 100 of the 500 or so coal-burning power plants in the United States are expected to be shut down in the next few years. While coal still provides about a third of the nation's power, just four years ago it was providing nearly half.
The decline is largely because new pollution rules have made coal plants more costly, while a surge in production of natural gas through the process of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, has sent gas prices plummeting. Together, the economics of coal have been transformed after a century of dominance in Washington, state capitals and the board rooms of electric utilities.
''The math screams at you to do gas,'' said Mr. Morris, whose company is the nation's largest consumer of coal.
Environmental groups, after years of targeting coal plants as leading sources of air pollution, have moved in for the kill. ''We never thought we would get to a place where coal plants are falling so fast,'' said Bruce Nilles, the director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal initiative. It has been aided by $50 million from Mr. Bloomberg, who views the campaign as part of a public health effort, and $26 million from an odd bedfellow: the top official of a natural gas company.
The environmentalists figure that if they can shut down a third of the nation's coal burning plants by 2020, emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States could be cut at least as much as they would have under a landmark 2009 climate bill that died in Congress.
But the coal industry is mustering all the weapons it can: lobbying, legislation, litigation and a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign trumpeting the benefits of ''clean coal.'' The fight has even become an issue in the presidential campaign, with the industry blaming President Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency for the onslaught, and Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, hinting that he would roll back some of the rules.
Here in Kentucky, the intervention by Mr. Adkins and other coal industry advocates has saved coal at Big Sandy, at least temporarily. American Electric Power, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, is proposing a $1 billion retrofit to allow the plant to continue burning coal and has asked Kentucky regulators to approve a 30 percent increase in electricity rates to pay for the work.
But that request, which will come up for a vote by the state's utility commission within the next week, has inspired resistance from some residents, large industrial companies that consume much of Kentucky's electricity and even the state attorney general's office.
Pressured on the domestic front, some giant American coal producers, like Arch Coal and Peabody Energy, are shifting their attention to markets overseas, where coal-fired power plants are being built faster than they are being abandoned in the United States.
Even if Big Sandy continues to eat up 90 rail cars of coal a day, the industry's decline is evident here. Sales to Midwestern power plants have slumped, as has the market price of coal, dropping so suddenly that many local mines are cutting back hours or closing. A warm winter, decreasing demand, only made matters worse.
''I call it the imperfect storm,'' Mr. Adkins said. ''And it is breaking the back of our local economy.''
A Coordinated Effort
The anger toward Washington is palpable in this impoverished corner of Eastern Kentucky, where miners display bumper stickers or license plates on their pickup trucks with slogans like ''Coal Keeps the Lights On'' or ''If Obama Is the Answer, How Stupid Was the Question?''
It is hard to find anyone here who does not feel affected by the fate of Big Sandy. Just as the smokestack at the plant towers over the countryside, Big Sandy dominates much of life here.
Danny Sartin, 61, a barrel-chested heavy equipment operator at the plant, said his father, grandfathers and uncles all worked in local mines that feed Big Sandy. ''Coal and the coal mining industry, it's all we have ever known,'' Mr. Sartin said.
Some of that coal comes from the Licking River mine, about 50 miles south of Big Sandy, where miners rip apart hillsides to reach vast seams just below the surface.
Chris Lacy, 41, an executive at Licking River Resources Inc., said layoffs among his 350 miners -- in Magoffin County, where unemployment is already 17.5 percent -- are inevitable if the coal furnaces at Big Sandy go cold. Even the garden supply company that Mr. Lacy's father-in-law owns and where his two sons work indirectly relies on Big Sandy, because mines are required to plant grass over the scarred earth they leave behind. ''It is the ripple effect that comes right through us,'' Mr. Lacy said.
Channeling the animosity toward Washington and fears about their livelihoods, coal producers, union leaders, landowners and railroads came together to pressure American Electric Power to back down on its plan to close the coal furnaces at Big Sandy. They have leaned on county judges, state legislators and other politicians to attempt to silence public criticism of the 30 percent electricity rate increase and to pressure the Kentucky Public Service Commission to approve the retrofit project.
Saving coal, they argued, justified the rate increase, which would cost the average residential customer about $472 a year in addition to the typical $1,580 annual bill today.
''I will grant you it is going to cost a lot of money to retrofit that plant,'' said Nick Carter, the president of a company that represents landowners whose properties hold billions of tons of coal reserves. ''But how many teachers will be laid off and how many churches will have to close if Big Sandy stops burning coal?''
At Dee's Drive Inn Restaurant, a fixture on Main Street in Louisa, the patrons are split.
Fred Klinebriel, 58, a disabled former steelworker, said his father was a mine worker and his brother a trucker who moved coal. But if keeping coal means an even bigger electric bill, he is not sure it is worth it. ''I am up against the wall right now as it is,'' he said. ''I guess you are damned if you do and damned if you don't -- or at least we are here in coal country.''
Environmental Issues
What went largely unspoken in the dozens of pages of e-mails, letters and other pitches these players have churned out in the fight to keep the plant open were the perils of coal, which extend far beyond mine accidents and black lung disease.
The Big Sandy plant spews tens of thousands of tons of pollutants each year into the region's air, including sulfur dioxide and smaller amounts of mercury, which can cause health problems like respiratory illnesses and possibly developmental disabilities among children. Many of these pollutants would be significantly reduced with the retrofit, but the plant would continue to be a major source of carbon dioxide, which is blamed for global warming.
Big Sandy also maintains a sprawling coal ash pit near the plant, created to store waste ash after the coal is burned, that the E.P.A. recently listed as one of 45 ''high hazard'' pits nationwide. That means it ''will probably cause loss of human life,'' the E.P.A. says, if a serious accident occurs. In Tennessee in 2008, a billion gallons of slurry from a coal ash pit washed out area homes and streams, though no deaths resulted.
Meanwhile, federal regulators have accused the owners of Licking River of dumping debris, known as spoil, from another nearby mine into a local valley, harming wildlife and an intermittent local stream.
Mr. Lacy, the Licking River executive, says such concerns are overblown. Instead, he talks of a conspiracy by environmentalists and the Obama administration to destroy the way of life here in Kentucky.
''I at least have to give them some credit,'' he said. ''It has been well played on their part, very methodical, step by step.''
Some of the regulations the industry finds objectionable, though, had their origins in a Republican administration. In 1990, President George Bush proposed and Congress approved sweeping revisions to the Clean Air Act, authorizing the E.P.A. to regulate emissions of mercury, arsenic and other toxic airborne chemicals. The agency determined in 2000 that it had the power to limit such emissions from power plants, but a weak rule issued under the second Bush administration was successfully challenged in court by environmental advocates.
The Obama administration, acting under court order, issued new standards in December that would require more emissions reductions by all but the top-performing plants. Gina McCarthy, the director of the Office of Air and Radiation at the E.P.A., said that accusations of collusion between the agency and environmental advocates were unfounded.
''Coal will continue to be a large part of electric generation in this country for a long time,'' Ms. McCarthy said in an interview. ''I just hope it is cleaner.''
Mr. Lacy is hardly convinced. As he drove through the Licking River mine during a shift change one recent afternoon, his face reddened.
''If they keep this up, the people who live here are going to have to move somewhere else, like during the Depression,'' he said. ''This place is suffering in a bad way.''
Unlikely Allies
Tacked up on the wall in a cramped office in Columbus, Ohio, that serves as the Midwest headquarters for the Sierra Club is a map of the United States with the headline ''Coal Plants Under Target.'' Dozens of color-coded pins form a giant U shape -- from Minnesota, south to Missouri, east to Kentucky and then up to Ohio -- with each marking a plant that the Sierra Club is determined to shut down.
For years, the group filed lawsuits to try to force utilities or federal regulators to comply with pollution-control laws and organized public opinion campaigns to try to block the construction of plants. But the change in the energy marketplace has given the environmentalists an extraordinary new weapon: the pocketbooks of consumers.
''The coal industry used to be able to get away with murder, here in Ohio and throughout Appalachia,'' said Nachy Kanfer, 27, a Sierra Club organizer. ''Not anymore.''
In late April, Mr. Kanfer and other Sierra Club staff members traveled to Kentucky to testify before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. They argued that American Electric Power should not be allowed to retrofit Big Sandy -- an argument they are making in many states -- because there are less expensive alternatives to deliver power.
Elsewhere, the Sierra Club and other environmental groups are also pressing local officials in metropolitan areas to help shut down coal-burning power plants. In Chicago, for example, Mayor Rahm Emanuel recently announced that the city's last two coal-fired plants would close in 2014, four years earlier than expected.
One of the most important early allies in this fight was Aubrey K. McClendon, the chief executive of Chesapeake Energy, who donated $26 million starting in 2007 to help the Sierra Club with its campaign.
The company also donated millions of dollars more to the American Lung Association, which used the money, in part, to run ''Fighting for Air'' television commercials. Some of the most recent ads in the campaign feature a baby coughing, wheezing and then crying while sitting outside a coal-fired power plant.
The Sierra Club came under attack from other environmental activists for accepting money from Mr. McClendon, whose company has a financial interest in killing off its competition but burns a fossil fuel itself. Mr. Nilles, the director of Beyond Coal, now views it as a mistake. ''We would not do it again,'' he said.
Other deep-pocketed donors have stepped in, including Mr. Bloomberg, whose intervention has infuriated Kentucky officials like Mr. Adkins, the legislator.
''Mayor Bloomberg should stay in that high-rise condo or his mansions,'' Mr. Adkins said, ''and eat his caviar while we keep his lights on in New York City.''
Big Coal has hardly conceded defeat in this multifront war.
The industry has increased political campaign contributions in the last four years to historic levels, with 80 percent of those donations going to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Companies like Arch Coal, which used to spend only about $100,000 a year on lobbyists in Washington, invested $5.7 million to push its case during the first three years of the Obama administration.
And even as American Electric Power plans to close 5 of its 21 coal-burning plants and rely much more on natural gas, it still intends to retrofit 12 plants. That means it will be burning coal for years to come. A rise in natural gas prices could also slow the decline of coal as a power source. So the company has joined with old allies in Washington to try to delay the new rules and block any future ones.
The industry and its supporters have also gone to court, filing lawsuits challenging E.P.A. rules that limit pollution from coal-burning plants from crossing state lines and the mountaintop mining rules that are holding up new permits in Kentucky and West Virginia -- legal fights that the industry has had some success with so far.
But the regional agency that coordinates electric power delivery in the mid-Atlantic and the Midwest cannot wait for the battles to be resolved. This month, it auctioned off the rights for utility companies to supply electricity that will be needed to make up for what is lost through coal plant retirements. Most of the new power is fueled by natural gas.
''It's an unprecedented transition,'' said Michael J. Kormos, senior vice president for operations at PJM Interconnection, the regional group that coordinates power delivery for 60 million people in 13 states. ''But whatever happens, we have to make sure we keep the lights on.''

HEADLINE: Japan as "Role Model"

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: At least no employment catastriphe. 

 BODY:
In my interview with Martin Wolf, I joked about apologizing to the emperor over Japanese policy -- not because it was good, but because our policy in response to the liquidity trap has been even worse. I thought it might be useful to have some indicator of what I'm talking about.
So, here's the employment-population ratio of men 15-64 in Japan and the United States since 1991, when Japan's woes are often considered to have begun. Why men as opposed to both sexes, and why the age limitation? Basically, to abstract from social change and demography -- Japan has lagged the US in terms of women in paid labor, and also of course has a rapidly aging population. I don't mean to suggest that only prime-age men matter; this is just a relatively clean indicator. And here's what it looks like:
Source: OECD i-Library
For all its woes, Japan has never experienced the kind of employment collapse we've suffered. That's the sense in which we're doing far worse than the Japanese ever did.
So as I said, in a way Japan is no longer a cautionary tale; it's still a lousy story, but compared to us it almost looks like a role model.

HEADLINE: An American Diplomat in Moscow Takes Flak on Twitter

BYLINE: MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ


HIGHLIGHT: The U.S. Ambassador in Russia and the Russian Foreign Ministry take to Twitter, and find that diplomatic nuance may require more than 140 characters. 

 BODY:
Diplomacy is usually a nuanced game that can turn on a word and a handshake preferably delivered in private. 
But no one, it seems, ever told this to Michael A. McFaul. Since his arrival in Moscow as the United States ambassador, he has engaged in frequent back-and-forth sniping with the Russian Foreign Ministry on matters of extraordinary international import like missile defense and the uprising in Syria all within the highly undiplomatic and public arena of the Internet, mostly on Twitter. 
The latest spat erupted after a speech Mr. McFaul delivered this week at Moscow's Higher School of Economics in which he stated flatly that the Russian government had given a "large bribe" to the government of Kyrgyzstan in 2009 to close an American military base that is a crucial staging point for operations in Afghanistan. (The Kyrgyz president initially agreed to do so, but then changed his mind when the United States did offer more money.) 
As my colleague Ellen Barry wrote this week, the Foreign Ministry responded furiously, saying in a statement that the speech "went far beyond the boundaries of diplomatic etiquette."
Normally, that is where things would end. But the spat quickly reverberated through the Internet as the two sides, along with their supporters and detractors, began taking potshots on Twitter. 
The Foreign Ministry fired off the opening salvo: 
Ambassadors' job, as we understand it, is to improve bilateral ties, not to spread blatant falsehoods through the mediasphere
- MFA Russia (@MFA_Russia)28 May 12
That the ministry would even take to Twitter is astonishing. In most other respects it is freighted with Soviet-era bureaucratic baggage. It can take months to respond to media inquiries, and it is rumored that there are a paltry few computers in its looming Stalinist headquarters. 
Mr. McFaul quickly shot back, noting that criticism of the Russian government made up only a small portion of the speech. 
@MFA_Russia My HSE talk highlighted over 20 positive results of "reset," that our governments worked together to achieve.
- Michael McFaul (@McFaul)28 May 12
When a Russian journalist informed Mr. McFaul in Russian that a "prominent official" from the ministry had said the speech was "unprofessional" he responded: 
@Varfolomeev thank you for this information. Still learning the craft of speaking more diplomatically.
- Michael McFaul (@McFaul)28 May 12
Mr. McFaul's speech also riled the head of Russia Today, an English-language channel funded by the Kremlin whose coverage is heavily weighted with criticism of the United States. In his speech, Mr. McFaul insinuated that the channel sought to lobby on behalf of the Russian government, to which its editor, Margarita Simonyan, who posted a message in Russian:
"Ambassador McFaul suggested that our channel is interfering in the internal affairs of the Untied States. And we shamefully thought that this was freedom of speech."
Mr. McFaul responded to her as well, pointing out that in the speech he also noted a recent op-edin the Wall Street Journal by Garry Kasparov, the chess grandmaster and opposition leader, which he said could also have been considered interference. 
@M_Simonyan I also said that WSJ article by Kasparov in support of US bill was "meddling". My point on both -- that's fine. Normal.
- Michael McFaul (@McFaul)28 May 12
Mr. McFaul has said his forays on Twitter, Facebook and the blogging site Live Journal were part of an effort to engage more directly with Russians, particularly young people. 
''Not only is my style going to be different, but the methods I'm going to use might also be different,'' said Mr. McFaul, a Russian speaker and former college professor, in an interview in January. ''I have a lot of things from my past that may be constraining, but one thing I know how to do, or I think I know how to do, is get up in front of 500 20-year-olds.''

HEADLINE: The Dawn of the Evidence-Based Budget

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: The White House effort to base its spending decisions on hard evidence is a step toward delivering more social good per taxpayer dollar. 

 BODY:
On May 18, the Office of Management and Budget issued a memorandum that couldn't be more critical to restoring public trust in government.
For the 2014 budget process, the office advised agencies to include information about how they plan to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs and link their disbursements to evidence. The office said a commitment to using evidence would make approval of budget requests more likely.
Could this be the coming of age of "evidence-based policy making"?
When we consider the vast sums that governments spend - and the responsibility public officials bear - it seems crazy that policy makers don't routinely make good use of evidence. Many promising programs have suffered as a result. Since 1990, 10 major federal initiatives including Head Start, Job Corps, Upward Bound, and 21st Century Community Learning Centers have been evaluated with large randomized studies - and all but one revealed modest or no impacts. That doesn't mean they never work. These funding streams support a wide range of approaches, some successful, some not. If more information had been available along the way, the government could have made adjustments to build on success, and reform or eliminate failure. Without timely and reliable feedback, how can we hope to improve government?
There are reasons why the evidence movement may take root in government today - despite the fact that data is no match for emotion in an election year, and many lobbyists, campaign donors, party leaders, constituents and ideologues will ignore evidence that contradicts their interests or beliefs. To begin with, money is tight and the stakes are high, whether we're talking about poverty, unemployment, or crises in education and health care. "Because of overall budget constraints we are in a moment where everyone feels the imperative to do more with less," explained Robert Gordon, the budget office's executive associate director. "It has created a sense of urgency."
Second, it's come to light that rigorous research doesn't have to be expensive, particularly if it makes use of administrative data that governments already collect (pdf) like test scores, graduation rates, emergency room visits, arrests, unemployment records, and so forth. The savings can, in turn, be significant.
Consider the New York City Schoolwide Performance Bonus Program, which Mayor Bloomberg launched to considerable fanfare in 2007. The $75 million program aimed to provide bonuses (of about $3,000 each) to teachers if they increased student achievement and other outcomes. 
At the outset, a researcher named Roland Fryer suggested that the city select schools via random assignment, using a control group for comparison. Since the city would already be collecting data about school outcomes, it would add little cost. It turned out to be a good idea. When results were tracked three years later, they showed no difference in education achievement between schools that got the incentives and those that didn't. The research even suggested that the incentives may have backfired. Total cost of the study: $50,000.
"With low-cost random controlled trials, you could begin testing hundreds of program models and spur a whole lot of innovation," explains Jon Baron, president of the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy, a national leader in this movement.
Without evidence, we rely on anecdote, ideology or faith. That's the way things were done before the Enlightenment, when bloodletting was believed to cure everything from acne to epilepsy. But science moves slowly. What we consider scientific evaluation today (i.e., treatment and control groups and random-assignments) is actually relatively new. The first randomized study of a medication, streptomycin, was published in 1948, and it was only in 1962, after birth defects caused by thalidomide, that the government began requiring pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate "substantial evidence of effectiveness" of drugs. Only in recent decades has evidence-based medicine emerged as an important movement in health care, challenging the idea that the doctor always knows best. (She may, but only after consulting the meta-analyses.) Baseball diehards will recognize the parallels to sabermetrics and Billy Beane's "moneyball."
Social policy has been mainly on the sidelines of this movement. In the mid 1970s, a group called MDRC began conducting large scale evaluations of social policies. Under presidents Reagan and Clinton, there were several notable randomized studies that examined welfare reform policies. However, by and large, rigorous evidence has been used sporadically by governments. "With the vast majority of federal funds, the government plays the role of a faucet, allocating large streams of funding to state and local organizations, often through a formula or competitive process, where evidence of effectiveness plays little role," says Baron.
The seeds for the budget office's policy were planted during the Bush administration, when Robert Shea, a political appointee at the office, led the way developing a questionnaire to assess the management of government programs. "One of the questions was to what extent has an evaluation been done to find whether the program had been effective," recalled Shea. Baron of the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy and David Olds, the founder of the Nurse-Family Partnership (which I reported on in my last Fixes column), helped Shea provide guidance to agencies about the key differences between rigorous and non-rigorous evaluations (which are less reliable and easier to spin).
Under the Obama administration the focus on evidence has already been ramped up considerably. The administration has brought this focus to home visitation, teen pregnancy prevention, educational innovation, social innovation, career training and workforce innovation - programs that account for close to $4 billion of spending.
What's different is not just that these programs have to be evaluated using scientific methods, but that funding is being tied to evidence-based models in the legislation. In the case of the administration's home visitation initiative, 75 percent of the funding must go to support programs that have been shown to produce results.
Last year, the president promised to reform Head Start along similar lines. Among Head Start grantees, there are high performers and low performers. The problem is that, historically, the government hasn't known which is which - or insisted that states find out and allocate funds accordingly. It's as if an investor failed to consider profitability when buying stocks. "Under the new rule, programs are going to be regularly evaluated against a set of clear, high standards," President Obama declared, adding that funding will go to programs that work and will be taken away from those that don't.
Evidence isn't important just for accountability; it's essential for innovation. Consider a study conducted in 2008 to test whether college enrollment could be boosted by simplifying the financial aid application (FAFSA) process. During tax season, researchers arranged for a subset of low- to moderate-income families (with young adults at home) to receive assistance at 156 H&R Block tax preparation offices in Ohio and North Carolina. Using tax information, the H&R Block representative automatically pre-populated the FAFSA (which has more than 100 questions and can take hours to complete). The representative then conducted a short interview to complete the form, told the families how much aid they would qualify for, provided tuition information for four local public colleges, and offered to submit the form immediately to the Department of Education. The intervention cost less than $90. Youths whose families received help were 29 percent more likely to attend college for at least two consecutive years. That's a huge gain for a tiny outlay of effort. The big question is: How do we make sure that evidence like this makes it into policy systematically?
At the state level, the evidence movement is also advancing, led by the Washington State Institute for Public Policy, a neutral research body that assembles evidence on a wide array of social programs - and then translates the findings into a user-friendly analysis so even the most number-challenged lawmaker can figure out the cost and benefits. For example, according to WSIPP's most recent "Return on Investment" report, among programs that focus on juvenile justice, the highest yielding investment is Functional Family Therapy (with a net present value of $67,108) and the worst bet is a program called Scared Straight (which yields a net for society of $5,014).
There are disputes, of course, about the way the institute evaluates evidence and does its calculations. But lawmakers have been using its evidence-based guidelines for a decade and a half, and in that time Washington has made significant gains, particularly in the area of criminal justice, noted Steve Aos, the institute's director (who is careful not to claim credit). Since 1990, he said, Washington's arrest rate has dropped by 60 percent, against a 35 percent drop at the national level. And while the nation's incarceration rate had increased by 260 percent since 1980, Washington's has gone up 150 percent.
The Pew Charitable Trusts is now working to spread the Washington model to other states through an initiative it calls Results First. "There's a real potential in this approach to deal with the polarization in the country," says Gary VanLandingham, the director of Results First. "At the end of the day whether you want big or little government, you want government to do things that work."
As Robert Shea recalled from his days in the Bush administration: "We were accused of cloaking our efforts to gut government in program evaluation. Everybody ought to be advancing the theory that we want programs to work. But a Democratic administration more naturally disposed to defend social programs is going to have a greater degree of trust when they're advancing these concepts."

HEADLINE: The Asymmetric Recovery

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: An economist explores several theories about why the labor market recovery has been so asymmetric in terms of hours and employment. 

 BODY:
 
By one measure, the labor market has not recovered at all. By another, the recovery is complete.
The red line in the chart below is a monthly index of the employment-to-population ratio, normalized to a value of 100 in December 2007, when the recession began. In this series, each employed person counts the same, regardless of how many hours she or he works.
The employment-to-population ratio fell more than 5 percent during the official recession period and fell almost an additional 2 percent in the second half of 2009. The ratio has been essentially constant since then; there has been no meaningful increase in the fraction of Americans who are employed.
The blue line shows the average number of hours worked by people with jobs in the private sector. In this series, only people with jobs are included in the calculation.

The hours series reflects a large contraction of more than 2 percent during the recession years. In other words, a number of employees found that their hours were cut during the recession and that long-hours jobs like construction were lost to a greater degree than short-hours jobs.
Unlike the employment-to-population ratio, average work hours have largely recovered since 2009. Earlier this year, the average hours series reached 100, which was its value for much of 2007.
To put it another way, 93 percent of the people who would have been employed in an economy such as we had in 2007 are employed today and are likely to feel that they are as busy with work today as they were then. The other 7 percent are not working at all.
There are several theories as to why the recovery has been so asymmetric in terms of hours and employment. 
One is that the unemployment insurance program, eligibility for which has expanded significantly since 2007, pays people to be without a job but usually does not pay them for having reduced hours. Thus, unemployment insurance does more to prolong joblessness than it does to prolong working at reduced hours.
Another theory is that actual or anticipated health insurance costs discourage employers from having too many employees; instead, they accomplish their tasks by having existing employees work longer hours. 
Because health insurance costs accrue on a per-employee basis, an employer with, say, 38 employees working 40 hours each has the same total number of work hours as an employer with 40 employers working 38 hours each, but the former employer's health insurance costs are 5 percent lower.
Yet another theory is that employers are concerned that their economic conditions may change quickly and find it easier to adjust work schedules than to adjust the number of employees.
And still another theory notes that the employment-to-population ratio would have fallen even without a recession as baby boomers reached retirement age. At the same time, those retirements might not reduce average work hours among those who had not yet reached retirement and might even increase them.
In any case, it is worth monitoring the separate recoveries for employment and for hours, as they can shed light on supply-and-demand factors that caused the recession and have prevented a full recovery by all measures.

HEADLINE: Cambodian Start-up Competes With India in Natural Hair Market

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: India has long provided much of the world's natural hair, but Cambodians have similar hair quality. 

 BODY:
"For an Internet start-up, Arjuni faces more challenges than usual," Ron Gluckman writes in the Deal Book blog of The New York Times. "The e-commerce site that sells hair extensions operates out of a five-story building here that lacks elevators and, sometimes, power." 
"In just two years, the company, founded by Janice Wilson, has grown from a handful of employees to 80, and it now generates more than $1 million in revenue," Mr. Gluckman writes. The start-up is also "slowly gaining market share from the industry's dominant players in India and China, as well as retailers in the United States and Europe." he writes. 
India has long provided "much of the world's natural hair, sold to wholesalers mainly in China, which in turn marketed their products to retailers in Europe and the United States," he writes. But Ms. Wilson found that Cambodians have similar hair quality, "long with cuticles in alignment," he writes. 
"Probably 99 percent of the world's hair comes from India. Nobody had thought of Cambodia," said Ms. Wilson, 39, straddling piles of hair on the floor.
It is a small but potentially profitable niche. The hair extensions business generates annual revenue of $250 million.
Ms. Wilson said it was important to her to have a business serve a social purpose. Many of Arjuni's employees formerly worked in Cambodia's notorious sex trade.

HEADLINE: Wildlife Refuges Raise Property Values, Study Shows

BYLINE: LESLIE KAUFMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Research indicates that homes within a half-mile of a wildlife reserve can be worth as much as 9 percent more than one that is two miles away. 

 BODY:
 Beyond the scenic views or flora and fauna, metropolitan area homeowners who live near a national wildlife refuge now have a different reason to appreciate the proximity. Research shows that such homes have higher property values than those that are farther from a reserve.
A study conducted by North Carolina State University researchers and issued on Wednesday by the federal Fish and Wildlife Service surveyed homes in urban areas that are close to refuges in three regions: the Northeast, the Southeast and California-Nevada. (They did not include data from, say, the Southwest, where refuges tend to be farther from urban centers.)
 For homes that are less than a half-mile from a wildlife refuge and within eight miles of an urban center, property values were 7 to 9 percent higher on average in the Southeast and 4 to 5 percent higher in the Northeast. In the California-Nevada area, such homes were worth 3 to 6 percent more.

 The data, drawn from the 2000 census, found that the 36 refuges studied added $300 million to local property values -- a boon to both homeowners and the tax base.
 The report comes as the tradition of protected preserves faces challenges from some House Republicans who would like to see federal lands sold off to raise money and to encourage development. 
Next year, the Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to update a 2006 analysis of the economic impact of such refuges in terms of tourism. That study found that 34.8 million visits to American wildlife refuges in fiscal 2006 generated $1.7 billion in sales, nearly 27,000 jobs and $542.8 million in employment income in regional economies.
 "Our wildlife refuges are strong economic engines that generate and support jobs in communities across the country," Jim Kurth, the chief of the national wildlife refuge system, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: College Grads Flock to Some Cities, Foregoing Others

BYLINE: DANIEL E. SLOTNIK


HIGHLIGHT: An analysis by the Brookings Institution indicates that college students tend to flock to certain metropolitan areas at the expense of others. 

 BODY:
There is a growing disparity among cities that have a surfeit of college graduates, like Washington, and those, like Dayton, Ohio, that are trying to attract more grads, an analysis by the Brookings Institution indicated. College graduates are increasingly important economic drivers, particularly in cities that have largely lost their manufacturing sectors and the accessible jobs they provide.
In the article "As College Grads Cluster, Some Cities Are Left Behind," our colleague Sabrina Tavernise writes:
Dayton sits on one side of a growing divide among American cities, in which a small number of metro areas vacuum up a large number of college graduates and the rest struggle to keep those they have.
The winners are cities like Bridgeport, Conn., San Francisco and Raleigh, N.C., where more than 40 percent of the population has a college degree. Cities like Youngstown, Ohio, Bakersfield, Calif., and Lakeland, Fla., where less than a fifth of the population has a college degree, are being left behind. The divide shows signs of widening as college graduates gravitate to places with a lot of other college graduates and the atmosphere that creates.
"This is one of the most important developments in recent economic history of this country," said Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who just published a book on the topic, "The New Geography of Jobs."
The recession amplified the trend. Metro areas where more than one in three adults were college-educated had an average unemployment rate of 7.5 percent earlier this year, compared with 10.5 percent for cities where less than one in six adults had a college degree, according to Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard and the author of "Triumph of the City."
Historically, most American cities had relatively similar shares of college graduates, in part because fewer people went to college. In 1970, the difference between the most-educated and least-educated cities, in terms of the portion of residents with four-year degrees, was 16 percentage points, and nearly all metro areas were within 5 points of the average. Today the spread is double that, and only half of all metro areas are within 5 points of the average, the Brookings research shows.
"There's a relentless cycle in which knowledge breeds knowledge, but the flip side is that many places are left out," said Alan Berube, a senior fellow at Brookings who conducted the analysis.

HEADLINE: KPN Rejects America Movil's Official Bid

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Dutch telecommunications company KPN rejected an official offer from Am&#233;rica M&#243;vil, owned by the billionaire Carlos Slim Hel&#250;, continuing to say the $3.2 billion bid was too low. Now KPN shareholders will have a month to decide. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The Dutch telecommunications company KPN rejected an official offer from América Móvil, the Mexican telephone operator owned by the billionaire Carlos Slim Helú, continuing to say the 2.6 billion euro ($3.2 billion) bid was too low. 
Now, KPN shareholders will have to decide.
On Tuesday, América Móvil, the owner of the Mexican wireless leader Telcel and the fixed-line carrier Telmex, launched a cash offer of 8 euros a share to increase its stake in KPN to 28 percent. The Mexican company currently owns a 4.8 percent stake.
 The multibillion dollar offer, a roughly 25 premium to where the stock was trading before the proposal was announced in early May, would represent América Móvil's largest expansion into Europe. It could also shake up the Continent's competitive landscape, as most developed countries have three or four operators fighting it out in stagnant or slow-growing national markets.
In a statement, KPN took note of the start of América Móvil's cash offer, but said the deal undervalued the company. KPN shareholders have until June 27 to accept América Móvil's offer.
KPN has been fighting declining profit and revenue amid a domestic slowdown and the European economic crisis. The company's share price has fallen 24 percent in the last 12 months. Shares rose 1.5 percent, to 7.7 euros, in Wednesday trading, still below the offer price.
"KPN will continue to explore all strategic options," the company said in its statement. It has hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to act as financial advisers.
A spokesman for the Dutch company declined to provide more detail on its strategic options.
América Móvil has been considering a move for some time to provide geographic balance for its Latin American operations. In a previous statement to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it aimed "to acquire an important minority stake in KPN, which has an attractive position in important European markets."
Mr. Slim, the majority owner of América Móvil, also owns a stake of about 8 percent in The New York Times Company.

HEADLINE: The Social Issues Strategy Revisited

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: A look at David Plouffe's plan to paint Mitt Romney as an "avatar of revanchism." 

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, I had a back-and-forth with The New Republic's Alec MacGillis over whether it was fair to suggest (as I had) that the Obama White House would much rather talk about social issues like the contraception mandate, the DREAM Act, and even gay marriage than about the economy and jobs. As an exhibit for my side of the argument, I'd like to submit this passage from John Heilemann's New York piece this week on the Obama campaign's plans for going negative against Mitt Romney:
Though the Obamans certainly hit John McCain hard four years ago-running more negative ads than any campaign in history-what they intend to do to Romney is more savage. They will pummel him for being a vulture-vampire capitalist at Bain Capital. They will pound him for being a miserable failure as the governor of Massachusetts. They will mash him for being a water-carrier for Paul Ryan's Social Darwinist fiscal program. They will maul him for being a combination of Jerry Falwell, Joe Arpaio, and John Galt on a range of issues that strike deep chords with the Obama coalition. "We're gonna say, 'Let's be clear what he would do as president,' " Plouffe explains. "Potentially abortion will be criminalized. Women will be denied contraceptive services. He's far right on immigration. He supports efforts to amend the Constitution to ban gay marriage."
The Obama effort at disqualifying Romney will go beyond painting him as excessively conservative, however. It will aim to cast him as an avatar of revanchism. "He's the fifties, he is retro, he is backward, and we are forward-that's the basic construct," says a top Obama strategist. "If you're a woman, you're Hispanic, you're young, or you've gotten left out, you look at Romney and say, 'This [expletive] guy is gonna take us back to the way it always was, and guess what? I've never been part of that.' "
The social issues strategy isn't the only component discussed here, obviously, but it's clearly the one that Heilemann's White House sources are most enthusiastic about, and the one that they're most intent on using to define Romney. This is exactly the kind of thinking I had in mind when I suggested that "at times, the Obama White House seems to be attempting to run a liberal version of George H. W. Bush's 1988 campaign, which used cultural arguments to delegitimize Michael Dukakis." In their vision of Mitt Romney, Retro Man and "avatar of revanchism," Plouffe and Co. plainly think that they have a winning left-of-center equivalent of the kind of "latte-drinking, sushi-eating, Volvo-driving" stereotypes that conservatives deployed against culturally-liberal Democrats between the McGovern and Obama eras.
The obvious problem with this strategy, as I've written before, is that cultural arguments tend to play poorly in recession-era elections - as Bush the elder discovered in 1992. The deeper problem, though, is that conservative culture war arguments have traditionally been most effective when they're attached to something more significant than just the iconography of identity politics - the lattes and sushi and Volvos, the perfidies of the Hollywood-media elite, and so on. The sex-and-marriage tangle of culture war issues mattered because American family structures broke down dramatically from the 1970s onward. The race-and-crime tangle mattered because crime rates went sky-high in the same period (and then those issues declined in salience as those same crime rates declined). Controversies ranging from immigration to affirmative action mattered because they played into white working class fears about wage stagnation and job loss, making it seem like while they were playing by the rules, their own government was taking sides against them.
So the question for the Obama campaign is whether any of social issues have a similar resonance in the current political atmosphere. Are American swing voters deeply worried about contraceptive access, for instance, and ready to believe that a Mitt Romney administration would imperil their ability to plan and space their children? If so, then the "war on women" framing could be a winner for the White House. If not, though, then the Obama camp's fixation on Mitt Romney, avatar of social reaction, could turn out to be a lot like the right-wing fixation on Barack Obama, radical socialist and crypto-Weatherman, during the 2008 campaign - a narrative that just makes the people pushing it look out-of-touch with the prevailing political and economic landscape.
Here's something I wrote about the right's William Ayers fixation during the '08 campaign that might have some relevance today:
 when I listen to Republicans talk about "taking the gloves off" where Barack Obama's relationship to William Ayers is concerned, I hear the sound of conservative failure - the sound, say, of the 1992 campaign, when George H.W. Bush went to the culture-war well in the midst of a recession and ended up losing to a philandering draft-dodger even so. The Ayers connection is completely fair game for the McCain campaign, as is the Jeremiah Wright connection: Both are windows into the political world Barack Obama moved in, and the "no enemies to the left" caution with which he navigated Chicago politics. I tend to think that both connections tell you a little more about Obama's tendency to be accommodating, and to tack with the prevailing political winds which ever way they blow, than they do about his own innermost convictions - I think he's more of a "go along, get along" guy than a crypto-socialist - but reasonable people can disagree on this point, and either way the connections are perfectly appropriate material for talking points, speeches and campaign ads. (And yes, by the same token, there's nothing unfair or dirty about the Obama campaign raising some of McCain's dubious past associations either.)
But Bill Ayers can't win you an election - he can't come anywhere close, in fact - because unlike Willie Horton, Bill Ayers isn't tied to any of the issues that are uppermost in voters' minds. He tells you something about Obama's judgment, maybe, and his ideological biases, maybe - and yes, yes, with enough innuendo and doomy music, you can imply that he tells you something about Obama's softness on Islamist terrorism as well. But think about the directness of the Willie Horton ad. Think about the directness of [Jesse Helms'] "white hands" ad. you And then think about the implications of any Ayers ad the McCain team could cut. 
For the Obama White House, the danger of the social issues strategy as outlined above is that it sends the following message. 

        
Obama and the Steelworkers
        
Romney the Inexorable
        
How Obama Loses
        
Why "Julia" Is Dangerous For Obama
        
The Success of the Gay Marriage Movement

HEADLINE: The Presidential Cage Match

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins on the Obama campaign's shift from hope to fear and whether Mitt Romney is the second coming of Perry Como. 

 BODY:
David Brooks: Gail, people are always asking me who is going to win the election. They must know I don't have a clue. I think they just want to hear me say that their favorite candidate is going to win.
Gail Collins: Wow, almost nobody asks me who's going to win. Mostly people just want to talk about the dog on the roof of Romney's car. I wonder if I'm being marginalized.
David: I could bring joy to the world if I told Democrats that Obama is surely going to win and Republicans that it's certain to be Romney.
But of course the code of the columnist dictates that my job is not to bring joy. It's to bring anger, frustration, depression and torpor. So let me say to you that I think Romney is more likely to win. My thinking is this: If nothing happens in Europe, then the odds are 50-50. But there's a strong chance that something very, very bad is going to happen to Europe.
Gail: I'm averse to placing odds unless we're talking about the Belmont Stakes, which I do think is going to be won by I'll Have Another, the horse that won the Preakness and Kentucky Derby. Do you know how often horses win the Derby and the Preakness and then flop in the Belmont? Constantly! But then we forget and the next year we're excited about the Triple Crown again. This is actually the only thing I know about horse racing.
But I'm sorry, you were talking about Europe.
David: There are a number of compelling people who are predicting Eurodoom over the next few months, but this Huffington Post piece by Simon Johnson and Peter Boone pretty well captures the full horror. 
Gail: I always appreciate the way you bring reading material to our discussions. Have you noticed the way I try to express my gratitude by providing historical context whenever when we're discussing political sex scandals?
David: Separately, Mark Cliffe, the head of ING Financial Markets Research, forecasts that if the Greeks can leave the euro in an orderly way, then the recession in Europe will slow American growth to about 1.3 percent in 2012 and 1.7 percent in 2013. If the Greek departure is messier, spilling over to other countries and maybe the collapse of the whole project, then euro zone G.D.P. would fall by 9 percent the first year and the United States would be back in recession.
Either scenario would swamp the presidential race. That is to say, Barack Obama could run the most brilliant campaign ever and it would still be swept away by the economic slide. No fault of his own. That's just the way the cookie crumbles.
Gail: It is possible that Europe will struggle through. Also, that it will be terrible for Europe but not as bad as expected for us. Also, we could discover someone on the Romney team was trying to corner the market on drachmas. I'm just saying that all kinds of outside events could have an impact on the presidential election, but there's no point in worrying about them until they happen. We have more than five months to go. Barack Obama might personally attack and subdue a terrorist hijacker, saving an entire airplane full of people. Although since he isn't allowed to fly commercial, the people getting saved would mainly be members of the media, which could dilute the national celebration.
David: But in the meantime, we have to go around pretending that the tactics, strategies and statements of the various campaigns matter. So I wanted to ask you about two salient issues.
Gail: Is either going to be about politicians' sex lives or the dog Mitt Romney put on the roof of his car? Because there are days when I begin to wonder if those are my only areas of expertise.
David: The first comes from a quotation in John Heilemann's well-reported piece in New York magazine on Obama's plans for his re-election race. One of Obama's election gurus puts it well. Romney is "the fifties, he is retro, he is backward, and we are forward - that's the basic construct."
Gail: I'm not sure they ought to run against the '50s. It was a tough time for women but really easy to get a job. Did you know that back then, newspaperswould for reporters? And there was no such thing as an unpaid internship.
David: Let me just note that the Obama campaign can't figure out a theme. Romney's the '50s, but he's also a modern financier. He's an opportunist who flip-flops but he's also a right-wing extremist in thrall to right-wing extremists? Obama flip-flops on Romney the way Romney flip-flops on health care reform.
Gail: I see a fairly consistent thought. Mitt is the opportunist who would happily turn himself into a right-wing extremist if it would get him elected. And I don't think you can discount the Bain Capital angle. Making unsuccessful companies efficient and successful is good. Buying loser companies, saddling them with debt and then walking off with a huge profit while the company expires like a beached flounder is bad.
David: Personally, I agree that Romney is sort of '50s. He's like Austin Powers, only from 1952. I've always thought the big electoral problem with his Mormonism is not Joseph Smith, it's the Osmonds.
Like Donny and Marie, he's counter-cultural. He doesn't seem to have experienced the cultural shift of the last few decades. No Lenny Bruce, no Richard Pryor, no Letterman, Seinfeld, Jay-Z or "The View."
Gail: Do you think Mitt sees reruns of "Howdy Doody" when he closes his eyes? Or maybe it's "I Led Three Lives"? That was the McCarthy-era TV series about Herbert Philbrick "who for nine frightening years did lead three lives - citizen, Communist and counterspy." Maybe that would explain Mitt's conviction, against all rational evidence, that our greatest peril lies in Mother Russia.
David: My question is: Is this good or bad? People turn back the clock all the time. Look at the Renaissance. Are Americans so disturbed that they want to reclaim a little wholesomeness, while obviously not turning their backs on the progress we've made on race, gender, cosmopolitanism and all the rest?
Gail: Not totally sure about the '50s wholesomeness. At least part of it was a national agreement not to talk about the unpleasantness that might be going on all about one. And to show all married couples sleeping in separate beds.
David: I think they might like a dose of retro-values. They'll eventually hear that Romney is the kind of guy who left his son's wedding reception early so he could bring food to someone who was recovering from breast cancer. If it's policy, then no one wants to go back to the '50s. If it's values, people might like that kind of back to basics.
Gail: Well, I totally reject the idea that it isn't 21st century to bring food to a sick friend. And when it comes to Romney's '50s-type behavior, there's also the time he tried to pressure a single woman into giving up her unborn baby for adoption.
David: The other large question is whether Obama's shift from hope to fear is a good thing. As Heilemann puts it, "For anyone still starry-eyed about Obama, the months ahead will provide a bracing revelation about what he truly is: not a savior, not a saint, not a man above the fray, but a brass-knuckled, pipe-hitting, red-in-tooth-and-claw brawler determined to do what is necessary to stay in power-in other words, a politician."
Gail: Poor guy. When he goes all positive and hope-y, his base demands to know when he's going to get in there and fight. When he fights, he's lost his positive message. I don't think it's possible for a presidential candidate to have a successful campaign strategy in June, because whatever he's doing, we in the opining class will say it's wrongheaded. Because, you know, we've still got five months of talking to go.
David: I understand why they are making this shift. But I think it's a mistake. They are neutralizing Obama's best asset - that he is different, authentic and personally admirable. Besides, I can't think of anybody who was elected with one persona and then re-elected with a completely opposite persona. It will creep people out.
Gail: I think you're exaggerating the persona shift. But I've got a funny feeling we'll be seeing many, many Baracks and Mitts before this one is over. We just need to calm down and enjoy the summer. Plenty of time to go crazy about your favored candidate's strategy in the fall.
David: So this is what we have to look forward to. A Republican candidate who is the second coming of Perry Como, a Democrat who is the personification of cage-match fighting, and it will all be determined by a bunch of spendthrift Greeks.
Gail: This sounds like a great script. Maybe we could sell it to HBO. Or make them all superheroes and put it in 3-D. Robert Downey Jr. can play the Democrat. You pick the Republican. Maybe Gwyneth Paltrow as Angela Merkel.

HIGHLIGHT: Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Fiat and Chrysler, says the Town &#038; Country minivan would be replaced in 2014 by a crossover. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
Sergio Marchionne, the Chrysler and Fiat chief executive, said in an interview scheduled to appear in the July issue of Automobile magazine that the Chrysler Town & Country minivan would be discontinued in 2014 and be replaced by a crossover model. In Chrysler's Jeep division, the slow-selling Compass crossover will be phased out. Chrysler, which is credited with popularizing the minivan in the 1980s, intends to retain the Dodge Grand Caravan as its sole minivan offering. (The Detroit Free Press)
 Fiat recently announced that its subsidiaries would cease selling vehicles to Iran. The decision followed those by other automakers who faced pressure from anti-proliferation organizations to stop sales until Iran's nuclear program could be proven by outside observers to not have weaponry elements. Fiat said it primarily sold Iveco commercial trucks and buses in Iran, none of which were produced there. (Bloomberg)
 Sales of turbocharged commercial and passenger vehicles are expected to increase by 1 million units in 2012, according to projections by J.D. Power & Associates and L.M.C. Automotive, a partner firm. In a media release, Honeywell Turbo Technologies noted that demand for greater fuel economy has led automakers and consumers toward low-displacement turbocharged engines. Citing data from the research firms, Honeywell said sales of turbocharged vehicles would increase from 2.2 million units in 2011 to 3.2 million this year. (Honeywell Turbo Technologies)
 Volkswagen announced it would offer a sportier, if not more powerful, version of its CC sedan under the R-Line badge. The sedan receives more aggressive lower body sculpting, 18-inch wheels, a 12-way adjustable driver's seat and upgraded audio-navigation equipment. Pricing for the CC R-Line will be announced toward the end of the year, when it is expected to go on sale. (Volkswagen)
 A 1933 Alfa Romeo 1750 GS bodied by Figoni was awarded the Trofeo BMW Group, the de facto best-in-show honor as determined by judges at the Concorso d'Eleganza at Villa d'Este. The Alfa also received the Coppa d'Oro Villa d'Este, the public prize for best in show. It was the second consecutive year that Alfas monopolized the awards. In the Concepts and Prototypes category, Alfa won with its 4C coupe, first shown at the 2011 Frankfurt motor show. (BMW Group)

HEADLINE: Paying Rent on Minimum Wage

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: There is no state in the country where it's possible to work a 40-hour week at minimum wage and afford a two-bedroom apartment. 

 BODY:
As part of its 2012 report on rent affordability, the National Low Income Housing Coalition released a chart that's been floating around the Internet. It shows that there isn't a single state in the country where it's possible to work 40 hours per week at minimum wage and afford a two-bedroom apartment at Fair Market Rent. In West Virginia and Arkansas, you'd need to work at least a 63-hour week, and that's as good as it gets. In California, Maryland, D.C., New Jersey and New York you'd need to work 130 hours or more. Hawaii comes in last place: 175 hours.

I can anticipate a few no-big-deal arguments, starting with the definition of affordability. The Coalition calculates the amount an individual must earn to afford a 2-bedroom unit according to the area's Fair Market Rent-which means paying no more than 30 percent of income for housing costs (rent and utilities). And why a two-bedroom apartment, as opposed to a one-bedroom?
Both of these choices seem reasonable to me. Thirty percent is a generally accepted standard, and there are plenty of single-parent households as well as families where, for various reasons, only one member is able to work.
But even if you quibble with how exactly the Coalition put the chart together, it's clear that there's a mismatch between the minimum wage and the cost of living (or at least a decent cost of living). In New York, which is in the midst of a fight over raising the minimum wage, two individuals would need to work 68 hours a week each to manage the rent on a two-bedroom unit. If they have kids, the 70 percent of their paychecks left after rent won't get them very far.
When he was campaigning for the presidency, Mr. Obama promised to raise the federal minimum wage annually. That hasn't happened. It's the same as it was in January of 2009: $7.25 an hour. According to Bloomberg View, that amount, adjusted for inflation, "is actually lower than what a minimum-wage worker earned in 1968."
Somehow I doubt Mitt Romney will highlight this particular broken promise in an attack ad, but that's no reason for anyone else to give the president a pass.

HEADLINE: Aung San Suu Kyi, Beyond Myanmar's Borders

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Aung San Suu Kyi's trip to Thailand, her first outside Myanmar since 1988, signals her confidence that President Thein Sein's government is serious about democratic reforms. 

 BODY:
The last time Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Myanmar's democracy movement, traveled internationally, it was 1988 and the Berlin Wall was still standing. That year, she flew back to Myanmar from Britain to care for her ailing mother.
Today, the lawmaker and leader of Myanmar's opposition is in Thailand on a historic - and politically sensitive - trip, the first outside her country in nearly a quarter of a century. As The Irrawaddy, a Thailand-based news magazine set up by exiles from Myanmar, put it, "Only now does Aung San Suu Kyi really seem to feel free." 
To get a sense of the historic nature of this trip (and just how long it's been since the Nobel Peace laureate was last about in the world), consider these facts, from a story by The Associated Press: In 1988, Ronald Reagan was still president of the United States, Libyan terrorists blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and Prozac was introduced to the market.
In June, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi will visit Switzerland, Britain and Ireland, where she is due to appear on stage at a concert by Bono, who has been an outspoken supporter. She will also travel to Oslo for her Nobel, awarded in 1991 but never received by her.
Most significantly, her presence in Thailand signals that the woman who cared so passionately about bringing democracy to Myanmar that she endured many years of house arrest, even missing the funeral of her husband in Britain, is confident that the government of President Thein Sein is serious about the democratic reforms it began last year. Until now, though she could probably have traveled at times, she stayed behind, fearful that the generals who ran Myanmar wouldn't let her back in.
The trip "signifies a strong vote of confidence on Suu Kyi's part in the seriousness of the reforms underway in the country," Suzanne DiMaggio, the Asia Society's vice president of global policy programs, told The Huffington Post. She wouldn't take the risk of leaving "if she wasn't absolutely certain she would be allowed to return," Ms. DiMaggio said.
As my colleague Thomas Fuller reported from Bangkok, the planning for this trip was somewhat chaotic. Even the Thai Foreign Ministry was in the dark about her plans. Tom quoted a spokesman, Thani Thongphakdi, as saying: "We'll have to play it by ear, I guess." 
In Thailand, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi will take part in a meeting of the World Economic Forum, an appearance that may have led Mr. Thein Sein, to - embarrassingly - cancel his own appearance there and postpone his own first trip to Thailand until next week. A cartoon in The Irawaddy, titled "Suu Kyi steals the show - Again," shows Thein Sein making a quick exit as Aung San Suu Kyi dominates media attention.
She is tackling sensitive political issues while in Thailand, reportedly planning to visit a refugee camp that is home to members of ethnic minorities who fled Myanmar during decades of fighting. About 140,000 refugees from the country live in Thailand, The Irawaddy reported. Some fled after a democracy uprising in 1988 was crushed by the military, beginning nearly a quarter-century of political and economic stasis.
Saw Tun Tun has lived in a camp with his family for two decades, since fleeing his home in Karen State to avoid possible arrest for his involvement in the democracy uprising. "We all want her to visit here. If she visits our camp, we want to tell her to create a political climate for us to be able to return home. We want to go home," Saw Tun Tun told The Irrawaddy. "We want her to hear our voices from our heart and see how difficult life is here."
"Maybe we might all go home if the 2015 election produces a genuine democratic government," he said.
On Wednesday, Ms. Suu Kyi visited migrant workers from Myanmar who had fled the parlous economy back home. This photo shows large crowds greeting her at Mahachai, an area outside Bangkok where many migrant workers live. 
About 2.5 million people from Myanmar work in Thailand, often in low-paid jobs, contributing as much as 7 percent of Thailand's G.D.P., said Andy Hall, an academic at Mahidol University in Bangkok, according to this report.

HEADLINE: Obama Video on Fox News Criticized as Attack Ad

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: Conservative and liberal observers said the video had the hallmarks of a campaign attack ad, except that it was produced and paid for by a news network rather than a candidate or a political action committee. 

 BODY:
6:53 p.m. | Updated The Fox News Channel came under withering criticism on Wednesday for a four-minute video broadcast on its morning show "Fox & Friends" that portrayed President Obama's tenure as a series of failed promises.
The video had most of the hallmarks of a campaign attack ad, except that it was produced and paid for by a news network rather than a candidate or a political action committee.
A blogger on the conservative Web site Hot Air wrote of the video on Wednesday afternoon, "It makes a pretty powerful argument against another four years of Barack Obama, but that shouldn't be the job of news-reporting organizations, even when we like the message."
David Zurawik, a television critic for The Baltimore Sun, wrote, "Even I am shocked by how blatantly Fox is throwing off any pretense of being a journalistic entity with videos like this."
"Fox & Friends" has been described by Fox public relations executives in the past as an entertainment show.
In recent years it has had an obviously conservative tilt, with near-constant criticism of Mr. Obama and other Democrats. It was on "Fox & Friends" that Mr. Obama was falsely reported to have attended an Islamic madrasa school while living in Indonesia.
But "Fox & Friends" also includes news elements and interviews, and Wednesday's video, titled "Four Years of Hope and Change," was preceded by a graphic that read "America's Election Headquarters," Fox's name for its election news coverage.

The video itself showed changes in the debt, the jobless rate, food prices, gas prices and other economic measurements, combined with spliced quotes from Mr. Obama and his critics.
"The Impact of the President's First Term," read a graphic on the bottom of the screen after the video. The co-anchors of "Fox & Friends" congratulated a producer, Chris White, for compiling the video, which noticeably did not include any positive measurements of Mr. Obama's tenure as president.
The video was broadcast one day after Mitt Romney officially secured the Republican nomination for president, having picked up the necessary number of delegates after a long primary campaign season. Asked whether the Obama campaign viewed the Fox video as a Romney campaign ad in disguise, a spokesman declined to comment.
A spokeswoman for Fox News, which is run by the former Republican strategist Roger Ailes, did not respond to requests for interviews. However, when asked about Mr. Ailes, she said, "Roger was not aware of the video. "
The blog TVNewser quoted a statement it said was from Bill Shine, the executive vice president of programming for Fox News: "The package that aired on 'Fox & Friends' was created by an associate producer and was not authorized at the senior executive level of the network. This has been addressed with the show's producers."
In past interviews, current and former Fox employees have described Mr. Ailes as keenly interested in the content of "Fox & Friends," which has an agenda-setting function since it starts off the network's day of programming. The people said Mr. Ailes regularly contributed talking points and phoned in ideas for the show, sometimes when it was on the air between 6 and 9 a.m. on weekdays.
The people spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of what they called possible retaliation by the network. Fox executives have publicly ridiculed employees in the past.
Versions of the video were taken off of the network's Web sites Wednesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, The Fox Nation, a conservative arm of FoxNews.com, promoted it as a "must-see Fox video," though now that URL leads to a dead link. Though Fox pulled the video, copies remained on YouTube and other sites.
Media Matters for America, a liberal nonprofit group that monitors Fox programming and mounts anti-Fox campaigns, asserted that the video may have violated one of the policies of the network's parent company, News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch.
The policy in question states that "we do not donate any corporate money, services, products or facilities to any political party, candidate or political committee" unless approved by the company's government relations office.
"The ad presented on 'Fox & Friends' was virtually indistinguishable from the sort of campaign videos regularly produced by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign, the Republican National Committee or Fox News analyst Karl Rove's American Crossroads," Media Matters stated. "Those videos at least provide a disclaimer noting their affiliation with a campaign or other sort of political committee."
The Fox video started with a graphic that read, "Fox & Friends Presents."

HEADLINE: The Early Word: New Attack

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at the latest happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
Mitt Romney, who formally secured the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday by winning a final batch of delegates in the Texas primary, introduced a new offensive: accusing the president of squandering taxpayer money on companies like Solyndra, Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg report. The new offensive is intended to win over independent voters and undermine confidence in President Obama's stewardship of the economy.

        
Donald J. Trump and his rhetorical grenades became the main focus on Tuesday when it was supposed to be a day of triumph for Mr. Romney, Ashley Parker writes. Instead of moving forward with an aggressive new attack on President Obama, Mr. Romney's aides were left to fend off questions about Mr. Trump's statements questioning the president's birth certificate.

        
The massacre of more than 100 civilians in Syria over the weekend has presented Mr. Romney with a new opportunity to attack President Obama's foreign policy as feckless and lacking in courage, Mark Landler reports. But Mr. Romney's own policy prescriptions for ending the mounting death toll in Syria have been less definitive than his denunciations of the president.

        
One of the few bills moving through Congress with bipartisan support would speed government approval of lower-cost generic copies of brand-name drugs, but lobbying from one company could alter the bill in favor of large drug companies, Robert Pear writes. The dispute highlights a central issue in health care: brand-name companies argue that future drug development will suffer if they cannot make good profits on their investments, while generic companies argue that they can hold down medical costs for households and taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Planned Parenthood Ads to Target Romney

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Planned Parenthood is unveiling one of its biggest-ever political advertising campaigns aimed at using Mitt Romney's own words to undermine his support among women. 

 BODY:
In the course of the Republican primary campaign, Mitt Romney took pains to convince socially conservative activists that he believes in them, understands their passions and would be an advocate for their causes in the Oval Office.
Now, Planned Parenthood is unveiling one of its biggest-ever political advertising campaigns aimed at using Mr. Romney's own words to undermine his support among women - a critical voter group among whom he already trails President Obama.
In a new ad that will run in three battleground states, the political arm of the women's health care organization accuses Mr. Romney of wanting to deny women access to birth control, abortions and equal pay for the work they do.
"When Mitt Romney says, 'Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that,'" the ad says, "Romney is saying he'll deny women the birth control and cancer screenings they depend on."
That statement can be misleading. Mr. Romney was answering a question about what federal funding he would target for elimination or reductions if he is elected. His campaign has said he wants to end federal funding of Planned Parenthood, not the organization itself.
But officials at the Planned Parenthood Action Fund said women understand the context of his remarks. They said the group is spending $1.4 million to run the ad in West Palm Beach, Fla., Des Moines, Iowa, and the suburbs of northern Virginia, as well as in Washington. That represents a threefold increase over the group's total spending during the 2008 campaign.
"This is just the beginning," said Dawn Laguens, the group's executive vice president. "This is a very small down payment on what we intend to do to make sure people are very clear where the candidates stand."
The campaign comes in the wake of Planned Parenthood's successful pressure campaign to win reversal of a cut in funding by the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation earlier this year. And it comes as Planned Parenthood and other liberal organizations see an opportunity in the statements Mr. Romney made during the primary.
Mr. Romney opposed the president's efforts to compel religious institutions to provide insurance coverage for contraception. He supported a "parenthood" measure in Mississippi that critics contend would ban birth control. And he has said he believes Roe v. Wade should be overturned.
Mr. Obama's campaign has seized on Mr. Romney's statements to try and drive a wedge between the Republican and women, many of whom live in battleground states that will decide the election this November.
Buoyed by polls that show Mr. Obama already has a significant edge over Mr. Romney among women, the Democratic campaign and its allies are hoping to maintain or even extend that lead. The Planned Parenthood ad fits into that strategy. The group will officially endorse Mr. Obama on Wednesday.
"Mitt Romney has been much clearer and more direct even than John McCain in his interest in dismantling women's health care," Ms. Laguens said. "The threats have intensified. The Republican primary laid bare and made clear what their agenda is."
Mr. Romney's campaign has responded by focusing its efforts on the economic plight that confronts many women. Mr. Romney has argued that 92 percent of the people who lost jobs under the president's watch were women.
That statistic ignores the fact that the economic downturn affected men more severely in the months before Mr. Obama took office. But Mr. Romney's advisers believe he can appeal to women by appealing to their sense of dismay about their financial futures.
"They go for security. They are looking for security more so than men," Bay Buchanan, an adviser to Mr. Romney, said of women in a conference call with reporters in March. "I think that Mitt Romney is going to be able to make a very strong case that we need these jobs. Women will understand that more than anybody."
Officials at Planned Parenthood dismiss those arguments. The organization conducted several focus groups with women during the past several months to fine-tune their political message. Geoff Garin, the group's pollster, said showing the ad had "jaw-dropping" effects on the women.
"They thought he was far more extreme and ideological than they suspected that he might be," Mr. Garin said. "In an election that is very likely to be won or lost with the votes of women, this ad and this whole campaign is very powerful."
In the focus groups of 500 swing women voters in battleground states, Mr. Garin said many voters did not know much about Mr. Romney's positions on issues of particular interest to women. After viewing the Planned Parenthood ad, the women were twice as likely to say Mr. Romney was "out of step" with women's issues, Mr. Garin said.
"There's a feeling that the election hangs in the balance based on the women's vote, beyond what was true even in 2008," he said. "The stakes are much higher."
The stakes are high for both presidential campaigns as well. Efforts by groups like Planned Parenthood will be especially important for Mr. Obama if they help him maintain his lead among women by warning that Mr. Romney represents a threat to their issues. 
But Mr. Romney's campaign will be just as aggressive in the days ahead, pushing its own narrative about how women have fared during Mr. Obama's presidency. And "super PACs" backing Mr. Romney will no doubt join the fight.
The women ad wars are just beginning.

HEADLINE: Obama Calls to Congratulate His Official Opponent

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama telephoned Mitt Romney on Wednesday to congratulate him on securing the Republican presidential nomination one day earlier. 

 BODY:
President Obama telephoned Mitt Romney on Wednesday to congratulate him on securing the Republican presidential nomination, and told Mr. Romney that he looked forward "to an important and healthy debate about America's future," a spokesman for the Obama campaign, Ben LaBolt, said.
The president, Mr. LaBolt said in a statement, "wished Governor Romney and his family well throughout the upcoming campaign." That may be the gentlest thing Mr. Obama says about Mr. Romney for the foreseeable future, as both candidates settle into a steady streams of attacks on each other in an increasingly rancorous campaign.
Mr. Romney secured the Republican nomination by picking up delegates in the Texas primary on Tuesday evening. Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, marked the milestone by introducing a new line of attack on the president, accusing Mr. Obama's administration of wasting taxpayer dollars on a reckless investment in the alternative-energy company, Solyndra. Mr. Romney's offensive came after Obama advertisements that sought to tie him to job losses engineered by his former firm, Bain Capital. 
Mr. Obama, who placed the call at 11:30 a.m., has begun to mention Mr. Romney by name at campaign events, mixing brief praise of him as a family man with sharp criticism of his views on economic issues and the middle class.
"Governor Romney is a patriotic American who has raised a wonderful family,'' the president said during a campaign rally in Ohio last month. But he quickly painted Mr. Romney as an out-of-touch plutocrat who Mr. Obama said lectures hard-working Americans on the need to be more productive.
Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, described the conversation as "brief but cordial." Mr. Romney, he said, thanked the president for his call and "wished him and his family well."
"They talked about the fact that a campaign is long," Mr. Fehrnstrom added, "but it's relieving to know it doesn't go on forever and that it will be over in November."

Dewey Hopes to Resolve Bankruptcy Quickly | As Dewey & LeBoeuf began its bankruptcy proceedings on Tuesday, its advisers said their aim was to speed the failed law firm through Chapter 11.
Among the chief near-term goals is reaching an agreement to recover money from some of the firm's former partners, many of whom departed earlier this year amid fear about their employer's financial health. That exodus drained Dewey of revenue and the confidence that the firm would survive.
Albert Togut, a lawyer representing the Dewey estate, said in a hearing on Tuesday afternoon in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan that the firm was working on a settlement, which could resolve a legal matter that could otherwise take years to figure out. He declined to give details after the hearing.
Still, a settlement is likely to take time. Mark C. Zauderer, a lawyer representing about 50 to 60 former Dewey partners, said in court that he and his clients had not heard what the basis of such claims would be. DealBook »

In the years leading up to the financial crisis, private equity dominated the takeover market, taking advantage of cheap credit and investors begging to participate. In the first half of 2007, according to Dealogic, the industry accounted for more than 18 percent of announced takeover volume in the world. It all came crashing down, and last year private equity accounted for a bit less than 7 percent of global takeover volume, according to Dealogic.
If private equity's recovery from the financial crisis has been fitful, its future looks uncertain. One of the industry's biggest problems is that it has too much money to invest. According to Preqin, at the end of last year private equity firms had about $900 billion worth of "dry powder," or money raised mostly before the financial crisis that has not been invested. At current takeover rates, this would take almost a decade. DealBook »

HEADLINE: The Products Sell, but Can Jellio Make Enough of Them?

BYLINE: ADRIANA GARDELLA


HIGHLIGHT: Mario Marsicano says retailers would love to be able to buy more of his furnishings. 

 BODY:
We've just published a case study about Jellio, a maker of whimsical home furnishings that is based in New York. Mario Marsicano, a former advertising agency account director, had long collected old toys -- Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots were among his favorites. He collected so many that he decided to experiment with embedding some in a table made of Lucite. When his friends started asking for their own Rock 'em Sock 'em tables, he figured he might be on to something. He and Chris Lenox, a co-founder, introduced Jellio with a Web site in 2005.
The products have been well received but Jellio has struggled to figure out how to make enough of them -- and how to make them at a price that people will pay.
We asked several manufacturing specialists to offer their advice. Please read the article as well the comments below and then tell us what you think. Next week, we will publish an update on how Jellio is doing. 
James Dyson, chief executive and chief engineer of Dyson Ltd., a British-based manufacturer of vacuums: "Committing to produce something yourself is terrifying. But if you have a product you believe in and a market for it, it makes sense if you can secure the capital. It gives you total control, particularly over quality, which is incredibly important when you start out. To keep costs down, it's essential to pick the right suppliers and develop good relationships with them. A bad supplier can hold you hostage. But, ultimately, I believe it's better to sell a better product at a higher price than an inferior one for less."
Paul Fichter, president, Tap Handles, which manufactures beer marketing products: "I suggest adapting the designs, currently optimized for one-off production, for manufacturability at volume. For example, find a way to hollow out the GummiLights while getting nearly the same effect, to save material and shipping weight. It's the difference between an original hand-painted painting and a print. Jellio customers should get a choice: Do you want the $250 original Marsicano/Lenox-made GummiLight -- $125 is too cheap -- or the $50 print from China?"
Garret Hirchak, owner, Manufacturing Solutions, a manufacturer in Morrisville, Vt.: "Jellio is creative, good at invention and launch, and even small-scale manufacturing. I would encourage them to focus on invention and marketing while developing a regionally local manufacturer that can respond quickly to changing demand and design. To find one, get leads from contacts and suppliers, reach out to manufacturers of like items, or try the New York economic development agency. We work with Vermont's version. With the right partner, this model is low-cost and low-risk."

HEADLINE: You Can Go Home Again

BYLINE: By KAREN L. FINGERMAN and FRANK F. FURSTENBERG. 
Karen L. Fingerman is a professor of human development and family sciences at the University of Texas at Austin. Frank F. Furstenberg is a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and the director of the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Transitions to Adulthood.

 BODY:
THEY'RE back.
Just when parents thought they might finally be free of their children, many of this year's college graduates will pick up their degrees -- and move back home. Even those who don't may continue to live off the parental dole; at the start of HBO's hit series ''Girls,'' Hannah, played by Lena Dunham, is trying to keep the monthly checks from Mom and Dad coming. The fragile economy could exacerbate the phenomenon of delayed adolescence, keeping Americans in their late 20s and even early 30s dependent on their families for years.
But this is not necessarily the nightmare scenario it's made out to be. Our research shows that the closer bonds between young adults and their parents should be celebrated, and do not necessarily compromise the independence of the next generation. 
Grown children benefit greatly from parental help. Young adults who received financial, practical and emotional support from their parents reported clearer life goals and more satisfaction than young adults who received less parental support. This support ranged from room and board to making a car available, to parents' listening to their son or daughter talk about the day.
Twenty-five years ago, young people sought advice and help from naive peers. Today's young adults may be savvier than their predecessors; they receive advice and help from middle-aged adults with greater life experience and material resources to offer.
This relationship has been evolving over the last generation.
In 1986, about half of parents reported that they had spoken with a grown child in the past week. In 2008, 87 percent said they had. In 1988, less than half of parents gave advice to a grown child in the past month, and fewer than one in three had provided any hands-on help. Recent data show that nearly 90 percent of parents give advice and 70 percent provide some type of practical assistance every month.
It turns out that many parents and children want this close contact. We first observed a shift in this relationship in 1999, when the economy was booming. Even before the cellphone era, many 20-something women talked with their mothers several times a week. They discussed boyfriend problems, classes and plans for the future. They brought home their laundry, went shopping with their mothers and even pronounced their mothers (and sometimes their fathers) their ''best friends.'' Their descriptions might have seemed cloying, yet the mothers involved said that they were thrilled. They took pride in their daughters and reveled in the intimacy.
These trends have accelerated over the past 10 years. Adult offspring today text their parents often, befriend them on Facebook and willingly accept emotional support, advice and a financial boost. Young men are as likely to be involved with parents as young women.
The benefits of parental involvement are not surprising from a global perspective. In other cultures and among many ethnic subcultures in America, young adults are expected to be intensely involved with their parents. Romantic relationships and marriage were the ties of primary importance in the United States during the 20th century. But in this new century, with delays in marriage, more Americans choosing to remain single, and high divorce rates, a tie to a parent may be the most important bond in a young adult's life.
Technological and economic developments have contributed to this shift. Nationwide cellphone calling plans and e-mail ease communication. Young people spend extra years in school to pursue well-paying careers. Teenagers who don't go on to higher education need even more parental support while they work at low-paying jobs with irregular hours. The economic downturn did not push kids out of the family.
Although this parental support seems to be a good thing, the new arrangements also rankle many people and violate ideals of autonomy that have long prevailed in this nation.
In our surveys, parents and grown children alike reported uneasiness, viewing intense parental support in adulthood as a sign of damaging over-involvement. Parents reported less satisfaction about their own lives if they believed their children were too dependent. The problem isn't with the help, per se, but with viewing that support as abnormal and worrying that it could cause harm. Maybe we just need to get over this discomfort.
In fact, we could be celebrating the strong bonds between today's young people and their parents, rather than lamenting the foibles of the next generation. Forty years ago, the news media were filled with reports of a generation gap. Let's be grateful that we've finally solved that problem.

HEADLINE: Facing Down the Bankers

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Sitting in a corner office high above K Street here, Dennis M. Kelleher, one of the most powerful lobbyists on financial regulatory reform, looks every bit the corporate lawyer and high-ranking Senate aide he formerly was: tailored suit, quick smile, assertive tone.
But Mr. Kelleher does not work for banks. He works against them.
''What is at stake is whether the American people are at risk of another Great Depression,'' Mr. Kelleher, who is 54, said in a recent interview. ''We exist to fight back against the forces trying to make us forget just how bad it was.''
Mr. Kelleher is the president of Better Markets, a nonprofit organization that pushes for a stringent interpretation of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, which passed in 2010 but whose specific rules and regulations are currently the focus of an intense, complex and expensive behind-the-scenes battle. 
Think of Better Markets as Occupy Wall Street's suit-wearing cousin.
Mr. Kelleher, a Harvard Law School alumnus and a former partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom -- is a wisecracking, fast-talking operator who just happens to think that banks would devastate the economy if given the chance.
The financing for the K Street office comes not from small donations but from millions contributed by Michael Masters, an Atlanta-based hedge fund manager who believes that the markets are as imperfect as the people participating in them, and therefore need stricter rules.
Better Markets does not march against banks, or bring loudspeakers to their lobbies. It instead writes detailed comment letters to regulators, meets with them, files friend-of-the-court briefs, puts out studies and testifies before Congress.
The goal, Mr. Kelleher said, was to present an alternative argument to the one made by the banks and their small army of lobbyists. ''For a long time, there had been no organization dedicated solely to going to toe-to-toe with the financial industry, on any issue, no matter how complex or obscure,'' he said. ''That's what we do.''
Still, Better Markets and the handful of other advocates for the public interest -- Americans for Financial Reform, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and a few think tanks among them -- remain seriously outmanned.
Take lobbying on the Volcker Rule, a controversial portion of the Dodd-Frank law that would prevent depository institutions from making certain speculative bets. From July 2010 to October 2011, financial institutions met with federal agencies to discuss it some 351 times, according to an analysis by Kimberly D. Krawiec, a law professor at Duke. Public interest groups, including Better Markets, held just 19.
''It's David versus Goliath,'' said Byron Dorgan, the former North Dakota senator and Mr. Kelleher's former employer. ''But at least David's there.''
Since JPMorgan Chase announced that it had lost $2 billion or more on a failed hedge, Mr. Kelleher has made an effort to be everywhere: in its crisis, he saw his opportunity to stress that banks need tougher controls.
''Jamie Dimon's poor fortune is good news for financial reform and taxpayers,'' said Mr. Kelleher, referring to the bank's chief executive. ''Because, as it is unendingly noted, he's the best banker in the world,'' he said wryly. ''The universe, maybe. It can get intergalactic with the compliments.''
He raced to New York for a television appearance. He spoke with more than two dozen reporters, and corresponded with several more. In Better Markets' 16 months of existence, Mr. Kelleher has become a favorite source for the media, speaking in long, quotable peals and in a broad-voweled Massachusetts accent.
In his sound bites, the JPMorgan affair is a ''debacle.'' Investment banks need to remember the ''hierarchy of guilt'' for the crisis. (They are at the top.) A weak rule on swaps is an ''indefensible retreat'' from tougher regulation and a ''poster child for the pernicious effect of industry's army of lobbyists.''
He also met with the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
''It's good to get some balance into the mix,'' said Gary S. Gensler, the chairman of the commodities commission. ''My mom and your mom don't usually have somebody who's going to spend the time reading the detailed rules, and do not necessarily have the same resources or desire to be into the minute details that the large financial interests on the other side of this debate do.''
The industry's lobbyists argue that they, too, are on the side of reform -- just not excessive reform. ''The industry is in favor of better regulation,'' said T. Timothy Ryan Jr., the president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.
Excessive regulation, he argues, would raise costs for businesses and individuals. ''The banks are in much better shape, because many of them have been earning some money, retaining those earnings, and upping their capital,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''If we produce through regulations banks that make no money, it's not going to strengthen the financial system.''
If any thread runs through Mr. Kelleher's career, it is a knack for showing up just after a crisis. After growing up in modest circumstances in central Massachusetts, Mr. Kelleher enlisted in the Air Force and served as a crash rescue firefighter. As a corporate lawyer, he specialized in the legal cleanup after a scandal -- as when an executive was caught committing fraud, or a company was caught cooking its books.
A partner in Skadden's Boston office, he had been quietly involved in Democratic politics while working in corporate law. In 1996, he took a year off to work on one of Senator Edward M. Kennedy's committee staffs. In 2004, he came back to Washington and never left, working for Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, the liberal aggressive Maryland Democrat and then Mr. Dorgan.
On Capitol Hill, Mr. Kelleher worked on a broad range of issues -- Afghanistan, health care and safety-net programs. He won a reputation as loquacious and assertive, twisting arms for Mr. Dorgan and wearing down interlocutors in long negotiations.
''Dennis was generally acknowledged to be a star,'' said Ted Kaufman, the former Delaware Senator who served as an adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for years before taking his vacated Senate seat in 2009. ''He was really, really smart, and really knew how to make an argument,'' he said.
When Mr. Dorgan retired, Mr. Kelleher fielded calls from lobbyists and law firms, but decided to keep working for the public. Mr. Masters, the hedge fund manager who had met Mr. Kelleher when he testified on Capitol Hill, convinced him to help him start a nonprofit, Better Markets. Both Mr. Masters and Mr. Kelleher felt that there were too few public intellectuals or research groups capable of giving detailed counterpoints to the investment banks and other financial firms.
So Mr. Masters agreed to finance Better Markets for a minimum of five years. His financial contribution -- the organization shows $3 million in financing in a 2010 regulatory filing -- has raised speculation that he built the organization to soak up information in Washington or to influence the rule-writing process. (Hedge funds may reap the benefits if investment banks are strictly regulated, after all.)
But Mr. Masters said he had been shocked by the poor understanding of financial markets on Capitol Hill, and said the crisis proved the need for more regulation. He dismissed the notion that his motivations were financial. ''If I wanted to alter my portfolio positions, I could do it in 24 hours,'' he said.
The odds remain against Better Markets and fellow public-interest advocates, Mr. Kelleher concedes.
''It's a battle in which the Wall Street lobbying and public-relations machine will have a decisive advantage,'' said Mr. Kaufman, the former Delaware senator. ''With the regulators, you don't have to win. You just have to gum them up. And that is exactly what Wall Street has done.''

HEADLINE: Pending Home Sales Fall to a 4-Month Low

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of people signing contracts to buy previously owned homes unexpectedly fell in April to a four-month low, undermining some of the recent optimism that the housing sector was nearing a bottom. 
The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that its index of pending home sales, based on contracts signed last month, fell 5.5 percent, to 95.5, its lowest level since December.
The series still remained sharply higher from a year earlier, and economists said the data did not change the view that the American economy remained in recovery.
''The drop in pending home sales is clearly disappointing,'' said Pierre Ellis, an economist at Decision Economics. ''It remains to be seen whether this is the beginning of a real downturn.''
Economists polled by Reuters had expected signed contracts, which lead home sales by a month or two, to rise 0.1 percent after a previously reported 4.1 percent gain in March.
The housing market has been one of the economy's weakest links as it recovers from the recession, but many economists believe the sector will add to economic growth in 2012 for the first time in seven years.
The report on pending contracts in April could temper some of that optimism.
Also casting a shadow, applications for home mortgages fell last week as refinance demand faltered, even as mortgage rates hit another record low. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, decreased 1.3 percent last week.
The National Association of Realtors report showed that signed contracts to buy homes fell 12 percent in the West and 6.8 percent in the South. They edged lower in the Midwest and rose slightly in the Northeast.

HEADLINE: The Credit History Underclass

 BODY:
Millions of Americans with damaged credit records are at risk of being unfairly denied job opportunities by companies that use credit histories to screen applicants. Faced with growing public complaints, seven states have rightly limited the use of credit histories by potential employers. Federal, state and local lawmakers who are considering similar legislation are on the right track. 
Job-related credit checks have grown increasingly popular, with an estimated 60 percent of employers using them, up from about 20 percent in the mid-1990s. Yet several studies have shown -- and some in the credit-checking industry readily admit -- that a poor rating does not automatically make a person a poor job prospect or more likely to commit fraud. Very often, damaged credit is the result of a layoff during the recession, divorce or a catastrophic illness.
Washington, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, California, Maryland and Oregon have passed laws limiting the use of credit screening in hiring decisions. But some of these laws still need to be tightened and exemptions narrowed. Illinois, for example, allows employers to continue to do credit checks on managers and minor retail workers.
Bills pending in the New York State Assembly and the New York City Council would be more restrictive, prohibiting employers from using a job applicant's credit history except in cases where such checks are required by either state or federal law. A bill pending in Congress, called The Equal Employment for All Act, would work in a similar fashion.
Credit-history screening can also lead to discrimination against minorities, who have historically been targeted for predatory lending practices that made them more vulnerable to default and blemished records.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has sued two companies for credit-record screening, has repeatedly said that such screening is illegal when it excludes groups of people and is not job-related or justified by business necessity.
The interest around this issue shows that more lawmakers are starting to realize how this unfair practice damages the lives and job prospects of millions of people. The sooner they act to end it, the better.

HEADLINE: Crumbs From the Crowd to Pay the Bills

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Cake Shop, a Lower East Side club that served as an incubator for celebrated indie bands like Vampire Weekend and the Dirty Projectors, is facing a financial crisis and has started a novel Internet fund-raising campaign to keep its doors from closing.
Though it has been in operation only since 2005, Cake Shop, at 152 Ludlow Street, has earned a reputation for helping local bands develop, and though it is a small, unpretentious club, it has become an important tour stop on the national circuit for alternative groups. It is also one of the last clubs of its kind in Lower Manhattan, as rising rents have pushed the scruffy bars that nurtured underground rock across the East River into Brooklyn. 
''It really catered to independent underground pop music, stuff that wasn't too concerned with how many tickets it was going to sell,'' said Kip Berman, the guitarist and lead vocalist for the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, one of the success stories to emerge from the club. ''That scene moved to Brooklyn, and Cake Shop is the last vestige left in Manhattan.''
But in recent months the founders of the club -- the brothers Nick and Andy Bodor -- have run into financial difficulties and face eviction, they said. They are under a court order to pay the landlord $58,000 by July 26, to cover the club's share of taxes under the lease for two calendar years. They are also facing a $20,000 fine from the New York State Liquor Authority for noise violations and for several incidents in which under-age patrons were sold drinks last year.
Nick Bodor said the tax bill, which kicked in after a five-year abatement, was much higher than the owners had calculated. He said the liquor authority violations came after a crackdown by the police and a change in rules governing what identifications could be accepted. The club has since hired full-time bouncers, another expense.
''We just never had huge profits or deep pockets or a lot of money in the bank as a cushion,'' Nick. Bodor said. ''A hit like this -- we don't have any kind of reserve fund we can magically tap into.''
To raise the money the Bodors and the third partner, Greg Curley, have turned to an Internet crowdfunding Web site called Pledge Music. Normally the site is used by musicians to raise money for recording an album. People can buy copies of the album in advance or pay for premiums offered by the artist, like an autographed guitar, a song about the donor or a performance in the donor's home. A portion of the money for each project goes to charity.
The owners of Cake Shop are giving away a range of creative rewards for donations. For $12 a donor can get a compilation album featuring bands that have played at the club. A $75 donation buys entrance to any show and eight drinks. A $200 donation puts a person on the guest list for six months of shows. For $20,000 a donor gets ''free drinks for life.''
Benji Rogers, a former frontman in the band Marwood who founded Pledge Music three years ago, said Cake Shop is the first music space to try raising cash through the site. He approached the Bodors after hearing that the club was in trouble and offered to help. In a sense, he said, he was repaying a debt. He recalled that several years ago, when he was still a working musician, the Bodors had helped him to sell his record collection to raise money for a tour.
''They have got an incredible amount of love from the music community,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''Every band in New York has gone through there. It's like a rite of passage.''
Nick Bodor said he hopes to raise enough money not just to pay off the taxes and fines but to expand the business. The club needs at least $50,000 over the next two months to stay in business, but the owners hope to collect three to four times that amount and to plow the extra funds into expansion. So far they have collected about 18 percent of the $50,000 goal.
Mr. Bodor envisions starting a record label with the Cake Shop logo. He would like to turn the club's Web site into a moneymaking operation with original content: articles, videos of performances, releases of new music. He acknowledged that to stay open beyond this year the club will have to increase its revenue to cover about $25,000 a year in property taxes going forward. ''We want to look at this as an opportunity to recalibrate our business,'' he said.
For some indie musicians the prospect that the club might close signals the end of a certain kind of underground music in Manhattan. David Longstreth, the frontman for Dirty Projectors, said Cake Shop gave a vital forum to his band and other groups who made ''music that was maybe a little bit improbable.'' He added, ''It's just a great place to try something out.''
If Cake Shop closes, it would also mean the loss of a performance space for new and developing groups. Andy Bodor, who handles booking, arranges gigs at the club for more than 25 bands every week, regularly showcasing three or four a night. The basement performance space, which holds only 120 people, is a long sloping room -- a windowless, tunnel-like structure -- with red walls that ends in a scarred, six-inch-high plywood stage. The wall behind the musicians is covered with cheap tinsel, and Christmas lights have been woven into a mass above the stage.
Tuesday was a typical night. The early evening was devoted to undiscovered stand-up comics with bizarre material. Then Good Sports, a local female trio, played their first gig in the early slot, nervously delivering a series of short three-chord songs with a punkish edge to a small crowd. Next came Ghost Heart, a quartet from Grand Rapids, Mich., whose drum kit included a bicycle wheel and timpani. It was the group's first gig in Manhattan, and it performed long, howling songs with falsetto vocals that floated above tribal drums and swirling guitar arpeggios. Their set, haunting and resonant, was decidedly noncommercial.
Nick Bodor, who has a tattoo on his left arm depicting man's descent from the apes, was behind the bar, pouring drinks and listening intently. ''We take a few more chances,'' he said. ''We are not going to book something unless we believe it's at least interesting.''

HEADLINE: Meeting the Demand For Quirky Objects

BYLINE: By ADRIANA GARDELLA

 BODY:
Mario Marsicano and Chris Lenox founded Jellio in 2005. The company, which is based in New York, makes whimsical home furnishings.
THE CHALLENGE To maximize growth, Jellio must figure out how to increase production to keep up with demand while reducing production costs.
THE BACKGROUND Mr. Marsicano, a former advertising agency account director, had long collected old toys -- Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots were among his favorites. He collected so many that he decided to experiment with embedding some in a table made of Lucite. When his friends started asking for their own Rock 'em Sock 'em tables, he figured he might be on to something. He introduced Jellio with a Web site in 2005 and left his ad agency job in 2008 to focus on the company full time. So far, Mr. Lenox, Jellio's creative director, has kept his day job in advertising, and Kevin Champeny, Jellio's production manager, has kept his in production.
As of summer 2011, Mr. Marsicano believed Jellio was on track to double its 2010 revenue, which was $450,000. At that time, Jellio -- in most cases, Mr. Champeny -- made each product individually, resulting in high costs and a maximum weekly output of 25 pieces. 
When the team had an idea for a new product, which occurred regularly, Mr. Lenox drew a three-dimensional rendering. Mr. Champeny, a sculptor and caster, fashioned the products made of polyurethane (like Jellio's $125 Gummi Bear candy-inspired GummiLights) and acrylic (like the company's $600 Rubik's Cube tables).
For products made of other materials, Mr. Marsicano hunted down manufacturers. For example, with Mr. Lenox's drawing of an ice cream sandwich bench in hand, he searched online for local upholsterers. The finished product sells for $900.
About 75 percent of Jellio's work was custom made for business clients -- including Nike, Toyota and Sony -- that used the company's products for special events, set design, and office decor. Google bought 20 lava lamps.
The remaining customers were consumers, who bought products on Jellio's Web site and at four boutiques in Manhattan. The GummiLights were its most popular product. Mr. Champeny made them along with other consumer pieces at his studio in Bronxville, N.Y.
Mr. Marsicano was confident that if he could lower production costs, he would be able to expand rapidly. When one of his retailers requested 100 GummiLights, he had to remind her that the company could provide a maximum of 20 a month. Mr. Marsicano said that if Jellio's products could be produced less expensively, the company could branch into the wholesale market and into additional retail outlets. ''I could e-mail my database of interested retailers and let them know the game is on -- they can have anything they want,'' he said.
THE OPTIONS Mr. Marsicano considered outsourcing production to China. Through contacts and online research he narrowed his search to two manufacturers and got quotes to produce the GummiLights. The costs quoted were $5 to $10 higher per light than what Mr. Marsicano had spent for Mr. Champeny's time and the polyurethane, which is petroleum based and therefore expensive.
The Chinese manufacturers also would have accepted orders of only 500 or 1,000 lights at a time. ''We'd have to raise capital to outsource,'' Mr. Marsicano said. He added that his products were unique because they were solid, not hollow, which increases the cost and complexity of manufacturing them. Jellio would also have to pay shipping costs and tariffs.
While Mr. Marsicano was unable to identify any likely domestic manufacturers for the lights, he did determine that future product lines might be produced here. For example, he would like to explore creating ceramic kitchen products and has found several potential manufacturers in the Southeast.
''That's something we wouldn't bring in-house,'' Mr. Marsicano said. ''Even Kevin doesn't know ceramics.'' Jellio would also like to begin designing metal objects, which Mr. Marsicano suspects could also be made in the United States.
To manufacture its current products, Jellio could bring all production in-house. Mr. Champeny could continue to make the polyurethane and acrylic products. But Jellio would need to invest in more pressure pots, the ovens used to bake the GummiLights.
Mr. Champeny recommended that Jellio buy seven pots that can each make 12 products at a time, which Mr. Marsicano said would translate to 100 a week and 5,000 a year. The equipment would cost a total of $30,000 to $50,000. To manufacture Jellio's upholstered and wooden products, Mr. Marsicano would need to hire an upholsterer and a carpenter, and invest in carpentry tools and the equipment to make the upholstered products.
He estimated the total cost of setting up this small studio at $400,000 to $500,000. In addition to equipment costs, this estimate includes salaries for the carpenter and upholsterer, enough material to get quantity discounts, and monthly rent of $5,000 to $7,000 for space either in Westchester County or in New York City outside Manhattan. This would allow Jellio to lower the price of the GummiLights to under $100, Mr. Marsicano said. Ideally, he would like to set the price at $60 to $75.
WHAT OTHERS SAY James Dyson, chief executive and chief engineer of Dyson Ltd., a British-based manufacturer of vacuums: ''Committing to produce something yourself is terrifying. But if you have a product you believe in and a market for it, it makes sense if you can secure the capital. It gives you total control, particularly over quality, which is incredibly important when you start out. To keep costs down, it's essential to pick the right suppliers and develop good relationships with them. A bad supplier can hold you hostage. But, ultimately, I believe it's better to sell a better product at a higher price than an inferior one for less.''
Paul Fichter, president, Tap Handles, which manufactures beer marketing products: ''I suggest adapting the designs, currently optimized for one-off production, for manufacturability at volume. For example, find a way to hollow out the GummiLights while getting nearly the same effect, to save material and shipping weight. It's the difference between an original hand-painted painting and a print. Jellio customers should get a choice: Do you want the $250 original Marsicano/Lenox-made GummiLight -- $125 is too cheap -- or the $50 print from China?''
Garret Hirchak, owner, Manufacturing Solutions, a manufacturer in Morrisville, Vt.: ''Jellio is creative, good at invention and launch, and even small-scale manufacturing. I would encourage them to focus on invention and marketing while developing a regionally local manufacturer that can respond quickly to changing demand and design. To find one, get leads from contacts and suppliers, reach out to manufacturers of like items, or try the New York economic development agency. We work with Vermont's version. With the right partner, this model is low-cost and low-risk.''
THE RESULTS Offer your thoughts on Jellio's decision on the You're the Boss blog at nytimes.com/boss. Next week, on the blog and in this space, we will publish an update on how the company is doing.

ENGINES OF CHANGE
A History of the American Dream in Fifteen Cars
By Paul Ingrassia
Illustrated. 395 pages. Simon & Schuster. $30.
The Great Tail Fin Wars of the late 1950s, between Chrysler and Cadillac; the Prius-Hummer face-offs of the early 2000s; the Cinderella transformation of the drab little Ford Falcon into the snazzy Mustang; and the even more startling metamorphosis of Hitler's Volkswagen into the American counterculture's car of choice in the '60s and '70s -- these are just some of the wonderfully entertaining real-life stories in Paul Ingrassia's book ''Engines of Change: A History of the American Dream in Fifteen Cars.''
Mr. Ingrassia, the deputy editor in chief of Reuters, is a former Detroit bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal (and the brother of Lawrence Ingrassia, the business editor of The New York Times). In this book he draws upon his expertise covering the car business to give us a highly informed but breezy narrative history of the vehicles that have shaped and reflected American culture. 
Along the way he also gives us some sharp snapshots of the engineers, businessmen and ad people who helped design and promote these automobiles, men like Harley Earl, who led General Motors' design department for three decades, ''from the Jazz Age to the Space Age,'' and John DeLorean, the fast-living engineer and executive behind Pontiac's GTO, ''the meanest street-legal car in America,'' and behind his own company's DMC-12, the stainless-steel roadster with gull-wing doors better known as the magic time machine in ''Back to the Future.''
It would be easy to argue that Mr. Ingrassia's selection of cars is arbitrary and subjective -- the Thunderbird and the Camaro, for instance, are mentioned only in passing -- but he makes a strong case that the automobiles in this book ''either changed American society or uniquely captured the spirit of their time.''
Henry Ford's Model T clearly transformed the United States into a mobile nation. It ''begat mass production, which begat the $5 day,'' which ''begat the middle class, the suburbs, shopping malls, McDonald's, Taco Bell, drive-through banking and other things beloved of the modern-day philistines.'' Other cars cited here, like the 1959 Cadillac, the Volkswagen Beetle and Microbus, the Corvette and the Chrysler minivan, serve more as mirrors of changing tastes, fashions and mores.
As Mr. Ingrassia explains, the cars he has chosen illustrate the yin-and-yang tug of war in modern American culture between the practical and the pretentious: ''the frugal versus the flamboyant, haute cuisine versus hot wings, uptown versus downtown, big-is-better versus small-is-beautiful, and Saturday night versus Sunday morning.'' Case in point: Whereas the Model T was simple, versatile and affordable (in 1912 the basic two-seat Torpedo Runabout model cost $590), General Motors' stylish La Salle (which had its debut in 1927, only weeks before the demise of the Model T was announced, and cost nearly seven times as much) pointed to Americans' growing appetite for status and sex appeal, tastes that would be curbed during the Great Depression.
For that matter, there seems to be a direct correlation, Mr. Ingrassia suggests, between the economy -- or at least gas prices -- and the kinds of cars that zoom up the best-seller lists. Chrome-slathered cars and big land sharks with big engines and big fins flourished in the late 1950s, which Thomas Hine has referred to as the start of the populuxe era, when Americans, buoyed by postwar prosperity, went on a huge shopping spree.
The sleek, sporty Corvette got off the starting blocks around the same time -- in 1953, the year Elvis Presley and Playboy magazine began their careers -- and roared into the '60s, though at the end of that decade the power of its engine shrank.
''The Corvette's horsepower, like the length of women's skirts,'' Mr. Ingrassia writes, ''proved a reliable indicator of America's economic and psychic strength. In the years between 1969 and 1975, when America endured the Vietnam War and Watergate, came the emasculation of the Corvette. The car's basic Corvette engine shrank from 350 to 165 horsepower,'' about ''the same as four-cylinder compact cars today.''
Minivan sales surged in the '80s and '90s as aging baby boomers traded in their sports cars for more family-friendly transportation. Sport utility vehicles grew bigger and brawnier in the early years of the 21st century, when gas was cheap: The gargantuan Ford Excursion, which came out in 2000, Mr. Ingrassia reports, was nearly 19 feet long and weighed in at almost four tons. Only when gas prices lurched up again did Toyota's Prius, ''the first practical mass-market hybrid,'' go from being a chic Hollywood accessory to a more mainstream choice for consumers eager to save money on gas.
Using his nimble narrative gifts, Mr. Ingrassia turns the creation stories behind the Prius and other cars into gripping accounts of how visionary design, corporate competition and inventive engineering combined to produce automobiles that would come to represent an era or a mind-set. As he tells it, the Prius was the result of Toyota management's demanding the creation of a car that could get twice the gas mileage of the company's Corolla and reduce vehicle emissions, a daunting mission that required hundreds of Toyota engineers to work ''insane hours, sometimes nearly around the clock, for four years to develop the car.''
In America, the Prius -- which went on sale on June 30, 2000 -- sold out the first three months of production on the very first day.
The story of how jeeps went from helping the Allies win World War II to being a brand-name favorite of yuppies afflicted with ''wilderness chic'' -- Jeep's Grand Cherokee Orvis Edition featured a ''green and champagne'' interior and Orvis leaping-trout logos on the floor mats -- is equally engaging. And so is the tale of how the unfortunate Chevy Corvair (whose rear-end engine gave it a dangerous penchant for spinning out) helped lift a young lawyer named Ralph Nader to national fame in the mid-1960s as the author of the best-selling book ''Unsafe at Any Speed.''
In doing so, Mr. Ingrassia suggests, with just a little hyperbole, the Corvair came to play almost as important a role in transforming American life as the Model T. The clash between Mr. Nader and General Motors, he argues, ''launched America's litigation society, the vast expansion of government's regulatory apparatus, the discrediting of corporate America in the minds of many people, the waning of engineering innovation at General Motors, and finally Nader's role in tilting the razor-thin 2000 presidential election to George W. Bush.''
It can safely be said, Mr. Ingrassia concludes, ''that the Chevy Corvair's legacy helped make George W. Bush president of the United States.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Imposes Duties on Chinese Wind Tower Makers

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Chinese manufacturers of towers for wind turbines received unfair subsidies and must now pay duties of 13.7 to 26 percent, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday in a preliminary decision in a case brought by four American manufacturers of the towers.
The decision, the third trade case decided this year in favor of American wind and solar manufacturers, will be followed by another in the coming weeks on whether Chinese companies engaged in dumping the towers in the United States at prices below the cost of making them. 
This month, the Commerce Department said China was dumping solar panels in the American market and imposed duties of 31 percent on the imports, adding to earlier duties imposed under a department ruling that China unfairly subsidized its solar manufacturers.
Some trade experts have warned that the series of rulings will increase trade tensions with China, which has already filed its own complaints about subsidies that federal and state governments give to American wind and solar companies.
As a result of the decision announced Wednesday, the Commerce Department said it would tell American customs agents to collect a cash deposit on imported towers equal to the preliminary rates. These duties would be substantial, because the towers can cost $600,000 each.
''These are large subsidy margins, and they likely will have significant impact on the market,'' said Alan H. Price, a lawyer at Wiley Rein, which represented the Wind Tower Trade Coalition, the group of American manufacturers that brought the case.
American imports of Chinese towers reached $222 million last year, according to the Commerce Department. But the size of the American market is not clear for this year and next year, because the main federal subsidy program, the production tax credit, is scheduled to expire and will not apply to any projects entering service after this year. The pending expiration has already suppressed new orders, wind industry executives say.
The Commerce Department's International Trade Administration said that CS Wind and its affiliates will be charged a 13.7 percent duty, and Titan Wind Energy and its affiliates will be charged 26 percent. All other companies will be charged a 19.9 percent duty.
The decision won praise from the United Steelworkers, which filed a broader case in September 2010 in which it accused China of unfairly subsidizing its renewable energy industries.
''We have plate mills that are idle right now as a consequence, so this is a good deal,'' said Gary Hubbard, a spokesman for the union, referring to the wind tower decision. The towers are made by rolling steel plate into tubes, welding the seams and stacking the tubes on top of each other.
A spokesman at the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.
John Breckenridge, an expert in financing renewable energy projects at Good Energies Capital in New York, said that while the wind decision comes after similar rulings on solar equipment imports, the two industries are quite different. In contrast to the huge Chinese presence in the American solar industry, he said, its involvement in wind is still relatively small.
''This does not have a big impact on the business as it is today, but it is clear that the Chinese products have been banging on the door, with significantly lower costs,'' he said. ''It was only a matter of time before that door was going to start to open, and this could slow that down.''
The rulings on solar cells have split the American solar industry, with firms that make the equipment applauding the rulings but ones that sell and install such systems lamenting that higher costs will reduce their sales.
The American wind industry has not taken a position on the wind tower case.
American tower manufacturers have a parallel dumping case pending against Vietnamese tower makers, although they did not accuse the Vietnamese makers of receiving unfair subsidies.

HEADLINE: A College Gap Leaves Some Cities Behind

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
DAYTON, Ohio -- As cities like this one try to reinvent themselves after losing large swaths of their manufacturing sectors, they are discovering that one of the most critical ingredients for a successful transformation -- college graduates -- is in perilously short supply.
Just 24 percent of the adult residents of metropolitan Dayton have four-year degrees, well below the average of 32 percent for American metro areas, and about half the rate of Washington, the country's most educated metro area, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. Like many Rust Belt cities, it is a captive of its rich manufacturing past, when well-paying jobs were plentiful and landing one without a college degree was easy.
Educational attainment lagged as a result, even as it became more critical to success in the national economy. ''We were so wealthy for so long that we got complacent,'' said Jane L. Dockery, associate director of the Center for Urban and Public Affairs at Wright State University here. ''We saw the writing on the wall, but we didn't act.''
Dayton sits on one side of a growing divide among American cities, in which a small number of metro areas vacuum up a large number of college graduates, and the rest struggle to keep those they have. 
The winners are metro areas like Raleigh, N.C., San Francisco and Stamford, Conn., where more than 40 percent of the adult residents have college degrees. The Raleigh area has a booming technology sector and several major research universities; San Francisco has been a magnet for college graduates for decades; and metropolitan Stamford draws highly educated workers from white-collar professions in New York like finance.
Metro areas like Bakersfield, Calif., Lakeland, Fla., and Youngstown, Ohio, where less than a fifth of the adult residents have college degrees, are being left behind. The divide shows signs of widening as college graduates gravitate to places with many other college graduates and the atmosphere that creates.
''This is one of the most important developments in the recent economic history of this country,'' said Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who recently published a book on the topic, ''The New Geography of Jobs.''
The recession amplified the trend. Metro areas where more than one in three adults were college-educated had an average unemployment rate of 7.5 percent earlier this year, compared with 10.5 percent for cities where less than one in six adults had a college degree, according to Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard and the author of ''Triumph of the City.''
Historically, most American cities have had relatively similar shares of college graduates, in part because fewer people went to college. In 1970, the difference between the most educated and least educated cities, in terms of the portion of residents with four-year degrees, was 16 percentage points, and nearly all metro areas were within 5 points of the average. Today the spread is double that, and only half of all metro areas are within 5 points of the average, the Brookings research shows.
''There's a relentless cycle in which knowledge breeds knowledge, but the flip side is that many places are left out,'' said Alan Berube, a senior fellow at Brookings who conducted the analysis using census data from the American Community Survey.
Dayton lost about 1 percent of its college-educated 25- to 34-year-olds between 2000 and 2009 at a time when that group grew by 13 percent nationally, said Joe Cortright, senior policy adviser for CEOs for Cities, an economic development group. In Columbus, Ohio, about 70 miles away, the same group grew by 25 percent.
In a pattern that is part education, part family background, college graduates tend to have longer life expectancies, higher household incomes, lower divorce rates and fewer single-parent families than those with less education, and cities where they cluster tend to exhibit those patterns more strongly. Montgomery County, where Dayton is located, has a premature death rate that is more than double that of Fairfax County, Va., the highly educated Washington suburb, according to Bridget Catlin, a University of Wisconsin researcher.
Now, Dayton is racing to produce, attract and retain college graduates as a badly needed food for its hungry economy. But it is a painstaking process. Kate Geiger, who lost her job at General Motors in 2008, said she would never forget the feeling of sitting in a college classroom for the first time after 24 years on the factory floor.
''I am this 44-year-old, old-school union girl,'' she said, ''and here I am with all these 18-year-old kids who have grown up with computers.''
Retaining graduates is hard when a city has fewer to begin with, because college graduates, like migratory birds, tend to flock to places with many other college graduates. Kelley Shomaker, 23, who graduated from the University of Dayton this year, said she searched for work in Dayton but ultimately received an offer from Rock Hill, S.C., a suburb of Charlotte, N.C. In August, she and two friends will set off for that city to start teaching careers there.
Charlotte, once a city with very little education, now has a population that is more than a third college graduates. Ms. Shomaker estimated that 60 percent of her friends were moving to other cities.
Dayton's past was rich, but by the 2000s the city was in trouble. It lost half of its manufacturing jobs in 12 years, according to Richard Stock, an economist at the University of Dayton. When the city's last Fortune 500 company, National Cash Register, left in 2009, residents were jolted into action.
''Our premise is you have to change people's mind-set,'' said Thomas Lasley, the former dean of education at the University of Dayton, who runs Learn to Earn, the city's effort to increase its share of college graduates. ''We have to go from one where people think of themselves as being in a high-school-attending culture to being in a college-attending culture.''
One effort has shown marked success. The Dayton Early College Academy, which opened in 2003 as a public high school, focuses on preparing low-income students for college. It sends 97 percent of its graduates to college, the vast majority to four-year programs.
One of the graduates, Francei Brown, plans to attend Morehouse College in Atlanta in the fall. His father, who for years cobbled together part-time jobs fixing cars and doing plumbing and roofing, even in the worst weather, was resolute about college for his son.
''He said, 'I want you to have a job where, if it's cold outside, you'll be warm inside,' '' Mr. Brown said.
Dayton has used internships as a glue to keep recent graduates, and the city found through a recent survey that graduates were twice as likely to stay if they had done an internship at a local business. One of them, Richard Kaiser, who graduated from Wright State University, stayed in Dayton because it was cheaper and seemed faster to advance in a career, a choice he does not regret. Friends who moved to Chicago, he said, ''ended up sitting at home and drinking cheap beer and playing video games every night.''
Dayton may be struggling to find a second act, but it has strengths that many industrial cities lack. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is a major employer in the area. Lexis-Nexis, the research company, has a large operation here. And the city has an above average share of people with some college -- those who have a two-year degree or who have taken some classes but have no degree.
Steven Lee Johnson, president of Sinclair Community College here, argues that the paradigm may be changing to one in which students take bundles of courses instead of spending four years on obscure academic topics. The approach has been popular among students here, who tend to have children and busy lives (about a tenth of students at Sinclair are displaced workers).
''There's a concern among employers that a degree is not specific enough,'' he said. ''What will count is competencies -- very concrete things that you have achieved.''
Even so, those with four-year degrees still tend to have the biggest impact on economic development, Mr. Cortright argues.
Ms. Geiger, the former G.M. employee, graduated with an associate degree in graphic design and is now working on a Web site and planning events for a Harley-Davidson shop.
The job does not pay very well, and she compares it to ''new shoes that don't really fit right yet.'' But she loves the freedom of not having to clock in and out. ''It's so strange to find that there is life after G.M.,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Bank Woes In Spain Continue To Deepen

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.; Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid.

 BODY:
LONDON -- As Spain's deepening financial problems make a European bailout a more distinct possibility, a looming question is where the money will come from.
Spain is the euro zone's fourth-largest economy, after Germany, France and Italy, and the cost of a rescue would strain the resources of Europe's new 700 billion euros ($867 billion) bailout fund that is to become available this summer. That would leave little margin for any additional bailouts.
Spanish and European officials hope a bailout will not be needed. But each day, financial turmoil mounts over the government takeover of the giant Spanish mortgage lender Bankia, the flight of money to safer borders and a worsening recession.
Compounding Spain's problems has been an outflow of foreign capital from the country, meaning the Spanish banks in recent months have been the only major buyers of its government bonds needed to finance the nation's budget deficits. With those bonds now plummeting in value, the fate of Spain's banks and government are intertwined in a financial tailspin. 
Because Spain is the euro zone's fourth-largest economy, after Germany, France and Italy, its problems pose a far greater challenge to European policy makers than does Greece, which is much smaller. Hoping to ease the pressure, the European Commission on Wednesday urged Spain to take market-calming measures, and Lael Brainard, an under secretary at the United States Treasury Department, arrived in Madrid for talks with government officials as part of a regional tour. Worries about Spain helped send stock markets down broadly in Europe, with Wall Street retreating in afternoon trading.
In the bond market, the Spanish government's borrowing costs are approaching the symbolically dangerous level of 7 percent on 10-year bonds. The rise has stoked worries that Spain might need bailouts similar in scope -- though many times larger -- than those extended to Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Interest rates in that range had pushed them out of the debt markets that governments rely on to finance their operations.
''At 7 percent, it will be very hard for Spain to obtain funding,'' said Santiago Valverde, an economics professor at the University of Granada and a research consultant for the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago. ''It's not just the government either, but big banks and companies, as well. The markets will close.''
On Wednesday, Spain's economy minister, Luis de Guindos, acknowledged as much when he said interest rates were ''not sustainable in the long term.''
The yield on Spain's 10-year bond rose 0.21 percentage point Wednesday, to 6.61 percent. In Italy -- a country whose debt burden of 120 percent of gross domestic product is much higher than Spain's -- the yield on 10-year bonds rose about 6 percent, hitting a 10-month high.
Since the nationalization of Bankia on May 9 signaled the perilous state of Spain's banking industry, and drew attention to the limited ability of the government to shore up the banks and prevent the flight of capital from the country, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has insisted that Spain will not need a Greek-style bailout.
No head of state would welcome such intervention, because as Athens and Dublin and Lisbon have found, those rescues come with demands for deeper budget cuts and fiscal rigor.
But Mr. Rajoy's administration has been floating the idea of engineering a bailout by other means. These include getting Europe's rescue fund to provide money directly to the country's banks or to buy Spanish government bonds on the open market, without Europe's demanding new levels of scrutiny and tough payback conditions.
Economists estimate that if Spain were forced out of the bond markets by its high borrowing costs and had to rely on funds from Europe and the International Monetary Fund to survive, the cost could reach 500 billion euros over several years.
Europe's new bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, will have about 700 billion euros when it goes into operation this summer. But it remains untested in its ability to work quickly.
At the root of Spain's crisis has been a drastic flight of foreign capital from the country -- one that, paradoxically, has been accentuated by the European Central Bank's program of providing low-cost three-year loans to European banks so that they might buy their governments' bonds.
When the central bank created that program late last year, and dispensed two rounds of loans within a few months, it was credited with having done much to ease Europe's crisis.
In the case of Spain, while the program bought time, it has made the country's underlying problems worse. Spanish banks have by far been the most aggressive participants in the cheap-loan program, having borrowed more than 300 billion euros from the central bank. And much of that money was spent on Spanish government bonds.
In the short term, those bond purchases helped the government by bringing down interest rates -- by reducing Madrid's cost of borrowing. But as a result, Spanish banks now own a larger share, about 67 percent, of their own government's debt than the banks of any other country in the euro zone, according to research by BNP Paribas.
Now the value of those bonds is declining -- prices fall as yields rise -- and further weakening Spanish banks.
In recent months, some of the biggest sellers of those bonds back to Spain's banks have been foreign banks and investors eager to take their money and run. In March, foreign bond investors owned only 26 percent of Spain's bonds, according to a recent analysis by J. P. Morgan, down from about 40 percent a year earlier.
Most analysts say they assume if that measure were made now, the foreign holdings would be even a smaller share of the total.
''There has been a great retreat here, and you can see it in the reduced foreign ownership of Spanish government bonds,'' said John Whittaker, an economist at Lancaster University in Britain who tracks capital flows within the euro zone.
Burdened as they are by problem loans from the collapse of Spain's real estate bubble, banks now have the additional onus of carrying large holdings of government bonds that are losing value by the day. Among the largest holders of Spanish bonds are the country's international banking giants Santander and BBVA, which, through February, owned 60 billion euros and 49 billion euros.
Given those big banks' diverse overseas operations and stronger capital positions, these holdings do not represent an immediate threat. But for Spain's many domestically focused banks, including the bailed-out Bankia, which had 29 billion euros worth of government bonds as of last year, such exposures are more problematic.
It's not just Spain, either.
Italian banks have also been enthusiastic buyers of their government's bonds, and they own 57 percent of bonds outstanding. As in the case of Spain, foreigners have been obliging sellers and have sold 242 billion euros worth of bonds to local banks, bringing their share in Italian bond holdings down to 35 percent as of this March compared with 51 percent late last year.
Just before the restructuring of private-sector Greek debt in March, foreign investors owned 32 percent of the bonds outstanding, a higher proportion than what foreigners now own in Spain.
If Spain does eventually need to seek a European bailout, it might have trouble meeting the various conditions -- most prominent of which would be hitting budget deficit targets.
And on that score the news is not good. Through the first four months of this year, Spain's budget deficit was 26 percent higher than it was a year earlier, because of increased payouts to its debt-plagued regional governments, collapsing tax revenues and the soaring cost of unemployment benefits.
The prospect of Spain's bringing its deficit down from its current level of 8.5 percent, to the 5.3 percent target set for this year by Europe, now seems unlikely.
''We are a highly leveraged nation,'' said Mr. Valverde. ''What we need is a Europe-wide solution.''

HEADLINE: Europe's Economic Troubles Push Investors Toward 10-Year Note

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Unnerved once again by Europe's economic problems, investors rushed to buy United States government securities on Wednesday, sending the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note down to a record low.
Stock prices, meanwhile, fell sharply on Wall Street after a broad sell-off sent Europe's markets down 2 percent or more. Analysts said the Treasury rally, as well as the selling in the European stock markets, was set off by new signs of weaker economic activity on the Continent.
''Almost the total focus on where the flight to quality is coming from is Europe,'' said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company. 
''I did not think we would gain so much momentum over a very obvious issue that has no quick fix to it,'' Mr. Giddis said. ''There is a lot of cash coming in to U.S. Treasuries from everywhere.''
The pressure in equities carried over to Asia in early trading on Thursday.
Japan's Nikkei average slid 2 percent while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan looked set to revisit its 2012 low with a decline of 0.8 percent.
The euro fell in early Thursday trade to a 23-month low of $1.2361 and a 4 1/2 month low against the yen below 97.70, Reuters reported.
''There is no exit in sight currently for the euro to get out of this downtrend because there is no shortage of negative news,'' Hisamitsu Hara, chief FX manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, told Reuters.
The buying spree in the United States sent the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note up 1 6/32, to 101 7/32, while its yield fell to 1.62 percent, from 1.75 percent late Tuesday.
On Wednesday, the European Commission said its indicator of business sentiment fell in May to 90.6 points from April's revised 92.9 because of falling confidence, especially in industry and retail trade. In addition, the latest data from the European Central Bank showed that banks were not lending more, despite its liquidity measures, and that they have reduced their holdings of government bonds.
''Economic weakness in the euro zone is likely over the next year or two with or without the breakup of monetary union,'' said John Higgins of Capital Economics in a research commentary.
Anthony Valeri, an investment strategist for fixed income at LPL Financial, said the latest data pointed to a ''deep contraction'' in the European economy. He also said the growing problems in the Spanish banking industry and the poor results of the latest Italian bond auction also spurred investors to seek a haven for their money.
''All of those conspired to help Treasuries here,'' he said.
Borrowing costs rose in Spain and Italy, but fell in Germany, where the yield on that nation's two-year bond fell close to zero.
As the flight to safety steered money from Europe, the euro fell to an almost two-year low of $1.2368 on Wednesday, from $1.2499 late Tuesday.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 160.83 points, or 1.3 percent, to 12,419.86. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 19.10 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,313.32, while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 33.63 points, 1.2 percent, to 2,837.36.
In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, fell 2 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London fell 1.7 percent. The Madrid benchmark Ibex 35 index fell 2.6 percent. The CAC 40 index in Paris was down 2.2 percent.
The concerns about Europe's economy also weighed on crude oil prices, which fell $2.94, or 3.2 percent, to $87.82 a barrel in late trading in New York.
Energy and financial stocks were among the notable losers on Wednesday. Schlumberger lost 4 percent to $64.18. Exxon was down 2.6 percent to $79.79. Bank of America slid 3 percent to $7.20. Citigroup also slid 3 percent to $26.

HEADLINE: Sex-Harassment Settlement By School District in Dispute

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Last week, officials with the Los Angeles Unified School District announced that they had settled with a senior employee who accused former Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines of sexual harassment. But that settlement appears to be coming undone, and the matter could be on the way to a long legal battle. 
According to the terms of the settlement laid out by officials last week, the school district would pay a lump sum of $200,000 and lifetime health benefits, which they estimated to be valued at $250,000 to $300,000. The employee, Scot Graham, would step down as the director of leasing and asset management, a job he has held since 2000.
But Mr. Graham's lawyers said the district had acted prematurely in announcing the agreement to the news media, because nothing had been signed. They also said the district had violated a confidentiality agreement by announcing Mr. Graham's name and the allegations.
Mr. Graham, 56, accused Mr. Cortines of taking him to his ranch north of Los Angeles in July 2010 and making inappropriate sexual advances.
Mr. Cortines, 79, said in a statement last week that there was no harassment and only consensual and spontaneous ''adult behavior.'' Mr. Cortines was a schools chancellor in New York City and took the reins in Los Angeles, the country's second-largest district, in 2000.
What happens next remains unclear. District officials said they had agreed to a plan that would require Mr. Graham to step down from his $150,000-a-year job by May 31 and since last week have blocked his access to district buildings and e-mail.
District officials said that they were trying to be transparent in announcing the settlement last week. But Mr. Graham's lawyers said that the district would have been obligated to release only Mr. Graham's name, not any of the specific accusations. They also said the district had told them the lifetime benefits were valued at $50,000 more than what was reported in the news media.
''The economic value of the medical benefits were one of the reasons he agreed to a lesser amount than he otherwise would have,'' said Arnold Peter, the lead lawyer for Mr. Graham. ''They acted in bad faith by misrepresenting that and by releasing otherwise private information we had agreed to keep confidential.''
Mr. Peter said they also believed that the timeline of events released by the district was incomplete and unfair. It did not indicate, for example, that Mr. Graham went to the district's chief counsel on three separate occasions to complain of harassment by Mr. Cortines.
Linda Savitt, a lawyer for the district, said that for now the board planned to ''rely on the verbal acceptance of the agreement we reached last week.''
''We're not stepping away from that, and if it unravels, as these things sometime do, we will have to move forward,'' she said. ''The board made this decision to deal with risk management.''
Last week, three of the seven board members of the district voted against the settlement and made it clear they would rather fight the accusations in court than settle.

HEADLINE: Well-Wishers: 'Hello, Mitt. It's Barack.'

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
President Obama telephoned Mitt Romney on Wednesday to congratulate him on securing the Republican presidential nomination, and told Mr. Romney that he looked forward ''to an important and healthy debate about America's future,'' a spokesman for the Obama campaign, Ben LaBolt, said. 
The president, Mr. LaBolt said in a statement, ''wished Governor Romney and his family well throughout the upcoming campaign.'' That may be the gentlest thing Mr. Obama says about Mr. Romney for the foreseeable future, as both candidates settle into a steady streams of attacks on each other in an increasingly rancorous campaign.
Mr. Romney secured the Republican nomination by picking up delegates in the Texas primary on Tuesday evening. Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, marked the milestone by introducing a new line of attack on the president, accusing Mr. Obama's administration of wasting taxpayer dollars on a reckless investment in the alternative-energy company, Solyndra. Mr. Romney's offensive came after Obama advertisements that sought to tie him to job losses engineered by his former firm, Bain Capital.
Mr. Obama, who placed the call at 11:30 a.m., has begun to mention Mr. Romney by name at campaign events, mixing brief praise of him as a family man with sharp criticism of his views on economic issues and the middle class.
''Governor Romney is a patriotic American who has raised a wonderful family,'' the president said during a campaign rally in Ohio last month. But he quickly painted Mr. Romney as an out-of-touch plutocrat who Mr. Obama said lectures hard-working Americans on the need to be more productive.
Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, described the conversation as ''brief but cordial.'' Mr. Romney, he said, thanked the president for his call and ''wished him and his family well.''
''They talked about the fact that a campaign is long,'' Mr. Fehrnstrom added, ''but it's relieving to know it doesn't go on forever and that it will be over in November.''

HEADLINE: The Networks: Obama Video on Fox Is Criticized

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
6:53 p.m. Updated The Fox News Channel came under withering criticism on Wednesday for a four-minute video broadcast on its morning show ''Fox & Friends'' that portrayed President Obama's tenure as a series of failed promises.
The video had most of the hallmarks of a campaign attack ad, except that it was produced and paid for by a news network rather than a candidate or a political action committee. 
A blogger on the conservative Web site Hot Air wrote of the video on Wednesday afternoon, ''It makes a pretty powerful argument against another four years of Barack Obama, but that shouldn't be the job of news-reporting organizations, even when we like the message.''
David Zurawik, a television critic for The Baltimore Sun, wrote, ''Even I am shocked by how blatantly Fox is throwing off any pretense of being a journalistic entity with videos like this.''
''Fox & Friends'' has been described by Fox public relations executives in the past as an entertainment show.
In recent years it has had an obviously conservative tilt, with near-constant criticism of Mr. Obama and other Democrats. It was on ''Fox & Friends'' that Mr. Obama was falsely reported to have attended an Islamic madrasa school while living in Indonesia.
But ''Fox & Friends'' also includes news elements and interviews, and Wednesday's video, titled ''Four Years of Hope and Change,'' was preceded by a graphic that read ''America's Election Headquarters,'' Fox's name for its election news coverage. The video itself showed changes in the debt, the jobless rate, food prices, gas prices and other economic measurements, combined with spliced quotes from Mr. Obama and his critics.
''The Impact of the President's First Term,'' read a graphic on the bottom of the screen after the video. The co-anchors of ''Fox & Friends'' congratulated a producer, Chris White, for compiling the video, which noticeably did not include any positive measurements of Mr. Obama's tenure as president.
The video was broadcast one day after Mitt Romney officially secured the Republican nomination for president, having picked up the necessary number of delegates after a long primary campaign season. Asked whether the Obama campaign viewed the Fox video as a Romney campaign ad in disguise, a spokesman declined to comment.
A spokeswoman for Fox News, which is run by the former Republican strategist Roger Ailes, did not respond to requests for interviews. However, when asked about Mr. Ailes, she said, ''Roger was not aware of the video. ''
The blog TVNewser quoted a statement it said was from Bill Shine, the executive vice president of programming for Fox News: ''The package that aired on 'Fox & Friends' was created by an associate producer and was not authorized at the senior executive level of the network. This has been addressed with the show's producers.''
In past interviews, current and former Fox employees have described Mr. Ailes as keenly interested in the content of ''Fox & Friends,'' which has an agenda-setting function since it starts off the network's day of programming. The people said Mr. Ailes regularly contributed talking points and phoned in ideas for the show, sometimes when it was on the air between 6 and 9 a.m. on weekdays.
The people spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of what they called possible retaliation by the network. Fox executives have publicly ridiculed employees in the past.
Versions of the video were taken off of the network's Web sites Wednesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, The Fox Nation, a conservative arm of FoxNews.com, promoted it as a ''must-see Fox video,'' though now that URL leads to a dead link. Though Fox pulled the video, copies remained on YouTube and other sites.
Media Matters for America, a liberal nonprofit group that monitors Fox programming and mounts anti-Fox campaigns, asserted that the video may have violated one of the policies of the network's parent company, News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch.
The policy in question states that ''we do not donate any corporate money, services, products or facilities to any political party, candidate or political committee'' unless approved by the company's government relations office.
''The ad presented on 'Fox & Friends' was virtually indistinguishable from the sort of campaign videos regularly produced by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign, the Republican National Committee or Fox News analyst Karl Rove's American Crossroads,'' Media Matters stated. ''Those videos at least provide a disclaimer noting their affiliation with a campaign or other sort of political committee.''
The Fox video started with a graphic that read, ''Fox & Friends Presents.''

HEADLINE: Markets And Morals

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Does it bother you that an online casino paid a Utah woman, Kari Smith, who needed money for her son's education, $10,000 to tattoo its Web site on her forehead?
Or that Project Prevention, a charity, pays women with drug or alcohol addictions $300 cash to get sterilized or undertake long-term contraception? Some 4,100 women have accepted this offer.
Michael Sandel, the Harvard political theorist, cites those examples in ''What Money Can't Buy,'' his important and thoughtful new book. He argues that in recent years we have been slipping without much reflection into relying upon markets in ways that undermine the fairness of our society. 
That's one of the underlying battles this campaign year. Many Republicans, Mitt Romney included, have a deep faith in the ability of laissez-faire markets to create optimal solutions.
There's something to that faith because markets, indeed, tend to be efficient. Pollution taxes are widely accepted as often preferable than rigid regulations on pollutants. It may also make sense to sell advertising on the sides of public buses, perhaps even to sell naming rights to subway stations.
Still, how far do we want to go down this path?
Is it right that prisoners in Santa Ana, Calif., can pay $90 per night for an upgrade to a cleaner, nicer jail cell?
Should the United States really sell immigration visas? A $500,000 investment will buy foreigners the right to immigrate.
Should Massachusetts have gone ahead with a proposal to sell naming rights to its state parks? The Boston Globe wondered in 2003 whether Walden Pond might become Wal-Mart Pond.
Should strapped towns accept virtually free police cars that come laden with advertising on the sides? Such a deal was negotiated and then ultimately collapsed, but at least one town does sell advertising on its police cars.
''The marketization of everything means that people of affluence and people of modest means lead increasingly separate lives,'' Sandel writes. ''We live and work and shop and play in different places. Our children go to different schools. You might call it the skyboxification of American life. It's not good for democracy, nor is it a satisfying way to live.''
''Do we want a society where everything is up for sale? Or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy?''
This issue goes to the heart of fairness in our country. There has been much discussion recently about economic inequality, but almost no conversation about the way the spread of markets nurtures a broader, systemic inequality.
We do, of course, place some boundaries on markets. I can't buy the right to cut off your leg for my amusement. Americans can sell blood, but (perhaps mistakenly) we don't allow markets for kidneys and other organs, even though that would probably save lives.
Wealthy people can, in effect, buy access to the president at a $40,000-a-plate dinner, but they can't purchase a Medal of Freedom. A major political donor can sometimes buy an ambassadorship, but not to an important country.
Where to draw the lines limiting the role of markets isn't clear to me, but I'm pretty sure that we've already gone too far. I'm offended when governments auction naming rights to public property or sell special access, even if only to fast lanes on a highway or better cells in a jail. It is one thing for Delta Air Lines to have first class and coach. It is quite another for government to offer first class and coach in the essential services that government provides.
Where would this stop? Do we let people pay to get premium police and fire protection? Do we pursue an idea raised by Judge Richard Posner to auction off the right to adopt children?
We already have tremendous inequality in our country: The richest 1 percent of Americans own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent, according to the Economic Policy Institute. But we do still have a measure of equality before the law -- equality in our basic dignity -- and that should be priceless.
''Market fundamentalism,'' to use the term popularized by George Soros, is gaining ground. It's related to the glorification of wealth over the last couple of decades, to the celebration of opulence, and to the emergence of a new aristocracy. Market fundamentalists assume a measure of social Darwinism and accept that laissez-faire is always optimal.
That's the dogma that helped lead to bank deregulation and the current economic mess. And anyone who honestly believes that low taxes and unfettered free markets are always best should consider moving to Pakistan's tribal areas. They are a triumph of limited government, negligible taxes, no ''burdensome regulation'' and free markets for everything from drugs to AK-47s.
If you're infatuated with unfettered free markets, just visit Waziristan.

HEADLINE: In Thailand, Burmese Workers Call Out to 'Mother Suu'

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
MAHACHAI, Thailand -- When word got out that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the long-imprisoned democracy campaigner, would visit this gritty town on the Gulf of Thailand, the mood became electric in the massive fish and shrimp processing plants where some Burmese eke out a living and where she is a heroine to many.
For Wai Wai Khaing, who has spent the past 12 years working long hours gutting fish, the news was almost too much to handle. ''I cried at work, and then I cried at home,'' she said. ''I cried when I made rice. I cried when I washed clothes. Tears came every time I thought about her coming.'' 
Wednesday was Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's first full day outside Myanmar in 24 years, and for a woman who has sacrificed her family life to bring democracy to her people, it seemed fitting that she began the day among the downtrodden.
Her visit to this obscure corner of Thailand offered an escape from the drudgery of long days of repetitive work and from stingy bosses.
Many of the workers, here only to escape the economic dysfunction of their own country, repeated a word used so often in the context of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's years of campaigning for democracy: hope.
If her mission was to lift their spirits, it seems to have succeeded.
''Being here is the best thing that has ever happened to me in my life -- including passing my exams in school,'' said Pyae Sone Nyein, a 23-year-old woman who works in the family business, importing squid from Myanmar. ''I never dreamed I would see Mother Suu.''
Unbothered by the searing sun, the crowd welcomed her with loud cheers, chants and song. Some carried bouquets; others clutched single roses. Some carried signs that said, ''We want to be cradled in your arms, Mother Suu.''
''There is no need to feel sad or depressed living in a country that is not yours,'' she told the crowd from a third-floor balcony of a building above the crowded streets.
More than two million Burmese workers are estimated to live in Thailand, and many occupy the bottom rungs of society.
In Mahachai, workers gut fish and peel shrimp for 300 baht, or about $10, a day. Much of the nearly 580 tons of shrimp exported from Thailand every day passes through their hands and ends up in supermarkets in the United States, Europe and Japan.
Workers live in mold-stained tenements, and the smell of fish wafts through the town with every breeze.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi told the crowd that one day their status would be raised, that their country would rejoin the ranks of Asia's up-and-coming economies.
''History is fluid, and it is always changing,'' she said. ''Please believe that as our country's situation gets better and develops more, our value as workers will increase, and people's perspectives on us will also change for the better.''
She advised the crowd to know their rights and encouraged them to speak out about abuses.
''I would like to let you know that you are not forgotten,'' she said.
The words resonated with women like Ms. Wai Wai Khaing, whose hands were shaking when she talked about her life in the cannery. ''I'm very angry about how we are being treated,'' she said. ''I hope Daw Suu can help address this.''
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi arrived in Thailand on Tuesday night, her first foreign trip since beginning her campaign against military rule in Myanmar in 1988. Her trip to Thailand, hastily planned, includes attending a conference sponsored by the World Economic Forum and a trip to a refugee camp along the border with Myanmar.
She will return on Sunday to Myanmar, where she was recently elected a member of Parliament, a new phase after her long years under house arrest under the former military junta.
Ms. Wai Wai Khaing and her colleagues have cellphones, e-mail accounts and the other trappings of modern communication. But when the first rumors surfaced this week that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi might visit, word spread quickest the old-fashioned way: by word of mouth.
Suwannee Rujanisarakul, a Thai marketing manager for King Fisher, a company with three factories and 5,000 workers here, said her Burmese employees had breathlessly asked for Wednesday off.
''I asked them why,'' she recounted. ''They said, 'My mother is coming from Burma! My mother is Aung San Suu Kyi!' ''
Burmese workers in the factory have been captivated by the changes in Myanmar in recent months, Ms. Suwannee said.
When Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was elected to Parliament in April, workers rejoiced.
''All the migrant workers here were so excited,'' she said. ''They told me, 'Now we've got democracy.' ''
Workers at the King Fisher factory peel shrimp in vast quantities. Depending on the size of the shrimp, each worker goes through about 11 to 33 pounds an hour.
Those who do the work regularly are often injured on the job.
''May you prosper with health, wealth and be free from danger,'' Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said before leaving Wednesday. ''And may you be able to come home soon.''

HEADLINE: A Big Dig Close to Nature and Home

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: Does man possess nature or does nature possess man? Jonathan Blaustein's photo series "Mine" ponders questions of ownership, the natural world and humankind's place in it. 

 BODY:
Jonathan Blaustein has a lot of rocks. He has probably more rocks than any single man could ever need.
The deeper he digs on a three-and-a-half acre site in New Mexico's Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the more rocks he finds. He also has leaves, grass, six fruit trees, the occasional animal remains and - in winter - snow. But mostly he has rocks. He doesn't have to travel far for his digs: it's all in his backyard.
It was not always this way.
Mr. Blaustein was living in Brooklyn eight years ago, "like everybody else." He and his wife, Jessie Kaufman, were searching for a place where they could afford to live on the meager salaries of an artist and a social worker. They settled near Taos, N.M., on land where his wife grew up. They designed and built a modern, eco-efficent, high-tech house, 7,000 feet above sea level. Outside their front window, they can see an extinct volcano that is millions of years old.
"I live in a place where the scale of geological time is self-evident," Mr. Blaustein said. "In New York, the sky-scape reinforces the power of humanity. The wild, mostly untamed, raw desert mountain-scape reinforces the insignificance of humanity."
Living in the midst of nature caused Mr. Blaustein to think about his use of natural resources and private property. He pondered what it meant to own land. Through all four seasons last year, he "mined" his land, gathering and examining the resources that belonged to him and his wife.
"In economics, you try to maximize the value of your existing resources," he said. "I thought, 'How can I turn it into art? How can I commodify it?' "
Mr. Blaustein brought his finds - the rocks, grass, leaves and snow - inside his studio to photograph them outside their natural context. He made aesthetically pleasing arrangements and imposed himself on them by drawing and carving. The results, collected in a project entitled "Mine," are primal and almost totemic.
In the first exhibit of the work, at the New Mexico Arts Centennial Project Space through July 6, some of the items are on view next to the photographs.
"It's unquestionably photography, but it's not only photography" Mr. Blaustein said. "It's art that utilizes the camera, that utilizes powers of observation and that investigates time."
Though Mr. Blaustein's three and a half acres come with beautiful vistas, he found that sometimes a certain amount of nature's "raw unpleasantness" is unavoidable.
"I killed an entire mouse family that was living in the trunk of my car and chewing the seat belts," Mr. Blaustein said. "I tried to get them out with mothballs and peppermint oil and spraying Tabasco sauce on my engine block, but none of it worked."
He reluctantly dispatched them with a large rock and felt compelled to make productive use of their death by photographing one of the mice. Parts of a deer that had been killed near a stream by coyotes or dogs later joined the mouse in the project.
For Mr. Blaustein, they are a reminder of the uneasy relationship that mankind has to nature. Whether we like it or not.

HEADLINE: The South's Gunboat War

BYLINE: JOHN GRADY


HIGHLIGHT: The fight over how to run the Confederate Navy was as much about personalities as it was about policy. 

 BODY:
When Matthew Fontaine Maury, one of America's most famous scientists but a naval officer of middling rank, accepted the position as head of the Confederacy's coastal defense in 1861, he did so knowing that storms were ahead - of the political variety. His new post meant he would be reporting to two men with whom he had butted heads in pre-secession days: Stephen Mallory, secretary of the Confederate Navy, and Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy's new president. 
The three had been engaged in nasty, often personal political warfare since the 1850s, when the Floridian Mallory chaired the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, the Mississippian Davis served as secretary of war and senator, and the Virginian Maury supervised the National Observatory. Those acrimonious personal relationships, which were of minor consequence in Washington, now promised to define, and potentially derail, the Confederacy's naval and coastal-defense strategies.
As president of the Confederacy, the West Point-educated Davis had little use for a navy; his interests ended with privateers and letters of marque. Mallory had a different vision: he saw his nascent navy as someday constituting a fleet of commerce raiders, iron-sheathed floating fortresses and ocean-going ironclads to smash the blockade and terrorize Northern ports - what today we would call a "blue-water" navy.
Then there was Maury. From the day he reported to Virginia Governor John Letcher shortly after Virginia seceded, the pudgy, badly limping, balding man pushed a strong line on internal defense, particularly of the harbors, rivers and inlets that girded and suffused Confederate territory - what strategists would later call a "brown-water" or "green-water" navy. Maury's position was hardly surprising: internal defense was an area he had given much thought to and testimony about over the previous decade. 
Maury's strategy was composed of in three layers: mines (called torpedoes at the time) and other obstructions to secure ports and waterways; well-placed coastal artillery, but not heavy fortifications; and fast, maneuverable gunboats to sting invaders. Upon arriving in his new post, he immediately began putting it in place, starting by re-positioning the big guns seized at Virginia's Gosport Shipyard (later renamed the Norfolk Naval Shipyard) - a move that Mallory approved, along with inexpensive mines deployed in nearby waters. 
The gunboats, however, were another matter. They cost real money, money that Mallory believed better spent on raiders, like the Florida, and iron plating for the captured Merrimack, which was soon rechristened as the Confederacy's first ironclad, the Virginia. As for Davis, his spending priority was always the armies in Virginia, Tennessee and along the Mississippi. If the money had to come from "his" navy, so be it. Gunboats, Davis said, were off the table.
The tension between Mallory and Davis, both from Deep South cotton states, and men like Letcher and Maury, from the Upper South state of Virginia, was more than personal. It embodied a fundamental problem at the heart of the Confederacy, namely the relationships among the states and the relationship between the states and the central government. 
In late May, 1861, and at Virginia's invitation, Davis arrived in Richmond to make it the Confederacy's capital. Over the next few weeks, on trains, in canal boats, in stage coaches and on horseback, members of his cabinet and the Confederate Congress trickled into the city, welcomed by the governor and the leaders of the secession convention. But the bonhomie did not last long. Virginia controlled the enormous armory at Harper's Ferry, which the central government demanded it hand over. Nor did Virginians take to the Confederate plan to
revert to the old ranks of the United States Army and Navy, which they saw as a step away from Southern independence. 
Neither side thought much of the other. In his diary, Mallory wrote: "From all I can learn here, Gov. Letcher's conduct must be the result of lack of judgment. It is indefensible - a traitor or a fool might equally act as he does and he is not a traitor." Nor did Virginia's leaders hold much respect for the new leaders in Richmond. As the events of early summer 1861 unfolded, a bitter Maury said, the Confederate government was riddled with "small men." He wrote in his diary: "You may rely upon it, the Confederate States Government has come here feeling that there is between it and us something of an antagonism." He was right, and it exploded first over Maury's and the state's insistence on building gunboats to defend its waterways.
While Mallory thought "small," in Maury's words, about coastal defense, the coastal-defense commander dreamed large. Maury did not want a ship "stout enough to keep the sea." Instead, he envisioned "steam launches each capable of carrying two rifled pivot guns and no more. Their structure should be simple and plain and as economical as possible. They should be literally nothing but floating gun carriages," with crews of 40 and no accommodations. It was a take-off on his 1851 proposal to build 25 "smart, active steamers," a patrolling "coast guard" to defend the Eastern Seaboard. 
Through his "big gun and little ship" plan, the commander wanted to turn the ships loose in the Chesapeake Bay's shallow waters and North Carolina's tidal rivers and sounds. Shipwrights in the bay counties would be the primary builders, and they could do the work, along with soldier-artisans about to go into winter quarters. 
"Going out like a nest of hornets," he wrote, "they will especially, if the building and the fitting out be kept from the enemy, either sink, capture or drive away from the Chesapeake and its tributaries the whole fleet which the enemy now has or probably will in that time in these waters." Once that was done, the "nest of hornets" could close off maritime traffic through the Virginia capes, starve out Fortress Monroe and threaten Washington.
To prepare the way for his gunboats, Maury, writing as "Ben Bow," used the influential Richmond Enquirer to blast the administration's moves to date as "mere makeshifts" when it came to coastal defense.
Mallory retaliated by ordering Maury to travel to Cuba to buy weapons, a trip that would take him out of the loop for weeks, if not months. But Maury's political patron, the former president John Tyler, and Charles M. Conrad, his ally in the Confederate Congress and the chair of the House Naval Affairs Committee (and a former United States secretary of war), declared the commander was too valuable to send out of the country. Mallory backed down - for now. 
Maury next turned to Letcher and his allies in the Virginia Convention. In the wake of the latest debacle on the Carolina coast at Port Royal, in which the Union captured a huge swath of territory with little opposition, he lobbied even more strenuously for his gunboats. Eventually the Confederate House and Senate approved $2 million to build 100 vessels. On Christmas Eve, Davis signed the bill putting Maury in charge of building the gunboat fleet. 
Like the money set aside to rebuild the Merrimack and the hundreds of thousands more to build floating fortresses to defend New Orleans, this was a high-stakes roll of the dice. Everything went well at first. Tyler happily reported that Maury had "woven a proud chaplet around her brow by having won a name all over the world which reflects new luster on the name of Virginia" by advocating the state's strong defense. 
But when members of the Virginia Convention approached Mallory about progress on the gunboats, the secretary reported that his agents were scouring the countryside for engines. By the start of 1862, supplies, especially boilers and the heavy oak for the hulls, proved difficult to come by. And fears of new Union attacks in Virginia led to the rejection of Maury's idea to free soldiers with carpentry skills from Army duties in the winter. 
Despite these setbacks, construction began on the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers, and also along the Rappahannock and at Gosport. Talbott & Brothers, a large Richmond foundry, delivered five double engines in February 1862. During this period, Maury advertised for "negro laborers to cut timber for the vessels." 
But Maury's project soon ran into even bigger problems. The battle between the Virginia (nee Merrimack) and the Monitor in March 1862 led the Confederate Congress to demand heavier ironclads for harbor defense and oceangoing ironclads like Britain's Warrior and France's Glorie. Wooden gunboats were useless in the face of the Monitor's firepower. 
The most pressing issue, though, was the Union's Peninsula Campaign, which had landed unmolested at Fortress Monroe in the spring of 1862 and marched haltingly but steadily toward Richmond. In late May the Union captured Norfolk, and the Virginia, docked nearby and unable to escape, was scuttled. Mallory's ironclad strategy was in shambles.
Maury, sensing an opening, pushed hard for more gunboats, especially if coupled with mines attached to long spars at the boats' bow. And he pushed the other planks in his strategy, particularly the use of electrically detonated mines. But the Union soon turned on Maury, too. As the Army marched north, it set fire to Maury's small "gunboat shipyards" along the way; of the 15 vessels under construction, no more than two escaped. 
After the Union march on Richmond was thwarted in July, Davis and Mallory deemed Maury's gunboats irrelevant. The money was needed elsewhere. What use to them was Maury in Richmond? They correctly gauged that support for the gunboats inside the uniformed Navy was waning. Maury, sensing the inevitable, reported that his project was dead and asked Mallory for a new assignment. "He thought I would be of use doing nothing," Maury reported. Instead he was ordered to Britain to acquire ships for the Confederacy, where he whiled away the rest of the war. 
The "gunboat war" was over, with no clear-cut winners, only burned hulls, sunken ironclads, two of the South's largest ports and its largest shipyard in enemy hands - and a depleted Confederate Treasury.

HEADLINE: Theater Talkback: Up Close, Feeling Very Personal

BYLINE: BEN BRANTLEY


HIGHLIGHT: What better art than the theater, by its nature a collective experience, to consider the overlap between the individual and communal? 

 BODY:
Since the subject under discussion today is a particularly sensitive and frightening one for some of you, I would like to make a few things clear right away. In none of the incidents described below was I ever clutched, stroked, groped or otherwise physically assaulted. Nor was I dragged onto a stage and forced to engage in unseemly activities with professional exhibitionists.
Yes, I am talking about (cue ominous organ chord, please) audience participation at the theater. But not in the way you have come to expect and quite possibly loathe. The productions I have in mind, both of which opened recently, do not single out theatergoers and place them under a spotlight. Yet watching them, I found it impossible to avoid the feeling that I - and everyone seated around me - was directly implicated in and possibly even responsible for what was happening onstage.
The shows are Athol Fugard's three-character drama "My Children! My Africa!," at the Signature Center, and Mike Bartlett's four-person comedy with an unprintable four-letter title, at the Duke Theater. At first glance, these plays don't seem to have much in common, aside from their small casts of characters. "My Children" is about South Africa in the last years of apartheid; Mr. Bartlett's work, hitherto to be referred to as "Cockfight Play," is about an internecine romantic triangle. In other words, one is political and the other personal.
Still, as most of us learn when we move toward that shifting and elusive state called adulthood, the political and the personal can never be unequivocally separated. Human beings don't conduct their lives in separate sealed compartments, try though they might. And what better art than the theater, by its nature a collective experience, to consider the overlap between what is individual and what is communal? 
In both "My Children," directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and "Cockfight Play," directed by James Macdonald, our awareness of that intersection is achieved subtly. Both productions are testaments to the theory that in seducing an audience by stealth, size definitely matters. So does shape. The Duke and the Romulus Linney Courtyard Theater are small spaces to begin with, and the ways in which their seats have been reconfigured make them feel even more intimate.
For "Cockfight Play," which is designed by Miriam Buether, the Duke has been turned into a stark forum that brings to mind a luxury-free miniature of a Roman coliseum. Wooden benches rise in a circle around the naked stage, which itself brings to mind an arena for one-on-one combat. The association turns out to be most appropriate, since "Cockfight" portrays a battle for the body and soul of one indecisive young man, John (Cory Michael Smith).
The combatants, as it happens, are of different sexes: the man is called simply M (Jason Butler Harner), John's existing romantic partner, and W (Amanda Quaid), with whom John has begun affair. The fourth character, F (Cotter Smith), is M's father, enlisted for moral support in a fraught dinner party scene. While sex plays a large part in "Cockfight," which also features the occasional minor act of violence, there is almost no physical contact among the actors.
Sexual encounters are described as they're happening, quite vividly, but the cast members all keep their clothes on. This has the unexpected effect of drawing us more completely into the onstage encounters. Simulated sex, with nudity, is likely to create a self-contained reality from which we keep our distance (unless we're talking about an experimental troupe like the Living Theater, in the anything-goes 1960s). With "Cockfight," the eroticism is at once abstract and immediate, and we don't feel obligated to look away, or embarrassed if we don't. We remain part of the, uh, conversation.
Did I mention that while this is happening the lights have never entirely gone down on the audience? So you can't really look at the actors without seeing the observers seated behind them. And their (and, oh yes, your) responses inevitably filter into the onstage discussion of the nature and fluidity of sexual identity.
You're more aware than usual of when certain lines strike home with the audience, and you may find yourself wondering about the personal history of everyone watching the play. I couldn't help noticing that a man directly across from me in the third row was in tears at the end of "Cockfight." And I didn't look away from him any more than I had from the sex scenes. His response seemed to feed and layer the implicit debate in the script.
The debate that begins "My Children! My Africa!" is explicit. Two high school students, a black boy and a white girl, are facing off in a formal, adjudicated argument about the role of women in South African society. The audience is seated in tiers around three-quarters of the stage. And the two students - Isabel (Allie Gallerani) and Thami (Stephen Tyrone Williams) - address their statements directly and successively to each part of the audience. A teacher known as Mr. M (James A. Williams) presides behind a desk, and reminds us, as if we were his students, to listen closely and to behave.
Isabel, it emerges, is a visitor from a private school to the township institution where Thami is a star student and Mr. M a strict but beloved instructor. And though you'd think a mixed-race debate in a country under apartheid would be angry, this one is characterized by high spirits that feel only friendly. We understand when Mr. M later tells us how much hope this encounter has given him; we've been infected by the same optimistic energy.
When that hopeful glow starts to fade, eclipsed by a murky confusion and rancor, we feel almost as betrayed by the change as Mr. M does. Mr. Fugard rings variations on the debate structure with which he begins the play, by letting each character talk to us in monologues. But these people aren't preaching with the conviction they brought to that classroom exercise. The reality they share is too complicated for unconditional beliefs.
As we listen to them, we become aware, by degrees, of how confining the space we're in is. Neil Patel's set includes metal fencing and barbed wire that extends into and frames the seated area. South Africa is a prison for Mr. Fugard's characters, and we grow to share that sense of confinement.
I should add that the actors in "Cockfight" and "My Children" are all excellent. If they weren't, the experience of the productions would be far less involving. But when performances are as on target as these, a small space allows us to enter more completely into a dramatist's reality, and to feel as if we're truly part of the play. Of course in a sense, we always are whenever we visit the theater. Like it or not, to be part of an audience is automatically to be a participant; it's in the unwritten but inescapable contract between us and any play. Intimate and intense productions like these remind us, in ways both exciting and discomfiting, of that beautiful cardinal truth of theatergoing.
What are your experiences of intimacy in theatergoing? When you have most felt a part of the action onstage?

HEADLINE: An Afghan's Three-Generation Quest for Peace

BYLINE: ADAM KLEIN


HIGHLIGHT: In one Afghan's family history, a tale of the shadowy world of American power players and Afghan dissidents--of policy-makers, shape-shifters, early war profiteers claiming to work on behalf of Afghan victims. 

 BODY:
Two years ago, I began working with Afghan writers in workshops, introducing them to short narratives from around the world, frequently from postwar writers. Most of my students weren't raised reading stories in English, and very few had ever sat down to write their own in a second or third language. Unlike an American workshop, it was rare to find an Afghan who felt their story warranted such attention, theirs or mine, or who wanted their work to ever appear in print.
Through a process of close conferencing, the stories developed, as did trust, and eventually a desire to see their work published - preferably outside Afghanistan, where candor is still risky. At the same time, I asked students to bring me pictures or documents, imagining that I might help start an image archive - something online that could one day be used for research and couldn't be destroyed by the Taliban or others who find photography incongruous with Islam.
Few students brought photographs or letters, stating that their provinces were too dangerous to return to, or that no such documents or letters survived the war, the Taliban, or their sometimes dramatic, overland escapes from the country.
Though my intention was to help create a book of their stories, in their words, I had one student who brought in a trove of images, letters, and most surprisingly, pictures of Muhammad Ali with his father, as well as New York protest permits. I was hooked. Kakail Nuristani began to relay his father's story to me. Over time, I realized that this was more than a story of Kakail's father's optimistic, driven youthfulness and sense of destiny. Rather, it unearthed the murky world of American power players and Afghan dissidents on the other side of the world -- the side of policy-makers, shape-shifters, early war profiteers claiming to work on behalf of Afghan victims. Kakail's story is one of destiny forestalled for three generations. He asked me to help him put this together, sensing there was a national narrative here. When we'd finally finished it, the images laid before us, I saw it starkly. Power is only as good as those who gain access to it. The rest is fallout.
A Forefather Who Ran With Kings
My grandfather's aunt was taken forcibly from Nuristan to be either a wife or courtesan of the Emir Abdur Rahman Khan sometime in the 1880s, and to live in the king's court. As far as I know, this may be the same presidential palace occupied by Hamid Karzai today. Nuristan is a remote region, high in the northeast mountains of Afghanistan; little is known of it, but it was the first region to oust the Russians and the last to convert to Islam within Afghanistan.
My grandfather was able to live under his aunt's supervision, and did have some access to the palace. That's how he formed his early friendship with Mohammed Nadir Shah, father to King Mohammed Zahir Shah, the last king of Afghanistan, who reigned from 1933-1973 before he was ousted in a coup. My grandfather would go on to serve as King Shah's treasurer.
After Abdur Rahman Khan had settled with the British on the Durand Line, the demarcation between India and Afghanistan, my grandfather went to British India for studies and fell in love with a viceroy's wife, whose face he had tattooed on his arm. When he returned to Nuristan, a group of mullahs saw the tattoo and insisted he was an infidel and could no longer pray in the mosque. In response, he informed them that if he were an infidel for having the face of a woman on his arm, they too, were infidels for trading in cash imprinted with the faces of world leaders. This left them speechless. He was left alone after that. In later years, perhaps due to my grandfather's deft diplomatic skills, he became the first elected provincial parliament member under Zahir Shah. The following muslin voting record shows the fingerprints of those villagers who nominated him and provides some idea of the fragility of such democratic processes that held these communities together.
Lennart Edelberg led a Danish expedition in the 1960s to Afghanistan. He wrote a book on Nuristani architecture that was greatly informed by my grandfather. Later, His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark, accompanied by the royal family of Afghanistan, visited my grandfather's simple home - wood-beamed and blackened with cooking smoke. It was common for the aristocracy to go on hunting expeditions in Nuristan. The following photograph shows my grandfather inaugurating the Nuristan Collection at the Moesgaard Museum, in Aarhus, Denmark. Their museum appears to still have holdings on the music of the region, identified as: "Documentation of an eradicated culture."
With these loose associations connecting my family to the royal families in Denmark and Afghanistan, we lived with a certain prestige. In 1965, the Danish aristocracy even knighted my grandfather.
However, Nuristan being what it was - a fourteen-day walk to Kabul (legend has it that my grandfather made this walk many times), was probably still a place where one's political efficacy was not as great as people imagined. Superstitions surrounded my grandfather as though he himself had great power merely through contact with others who possessed it. They imagined him able to eradicate impoverishment, remoteness, and backwardness. My grandfather continued to live humbly among them in the village. Nothing much changed; it was only the expectation of his eventual influence that differentiated him from them.
A Father Who Fought for Afghanistan's Freedom
On Sept. 11, 1948, my father, Khalilullah Nuristani, was born under the same burden of greatness. In retrospect, he must have believed that he could fulfill what had been his father's unfulfilled destiny. My father became a tireless fighter for a free Afghanistan. In looking at the documents he left behind, I am also inclined to believe that he was nostalgic for an Afghanistan that at one point was considered a mini-Paris for visiting Pakistanis, Indians, even those few movie crews, academics, and shaggy hippies who went so far, and into such remote corners of the country, that my father had, on a number of occasions, put them up. He was assured of its promise as a location that would attract world travelers, welcome and impress them.
Because of my father's involvement in Sardar Mohammad Daoud Khan's government, he had to flee the Russians. His first exile was in Germany where he was encouraged to seek political asylum in the United States, as the cold war was in full swing and European interest in Afghanistan was specific to those countries under Soviet occupation. The United States' response to the Russians was broader, ideological. My father was granted asylum in 1979 with the help of Columbia University professor John Monday and his wife, as well as the anthropology professor Charles Lindholm and his wife, Janice Gardener, who hosted him. He immediately went to work on behalf of the Nuristani resistance, lobbying Congress and writing directly to Senator Jacob K. Javits in 1979, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy in 1980.
Despite the sympathetic letters he received in response to the escalation of aggression by the Russians in Afghanistan, my father felt it necessary to take his protest to the streets, and specifically to the United Nations.
A lone agitator at that time, my father left behind his protest permits from 1979 (probably impossible to get now after the Occupy Wall Street movement) and a couple of photographs in which it appears he is never surrounded by more than twenty-five sympathizers, including Lithuanians and Latvians, and perhaps some people just attracted to a crowd. It is rumored that Zalmay Khalilzad attended these protests, but I am unable to identify him in these pictures. I only know that Zalmay Khalilzad's access to the halls of American power would have him eventually working directly under George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. He was instrumental in Iraq and Afghanistan policy, which, 14 years after my father's early pleas for support, morphed into something much more sinister than my father's initial idealism would have ever allowed.
Interestingly, before Charlie Wilson's war, my father finally found a sole supporter, spiritually and economically, in Muhammad Ali. It is still a mystery to me how they met, but I remember my father claiming he had visited him and his daughter, Laila, and that he played with her as an infant. While Wilson was channeling cash to the "refugees" of Afghanistan, my father was warning Muhammad Ali through the Afghan Association of Freedom Fighters U.S.A. to oversee where funds were directed, which he clearly believed to be misappropriated and diverted for the personal interests of American Afghans and the militant fighters whom he later strongly opposed and fought against in the mid-1980s.
My father returned to Nuristan prematurely after receiving news that his entire family had been wiped out in a Russian strafe bombing. This misinformation had been delivered to him by Sam Sloan, also known as Haji Mohammed Ismail Sloan, a candidate to become the 2012 presidential nominee for the Libertarian Party, stock trader, successful litigant in a Supreme Court case involving penny stocks, chess journalist and author of "How To take Over an American Public Company" as well as the author of the introduction of Bobby Fischer's only book - euphemistically, a man with a long past.
Upon return, my father realized he had lost two daughters. The rest of his family was safe. But he was dejected, broken, having marshaled so much energy toward the struggles of Afghanistan, and in particular, the needs of Nuristan, only to find a Congress insulated by lobbyists, and a group of competing militias attempting to pick the pockets of the United States on behalf of refugees. He had put his faith in people like Mr. Sloan -- minor players on the criminal outskirts of power, and iconic, sometimes well-intentioned figures such as Muhammad Ali, whose money was probably the first to support the mujahedeen, but the wrong arm of it. Not only this, but internecine warfare - based on water, land, and old resentments between Nuristani tribes -- eventually wiped out the village of Kushtooz; its residents now populate other areas of the province, but our family home is gone. None of the supposed benefits of "freedom" or "resistance" changed the precariousness of life in Nuristan.
My father's last letter, thanking those academics that supported him, is also a prescient reminder of the situation that dogs Afghan and American relations today. It is not that one party lacks the vision, hope or capacity to change the situation in the country, but the intractable nature of corruption that makes any single man's contribution, and perhaps any nation's, inevitably doomed. My father wrote in 1980:
And so now I see the American press and television praising Afghanistan, and laughing at the Russian defeats.
But praising Afghan freedom fighters and marveling at their courage is not helpful. I have been very disappointed in my work here. The press and the public do not seem to understand that the fight in Afghanistan is a fight which vitally effects the welfare of the whole free world. [ ] I oppose elite interests, and so have been unable to make use of connections in Washington and elsewhere which the elite, with their money and Western educations, have been able to utilize. [ ] American disinterest, my own lack of funds, my lack of knowledge of English, my isolation from the American power structure; all these difficulties force me, with regret, to leave New York for the time being. [ ] For my thousands of friends, you have made New York like my own village. I am very unhappy to leave you all."
And so I write five years after my father's death to ask that New Yorkers, and Americans who've lost so much already, see Afghanistan, and particularly Nuristan, as a place capable of peace, longing for it. I want them to know that, if they eventually must leave due to the same corrupting forces that once forced my father give up his struggle; they will be leaving potentially thousands of friends still here, imagining that access to great power will one day deliver, will not be diverted to dishonest brokers and the crooked of both our countries, and that impoverishment and backwardness will finally be a thing of the past, rather than a past replayed.

HEADLINE: Turn Waste Into Energy, Group Urges New York

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: To save money and cut greenhouse gas emissions, a group suggests that New York City use regional treatment plants rather than transporting the garbage by truck to other states. 

 BODY:
New York City should embrace waste-to-energy plants to reduce the $300 million it spends annually disposing of its garbage, a government watchdog group suggested in a report released on Thursday. 
The group, the Citizens Budget Commission, noted that the city's trash is transported to out-of-state landfills by tractor-trailer trucks that travel hundreds of miles while emitting greenhouse gases. If one-third of the garbage going to landfills were to be turned into energy instead, the city would save $119 million a year and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35 percent, said the group, which monitors state and city spending.
The report estimated the cost of sending a ton of garbage to a regional waste-to-energy plant at $66 to $77 per ton, compared with $95 per ton for transporting it to a faraway landfill, and said that differential was likely to grow. 
Waste-to-energy plants are commonplace in Europe and increasingly used in states including Connecticut, the report notes. About 9 percent of New York City's garbage now goes to waste-to-energy plants in New Jersey and on Long Island.

The city is currently seeking proposals to build a privately owned state-of-the-art plant in or near the city that could initially handle 450 tons of trash a day. That plan has drawn some criticism from environmental groups, however, who that argue that officials should focus instead on reducing waste and increasing recycling. 
"Everyone wants to reduce the mounting cost and burdens of landfilling," said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, "but progressive cities around the country are turning first to enhanced and sophisticated recycling programs, before waste-to-energy incinerators."
"The most economical and environmentally sound first step is to recreate and reform our recycling program," he said.

HEADLINE: Study Ties Albany's Distance From Voters to Its Corruption

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: The state government's history of scandal may have something to do with the capital's location, the study's authors conclude. 

 BODY:
It took no less than the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard to demonstrate that out of sight is, indeed, out of mind. Or, if you prefer a different cliché, that when the cat's away, the mice will play. 
 "The evidence displays a strong connection between the spatial distribution of population and corruption: Isolated capital cities are associated with greater levels of corruption across U.S. states," a study by the Kennedy School concludes.
 "Massachusetts, with its population quite concentrated around Boston, is measured as considerably less corrupt than New York and its isolated Albany," the authors found. And the readership of Boston newspapers "might be more interested in what goes on in Beacon Hill (the central Boston neighborhood that is the site of the state government) than the New York papers' is in what takes place in Albany." 
 The authors, Filipe R. Campante of Harvard and Quoc-Anh Do of the school of economics at Singapore Management University, devised an intricate formula to measure corruption, press coverage, voter participation and delivery of government services. The less concentrated a state's population is around the capital, they found, the more corruption and the less press coverage, voter participation in state elections and delivery of services.
 "People who are close to the capital city are indeed more likely to turn out in state elections," the report said. 
 "I think the way to interpret our results is that the isolation of Albany makes New York State particularly prone to corruption, so it should lead one to be especially vigilant with respect to corruption," Professor Campante said. "When it comes to turnout specifically, we do find that elections that take place along with presidential elections do not see the same effect, as state turnout seems to benefit from the coattails of presidential turnout. In that sense, pairing the elections would tend to reduce the asymmetry between upstate and downstate." 
 New York's capital moved from New York City to Kingston in 1777 when the British invaded, then meandered to Hurley and Poughkeepsie before encamping permanently in 1797 in Albany, which was more centrally located and was then (until the 1860 census) one of the nation's 10 most populous cities. 
 "It is not New York City, and therefore makes the state less subject to the city's dominance," said Gerald Benjamin, a political scientist at the State University of New York at New Paltz. "It is relatively centrally located, and reachable by river travel from several directions, or at least somewhat reachable. It is not uncommon in the states to choose a smaller place for the state capital, for these or similar reasons."
 The shift upstate wasn't necessarily to avoid big-city scrutiny.
 "The move of the capital from New York City to Albany was paralleled in most of the other 13 original states," said Jim Folts, the head of research services for the New York State Archives. "During the same period, Virginia moved its capital from Williamsburg to Richmond, Pennsylvania from Philadelphia to Harrisburg. The moves reflected the rapid growth and shift of states' populations after the Revolutionary War."
 Still, the move helps explain why New Yorkers generally greet what goes on in Albany more dispassionately than what happens in City Hall. As former Mayor Edward I. Koch once said, "If you don't like the president, it costs you 90 bucks to fly to Washington to picket. If you don't like the governor, it costs you 60 bucks to fly to Albany to picket. If you don't like me, 90 cents."

HEADLINE: A Big Dig Close to Nature and Home

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: Does man possess nature or does nature possess man? Jonathan Blaustein's photo series "Mine" ponders questions of ownership, the natural world and humankind's place in it. 

 BODY:
Jonathan Blaustein has a lot of rocks. He has probably more rocks than any single man could ever need.
The deeper he digs on a three-and-a-half acre site in New Mexico's Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the more rocks he finds. He also has leaves, grass, six fruit trees, the occasional animal remains and - in winter - snow. But mostly he has rocks. He doesn't have to travel far for his digs: it's all in his backyard.
It was not always this way.
Mr. Blaustein was living in Brooklyn eight years ago, "like everybody else." He and his wife, Jessie Kaufman, were searching for a place where they could afford to live on the meager salaries of an artist and a social worker. They settled near Taos, N.M., on land where his wife grew up. They designed and built a modern, eco-efficent, high-tech house, 7,000 feet above sea level. Outside their front window, they can see an extinct volcano that is millions of years old.
"I live in a place where the scale of geological time is self-evident," Mr. Blaustein said. "In New York, the sky-scape reinforces the power of humanity. The wild, mostly untamed, raw desert mountain-scape reinforces the insignificance of humanity."
Living in the midst of nature caused Mr. Blaustein to think about his use of natural resources and private property. He pondered what it meant to own land. Through all four seasons last year, he "mined" his land, gathering and examining the resources that belonged to him and his wife.
"In economics, you try to maximize the value of your existing resources," he said. "I thought, 'How can I turn it into art? How can I commodify it?' "
Mr. Blaustein brought his finds - the rocks, grass, leaves and snow - inside his studio to photograph them outside their natural context. He made aesthetically pleasing arrangements and imposed himself on them by drawing and carving. The results, collected in a project entitled "Mine," are primal and almost totemic.
In the first exhibit of the work, at the New Mexico Arts Centennial Project Space through July 6, some of the items are on view next to the photographs.
"It's unquestionably photography, but it's not only photography" Mr. Blaustein said. "It's art that utilizes the camera, that utilizes powers of observation and that investigates time."
Though Mr. Blaustein's three and a half acres come with beautiful vistas, he found that sometimes a certain amount of nature's "raw unpleasantness" is unavoidable.
"I killed an entire mouse family that was living in the trunk of my car and chewing the seat belts," Mr. Blaustein said. "I tried to get them out with mothballs and peppermint oil and spraying Tabasco sauce on my engine block, but none of it worked."
He reluctantly dispatched them with a large rock and felt compelled to make productive use of their death by photographing one of the mice. Parts of a deer that had been killed near a stream by coyotes or dogs later joined the mouse in the project.
For Mr. Blaustein, they are a reminder of the uneasy relationship that mankind has to nature. Whether we like it or not.

HEADLINE: The South's Gunboat War

BYLINE: JOHN GRADY


HIGHLIGHT: The fight over how to run the Confederate Navy was as much about personalities as it was about policy. 

 BODY:
When Matthew Fontaine Maury, one of America's most famous scientists but a naval officer of middling rank, accepted the position as head of the Confederacy's coastal defense in 1861, he did so knowing that storms were ahead - of the political variety. His new post meant he would be reporting to two men with whom he had butted heads in pre-secession days: Stephen Mallory, secretary of the Confederate Navy, and Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy's new president. 
The three had been engaged in nasty, often personal political warfare since the 1850s, when the Floridian Mallory chaired the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, the Mississippian Davis served as secretary of war and senator, and the Virginian Maury supervised the National Observatory. Those acrimonious personal relationships, which were of minor consequence in Washington, now promised to define, and potentially derail, the Confederacy's naval and coastal-defense strategies.
As president of the Confederacy, the West Point-educated Davis had little use for a navy; his interests ended with privateers and letters of marque. Mallory had a different vision: he saw his nascent navy as someday constituting a fleet of commerce raiders, iron-sheathed floating fortresses and ocean-going ironclads to smash the blockade and terrorize Northern ports - what today we would call a "blue-water" navy.
Then there was Maury. From the day he reported to Virginia Governor John Letcher shortly after Virginia seceded, the pudgy, badly limping, balding man pushed a strong line on internal defense, particularly of the harbors, rivers and inlets that girded and suffused Confederate territory - what strategists would later call a "brown-water" or "green-water" navy. Maury's position was hardly surprising: internal defense was an area he had given much thought to and testimony about over the previous decade. 
Maury's strategy was composed of in three layers: mines (called torpedoes at the time) and other obstructions to secure ports and waterways; well-placed coastal artillery, but not heavy fortifications; and fast, maneuverable gunboats to sting invaders. Upon arriving in his new post, he immediately began putting it in place, starting by re-positioning the big guns seized at Virginia's Gosport Shipyard (later renamed the Norfolk Naval Shipyard) - a move that Mallory approved, along with inexpensive mines deployed in nearby waters. 
The gunboats, however, were another matter. They cost real money, money that Mallory believed better spent on raiders, like the Florida, and iron plating for the captured Merrimack, which was soon rechristened as the Confederacy's first ironclad, the Virginia. As for Davis, his spending priority was always the armies in Virginia, Tennessee and along the Mississippi. If the money had to come from "his" navy, so be it. Gunboats, Davis said, were off the table.
The tension between Mallory and Davis, both from Deep South cotton states, and men like Letcher and Maury, from the Upper South state of Virginia, was more than personal. It embodied a fundamental problem at the heart of the Confederacy, namely the relationships among the states and the relationship between the states and the central government. 
In late May, 1861, and at Virginia's invitation, Davis arrived in Richmond to make it the Confederacy's capital. Over the next few weeks, on trains, in canal boats, in stage coaches and on horseback, members of his cabinet and the Confederate Congress trickled into the city, welcomed by the governor and the leaders of the secession convention. But the bonhomie did not last long. Virginia controlled the enormous armory at Harper's Ferry, which the central government demanded it hand over. Nor did Virginians take to the Confederate plan to
revert to the old ranks of the United States Army and Navy, which they saw as a step away from Southern independence. 
Neither side thought much of the other. In his diary, Mallory wrote: "From all I can learn here, Gov. Letcher's conduct must be the result of lack of judgment. It is indefensible - a traitor or a fool might equally act as he does and he is not a traitor." Nor did Virginia's leaders hold much respect for the new leaders in Richmond. As the events of early summer 1861 unfolded, a bitter Maury said, the Confederate government was riddled with "small men." He wrote in his diary: "You may rely upon it, the Confederate States Government has come here feeling that there is between it and us something of an antagonism." He was right, and it exploded first over Maury's and the state's insistence on building gunboats to defend its waterways.
While Mallory thought "small," in Maury's words, about coastal defense, the coastal-defense commander dreamed large. Maury did not want a ship "stout enough to keep the sea." Instead, he envisioned "steam launches each capable of carrying two rifled pivot guns and no more. Their structure should be simple and plain and as economical as possible. They should be literally nothing but floating gun carriages," with crews of 40 and no accommodations. It was a take-off on his 1851 proposal to build 25 "smart, active steamers," a patrolling "coast guard" to defend the Eastern Seaboard. 
Through his "big gun and little ship" plan, the commander wanted to turn the ships loose in the Chesapeake Bay's shallow waters and North Carolina's tidal rivers and sounds. Shipwrights in the bay counties would be the primary builders, and they could do the work, along with soldier-artisans about to go into winter quarters. 
"Going out like a nest of hornets," he wrote, "they will especially, if the building and the fitting out be kept from the enemy, either sink, capture or drive away from the Chesapeake and its tributaries the whole fleet which the enemy now has or probably will in that time in these waters." Once that was done, the "nest of hornets" could close off maritime traffic through the Virginia capes, starve out Fortress Monroe and threaten Washington.
To prepare the way for his gunboats, Maury, writing as "Ben Bow," used the influential Richmond Enquirer to blast the administration's moves to date as "mere makeshifts" when it came to coastal defense.
Mallory retaliated by ordering Maury to travel to Cuba to buy weapons, a trip that would take him out of the loop for weeks, if not months. But Maury's political patron, the former president John Tyler, and Charles M. Conrad, his ally in the Confederate Congress and the chair of the House Naval Affairs Committee (and a former United States secretary of war), declared the commander was too valuable to send out of the country. Mallory backed down - for now. 
Maury next turned to Letcher and his allies in the Virginia Convention. In the wake of the latest debacle on the Carolina coast at Port Royal, in which the Union captured a huge swath of territory with little opposition, he lobbied even more strenuously for his gunboats. Eventually the Confederate House and Senate approved $2 million to build 100 vessels. On Christmas Eve, Davis signed the bill putting Maury in charge of building the gunboat fleet. 
Like the money set aside to rebuild the Merrimack and the hundreds of thousands more to build floating fortresses to defend New Orleans, this was a high-stakes roll of the dice. Everything went well at first. Tyler happily reported that Maury had "woven a proud chaplet around her brow by having won a name all over the world which reflects new luster on the name of Virginia" by advocating the state's strong defense. 
But when members of the Virginia Convention approached Mallory about progress on the gunboats, the secretary reported that his agents were scouring the countryside for engines. By the start of 1862, supplies, especially boilers and the heavy oak for the hulls, proved difficult to come by. And fears of new Union attacks in Virginia led to the rejection of Maury's idea to free soldiers with carpentry skills from Army duties in the winter. 
Despite these setbacks, construction began on the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers, and also along the Rappahannock and at Gosport. Talbott & Brothers, a large Richmond foundry, delivered five double engines in February 1862. During this period, Maury advertised for "negro laborers to cut timber for the vessels." 
But Maury's project soon ran into even bigger problems. The battle between the Virginia (nee Merrimack) and the Monitor in March 1862 led the Confederate Congress to demand heavier ironclads for harbor defense and oceangoing ironclads like Britain's Warrior and France's Glorie. Wooden gunboats were useless in the face of the Monitor's firepower. 
The most pressing issue, though, was the Union's Peninsula Campaign, which had landed unmolested at Fortress Monroe in the spring of 1862 and marched haltingly but steadily toward Richmond. In late May the Union captured Norfolk, and the Virginia, docked nearby and unable to escape, was scuttled. Mallory's ironclad strategy was in shambles.
Maury, sensing an opening, pushed hard for more gunboats, especially if coupled with mines attached to long spars at the boats' bow. And he pushed the other planks in his strategy, particularly the use of electrically detonated mines. But the Union soon turned on Maury, too. As the Army marched north, it set fire to Maury's small "gunboat shipyards" along the way; of the 15 vessels under construction, no more than two escaped. 
After the Union march on Richmond was thwarted in July, Davis and Mallory deemed Maury's gunboats irrelevant. The money was needed elsewhere. What use to them was Maury in Richmond? They correctly gauged that support for the gunboats inside the uniformed Navy was waning. Maury, sensing the inevitable, reported that his project was dead and asked Mallory for a new assignment. "He thought I would be of use doing nothing," Maury reported. Instead he was ordered to Britain to acquire ships for the Confederacy, where he whiled away the rest of the war. 
The "gunboat war" was over, with no clear-cut winners, only burned hulls, sunken ironclads, two of the South's largest ports and its largest shipyard in enemy hands - and a depleted Confederate Treasury.

HEADLINE: Theater Talkback: Up Close, Feeling Very Personal

BYLINE: BEN BRANTLEY


HIGHLIGHT: What better art than the theater, by its nature a collective experience, to consider the overlap between the individual and communal? 

 BODY:
Since the subject under discussion today is a particularly sensitive and frightening one for some of you, I would like to make a few things clear right away. In none of the incidents described below was I ever clutched, stroked, groped or otherwise physically assaulted. Nor was I dragged onto a stage and forced to engage in unseemly activities with professional exhibitionists.
Yes, I am talking about (cue ominous organ chord, please) audience participation at the theater. But not in the way you have come to expect and quite possibly loathe. The productions I have in mind, both of which opened recently, do not single out theatergoers and place them under a spotlight. Yet watching them, I found it impossible to avoid the feeling that I - and everyone seated around me - was directly implicated in and possibly even responsible for what was happening onstage.
The shows are Athol Fugard's three-character drama "My Children! My Africa!," at the Signature Center, and Mike Bartlett's four-person comedy with an unprintable four-letter title, at the Duke Theater. At first glance, these plays don't seem to have much in common, aside from their small casts of characters. "My Children" is about South Africa in the last years of apartheid; Mr. Bartlett's work, hitherto to be referred to as "Cockfight Play," is about an internecine romantic triangle. In other words, one is political and the other personal.
Still, as most of us learn when we move toward that shifting and elusive state called adulthood, the political and the personal can never be unequivocally separated. Human beings don't conduct their lives in separate sealed compartments, try though they might. And what better art than the theater, by its nature a collective experience, to consider the overlap between what is individual and what is communal? 
In both "My Children," directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and "Cockfight Play," directed by James Macdonald, our awareness of that intersection is achieved subtly. Both productions are testaments to the theory that in seducing an audience by stealth, size definitely matters. So does shape. The Duke and the Romulus Linney Courtyard Theater are small spaces to begin with, and the ways in which their seats have been reconfigured make them feel even more intimate.
For "Cockfight Play," which is designed by Miriam Buether, the Duke has been turned into a stark forum that brings to mind a luxury-free miniature of a Roman coliseum. Wooden benches rise in a circle around the naked stage, which itself brings to mind an arena for one-on-one combat. The association turns out to be most appropriate, since "Cockfight" portrays a battle for the body and soul of one indecisive young man, John (Cory Michael Smith).
The combatants, as it happens, are of different sexes: the man is called simply M (Jason Butler Harner), John's existing romantic partner, and W (Amanda Quaid), with whom John has begun affair. The fourth character, F (Cotter Smith), is M's father, enlisted for moral support in a fraught dinner party scene. While sex plays a large part in "Cockfight," which also features the occasional minor act of violence, there is almost no physical contact among the actors.
Sexual encounters are described as they're happening, quite vividly, but the cast members all keep their clothes on. This has the unexpected effect of drawing us more completely into the onstage encounters. Simulated sex, with nudity, is likely to create a self-contained reality from which we keep our distance (unless we're talking about an experimental troupe like the Living Theater, in the anything-goes 1960s). With "Cockfight," the eroticism is at once abstract and immediate, and we don't feel obligated to look away, or embarrassed if we don't. We remain part of the, uh, conversation.
Did I mention that while this is happening the lights have never entirely gone down on the audience? So you can't really look at the actors without seeing the observers seated behind them. And their (and, oh yes, your) responses inevitably filter into the onstage discussion of the nature and fluidity of sexual identity.
You're more aware than usual of when certain lines strike home with the audience, and you may find yourself wondering about the personal history of everyone watching the play. I couldn't help noticing that a man directly across from me in the third row was in tears at the end of "Cockfight." And I didn't look away from him any more than I had from the sex scenes. His response seemed to feed and layer the implicit debate in the script.
The debate that begins "My Children! My Africa!" is explicit. Two high school students, a black boy and a white girl, are facing off in a formal, adjudicated argument about the role of women in South African society. The audience is seated in tiers around three-quarters of the stage. And the two students - Isabel (Allie Gallerani) and Thami (Stephen Tyrone Williams) - address their statements directly and successively to each part of the audience. A teacher known as Mr. M (James A. Williams) presides behind a desk, and reminds us, as if we were his students, to listen closely and to behave.
Isabel, it emerges, is a visitor from a private school to the township institution where Thami is a star student and Mr. M a strict but beloved instructor. And though you'd think a mixed-race debate in a country under apartheid would be angry, this one is characterized by high spirits that feel only friendly. We understand when Mr. M later tells us how much hope this encounter has given him; we've been infected by the same optimistic energy.
When that hopeful glow starts to fade, eclipsed by a murky confusion and rancor, we feel almost as betrayed by the change as Mr. M does. Mr. Fugard rings variations on the debate structure with which he begins the play, by letting each character talk to us in monologues. But these people aren't preaching with the conviction they brought to that classroom exercise. The reality they share is too complicated for unconditional beliefs.
As we listen to them, we become aware, by degrees, of how confining the space we're in is. Neil Patel's set includes metal fencing and barbed wire that extends into and frames the seated area. South Africa is a prison for Mr. Fugard's characters, and we grow to share that sense of confinement.
I should add that the actors in "Cockfight" and "My Children" are all excellent. If they weren't, the experience of the productions would be far less involving. But when performances are as on target as these, a small space allows us to enter more completely into a dramatist's reality, and to feel as if we're truly part of the play. Of course in a sense, we always are whenever we visit the theater. Like it or not, to be part of an audience is automatically to be a participant; it's in the unwritten but inescapable contract between us and any play. Intimate and intense productions like these remind us, in ways both exciting and discomfiting, of that beautiful cardinal truth of theatergoing.
What are your experiences of intimacy in theatergoing? When you have most felt a part of the action onstage?

HEADLINE: An Afghan's Three-Generation Quest for Peace

BYLINE: ADAM KLEIN


HIGHLIGHT: In one Afghan's family history, a tale of the shadowy world of American power players and Afghan dissidents--of policy-makers, shape-shifters, early war profiteers claiming to work on behalf of Afghan victims. 

 BODY:
Two years ago, I began working with Afghan writers in workshops, introducing them to short narratives from around the world, frequently from postwar writers. Most of my students weren't raised reading stories in English, and very few had ever sat down to write their own in a second or third language. Unlike an American workshop, it was rare to find an Afghan who felt their story warranted such attention, theirs or mine, or who wanted their work to ever appear in print.
Through a process of close conferencing, the stories developed, as did trust, and eventually a desire to see their work published - preferably outside Afghanistan, where candor is still risky. At the same time, I asked students to bring me pictures or documents, imagining that I might help start an image archive - something online that could one day be used for research and couldn't be destroyed by the Taliban or others who find photography incongruous with Islam.
Few students brought photographs or letters, stating that their provinces were too dangerous to return to, or that no such documents or letters survived the war, the Taliban, or their sometimes dramatic, overland escapes from the country.
Though my intention was to help create a book of their stories, in their words, I had one student who brought in a trove of images, letters, and most surprisingly, pictures of Muhammad Ali with his father, as well as New York protest permits. I was hooked. Kakail Nuristani began to relay his father's story to me. Over time, I realized that this was more than a story of Kakail's father's optimistic, driven youthfulness and sense of destiny. Rather, it unearthed the murky world of American power players and Afghan dissidents on the other side of the world -- the side of policy-makers, shape-shifters, early war profiteers claiming to work on behalf of Afghan victims. Kakail's story is one of destiny forestalled for three generations. He asked me to help him put this together, sensing there was a national narrative here. When we'd finally finished it, the images laid before us, I saw it starkly. Power is only as good as those who gain access to it. The rest is fallout.
A Forefather Who Ran With Kings
My grandfather's aunt was taken forcibly from Nuristan to be either a wife or courtesan of the Emir Abdur Rahman Khan sometime in the 1880s, and to live in the king's court. As far as I know, this may be the same presidential palace occupied by Hamid Karzai today. Nuristan is a remote region, high in the northeast mountains of Afghanistan; little is known of it, but it was the first region to oust the Russians and the last to convert to Islam within Afghanistan.
My grandfather was able to live under his aunt's supervision, and did have some access to the palace. That's how he formed his early friendship with Mohammed Nadir Shah, father to King Mohammed Zahir Shah, the last king of Afghanistan, who reigned from 1933-1973 before he was ousted in a coup. My grandfather would go on to serve as King Shah's treasurer.
After Abdur Rahman Khan had settled with the British on the Durand Line, the demarcation between India and Afghanistan, my grandfather went to British India for studies and fell in love with a viceroy's wife, whose face he had tattooed on his arm. When he returned to Nuristan, a group of mullahs saw the tattoo and insisted he was an infidel and could no longer pray in the mosque. In response, he informed them that if he were an infidel for having the face of a woman on his arm, they too, were infidels for trading in cash imprinted with the faces of world leaders. This left them speechless. He was left alone after that. In later years, perhaps due to my grandfather's deft diplomatic skills, he became the first elected provincial parliament member under Zahir Shah. The following muslin voting record shows the fingerprints of those villagers who nominated him and provides some idea of the fragility of such democratic processes that held these communities together.
Lennart Edelberg led a Danish expedition in the 1960s to Afghanistan. He wrote a book on Nuristani architecture that was greatly informed by my grandfather. Later, His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark, accompanied by the royal family of Afghanistan, visited my grandfather's simple home - wood-beamed and blackened with cooking smoke. It was common for the aristocracy to go on hunting expeditions in Nuristan. The following photograph shows my grandfather inaugurating the Nuristan Collection at the Moesgaard Museum, in Aarhus, Denmark. Their museum appears to still have holdings on the music of the region, identified as: "Documentation of an eradicated culture."
With these loose associations connecting my family to the royal families in Denmark and Afghanistan, we lived with a certain prestige. In 1965, the Danish aristocracy even knighted my grandfather.
However, Nuristan being what it was - a fourteen-day walk to Kabul (legend has it that my grandfather made this walk many times), was probably still a place where one's political efficacy was not as great as people imagined. Superstitions surrounded my grandfather as though he himself had great power merely through contact with others who possessed it. They imagined him able to eradicate impoverishment, remoteness, and backwardness. My grandfather continued to live humbly among them in the village. Nothing much changed; it was only the expectation of his eventual influence that differentiated him from them.
A Father Who Fought for Afghanistan's Freedom
On Sept. 11, 1948, my father, Khalilullah Nuristani, was born under the same burden of greatness. In retrospect, he must have believed that he could fulfill what had been his father's unfulfilled destiny. My father became a tireless fighter for a free Afghanistan. In looking at the documents he left behind, I am also inclined to believe that he was nostalgic for an Afghanistan that at one point was considered a mini-Paris for visiting Pakistanis, Indians, even those few movie crews, academics, and shaggy hippies who went so far, and into such remote corners of the country, that my father had, on a number of occasions, put them up. He was assured of its promise as a location that would attract world travelers, welcome and impress them.
Because of my father's involvement in Sardar Mohammad Daoud Khan's government, he had to flee the Russians. His first exile was in Germany where he was encouraged to seek political asylum in the United States, as the cold war was in full swing and European interest in Afghanistan was specific to those countries under Soviet occupation. The United States' response to the Russians was broader, ideological. My father was granted asylum in 1979 with the help of Columbia University professor John Monday and his wife, as well as the anthropology professor Charles Lindholm and his wife, Janice Gardener, who hosted him. He immediately went to work on behalf of the Nuristani resistance, lobbying Congress and writing directly to Senator Jacob K. Javits in 1979, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy in 1980.
Despite the sympathetic letters he received in response to the escalation of aggression by the Russians in Afghanistan, my father felt it necessary to take his protest to the streets, and specifically to the United Nations.
A lone agitator at that time, my father left behind his protest permits from 1979 (probably impossible to get now after the Occupy Wall Street movement) and a couple of photographs in which it appears he is never surrounded by more than twenty-five sympathizers, including Lithuanians and Latvians, and perhaps some people just attracted to a crowd. It is rumored that Zalmay Khalilzad attended these protests, but I am unable to identify him in these pictures. I only know that Zalmay Khalilzad's access to the halls of American power would have him eventually working directly under George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. He was instrumental in Iraq and Afghanistan policy, which, 14 years after my father's early pleas for support, morphed into something much more sinister than my father's initial idealism would have ever allowed.
Interestingly, before Charlie Wilson's war, my father finally found a sole supporter, spiritually and economically, in Muhammad Ali. It is still a mystery to me how they met, but I remember my father claiming he had visited him and his daughter, Laila, and that he played with her as an infant. While Wilson was channeling cash to the "refugees" of Afghanistan, my father was warning Muhammad Ali through the Afghan Association of Freedom Fighters U.S.A. to oversee where funds were directed, which he clearly believed to be misappropriated and diverted for the personal interests of American Afghans and the militant fighters whom he later strongly opposed and fought against in the mid-1980s.
My father returned to Nuristan prematurely after receiving news that his entire family had been wiped out in a Russian strafe bombing. This misinformation had been delivered to him by Sam Sloan, also known as Haji Mohammed Ismail Sloan, a candidate to become the 2012 presidential nominee for the Libertarian Party, stock trader, successful litigant in a Supreme Court case involving penny stocks, chess journalist and author of "How To take Over an American Public Company" as well as the author of the introduction of Bobby Fischer's only book - euphemistically, a man with a long past.
Upon return, my father realized he had lost two daughters. The rest of his family was safe. But he was dejected, broken, having marshaled so much energy toward the struggles of Afghanistan, and in particular, the needs of Nuristan, only to find a Congress insulated by lobbyists, and a group of competing militias attempting to pick the pockets of the United States on behalf of refugees. He had put his faith in people like Mr. Sloan -- minor players on the criminal outskirts of power, and iconic, sometimes well-intentioned figures such as Muhammad Ali, whose money was probably the first to support the mujahedeen, but the wrong arm of it. Not only this, but internecine warfare - based on water, land, and old resentments between Nuristani tribes -- eventually wiped out the village of Kushtooz; its residents now populate other areas of the province, but our family home is gone. None of the supposed benefits of "freedom" or "resistance" changed the precariousness of life in Nuristan.
My father's last letter, thanking those academics that supported him, is also a prescient reminder of the situation that dogs Afghan and American relations today. It is not that one party lacks the vision, hope or capacity to change the situation in the country, but the intractable nature of corruption that makes any single man's contribution, and perhaps any nation's, inevitably doomed. My father wrote in 1980:
And so now I see the American press and television praising Afghanistan, and laughing at the Russian defeats.
But praising Afghan freedom fighters and marveling at their courage is not helpful. I have been very disappointed in my work here. The press and the public do not seem to understand that the fight in Afghanistan is a fight which vitally effects the welfare of the whole free world. [ ] I oppose elite interests, and so have been unable to make use of connections in Washington and elsewhere which the elite, with their money and Western educations, have been able to utilize. [ ] American disinterest, my own lack of funds, my lack of knowledge of English, my isolation from the American power structure; all these difficulties force me, with regret, to leave New York for the time being. [ ] For my thousands of friends, you have made New York like my own village. I am very unhappy to leave you all."
And so I write five years after my father's death to ask that New Yorkers, and Americans who've lost so much already, see Afghanistan, and particularly Nuristan, as a place capable of peace, longing for it. I want them to know that, if they eventually must leave due to the same corrupting forces that once forced my father give up his struggle; they will be leaving potentially thousands of friends still here, imagining that access to great power will one day deliver, will not be diverted to dishonest brokers and the crooked of both our countries, and that impoverishment and backwardness will finally be a thing of the past, rather than a past replayed.

HEADLINE: Turn Waste Into Energy, Group Urges New York

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: To save money and cut greenhouse gas emissions, a group suggests that New York City use regional treatment plants rather than transporting the garbage by truck to other states. 

 BODY:
New York City should embrace waste-to-energy plants to reduce the $300 million it spends annually disposing of its garbage, a government watchdog group suggested in a report released on Thursday. 
The group, the Citizens Budget Commission, noted that the city's trash is transported to out-of-state landfills by tractor-trailer trucks that travel hundreds of miles while emitting greenhouse gases. If one-third of the garbage going to landfills were to be turned into energy instead, the city would save $119 million a year and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35 percent, said the group, which monitors state and city spending.
The report estimated the cost of sending a ton of garbage to a regional waste-to-energy plant at $66 to $77 per ton, compared with $95 per ton for transporting it to a faraway landfill, and said that differential was likely to grow. 
Waste-to-energy plants are commonplace in Europe and increasingly used in states including Connecticut, the report notes. About 9 percent of New York City's garbage now goes to waste-to-energy plants in New Jersey and on Long Island.

The city is currently seeking proposals to build a privately owned state-of-the-art plant in or near the city that could initially handle 450 tons of trash a day. That plan has drawn some criticism from environmental groups, however, who that argue that officials should focus instead on reducing waste and increasing recycling. 
"Everyone wants to reduce the mounting cost and burdens of landfilling," said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, "but progressive cities around the country are turning first to enhanced and sophisticated recycling programs, before waste-to-energy incinerators."
"The most economical and environmentally sound first step is to recreate and reform our recycling program," he said.

HEADLINE: Study Ties Albany's Distance From Voters to Its Corruption

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: The state government's history of scandal may have something to do with the capital's location, the study's authors conclude. 

 BODY:
It took no less than the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard to demonstrate that out of sight is, indeed, out of mind. Or, if you prefer a different cliché, that when the cat's away, the mice will play. 
 "The evidence displays a strong connection between the spatial distribution of population and corruption: Isolated capital cities are associated with greater levels of corruption across U.S. states," a study by the Kennedy School concludes.
 "Massachusetts, with its population quite concentrated around Boston, is measured as considerably less corrupt than New York and its isolated Albany," the authors found. And the readership of Boston newspapers "might be more interested in what goes on in Beacon Hill (the central Boston neighborhood that is the site of the state government) than the New York papers' is in what takes place in Albany." 
 The authors, Filipe R. Campante of Harvard and Quoc-Anh Do of the school of economics at Singapore Management University, devised an intricate formula to measure corruption, press coverage, voter participation and delivery of government services. The less concentrated a state's population is around the capital, they found, the more corruption and the less press coverage, voter participation in state elections and delivery of services.
 "People who are close to the capital city are indeed more likely to turn out in state elections," the report said. 
 "I think the way to interpret our results is that the isolation of Albany makes New York State particularly prone to corruption, so it should lead one to be especially vigilant with respect to corruption," Professor Campante said. "When it comes to turnout specifically, we do find that elections that take place along with presidential elections do not see the same effect, as state turnout seems to benefit from the coattails of presidential turnout. In that sense, pairing the elections would tend to reduce the asymmetry between upstate and downstate." 
 New York's capital moved from New York City to Kingston in 1777 when the British invaded, then meandered to Hurley and Poughkeepsie before encamping permanently in 1797 in Albany, which was more centrally located and was then (until the 1860 census) one of the nation's 10 most populous cities. 
 "It is not New York City, and therefore makes the state less subject to the city's dominance," said Gerald Benjamin, a political scientist at the State University of New York at New Paltz. "It is relatively centrally located, and reachable by river travel from several directions, or at least somewhat reachable. It is not uncommon in the states to choose a smaller place for the state capital, for these or similar reasons."
 The shift upstate wasn't necessarily to avoid big-city scrutiny.
 "The move of the capital from New York City to Albany was paralleled in most of the other 13 original states," said Jim Folts, the head of research services for the New York State Archives. "During the same period, Virginia moved its capital from Williamsburg to Richmond, Pennsylvania from Philadelphia to Harrisburg. The moves reflected the rapid growth and shift of states' populations after the Revolutionary War."
 Still, the move helps explain why New Yorkers generally greet what goes on in Albany more dispassionately than what happens in City Hall. As former Mayor Edward I. Koch once said, "If you don't like the president, it costs you 90 bucks to fly to Washington to picket. If you don't like the governor, it costs you 60 bucks to fly to Albany to picket. If you don't like me, 90 cents."

HEADLINE: An Exposé Before a Vote on Gender-Based Abortions

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: As the House prepared to vote on a bill that would ban abortions based on gender, an antiabortion group released undercover videos that show Planned Parenthood employees giving information to women pretending to want to terminate their pregnancies based on gender. 

 BODY:
Last Updated, 2:20 p.m. The House rejected a bill on Thursday that would have banned abortions based on gender.
The vote came as a group opposed to abortion rights stepped up its campaign against what it said is an increase in sex-selective abortions, using hoax patient visits and hidden cameras to show Planned Parenthood employees offering guidance to women looking to terminate their pregnancies because they were concerned about having a girl. 
The group, Live Action, released an edited undercover video and an unedited version on Tuesday of an employee at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Austin, Tex., giving information to a woman pretending to want to terminate her pregnancy if she was carrying a girl. 
At a news conference Thursday morning in Washington with Representative Trent Franks, a Republican from Arizona who is the main sponsor of the bill known as the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, or Prenda, the group released a second video that was filmed with a hidden camera at the Margaret Sanger Planned Parenthood clinic in Manhattan. 
Both the edited and unedited versions of the Manhattan video show a meeting between a counselor and a woman also pretending she wants to be pregnant only with a boy.
In the video, the counselor answers questions in a matter-of-fact, nonjudgmental approach about what prenatal tests can be used to determine gender in a pregnancy. The counselor also suggests prenatal care in the case that the hoax patient continues her pregnancy. The counselor also asks if the woman would consider adoption. 
At the end of the meeting the woman from Live Action asks the counselor to schedule an abortion for her should prenatal test results confirm the gender is female. 
She also asks whether staff members at Planned Parenthood would raise questions if she came back for multiple abortions "if we end up being unlucky, and we keep having girls." 
The staff member replies, "That, I really can't answer for you." Then she adds: "Here at Planned Parenthood it is not up to us what is a good or bad reason for somebody to decide to terminate a pregnancy. It is up to the individual person to decide what is best for you and your family."
In response to the hoax patient video earlier this week, Planned Parenthood issued a statement saying that it opposed gender-selection abortion and arguing that the group's videos were being used to promote "false claims about our organization and patient services."
Lila Rose, 23, a recent graduate of U.C.L.A. who is the president and founder of Live Action, an antiabortion group that she started at age 15, said the undercover videos exposed what she said was a growing practice of sex-selective abortion in the United States and how Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers facilitated the selective elimination of baby girls in the womb.
She said hidden cameras were used to make videos in about a dozen abortion clinics around the country in April and would be released in the coming week as part of a "Protect Our Girls"campaign.
"In the last year, we started to get disturbing tips from people, from ultrasound technicians who said women would ask to schedule an abortion immediately after learning the sex," Ms. Rose said in an interview. "We are seeing not only coaching on how to do gender determination but willingness to arrange a late term abortion."
Leslie Kantor, vice president of education for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said that Planned Parenthood "condemns sex selection motivated by gender bias, and urges leaders to challenge the underlying conditions that lead to these beliefs and practices, including addressing the social, legal, economic and political conditions that promote gender bias and lead some to value one gender over the other. "
Ms. Kantor said that the employee in the Austin center was in an entry-level position and "did not follow our protocol for providing information and guidance when presented with a highly unusual patient scenario." She said that the employee was terminated three days after the patient hoax visit last April and that staff members at the Austin affiliate were immediately scheduled for retraining in "managing unusual patient encounters."
On Wednesday, members of the House debated the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, which would impose up to a five-year jail term on doctors who perform abortions based on gender. Opponents of the bill say it is the latest effort by Republicans to chip away at women's reproductive rights. 
Representative Franks said during the debateover the bill on Wednesday that recent studies had shown that the practice of sex-selection abortion was "demonstrably increasing here in the United States." 
Representative John Conyers Jr. and other Democrats who spoke up against the legislation argued that the bill would effectively destroy the "doctor-patient relationship by turning all health care providers into police. It would require a doctor to try and read her patient's mind and determine what her reasons are."
Representative Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey and a longtime opponent of abortion rights, cited the blind Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng, who spoke out against forced abortions in his native China.
"For most of us, Mr. Speaker, 'It's a girl' is cause for enormous joy, happiness and celebration," Mr. Smith said during the debate. "But in many countries including our own, it could be a death sentence. Today the three most dangerous words in China and India are 'It's a girl.' We can't let that happen here."
Planned Parenthood also issued a statementagainst the bill, amid all the questions that Live Action was trying to raise from its videos. 
"As the nation's leading sexual and reproductive health provider and advocate, Planned Parenthood knows all too well that women still face gender discrimination in this country," said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. "We oppose sex selection abortion. But this bill does nothing to advance protections against discrimination and instead will have the result of further shaming and stigmatizing women. " 
The House vote was 246 to 168 in favor of the bill but it failed to win passage because a two-thirds vote was needed for approval. 
The debate over women's reproductive rights and health care has taken a central role in the coming presidential and Congressional elections, with both sides declaring a war on women's rights. As my colleague Michael D. Shear reported on Wednesday, Planned Parenthood has put money into an advertising campaign targeting Mitt Romney.

HEADLINE: On 'Greece-Proofing' China

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: China urgently needs to "Greece-proof" itself to avoid powerful shocks that will come if Greece leaves the euro, a leading Chinese economist says, amid the sound of screeching brakes from the Asian giant's economy. 

 BODY:
China urgently needs to "Greece-proof" itself to avoid powerful shocks that will undoubtedly come if Greece leaves the euro, a leading Chinese economist says, amid the sound of screeching brakes from an economy that has been looked to for world growth.
In fact, recession in the West will last for years, predicts Yu Yongding, and coupled with a Grexit - as a potential Greek exit from the euro is being called - key challenges for China will be expected waves of deleveraging and investors exiting risky markets, surging unemployment and threats to social stability, he writes. 
Mr. Yu has criticism for Europe, writing that "the eurozone, and Germany in particular, must fully acknowledge the fundamental causes of Greece's exit and pledge to move towards fiscal union, while acknowledging that an austerity-only approach towards other at-risk members is a dead end." 
Mr. Yu's warning is well-timed. China's own growth is expected to fall this year to its lowest point in about 13 years, and Mr. Yu, the president of the China Society of World Economics and a former member of the monetary policy committee of the Chinese central bank, the People's Bank of China, may have a pretty clear idea of what lies ahead. He's saying: Get ready.
Of course, growth is relative, and for Europeans and Americans used to far lower rates, recent analyst projections for China's second quarter of 2012 - of about 7.9 percent - may seem extremely robust. 
But it's low for a country where policy makers, and people in general, have long been used to double digits, and where the government is convinced social stability is at risk if growth drops much below 8 percent. 
Back in 2008, frightened by internal reports that up to 30 million Chinese could lose their jobs in the export sector as the world economy staggered, officials reacted by throwing money at the problem - at least four trillion renminbi ($635 billion, with much more to follow in local bank lending). 
The result was a bubbly froth that China is still struggling to cope with. Housing prices shot up and debt ballooned. 
So the government has said it won't launch another stimulus. Yet as my colleague Michael Wines reports, it is doing so, after a fashion.
The government is using words like "accelerate" and "quicken," so if it's not stimulating the economy, it's certainly spurring it. The difference isn't quite clear, but it may have to do with outside perceptions, as Xia Bin, head of the financial research institute at the State Council's think tank, the Development Research Center, hinted.
Mr. Xia ruled out dramatic policy action - another official stimulus package - even if foreigners want to see it. 
"Americans and Europeans like it. Investors like it because they want to speculate on stocks. The whole world is hoping China will relax policy," Mr. Xia told Reuters.
"We will fall into a trap if we do. We will not be that stupid," he said.
Signs of weakness are everywhere. In Hong Kong, the London diamond merchant Graff has postponed a long-awaited I.P.O. that may have raised as much as $1.5 billion, citing "adverse market conditions," Bloomberg reports.
The connection with Europe's woes is clear. "The global I.P.O. markets are dead until European Union issues abate, worldwide economic indicators improve and the overall stock market regains some footing," Jim Krapfel, an I.P.O. analyst at Morningstar in Chicago, told Bloomberg.
Chinese companies such as China Yongda Automobiles Services, China's biggest distributor of BMW cars, and Sany Heavy Industry have canceled or cut back share sales in Hong Kong, Bloomberg reports.
China's government has refrained from commenting much on the European muddle. Yet Mr. Yu says, "Chinese officials should be under no illusion that the country will be immune to financial contagion. A 'Grexit' would hit European banks that hold peripheral eurozone countries' sovereign bonds. Shock waves from the deleveraging would, in turn, spread to emerging markets like China." 
Chinese banks aren't that exposed in Europe, Mr. Yu notes. Still, a "post-Grexit capital flight from risky markets could rival, or even surpass, that in the weeks following Lehman Brothers' collapse in September 2008," he says.
This year, China begins a once-in-a-decade power handover, and political leaders undoubtedly feel they need a Grexit like a hole in the head. Some in Europe may agree with that, even if Greece is a powerful symbol of Europe and the font of its culture. But is it perhaps better to get it over with and move on? 
Mr. Yu has some practical suggestions. 
China "should be ready to extend a helping hand," he writes. "To ensure that the post-Grexit eurozone's integrity faces no further immediate threats, China must join international partners in establishing a fully credible firewall via the I.M.F.," to ringfence the damage. 
But so that good Chinese money isn't spent in vain, he calls for a European commitment to "structural reform" to calm markets. And - yes - more reform at the I.M.F., where China feels it is badly underrepresented. 
What do you think? Is a Grexit the last thing the world needs, or is it better to prepare for it, let it happen and try to contain the damage, as Mr. Yu seems to suggest? How should China, the world's second-biggest economy, be preparing itself?

HEADLINE: Pressure Continues on Regulators to Approve Volcker Rule

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: On Thursday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission held a public roundtable to solicit ideas from banks, academics and other experts on the contentious Volcker Rule, which seeks to ban banks from making risky bets with their own money. 

 BODY:
In the wake of JPMorgan's multibillion-dollar trading loss, regulators are under pressure to beef up the proposed Volcker Rule.
On Thursday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission held a public roundtable to solicit ideas from banks, academics and other experts on the contentious rule, which seeks to ban banks from making risky bets with their own money. The trading commission is one of five regulatory agencies writing the rule, borne from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law. 
The effort has also faced an onslaught of opposition from Wall Street lobbyists, who argue that the Volcker Rule could stifle their ability to hedge against risk. But the ban on proprietary trading, regulators noted on Thursday, exempts most transactions that involve hedging. 
"Some commenters have said if we're too prohibitive in one area, we may limit banking entities ability to engage in risk-mitigating hedging," Gary Gensler, chairman of the trading commission, said at the roundtable. "On the other hand, if we follow comments of some of the banking entities, then the rule's allowance for permitted hedging might swallow up Congress's intent to limit the risk of proprietary trading."
The roundtable, which also featured testimony from major investors like the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the rule's supporters like Sheila Bair, came against the backdrop of JPMorgan's recent trading blunder, which is so far pegged at roughly $3 billion. (JPMorgan was invited to the roundtable but did not attend). The bank's losses in recent weeks provided fodder for advocates of a strong Volcker Rule, who say that the crackdown should rein in the sort of risk-taking that prompted the problem.
Named after Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, the rule was intended to prevent future bank bailouts. Ms. Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, likewise argued on Thursday that banks ought to not place risky wagers while enjoying government backing. 
"Don't let insured deposits fund that activity," said Ms. Bair, who was known for haranguing banks while she was their regulator.
JPMorgan was conspicuously absent at the roundtable. The bank was invited to speak, but stepped back in the aftermath of the trading loss. JPMorgan said the cancellation was because of a scheduling conflict and was unrelated to the trading loss. 
Other big American banks kept their distance, too. But Wall Street still made its voice heard, dispatching industry lawyers and trade groups to testify. Barclays and Credit Suisse, two large European banks, also appeared on Thursday. 
Banks have warned that the Volcker Rule would jeopardize profits and the broader health of the economy. Noting that the definition of proprietary trading is imprecise, Wall Street says that the rule threatens to spill into legitimate practices like market-making and hedging. 
Some regulators were skeptical of those claims. 
"We heard from some folks today that tout tragedy if a sturdy Volcker Rule is approved," Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the trading commission, told DealBook on Thursday. "That's foolish phooey. There are tremendous perils for not having a strong Volcker Rule: namely another budget-busting bank bailout."

HEADLINE: The Wrong Résumé

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The evidence suggests that electing a president with a business background is actually a terrible idea. 

 BODY:
Lost in the exhaust of mendacity left in Las Vegas this week, after Donald Trump brought his birther fantasies to town on behalf of Mitt Romney, was a curious statement by the man who has now cinched the Republican nomination for president. 
On Tuesday, the same day Trump proved yet again that money and truth, like money and taste, are seldom twined, Romney talked about amending the Constitution to require the president to have business experience. He spoke approvingly of a notion from a store owner who wanted to make anyone who does not have at least three years of business background ineligible to lead the country.
"He said, 'I'd like to have a provision in the Constitution that in addition to the age of the president and the citizenship of the president and the birth place of the president being set by the Constitution, I'd like it also to say that the president has to spend at least three years working in business before he could become president of the United States,'" said Romney, cheerfully summarizing this rewrite of the founders' governing blueprint.
Well, there goes Teddy Roosevelt, the writer, rancher and police commissioner, not to mention his distant cousin Franklin Roosevelt, the assistant naval secretary and politician, or Dwight Eisenhower, the career soldier. Ike's résumé, which includes defeating the world's most concentrated form of evil in Nazi Germany, would not be not enough to qualify him for the presidency.

Romney has made business experience the main reason to elect him. Without his business past or his projections of business future, there is no there there. But history shows that time in the money trade is more often than not a prelude to a disastrous presidency. The less experience in business, the better the president.
In a scholarly ranking of great presidents, a 2009 survey conducted by C-Span,6 of the 10 best leaders lacked sufficient business experience to be president by Romney's rumination. This list includes Ronald Reagan, the actor, union activist and corporate spokesman, and John F. Kennedy, the naval officer, writer and politician. There is one failed businessman on the list of great presidents, the haberdasher Harry S. Truman.
By contrast, two 20th century businessmen - George W. Bush, whose sweetheart deal with the Texas Rangers made him a multimillionaire, and Herbert Hoover, who came by his mining fortune honestly - were ranked among the worst presidents ever by the same historians. Bush left the country in a sea of debt and an economic crisis rivaled only by the one that engulfed Hoover.
Both George W. Bush and Romney are Harvard Business School graduates, further padding their business cred. Once they started governing, both men failed to improve the economic lives of those under them.
At Bain Capital, Romney as C.E.O. practiced a very Darwinian form of capitalism for 14 years; he points to his time there as a model for how he would turn around the American economy. But it's clear that enriching a handful of shareholders often has very little to do with job creation. The point of private equity, after all, is to make deals that turn investments into profits - nothing more. In that realm, Romney has succeeded.
Once he moved from running Bain to running the Bay State, Romney was a failure at job creation. His state ranked 47th. Job growth nationwide, even under the sluggish economy of George W. Bush, was five times higher than it was in the Massachusetts run by Romney from 2003 to 2007. This was reflected in his approval ratings - 34 percent in the last full year of his term, making him one of the most unpopular governors in the country, ranked 48 out of 50.
The biggest job creator of modern times, Bill Clinton, wouldn't know a spreadsheet from a cooked derivative. His business experience was nil, but he had governing smarts, and his instincts were usually right. Under Clinton's watch, the United States added 23 million new jobs - this after he raised "job-killing" taxes on the rich.
Romney never mentions Clinton's formula for prosperity, or that of Franklin Roosevelt, the other business-challenged president who took the American economy to new highs. Roosevelt had been through a traumatic life experience, the diagnosis of polio, that made him a man of resolve, with empathy for the average person. 
"If you spent two years in bed trying to wiggle your toes, after that anything would seem easy," said Roosevelt. When he ran for president in 1932, his theme was "the forgotten man."
Romney has shown a strange tendency to fetishize wealth, from his belief that "corporations are people" to his boasting of how many Cadillacs his wife drives. His European role model would have to be Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's richest man. A media tycoon, the Rupert Murdoch of his country, Berlusconi was laughably bad as a three-time prime minister. 
The verdict is still out on Barack Obama, the community organizer, lawyer and writer. Because he got hit with the Bush hangover, his overall job numbers show a net loss of about 850,000, from January 2009 to the present. But if you start a year into his presidency, Obama has added almost four million jobs. 
We aren't electing a C.E.O. to occupy the White House. We're looking for good judgment, broad life experience, flashes of wisdom. Still, for those who insist on making business the bottom line in who they pick, the past is indeed predictive.

HEADLINE: Jamie Dimon and the Fall of Nations

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The JPMorgan Chase chief's continued presence on the board of the New York Fed fits into a dangerous historical pattern of undue influence by powerful interests, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
"Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty," by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, is a brilliant and sometimes breathtaking survey of country-level governance over history and around the world. Professors Acemoglu and Robinson discern a simple pattern - when elites are held in check, typically by effective legal mechanisms, everyone else in society does much better and sustained economic growth becomes possible. But powerful people - kings, barons, industrialists, bankers - work long and hard to relax the constraints on their actions. And when they succeed, the effects are not just redistribution toward themselves but also an undermining of economic growth and often a tearing at the fabric of society. (I've worked with the authors on related issues, but I was not involved in writing the book.)
The historical evidence is overwhelming. Many societies have done well for a while - until powerful people get out of hand. This is an easy pattern to see at a distance and in other cultures. It is typically much harder to recognize when your own society has an elite less subject to effective constraints and more able to exert power in an abusive fashion. And given the long history of strong institutions in the United States, it appears particularly difficult for some people to acknowledge that we have serious governance issues that need to be addressed.
The governance issue of the season is Jamie Dimon's seat on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Mr. Dimon is the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, currently the largest bank in the United States. This bank is "too big to fail" - meaning that if it were to get into difficulties, substantial financial support would be provided by the Federal Reserve System (and perhaps other parts of government) to prevent it from collapsing. 
I am well aware of the moves afoot to carry out the intent of the Dodd-Frank reform legislation and to make it possible for such banks to fail, with consequent losses for their creditors. In my assessment, we are still a long way from putting in place the necessary resolution mechanisms and backing them up with sufficient political will. 
If Greece were to default tomorrow - a hypothetical scenario, although I am worried about the current European trajectory - and this had devastating effects on the European and thus the United States financial system, would JPMorgan Chase be allowed to go bankrupt in the same fashion as Lehman Brothers? It would not.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York would be a key player in the decision on how to provide support and on what basis to huge financial institutions in distress - although the final determination would presumably rest with the Board of Governors in Washington.
In the Acemoglu and Robinson tour de force, I find one of the greatest elite wealth-making (for themselves) strategies of all time to be underemphasized. Persuade the government to let you build a big bank; take a great deal of risk in that bank (particularly by increasing leverage, i.e., debt relative to equity); pay yourself based on the return on equity, unadjusted for risk; get cash payouts while times are good; and when events turn against you, the central bank can bail you out - and keep you in place because you are regarded as indispensable. This is the history of modern America.
We had strong institutions for a long time in this country - including effective checks on the power of bankers. Many people remember that history and still hold its image in their mind's eye as they look at modern Wall Street. It's time to wake up. In recent decades we abandoned the governance mechanisms that previously served us well. Global megabanks have obtained excessive and inappropriate power - the power to take a great deal of risk, with cash for their executives on the upside and huge damage for the rest of us on the downside.
Since I wrote about this issue here last week, a great deal of support has been expressed for the recommendation that Jamie Dimon should step down from the board of the New York Fed - including by over 32,000 people who signed the petition I drafted. (The petition is addressed to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, as only it has the power to remove a director of a Federal Reserve Bank. I have requested an appointment with a governor on Monday, in order to deliver this petition and discuss the substantive issues; a relevant Fed staff member is currently checking availability. I hope to write about that meeting here next week.)
The pressure on Mr. Dimon is increasing with a steady flow of news articles concerning the care with which risk has been managed at his bank - including the suggestion that the risk committee of the JPMorgan Chase board lacks sufficient experience to understand or monitor the complexity of the bank's operations. (See also the coverage from Forbes and CBS MoneyWatch.)
We need an independent inquiry into exactly how JPMorgan lost so much money so quickly on its London trading operations - which supposedly were just "hedging." It would also be helpful to know how Jamie Dimon, widely regarded as a good risk manager, did not know what was happening in London until Bloomberg News brought it to his attention - and why even then he denied there was a serious issue. Is this a systematic breakdown in management and risk control systems? What exactly went wrong with the relevant models? What can we learn that would help improve the safety of the financial system? Have the largest banks grown too big and too complex to be managed safely?
More broadly, how can we rely on the Federal Reserve to oversee and constrain the actions of Mr. Dimon while he continues to sit on the board of the New York Fed - with the job of overseeing and potentially constraining the actions of that organization?
Esther George, president of the Kansas City Fed, made a strong statement at the end of last week, emphasizing that all Federal Reserve Bank board members had a responsibility to uphold the integrity and perceived legitimacy of the Federal Reserve System. She ended with a powerful line that cuts to the center of the current debate: "No individual is more important than the institution and the public's trust."
Those who would still prefer to keep Mr. Dimon in his current position rely on some combination of three counterarguments.
First, one line is that Mr. Dimon is elected to "represent the banks," so he is just doing his job when he argues his corner - for example, against financial sector reform. Ernest Patrikis, former general counsel of the New York Federal Reserve, takes exactly this position; I quoted him in my column last week.
As a factual matter, any such statement defining Mr. Dimon's responsibility as a board member at the New York Fed is inaccurate. Here are two passages from the first paragraph of the Guide to Conduct from the Board of Governors' Web site:
Directors of Federal Reserve Banks and branches have a special obligation for maintaining the integrity, dignity, and reputation of the Federal Reserve System.
To ensure the proper performance of System business and the maintenance of public confidence in the System, it is essential that directors, through adherence to high ethical standards of conduct, avoid actions that might impair the effectiveness of System operations or in any way tend to discredit the System.
Ms. George made this point clearly and effectively in her press release last week. All board members have a responsibility - first and foremost - to the Federal Reserve System. If they have a problem with that, they should avoid serving or step down when appropriate.
For example, Jeffrey R. Immelt - chief executive of General Electric - stepped down from the New York Fed board in April 2011 when it became clear that GE Capital would be regulated by the Fed as a systemically important financial institution. That was an entirely appropriate decision, removing any perception of a potential conflict of interest. (To be clear, both Mr. Immelt and the New York Fed said that he resigned because of pressures on his time.)
The second line - including from Mr. Dimon himself - is that at the New York Fed he plays "an advisory role."
Again, this is not factually accurate. Here is some relevant text from the Guide to Conduct:
In their capacity as directors, these individuals are charged by law with the responsibility of supervising and controlling the operations of the Reserve Banks, under the general supervision of the Board of Governors, and for ensuring that the affairs of the Banks are administered fairly and impartially.
Plenty of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies have advisory groups. I'm on two - for the Congressional Budget Office (for economic forecasts) and for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (for the resolution or liquidation of systemically important financial institutions). Advisory groups do not oversee budgets and are not involved in personnel decisions. 
I have no problem with the Federal Reserve - or anyone else in government - seeking and receiving input on local economic conditions. But that is no reason for a "too big to fail" banker or any other excessively powerful special interest to be on the board of the New York Fed.
The board of the New York Fed is not "advisory." If Mr. Dimon really thinks that, he needs another orientation session with New York Fed officials. Or he could read the Federal Reserve Act.
The third position acknowledges that governance at the regional Feds is an anachronism, but argues that Mr. Dimon has done nothing wrong and that these boards can be fixed only by legislative action (see this editorial in The Financial Times on Wednesday, for example).
To be clear, I am not accusing Mr. Dimon or anyone else of any wrongdoing. I am calling for an independent inquiry into the JPMorgan losses - along the lines that my M.I.T. colleague Andrew Lo has suggested for all serious financial "accidents."
I am also agreeing with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner who, when asked about Mr. Dimon's role at the New York Fed, told the PBS NewsHour:
It is very important, particularly given the damage caused by the crisis, that our system of oversight and safeguards and the enforcement authorities have not just the resources they need, but they are perceived to be above any political influence and have the independence and the ability to make sure these reforms are tough and effective so we protect the American people, again, from a crisis like this.
Legislative action to further adjust the governance of the New York Fed will not happen this year and is not likely in the near future. Frankly, saying in this context "we'll wait for Congress" is the functional equivalent of saying, "let's not fix it."
Undermining the "integrity, dignity, and reputation of the Federal Reserve System" in current fashion poses grave risks. A powerful elite has risen with control over global megabanks - and the ability to mismanage their way into disaster, with huge negative implications for the broader economy.
We should be strengthening the power of the New York Fed and other institutions to constrain reckless risk-taking. Instead, we are standing idly by while our "extractive elite" (to use a great term from Professors Acemoglu and Robinson) enrich themselves and endanger the rest of us.
If you want to see where we are heading, on our current course, read "Why Nations Fail."

HEADLINE: Trying to Solve the Great Trump Mystery

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: How is it that so many presidential aspirants and other leading Republicans all feel obliged to go to Donald Trump in supplication and kiss his ring? 

 BODY:
 Life, as we know, is filled with mysteries. Some are cosmic, like who was the first to catch a lobster and think anyone would want to eat something that looked like that? Or where do the children of circus performers run off to when they rebel against their parents?
 Then there are trivial but entrenched mysteries like one that has bewildered countless thousands of New Yorkers. It is the mystery of Donald J. Trump, or as the conservative commentator George F. Will called him, "this bloviating ignoramus."
 What prompted that outburst from the normally decorous Mr. Will was Mr. Trump's revival of his "birther" nonsense, an insistence that President Obama was born outside the United States despite ample evidence to the contrary, not the least of which is Mr. Obama's Hawaiian birth certificate. Mr. Trump's latest birther spasm coincided with a new flowering of the bromance between him and Mitt Romney, who has sewn up the Republican presidential nomination. The buddies were together again Tuesday night at a fund-raiser in Las Vegas.
 Mr. Will couldn't understand why the candidate would have anything to do with the television performer and New York real-estate nabob. "The cost of appearing with this bloviating ignoramus is obvious, it seems to me," he said on "This Week," the ABC News program. "Donald Trump is redundant evidence that if your net worth is high enough, your I.Q. can be very low, and you can still intrude into American politics."
 The commentator thus neatly captured the great Trump mystery: How is it that so many presidential aspirants and other leading Republicans - Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, one after another - all feel obliged to go to Mr. Trump in supplication and kiss his ring? As Mr. Will said, referring specifically to Mr. Romney, "What voter is going to vote for him because he is seen with Donald Trump?"
 New Yorkers certainly know better. They've long recognized Mr. Trump for what he is - a man beyond caricature, what with the hair and the pomposity and the sheer ugliness of his remarks (and of his buildings, some would add). For them, the mystery of the lobster is far easier to crack than the one about these Republican pilgrimages on bended knee.
 In search of answers, we turned to Republican political consultants in the city, serious people like Susan Del Percio and Michael McKeon. 
 Ms. Del Percio acknowledged that "as a Republican watching all of this unfold, I don't get it myself." She, too, had trouble understanding why Mr. Romney allowed himself to be "caught up in this Trump nonsense" and be "trumped by Trump."
 But "one thing I am sure of is that this doesn't happen by accident, and polling on Donald Trump is probably very good," Ms. Del Percio said. Beyond this city, she said, Americans may view him more favorably than jaded New Yorkers do, and he seems to do better among them when it comes to raising money for politicians.
 "Sometimes," she said, "you have to get out of the New York, L.A., D.C. world and see that he does have a lot to offer in the sense of celebrity. He's successful. There's a reason he has a top-rated show."
 Mr. McKeon, who used to be a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, agreed.
 "I'm not going to argue with your logic," he said after hearing our puzzlement over all the ring-kissing. But "at the end of the day," he said, "here's a guy who's had some success in business, and that's what the candidates were looking for - that kind of blessing, that 'Yes, these guys have a plan that's good for the economy.'"
 Mr. Trump is "a validator" of the candidates' credentials, Mr. McKeon said. Then too, "he can be a very potent fund-raiser."
 Still, "bloviating ignoramus" is a label that Mr. Trump may not shake anytime soon.
 For New Yorkers, his insatiable craving for attention is a dreary, stale routine. In his own way, he's not unlike the performer who bursts into the subway car demanding your immediate attention, when all you want is a few minutes to yourself. You may keep your head down and pretend not to see him, but there is no escape.
 It's the same with Donald Trump, constantly thrusting himself in front of you, begging to be noticed. No matter how much you try to look away, it's hard to tune him out entirely. Only he has none of the subway supplicant's redeeming qualities. And that guy at least apologizes for the intrusion.

HIGHLIGHT: y 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
President Obama has boasted that he handled the crisis in Libya more decisively than some of his predecessors managed conflicts they faced, but his unwillingness to take more forceful action to deal with the deteriorating situation in Syria has led observers to believe he spoke too soon, Peter Baker writes in a news analysis. Even as his ambassador to the United Nations predicts that the Syrian crisis will escalate to a regional war, Mr. Obama is constrained by limited options and a wariness at home about another military conflict.
Mitt Romney received an endorsement on Wednesday from Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, but other foreign policy stalwarts within the Republican Party have been slow to embrace him. Richard A. Oppel Jr. writes that their reluctance reflects uneasiness about Mr. Romney's hostile tone toward Russia and his opposition to a new missile treaty.
The Jewish lobbying group J Street is bucking the trend that demands candidates for elective office to take a hard-line stance in defense of Israel by encouraging a moderate approach, Eric Lichtblau writes.
Young illegal immigrants are pressing President Obama to fulfill a campaign promise to help them stay in the United States, Julia Preston writes. The young people want Mr. Obama, who needs the Latino vote in several swing states, to use his executive powers to protect them from deportation while Congress considers a proposal known as the Dream Act that would give them legal status.
Officially ending a political battle that saw threats to starve the Export-Import bank, Mr. Obama signed legislation on Wednesday that will fund the bank until 2014 at increased levels, Mark Landler writes. After highlighting the bank's importance to his goal of doubling American exports, the president urged Congress to address other items on his agenda like streamlining the refinancing of home mortgages and creating tax breaks for companies that hire new workers.
Happening In Washington:
Economic data expected today include the second estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product at 8:30 a.m., along with weekly jobless claims. Weekly mortgage rates follow at 10.
At 9:30 a.m., the House Oversight and Reform Committee will hold a hearing to assess Mr. Obama's "all of the above" energy strategy. A second hearing on the topic is scheduled for 1:30 p.m.
At 11:30, high-level Obama administration officials will participate in a town-hall-style meeting to discuss a finding that black and Puerto Rican children develop asthma at higher-than-average rates.
Shortly after noon, former President George W. Bush and Laura Bush will join President Obama at the White House for lunch and the unveiling for the former first couple's official portraits. The elder President George Bush and Barbara Bush will also be on hand for the ceremony.
At 2 p.m., a bipartisan group of House lawmakers will hold a news conference to push for a faster withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Obama Campaign's New Attack on Romney's Record as Governor

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The president's campaign has been auditioning a series of negative narratives that attempt to disqualify the Republican as a legitimate alternative to sit in the Oval Office. Now, add to that list: Mitt Romney as failed governor. 

 BODY:
How can President Obama defeat Mitt Romney?
That question is at the heart of an effort by Mr. Obama's campaign strategists to test the impact of its potentially most potent attacks against the president's rival.
In rapid-fire fashion, Mr. Obama's Chicago headquarters has been auditioning a series of negative narratives that might disqualify the Republican as a legitimate alternative to sit in the Oval Office: Mr. Romney as corporate raider at Bain Capital, Mr. Romney as enemy of women, Mr. Romney as friend of the birther movement.
Now, add to that list: Mr. Romney as failed governor.
In a detailed memo released Wednesday night by David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior campaign strategist, the campaign argues that Mr. Romney's time as governor of Massachusetts provides no legitimate basis for him to ascend to the presidency.
"Romney campaigned for governor on the promises of more jobs, decreased debt and smaller government," Mr. Axelrod writes in the memo. "When he left office, however, state debt had increased, the size of government had grown, and over his four years, Massachusetts's record of job creation was among the worst in the nation."
He concludes: "The facts are clear - it didn't work then, and it won't work now."
Mr. Axelrod and Massachusetts state lawmakers are holding a news conference Thursday morning in Boston on the steps of the Statehouse as a way of drawing media attention to the attacks. The news conference was designed to be a secret until the morning, but word leaked out Wednesday night.
The campaign is also releasing a Web video called "Broken Promises" that documents the Democratic case against Mr. Romney's tenure as governor. The four-minute video shows interviews with former and current local politicians in Massachusetts complaining about his tenure as governor.
So far, Mr. Obama's campaign has put little money behind the assault on Mr. Romney's Massachusetts record. In fact, the campaign has spent very little to push any of their negative attacks. Instead, they have sought to maximize press attention and Internet chatter in an attempt to see what works and what doesn't.
The criticism of Mr. Romney's years at Bain were leveled a couple of weeks ago with just a tiny amount of advertising. The mocking of Mr. Romney as a friend of Donald Trump came in a Web video that didn't run on any television or cable networks. And the assault on Mr. Romney's experience as governor is - so far - mostly just talk.
That strategy will eventually end. Mr. Obama's campaign is amassing a war chest of hundreds of millions of dollars that it will eventually spend to saturate battleground states with its messages and compete with Mr. Romney and outside political groups.
But which messages?
The decision by Mr. Obama's campaign to unload its political arsenal this spring gives them the chance to gauge how the attacks are received by the press, swing voters, activists and others. It also gives them a low-cost way of seeing Mr. Romney's response.
After the Bain attacks, Mr. Romney's campaign responded by accusing the president and his allies of an assault on free enterprise. For Mr. Obama's campaign, it was instructive. And the media and Twitter interest - especially after Mr. Obama embraced the Bain attacks during the NATO summit in Chicago - provided more information.
The new attacks on Mr. Romney's record as governor may be more of the same. The Web video costs the campaign little. And the surprise news conference is intended to generate news coverage of the critique.
In the long memo, Mr. Axelrod offers a list of allegations about Mr. Romney's time as the state's chief executive. There is a section on "Romney's Record on Jobs," another on "Romney's Record on Taxes," another on "Romney's Record on Deficit and Debt" and a fourth on "Romney's Record on the Size of Government."
In each, Mr. Axelrod argues that Mr. Romney made things worse for the citizens of the commonwealth.
"He carried his experience as a corporate buyout specialist to the Statehouse in Massachusetts," Mr. Axelrod says. "But in the end, Romney Economics actually resulted in fewer jobs, more debt and bigger government."
Mr. Romney's campaign reacted acidly.
 "This is another desperate attack from President Obama because he has no positive record to run on," said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign. "Mitt Romney created more jobs in the state of Massachusetts than President Obama has for the entire nation."
In a detailed response, Ms. Saul offered statistics about the decline in the state's unemployment rate (to 4.7 from 5.6 percent) during Mr. Romney's term. And she noted that personal income grew by 14 percent - more than it did in the nation at large.
The back-and-forth between the two campaigns also serves to provide a constant stream of punch-counterpunch that is now demanded by the Internet-fueled media.
But with more than five months left before voters go to the polls, both campaigns are shadow-boxing - throwing punches more to see whether they land than to try to knock out their opponent.
When it gets closer to the end, Mr. Obama's team will recycle many of the attacks, fine-tuned by the lessons they have learned during the spring.
How the campaign spends its millions will demonstrate publicly what it has learned about Mr. Romney's potential vulnerabilities and how to shape a message that resonates with voters.
In the meantime, another day on the 2012 campaign trail likely means another attack on Mr. Romney's record.
And vice versa.

HEADLINE: Romney Campaigns at Failed Solyndra Factory

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The event at Solyndra, the solar-panel company that filed for bankruptcy protection after receiving $528 million in federal loan guarantees, represents a new effort by the Romney campaign to win over independent voters. 

 BODY:
1:26 a.m. | Updated Read a full report of Thursday's presidential campaign news here.
FREMONT, Calif. - Standing outside the headquarters of Solyndra, the solar-panel company that filed for bankruptcy protection last year after receiving $528 million in federal loan guarantees, Mitt Romney decried the shuttered business as "a symbol of gross waste" and as an example of President Obama's poor stewardship of a shaky economy.
"It's a symbol not of success but of failure," Mr. Romney said. "I'm afraid the reason that the stimulus has been unsuccessful, that the turnaround has taken so long to occur, that the recovery has been tepid, is that the president fails to understand the basic nature of free enterprise in America."
Solyndra declared bankruptcy in August 2011 after having received $528 million in federal loan guarantees, and its fate has been seized on by Republicans as symptomatic of big government waste in the stimulus program and the futility of clean energy subsidies.
Mr. Romney accused the president of steering taxpayer dollars to his friends and "cronies," and of stifling free market competition by picking economic winners and losers.
"I also note how damaging a decision like this is for free enterprise generally," he said. "What you're saying to other inventors, to other entrepreneurs, particularly in the solar space, is that the best way to get ahead is not with the best ideas and the best technology and the best people and the best marketing, but instead with the best lobbyists. That is not the nature of how America works."
The stop at Solyndra's closed factory here represents a new effort by the Romney campaign to win over independent voters and draw further scrutiny to the struggling economy under Mr. Obama. The Romney campaign also believes that criticizing Mr. Obama over Solyndra will help deflect attention from the Obama campaign's recent attacks over Mr. Romney's time at the helm of Bain Capital, the private equity firm he co-founded and ran for more than a decade.
Mr. Romney's event came as David Axelrod, a senior strategist for the Obama campaign, held a news conference of his own, on the steps of the Massachusetts State House, to attack Mr. Romney's record as governor - but Mr. Axlerod's speech was largely drowned out by the chants of Romney supporters.
The dueling events signal one of the first times that the Romney and Obama campaigns are going head-to-head with campaign events, both trying to draw attention to their competing messages.
The stop at Solyndra was shrouded in secrecy. Mr. Romney's campaign refused to release the location or details, but asked reporters to gather in the morning at a parking lot in Redwood City, Calif., to board a bus heading toward an undisclosed location.
A Romney adviser explained that the campaign was worried that if Solyndra and the Obama administration knew where Mr. Romney was headed, they would do everything possible to try to prevent Mr. Romney from holding his event at the shuttered factory.
"I think there are people who don't want to see this event occur, don't want to have questions asked about this particular investment," Mr. Romney said, when asked why the campaign had gone to such lengths to keep the event a mystery.
But for all of the campaign's advance planning, Mr. Romney arrived at the dusty backdrop for his speech at nearly the same moment that former President George W. Bush was unveiling his portrait at the White House. All of the networks and cable channels opted to cover the White House live, rather than show Mr. Romney's painstakingly planned event.
Thursday's remarks were not the first time that Mr. Romney has made Solyndra an integral part of his stump speech. He frequently mentions the company on the campaign trail as an example of Mr. Obama's lack of experience in what Mr. Romney calls the "real" economy.
"Their corporate headquarters looked like the Taj Mahal, they had showers that looked like spa showers," Mr. Romney said at a campaign stop last year in Exeter, N.H., a fact he reprised on Thursday. "Oh, these guys were living high because it was government money, it was someone else's money, it was the taxpayer's money."
At a fund-raiser in the San Francisco area Wednesday night, Mr. Romney again talked about Solyndra, portraying the president as a failed venture capitalist who unsuccessfully tried to have government pick winners and losers.
"Have you seen the Solyndra corporation headquarters? You probably have," Mr. Romney asked the crowd. "That's what happens when government puts in hundreds of millions of dollars into an enterprise. And by the way, the president doesn't understand when you invest like that in one solar energy company, it makes it harder for solar technology generally because the scores of other entrepreneurs in the solar field suddenly lost their opportunity to get capital. Who wants to put money into a solar company when the government puts half a billion into one of its choice? So instead of encouraging solar energy, he discouraged it."
Returning to his overarching message, Mr. Romney concluded: "They don't understand how the free economy works."
The Obama campaign has pushed back on the Republican argument, by comparing Solyndra to Mr. Romney's experience at Bain Capital and to his record as Massachusetts governor.
"The reality is that Solyndra received funding through a Department of Energy program created under the Bush administration - a program that has supported tens of thousands of jobs across the country and is moving forward with investments in innovative projects like the first nuclear plant built in the U.S. in decades and the world's largest wind farm," said Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, in a statement. "In fact, both Republican and Democratic administrations advanced Solyndra's application, and the company was widely praised as successful and innovative both before and after receiving the Department of Energy loan guarantee.
Ms. Smith added, "As governor, Mitt Romney's record was one of dismal job creation, outsourcing, increased spending and the highest per capita debt in the nation. Now, he'd cede the clean energy industry and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that come with it to China in order to please his Big Oil campaign donors, including keeping massive tax cuts for the oil industry on the middle class's dime. Massachusetts couldn't afford Romney Economics, and America can't either."
Because of an editing error, a photo caption in an earlier version of this post misspelled the name of the California town where Mitt Romney held a campaign event on Thursday. It is Fremont, not Freemont.

HEADLINE: Fight Reignited Over Student Loan Rates

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: With the Senate on recess and the House just back in action after its week off, the fight over how to deal with an impending increase in some student loan rates was reignited Thursday when Congressional Republicans sent a letter to the White House offering some suggestions of how to pay for an extended lower loan rate. 

 BODY:
With the Senate in recess and the House just back in action after its week off, the fight over how to deal with an impending increase in some student loan rates was reignited Thursday when Congressional Republicans sent a letter to the White House offering some suggestions on how to pay for an extended lower loan rate.
The letter was sent a few hours after Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio told fellow Republicans that he believed that the rate on subsidized undergraduate loans -- currently set at 3.4 percent - would probably revert to 6.8 percent on July 1 because he was not sure that Congress would take the necessary action.
This set off a mini-firestorm among Democrats in both chambers. "Today, Speaker Boehner confirmed to his conference what was already obvious," said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California.
In April, the House passed a billthat would freeze the one-year rates at a cost of $5.9 billion by stripping billions from a prevention program in the health care law, something Democrats have said they would not brook. Many Republicans, who do not favor extending the rates, were not interested in passing the bill at all; 13 Democrats, largely moderates, pushed it to passage, and 30 Republicans voted against it.

Senate Democrats failed to clear a procedural vote on their own student loan bill, which would have paid for the extension with a change to a law that allows some wealthy taxpayers to avoid paying Social Security and Medicare taxes by classifying their pay as dividends, not cash income, known in that chamber as the "John Edwards law."
On Thursday, Republican leaders in both chambers sent a letter to President Obama offering some new ideas for paying for the extension, culled in part from his own budget.
One would increase current employee contributions to the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employee Retirement System by four-tenths of 1 percent. Another would limit the period during which students can receive in-school interest subsidies for subsidized Stafford loans, and adjust taxes for Medicaid providers and require state and local government pension payers to use programs to prevent workers from double-dipping on pensions.
All of those ideas are less controversial than the one offered in the original House bill, but each has its detractors. The fight over the student loan bill mirrors a similar skirmish last year over the extension of a payroll tax holiday for workers, in which each party is trying to claim the title of best friend to the middle class.

HEADLINE: Pressure Continues on Regulators to Approve Volcker Rule

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: On Thursday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission held a public roundtable to solicit ideas from banks, academics and other experts on the contentious Volcker Rule, which seeks to ban banks from making risky bets with their own money. 

 BODY:
In the wake of JPMorgan's multibillion-dollar trading loss, regulators are under pressure to beef up the proposed Volcker Rule.
On Thursday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission held a public roundtable to solicit ideas from banks, academics and other experts on the contentious rule, which seeks to ban banks from making risky bets with their own money. The trading commission is one of five regulatory agencies writing the rule, borne from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law. 
The effort has also faced an onslaught of opposition from Wall Street lobbyists, who argue that the Volcker Rule could stifle their ability to hedge against risk. But the ban on proprietary trading, regulators noted on Thursday, exempts most transactions that involve hedging. 
"Some commenters have said if we're too prohibitive in one area, we may limit banking entities ability to engage in risk-mitigating hedging," Gary Gensler, chairman of the trading commission, said at the roundtable. "On the other hand, if we follow comments of some of the banking entities, then the rule's allowance for permitted hedging might swallow up Congress's intent to limit the risk of proprietary trading."
The roundtable, which also featured testimony from major investors like the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the rule's supporters like Sheila Bair, came against the backdrop of JPMorgan's recent trading blunder, which is so far pegged at roughly $3 billion. (JPMorgan was invited to the roundtable but did not attend). The bank's losses in recent weeks provided fodder for advocates of a strong Volcker Rule, who say that the crackdown should rein in the sort of risk-taking that prompted the problem.
Named after Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, the rule was intended to prevent future bank bailouts. Ms. Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, likewise argued on Thursday that banks ought to not place risky wagers while enjoying government backing. 
"Don't let insured deposits fund that activity," said Ms. Bair, who was known for haranguing banks while she was their regulator.
JPMorgan was conspicuously absent at the roundtable. The bank was invited to speak, but stepped back in the aftermath of the trading loss. JPMorgan said the cancellation was because of a scheduling conflict and was unrelated to the trading loss. 
Other big American banks kept their distance, too. But Wall Street still made its voice heard, dispatching industry lawyers and trade groups to testify. Barclays and Credit Suisse, two large European banks, also appeared on Thursday. 
Banks have warned that the Volcker Rule would jeopardize profits and the broader health of the economy. Noting that the definition of proprietary trading is imprecise, Wall Street says that the rule threatens to spill into legitimate practices like market-making and hedging. 
Some regulators were skeptical of those claims. 
"We heard from some folks today that tout tragedy if a sturdy Volcker Rule is approved," Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the trading commission, told DealBook on Thursday. "That's foolish phooey. There are tremendous perils for not having a strong Volcker Rule: namely another budget-busting bank bailout."

HEADLINE: The Wrong Résumé

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The evidence suggests that electing a president with a business background is actually a terrible idea. 

 BODY:
Lost in the exhaust of mendacity left in Las Vegas this week, after Donald Trump brought his birther fantasies to town on behalf of Mitt Romney, was a curious statement by the man who has now cinched the Republican nomination for president. 
On Tuesday, the same day Trump proved yet again that money and truth, like money and taste, are seldom twined, Romney talked about amending the Constitution to require the president to have business experience. He spoke approvingly of a notion from a store owner who wanted to make anyone who does not have at least three years of business background ineligible to lead the country.
"He said, 'I'd like to have a provision in the Constitution that in addition to the age of the president and the citizenship of the president and the birth place of the president being set by the Constitution, I'd like it also to say that the president has to spend at least three years working in business before he could become president of the United States,'" said Romney, cheerfully summarizing this rewrite of the founders' governing blueprint.
Well, there goes Teddy Roosevelt, the writer, rancher and police commissioner, not to mention his distant cousin Franklin Roosevelt, the assistant naval secretary and politician, or Dwight Eisenhower, the career soldier. Ike's résumé, which includes defeating the world's most concentrated form of evil in Nazi Germany, would not be not enough to qualify him for the presidency.

Romney has made business experience the main reason to elect him. Without his business past or his projections of business future, there is no there there. But history shows that time in the money trade is more often than not a prelude to a disastrous presidency. The less experience in business, the better the president.
In a scholarly ranking of great presidents, a 2009 survey conducted by C-Span,6 of the 10 best leaders lacked sufficient business experience to be president by Romney's rumination. This list includes Ronald Reagan, the actor, union activist and corporate spokesman, and John F. Kennedy, the naval officer, writer and politician. There is one failed businessman on the list of great presidents, the haberdasher Harry S. Truman.
By contrast, two 20th century businessmen - George W. Bush, whose sweetheart deal with the Texas Rangers made him a multimillionaire, and Herbert Hoover, who came by his mining fortune honestly - were ranked among the worst presidents ever by the same historians. Bush left the country in a sea of debt and an economic crisis rivaled only by the one that engulfed Hoover.
Both George W. Bush and Romney are Harvard Business School graduates, further padding their business cred. Once they started governing, both men failed to improve the economic lives of those under them.
At Bain Capital, Romney as C.E.O. practiced a very Darwinian form of capitalism for 14 years; he points to his time there as a model for how he would turn around the American economy. But it's clear that enriching a handful of shareholders often has very little to do with job creation. The point of private equity, after all, is to make deals that turn investments into profits - nothing more. In that realm, Romney has succeeded.
Once he moved from running Bain to running the Bay State, Romney was a failure at job creation. His state ranked 47th. Job growth nationwide, even under the sluggish economy of George W. Bush, was five times higher than it was in the Massachusetts run by Romney from 2003 to 2007. This was reflected in his approval ratings - 34 percent in the last full year of his term, making him one of the most unpopular governors in the country, ranked 48 out of 50.
The biggest job creator of modern times, Bill Clinton, wouldn't know a spreadsheet from a cooked derivative. His business experience was nil, but he had governing smarts, and his instincts were usually right. Under Clinton's watch, the United States added 23 million new jobs - this after he raised "job-killing" taxes on the rich.
Romney never mentions Clinton's formula for prosperity, or that of Franklin Roosevelt, the other business-challenged president who took the American economy to new highs. Roosevelt had been through a traumatic life experience, the diagnosis of polio, that made him a man of resolve, with empathy for the average person. 
"If you spent two years in bed trying to wiggle your toes, after that anything would seem easy," said Roosevelt. When he ran for president in 1932, his theme was "the forgotten man."
Romney has shown a strange tendency to fetishize wealth, from his belief that "corporations are people" to his boasting of how many Cadillacs his wife drives. His European role model would have to be Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's richest man. A media tycoon, the Rupert Murdoch of his country, Berlusconi was laughably bad as a three-time prime minister. 
The verdict is still out on Barack Obama, the community organizer, lawyer and writer. Because he got hit with the Bush hangover, his overall job numbers show a net loss of about 850,000, from January 2009 to the present. But if you start a year into his presidency, Obama has added almost four million jobs. 
We aren't electing a C.E.O. to occupy the White House. We're looking for good judgment, broad life experience, flashes of wisdom. Still, for those who insist on making business the bottom line in who they pick, the past is indeed predictive.

HEADLINE: Jamie Dimon and the Fall of Nations

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The JPMorgan Chase chief's continued presence on the board of the New York Fed fits into a dangerous historical pattern of undue influence by powerful interests, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
"Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty," by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, is a brilliant and sometimes breathtaking survey of country-level governance over history and around the world. Professors Acemoglu and Robinson discern a simple pattern - when elites are held in check, typically by effective legal mechanisms, everyone else in society does much better and sustained economic growth becomes possible. But powerful people - kings, barons, industrialists, bankers - work long and hard to relax the constraints on their actions. And when they succeed, the effects are not just redistribution toward themselves but also an undermining of economic growth and often a tearing at the fabric of society. (I've worked with the authors on related issues, but I was not involved in writing the book.)
The historical evidence is overwhelming. Many societies have done well for a while - until powerful people get out of hand. This is an easy pattern to see at a distance and in other cultures. It is typically much harder to recognize when your own society has an elite less subject to effective constraints and more able to exert power in an abusive fashion. And given the long history of strong institutions in the United States, it appears particularly difficult for some people to acknowledge that we have serious governance issues that need to be addressed.
The governance issue of the season is Jamie Dimon's seat on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Mr. Dimon is the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, currently the largest bank in the United States. This bank is "too big to fail" - meaning that if it were to get into difficulties, substantial financial support would be provided by the Federal Reserve System (and perhaps other parts of government) to prevent it from collapsing. 
I am well aware of the moves afoot to carry out the intent of the Dodd-Frank reform legislation and to make it possible for such banks to fail, with consequent losses for their creditors. In my assessment, we are still a long way from putting in place the necessary resolution mechanisms and backing them up with sufficient political will. 
If Greece were to default tomorrow - a hypothetical scenario, although I am worried about the current European trajectory - and this had devastating effects on the European and thus the United States financial system, would JPMorgan Chase be allowed to go bankrupt in the same fashion as Lehman Brothers? It would not.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York would be a key player in the decision on how to provide support and on what basis to huge financial institutions in distress - although the final determination would presumably rest with the Board of Governors in Washington.
In the Acemoglu and Robinson tour de force, I find one of the greatest elite wealth-making (for themselves) strategies of all time to be underemphasized. Persuade the government to let you build a big bank; take a great deal of risk in that bank (particularly by increasing leverage, i.e., debt relative to equity); pay yourself based on the return on equity, unadjusted for risk; get cash payouts while times are good; and when events turn against you, the central bank can bail you out - and keep you in place because you are regarded as indispensable. This is the history of modern America.
We had strong institutions for a long time in this country - including effective checks on the power of bankers. Many people remember that history and still hold its image in their mind's eye as they look at modern Wall Street. It's time to wake up. In recent decades we abandoned the governance mechanisms that previously served us well. Global megabanks have obtained excessive and inappropriate power - the power to take a great deal of risk, with cash for their executives on the upside and huge damage for the rest of us on the downside.
Since I wrote about this issue here last week, a great deal of support has been expressed for the recommendation that Jamie Dimon should step down from the board of the New York Fed - including by over 32,000 people who signed the petition I drafted. (The petition is addressed to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, as only it has the power to remove a director of a Federal Reserve Bank. I have requested an appointment with a governor on Monday, in order to deliver this petition and discuss the substantive issues; a relevant Fed staff member is currently checking availability. I hope to write about that meeting here next week.)
The pressure on Mr. Dimon is increasing with a steady flow of news articles concerning the care with which risk has been managed at his bank - including the suggestion that the risk committee of the JPMorgan Chase board lacks sufficient experience to understand or monitor the complexity of the bank's operations. (See also the coverage from Forbes and CBS MoneyWatch.)
We need an independent inquiry into exactly how JPMorgan lost so much money so quickly on its London trading operations - which supposedly were just "hedging." It would also be helpful to know how Jamie Dimon, widely regarded as a good risk manager, did not know what was happening in London until Bloomberg News brought it to his attention - and why even then he denied there was a serious issue. Is this a systematic breakdown in management and risk control systems? What exactly went wrong with the relevant models? What can we learn that would help improve the safety of the financial system? Have the largest banks grown too big and too complex to be managed safely?
More broadly, how can we rely on the Federal Reserve to oversee and constrain the actions of Mr. Dimon while he continues to sit on the board of the New York Fed - with the job of overseeing and potentially constraining the actions of that organization?
Esther George, president of the Kansas City Fed, made a strong statement at the end of last week, emphasizing that all Federal Reserve Bank board members had a responsibility to uphold the integrity and perceived legitimacy of the Federal Reserve System. She ended with a powerful line that cuts to the center of the current debate: "No individual is more important than the institution and the public's trust."
Those who would still prefer to keep Mr. Dimon in his current position rely on some combination of three counterarguments.
First, one line is that Mr. Dimon is elected to "represent the banks," so he is just doing his job when he argues his corner - for example, against financial sector reform. Ernest Patrikis, former general counsel of the New York Federal Reserve, takes exactly this position; I quoted him in my column last week.
As a factual matter, any such statement defining Mr. Dimon's responsibility as a board member at the New York Fed is inaccurate. Here are two passages from the first paragraph of the Guide to Conduct from the Board of Governors' Web site:
Directors of Federal Reserve Banks and branches have a special obligation for maintaining the integrity, dignity, and reputation of the Federal Reserve System.
To ensure the proper performance of System business and the maintenance of public confidence in the System, it is essential that directors, through adherence to high ethical standards of conduct, avoid actions that might impair the effectiveness of System operations or in any way tend to discredit the System.
Ms. George made this point clearly and effectively in her press release last week. All board members have a responsibility - first and foremost - to the Federal Reserve System. If they have a problem with that, they should avoid serving or step down when appropriate.
For example, Jeffrey R. Immelt - chief executive of General Electric - stepped down from the New York Fed board in April 2011 when it became clear that GE Capital would be regulated by the Fed as a systemically important financial institution. That was an entirely appropriate decision, removing any perception of a potential conflict of interest. (To be clear, both Mr. Immelt and the New York Fed said that he resigned because of pressures on his time.)
The second line - including from Mr. Dimon himself - is that at the New York Fed he plays "an advisory role."
Again, this is not factually accurate. Here is some relevant text from the Guide to Conduct:
In their capacity as directors, these individuals are charged by law with the responsibility of supervising and controlling the operations of the Reserve Banks, under the general supervision of the Board of Governors, and for ensuring that the affairs of the Banks are administered fairly and impartially.
Plenty of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies have advisory groups. I'm on two - for the Congressional Budget Office (for economic forecasts) and for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (for the resolution or liquidation of systemically important financial institutions). Advisory groups do not oversee budgets and are not involved in personnel decisions. 
I have no problem with the Federal Reserve - or anyone else in government - seeking and receiving input on local economic conditions. But that is no reason for a "too big to fail" banker or any other excessively powerful special interest to be on the board of the New York Fed.
The board of the New York Fed is not "advisory." If Mr. Dimon really thinks that, he needs another orientation session with New York Fed officials. Or he could read the Federal Reserve Act.
The third position acknowledges that governance at the regional Feds is an anachronism, but argues that Mr. Dimon has done nothing wrong and that these boards can be fixed only by legislative action (see this editorial in The Financial Times on Wednesday, for example).
To be clear, I am not accusing Mr. Dimon or anyone else of any wrongdoing. I am calling for an independent inquiry into the JPMorgan losses - along the lines that my M.I.T. colleague Andrew Lo has suggested for all serious financial "accidents."
I am also agreeing with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner who, when asked about Mr. Dimon's role at the New York Fed, told the PBS NewsHour:
It is very important, particularly given the damage caused by the crisis, that our system of oversight and safeguards and the enforcement authorities have not just the resources they need, but they are perceived to be above any political influence and have the independence and the ability to make sure these reforms are tough and effective so we protect the American people, again, from a crisis like this.
Legislative action to further adjust the governance of the New York Fed will not happen this year and is not likely in the near future. Frankly, saying in this context "we'll wait for Congress" is the functional equivalent of saying, "let's not fix it."
Undermining the "integrity, dignity, and reputation of the Federal Reserve System" in current fashion poses grave risks. A powerful elite has risen with control over global megabanks - and the ability to mismanage their way into disaster, with huge negative implications for the broader economy.
We should be strengthening the power of the New York Fed and other institutions to constrain reckless risk-taking. Instead, we are standing idly by while our "extractive elite" (to use a great term from Professors Acemoglu and Robinson) enrich themselves and endanger the rest of us.
If you want to see where we are heading, on our current course, read "Why Nations Fail."

HEADLINE: Trying to Solve the Great Trump Mystery

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: How is it that so many presidential aspirants and other leading Republicans all feel obliged to go to Donald Trump in supplication and kiss his ring? 

 BODY:
 Life, as we know, is filled with mysteries. Some are cosmic, like who was the first to catch a lobster and think anyone would want to eat something that looked like that? Or where do the children of circus performers run off to when they rebel against their parents?
 Then there are trivial but entrenched mysteries like one that has bewildered countless thousands of New Yorkers. It is the mystery of Donald J. Trump, or as the conservative commentator George F. Will called him, "this bloviating ignoramus."
 What prompted that outburst from the normally decorous Mr. Will was Mr. Trump's revival of his "birther" nonsense, an insistence that President Obama was born outside the United States despite ample evidence to the contrary, not the least of which is Mr. Obama's Hawaiian birth certificate. Mr. Trump's latest birther spasm coincided with a new flowering of the bromance between him and Mitt Romney, who has sewn up the Republican presidential nomination. The buddies were together again Tuesday night at a fund-raiser in Las Vegas.
 Mr. Will couldn't understand why the candidate would have anything to do with the television performer and New York real-estate nabob. "The cost of appearing with this bloviating ignoramus is obvious, it seems to me," he said on "This Week," the ABC News program. "Donald Trump is redundant evidence that if your net worth is high enough, your I.Q. can be very low, and you can still intrude into American politics."
 The commentator thus neatly captured the great Trump mystery: How is it that so many presidential aspirants and other leading Republicans - Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, one after another - all feel obliged to go to Mr. Trump in supplication and kiss his ring? As Mr. Will said, referring specifically to Mr. Romney, "What voter is going to vote for him because he is seen with Donald Trump?"
 New Yorkers certainly know better. They've long recognized Mr. Trump for what he is - a man beyond caricature, what with the hair and the pomposity and the sheer ugliness of his remarks (and of his buildings, some would add). For them, the mystery of the lobster is far easier to crack than the one about these Republican pilgrimages on bended knee.
 In search of answers, we turned to Republican political consultants in the city, serious people like Susan Del Percio and Michael McKeon. 
 Ms. Del Percio acknowledged that "as a Republican watching all of this unfold, I don't get it myself." She, too, had trouble understanding why Mr. Romney allowed himself to be "caught up in this Trump nonsense" and be "trumped by Trump."
 But "one thing I am sure of is that this doesn't happen by accident, and polling on Donald Trump is probably very good," Ms. Del Percio said. Beyond this city, she said, Americans may view him more favorably than jaded New Yorkers do, and he seems to do better among them when it comes to raising money for politicians.
 "Sometimes," she said, "you have to get out of the New York, L.A., D.C. world and see that he does have a lot to offer in the sense of celebrity. He's successful. There's a reason he has a top-rated show."
 Mr. McKeon, who used to be a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, agreed.
 "I'm not going to argue with your logic," he said after hearing our puzzlement over all the ring-kissing. But "at the end of the day," he said, "here's a guy who's had some success in business, and that's what the candidates were looking for - that kind of blessing, that 'Yes, these guys have a plan that's good for the economy.'"
 Mr. Trump is "a validator" of the candidates' credentials, Mr. McKeon said. Then too, "he can be a very potent fund-raiser."
 Still, "bloviating ignoramus" is a label that Mr. Trump may not shake anytime soon.
 For New Yorkers, his insatiable craving for attention is a dreary, stale routine. In his own way, he's not unlike the performer who bursts into the subway car demanding your immediate attention, when all you want is a few minutes to yourself. You may keep your head down and pretend not to see him, but there is no escape.
 It's the same with Donald Trump, constantly thrusting himself in front of you, begging to be noticed. No matter how much you try to look away, it's hard to tune him out entirely. Only he has none of the subway supplicant's redeeming qualities. And that guy at least apologizes for the intrusion.

HIGHLIGHT: y 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
President Obama has boasted that he handled the crisis in Libya more decisively than some of his predecessors managed conflicts they faced, but his unwillingness to take more forceful action to deal with the deteriorating situation in Syria has led observers to believe he spoke too soon, Peter Baker writes in a news analysis. Even as his ambassador to the United Nations predicts that the Syrian crisis will escalate to a regional war, Mr. Obama is constrained by limited options and a wariness at home about another military conflict.
Mitt Romney received an endorsement on Wednesday from Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, but other foreign policy stalwarts within the Republican Party have been slow to embrace him. Richard A. Oppel Jr. writes that their reluctance reflects uneasiness about Mr. Romney's hostile tone toward Russia and his opposition to a new missile treaty.
The Jewish lobbying group J Street is bucking the trend that demands candidates for elective office to take a hard-line stance in defense of Israel by encouraging a moderate approach, Eric Lichtblau writes.
Young illegal immigrants are pressing President Obama to fulfill a campaign promise to help them stay in the United States, Julia Preston writes. The young people want Mr. Obama, who needs the Latino vote in several swing states, to use his executive powers to protect them from deportation while Congress considers a proposal known as the Dream Act that would give them legal status.
Officially ending a political battle that saw threats to starve the Export-Import bank, Mr. Obama signed legislation on Wednesday that will fund the bank until 2014 at increased levels, Mark Landler writes. After highlighting the bank's importance to his goal of doubling American exports, the president urged Congress to address other items on his agenda like streamlining the refinancing of home mortgages and creating tax breaks for companies that hire new workers.
Happening In Washington:
Economic data expected today include the second estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product at 8:30 a.m., along with weekly jobless claims. Weekly mortgage rates follow at 10.
At 9:30 a.m., the House Oversight and Reform Committee will hold a hearing to assess Mr. Obama's "all of the above" energy strategy. A second hearing on the topic is scheduled for 1:30 p.m.
At 11:30, high-level Obama administration officials will participate in a town-hall-style meeting to discuss a finding that black and Puerto Rican children develop asthma at higher-than-average rates.
Shortly after noon, former President George W. Bush and Laura Bush will join President Obama at the White House for lunch and the unveiling for the former first couple's official portraits. The elder President George Bush and Barbara Bush will also be on hand for the ceremony.
At 2 p.m., a bipartisan group of House lawmakers will hold a news conference to push for a faster withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Obama Campaign's New Attack on Romney's Record as Governor

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The president's campaign has been auditioning a series of negative narratives that attempt to disqualify the Republican as a legitimate alternative to sit in the Oval Office. Now, add to that list: Mitt Romney as failed governor. 

 BODY:
How can President Obama defeat Mitt Romney?
That question is at the heart of an effort by Mr. Obama's campaign strategists to test the impact of its potentially most potent attacks against the president's rival.
In rapid-fire fashion, Mr. Obama's Chicago headquarters has been auditioning a series of negative narratives that might disqualify the Republican as a legitimate alternative to sit in the Oval Office: Mr. Romney as corporate raider at Bain Capital, Mr. Romney as enemy of women, Mr. Romney as friend of the birther movement.
Now, add to that list: Mr. Romney as failed governor.
In a detailed memo released Wednesday night by David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior campaign strategist, the campaign argues that Mr. Romney's time as governor of Massachusetts provides no legitimate basis for him to ascend to the presidency.
"Romney campaigned for governor on the promises of more jobs, decreased debt and smaller government," Mr. Axelrod writes in the memo. "When he left office, however, state debt had increased, the size of government had grown, and over his four years, Massachusetts's record of job creation was among the worst in the nation."
He concludes: "The facts are clear - it didn't work then, and it won't work now."
Mr. Axelrod and Massachusetts state lawmakers are holding a news conference Thursday morning in Boston on the steps of the Statehouse as a way of drawing media attention to the attacks. The news conference was designed to be a secret until the morning, but word leaked out Wednesday night.
The campaign is also releasing a Web video called "Broken Promises" that documents the Democratic case against Mr. Romney's tenure as governor. The four-minute video shows interviews with former and current local politicians in Massachusetts complaining about his tenure as governor.
So far, Mr. Obama's campaign has put little money behind the assault on Mr. Romney's Massachusetts record. In fact, the campaign has spent very little to push any of their negative attacks. Instead, they have sought to maximize press attention and Internet chatter in an attempt to see what works and what doesn't.
The criticism of Mr. Romney's years at Bain were leveled a couple of weeks ago with just a tiny amount of advertising. The mocking of Mr. Romney as a friend of Donald Trump came in a Web video that didn't run on any television or cable networks. And the assault on Mr. Romney's experience as governor is - so far - mostly just talk.
That strategy will eventually end. Mr. Obama's campaign is amassing a war chest of hundreds of millions of dollars that it will eventually spend to saturate battleground states with its messages and compete with Mr. Romney and outside political groups.
But which messages?
The decision by Mr. Obama's campaign to unload its political arsenal this spring gives them the chance to gauge how the attacks are received by the press, swing voters, activists and others. It also gives them a low-cost way of seeing Mr. Romney's response.
After the Bain attacks, Mr. Romney's campaign responded by accusing the president and his allies of an assault on free enterprise. For Mr. Obama's campaign, it was instructive. And the media and Twitter interest - especially after Mr. Obama embraced the Bain attacks during the NATO summit in Chicago - provided more information.
The new attacks on Mr. Romney's record as governor may be more of the same. The Web video costs the campaign little. And the surprise news conference is intended to generate news coverage of the critique.
In the long memo, Mr. Axelrod offers a list of allegations about Mr. Romney's time as the state's chief executive. There is a section on "Romney's Record on Jobs," another on "Romney's Record on Taxes," another on "Romney's Record on Deficit and Debt" and a fourth on "Romney's Record on the Size of Government."
In each, Mr. Axelrod argues that Mr. Romney made things worse for the citizens of the commonwealth.
"He carried his experience as a corporate buyout specialist to the Statehouse in Massachusetts," Mr. Axelrod says. "But in the end, Romney Economics actually resulted in fewer jobs, more debt and bigger government."
Mr. Romney's campaign reacted acidly.
 "This is another desperate attack from President Obama because he has no positive record to run on," said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign. "Mitt Romney created more jobs in the state of Massachusetts than President Obama has for the entire nation."
In a detailed response, Ms. Saul offered statistics about the decline in the state's unemployment rate (to 4.7 from 5.6 percent) during Mr. Romney's term. And she noted that personal income grew by 14 percent - more than it did in the nation at large.
The back-and-forth between the two campaigns also serves to provide a constant stream of punch-counterpunch that is now demanded by the Internet-fueled media.
But with more than five months left before voters go to the polls, both campaigns are shadow-boxing - throwing punches more to see whether they land than to try to knock out their opponent.
When it gets closer to the end, Mr. Obama's team will recycle many of the attacks, fine-tuned by the lessons they have learned during the spring.
How the campaign spends its millions will demonstrate publicly what it has learned about Mr. Romney's potential vulnerabilities and how to shape a message that resonates with voters.
In the meantime, another day on the 2012 campaign trail likely means another attack on Mr. Romney's record.
And vice versa.

HEADLINE: Romney Campaigns at Failed Solyndra Factory

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The event at Solyndra, the solar-panel company that filed for bankruptcy protection after receiving $528 million in federal loan guarantees, represents a new effort by the Romney campaign to win over independent voters. 

 BODY:
1:26 a.m. | Updated Read a full report of Thursday's presidential campaign news here.
FREMONT, Calif. - Standing outside the headquarters of Solyndra, the solar-panel company that filed for bankruptcy protection last year after receiving $528 million in federal loan guarantees, Mitt Romney decried the shuttered business as "a symbol of gross waste" and as an example of President Obama's poor stewardship of a shaky economy.
"It's a symbol not of success but of failure," Mr. Romney said. "I'm afraid the reason that the stimulus has been unsuccessful, that the turnaround has taken so long to occur, that the recovery has been tepid, is that the president fails to understand the basic nature of free enterprise in America."
Solyndra declared bankruptcy in August 2011 after having received $528 million in federal loan guarantees, and its fate has been seized on by Republicans as symptomatic of big government waste in the stimulus program and the futility of clean energy subsidies.
Mr. Romney accused the president of steering taxpayer dollars to his friends and "cronies," and of stifling free market competition by picking economic winners and losers.
"I also note how damaging a decision like this is for free enterprise generally," he said. "What you're saying to other inventors, to other entrepreneurs, particularly in the solar space, is that the best way to get ahead is not with the best ideas and the best technology and the best people and the best marketing, but instead with the best lobbyists. That is not the nature of how America works."
The stop at Solyndra's closed factory here represents a new effort by the Romney campaign to win over independent voters and draw further scrutiny to the struggling economy under Mr. Obama. The Romney campaign also believes that criticizing Mr. Obama over Solyndra will help deflect attention from the Obama campaign's recent attacks over Mr. Romney's time at the helm of Bain Capital, the private equity firm he co-founded and ran for more than a decade.
Mr. Romney's event came as David Axelrod, a senior strategist for the Obama campaign, held a news conference of his own, on the steps of the Massachusetts State House, to attack Mr. Romney's record as governor - but Mr. Axlerod's speech was largely drowned out by the chants of Romney supporters.
The dueling events signal one of the first times that the Romney and Obama campaigns are going head-to-head with campaign events, both trying to draw attention to their competing messages.
The stop at Solyndra was shrouded in secrecy. Mr. Romney's campaign refused to release the location or details, but asked reporters to gather in the morning at a parking lot in Redwood City, Calif., to board a bus heading toward an undisclosed location.
A Romney adviser explained that the campaign was worried that if Solyndra and the Obama administration knew where Mr. Romney was headed, they would do everything possible to try to prevent Mr. Romney from holding his event at the shuttered factory.
"I think there are people who don't want to see this event occur, don't want to have questions asked about this particular investment," Mr. Romney said, when asked why the campaign had gone to such lengths to keep the event a mystery.
But for all of the campaign's advance planning, Mr. Romney arrived at the dusty backdrop for his speech at nearly the same moment that former President George W. Bush was unveiling his portrait at the White House. All of the networks and cable channels opted to cover the White House live, rather than show Mr. Romney's painstakingly planned event.
Thursday's remarks were not the first time that Mr. Romney has made Solyndra an integral part of his stump speech. He frequently mentions the company on the campaign trail as an example of Mr. Obama's lack of experience in what Mr. Romney calls the "real" economy.
"Their corporate headquarters looked like the Taj Mahal, they had showers that looked like spa showers," Mr. Romney said at a campaign stop last year in Exeter, N.H., a fact he reprised on Thursday. "Oh, these guys were living high because it was government money, it was someone else's money, it was the taxpayer's money."
At a fund-raiser in the San Francisco area Wednesday night, Mr. Romney again talked about Solyndra, portraying the president as a failed venture capitalist who unsuccessfully tried to have government pick winners and losers.
"Have you seen the Solyndra corporation headquarters? You probably have," Mr. Romney asked the crowd. "That's what happens when government puts in hundreds of millions of dollars into an enterprise. And by the way, the president doesn't understand when you invest like that in one solar energy company, it makes it harder for solar technology generally because the scores of other entrepreneurs in the solar field suddenly lost their opportunity to get capital. Who wants to put money into a solar company when the government puts half a billion into one of its choice? So instead of encouraging solar energy, he discouraged it."
Returning to his overarching message, Mr. Romney concluded: "They don't understand how the free economy works."
The Obama campaign has pushed back on the Republican argument, by comparing Solyndra to Mr. Romney's experience at Bain Capital and to his record as Massachusetts governor.
"The reality is that Solyndra received funding through a Department of Energy program created under the Bush administration - a program that has supported tens of thousands of jobs across the country and is moving forward with investments in innovative projects like the first nuclear plant built in the U.S. in decades and the world's largest wind farm," said Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, in a statement. "In fact, both Republican and Democratic administrations advanced Solyndra's application, and the company was widely praised as successful and innovative both before and after receiving the Department of Energy loan guarantee.
Ms. Smith added, "As governor, Mitt Romney's record was one of dismal job creation, outsourcing, increased spending and the highest per capita debt in the nation. Now, he'd cede the clean energy industry and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that come with it to China in order to please his Big Oil campaign donors, including keeping massive tax cuts for the oil industry on the middle class's dime. Massachusetts couldn't afford Romney Economics, and America can't either."
Because of an editing error, a photo caption in an earlier version of this post misspelled the name of the California town where Mitt Romney held a campaign event on Thursday. It is Fremont, not Freemont.

HEADLINE: Fight Reignited Over Student Loan Rates

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: With the Senate on recess and the House just back in action after its week off, the fight over how to deal with an impending increase in some student loan rates was reignited Thursday when Congressional Republicans sent a letter to the White House offering some suggestions of how to pay for an extended lower loan rate. 

 BODY:
With the Senate in recess and the House just back in action after its week off, the fight over how to deal with an impending increase in some student loan rates was reignited Thursday when Congressional Republicans sent a letter to the White House offering some suggestions on how to pay for an extended lower loan rate.
The letter was sent a few hours after Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio told fellow Republicans that he believed that the rate on subsidized undergraduate loans -- currently set at 3.4 percent - would probably revert to 6.8 percent on July 1 because he was not sure that Congress would take the necessary action.
This set off a mini-firestorm among Democrats in both chambers. "Today, Speaker Boehner confirmed to his conference what was already obvious," said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California.
In April, the House passed a billthat would freeze the one-year rates at a cost of $5.9 billion by stripping billions from a prevention program in the health care law, something Democrats have said they would not brook. Many Republicans, who do not favor extending the rates, were not interested in passing the bill at all; 13 Democrats, largely moderates, pushed it to passage, and 30 Republicans voted against it.

Senate Democrats failed to clear a procedural vote on their own student loan bill, which would have paid for the extension with a change to a law that allows some wealthy taxpayers to avoid paying Social Security and Medicare taxes by classifying their pay as dividends, not cash income, known in that chamber as the "John Edwards law."
On Thursday, Republican leaders in both chambers sent a letter to President Obama offering some new ideas for paying for the extension, culled in part from his own budget.
One would increase current employee contributions to the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employee Retirement System by four-tenths of 1 percent. Another would limit the period during which students can receive in-school interest subsidies for subsidized Stafford loans, and adjust taxes for Medicaid providers and require state and local government pension payers to use programs to prevent workers from double-dipping on pensions.
All of those ideas are less controversial than the one offered in the original House bill, but each has its detractors. The fight over the student loan bill mirrors a similar skirmish last year over the extension of a payroll tax holiday for workers, in which each party is trying to claim the title of best friend to the middle class.

 BODY:
Weakness in Facebook Stock Adds to Pause in I.P.O.'s | In the days since the highly anticipated opening of Facebook turned into a flop, the effect has become worse as would-be issuers have taken a second look at what they are getting into.
In one of the latest setbacks, Kayak, a discount travel Web site, did not like what it saw and postponed its initial public offering on Wednesday, a person briefed on the matter said. The company's roadshow for investors, which was expected to begin soon, has been delayed for the time being, this person said.
Not all initial public offering troubles can be pinned on Facebook. Europe's economic woes have worsened and investors are seeking safety, not the risk of new stock issues from companies with little public track record.
Still, Facebook, by failing to instill confidence among investors and executives, has made a weak market weaker. No offerings have priced since Facebook's debut on May 18. And as of Wednesday, only one company, Loyalty Alliance Enterprise, was set to go public anytime in the near future. DealBook »

HEADLINE: Prosecutors Try to Prove Gupta's Link to Galleon Trades

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Among the government's hurdles in its insider trading case against Rajat K. Gupta is proving that he benefited from any illegal trades. 

 BODY:
Among the government's hurdles in its insider trading case against Rajat K. Gupta is proving that he benefited from any illegal trades.
Mr. Gupta, 63, a former head of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, did not make any direct profits on the trades in question. He lost money on his investment with the Galleon Group, a hedge fund run by Raj Rajaratnam. Prosecutors say Mr. Gupta provided insider tips to Mr. Rajaratnam, who was convicted by a jury last year.
On Thursday, the eighth day of the trial at Federal District Court in Manhattan, the government sought to make its case against Mr. Gupta by showing that he played an active role in Galleon's business. Prosecutors called to the witness stand Ayad Alhadi, a former executive on Galleon's marketing team.
To help win business, Mr. Alhadi said he leaned on Mr. Gupta, who in 2008 began helping Galleon raise money and took on the title of chairman of Galleon International. In early 2008, Mr. Alhadi and Mr. Gupta traveled to the Middle East for two days of back-to-back meetings with deep-pocketed investors like the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Emirates Bank.
At least two of the Middle East firms that Mr. Alhadi and Mr. Gupta pitched on their trip invested in Galleon's funds.
For some investors, a meeting with Mr. Gupta was like having a meeting with a rock star, Mr. Alhadi told government investigators in a pretrial interview, according to the defense. (Mr. Alhadi said he did not recall saying that.) In an e-mail to a banker that was going to help Galleon set up meetings, Mr. Alhadi praised Mr. Gupta's credentials.
"I will be in the Emirates with Rajat Gupta, a friend and adviser to Galleon," Mr. Alhadi wrote. "He's a highly respected global business leader and I know a meeting with him would be very worthwhile."
In another e-mail, Mr. Alhadi gushed to Mr. Gupta about the reaction of an executive at the National Bank of Abu Dhabi when he heard about Mr. Gupta's Galleon connection.
"When I told him about your affiliation with Galleon he was extremely impressed," Mr. Alhadi wrote. "He said it would be an 'honor to meet you.' "
Also on Thursday, prosecutors called Stephen Pierce, a senior executive at Goldman Sachs, to the witness stand to describe the secrecy surrounding some of the information that Mr. Gupta is accused of leaking. Mr. Pierce was actively involved in helping Goldman raise $10 billion in capital on Sept. 23, 2008, during the depths of the financial crisis. The money provided a vital lifeline to Goldman and lifted its stock price. Prosecutors contend that Mr. Gupta, who as a Goldman director had to approve that deal, leaked the information to Mr. Rajaratnam.
Mr. Pierce's testimony provided some levity and drama to the otherwise tedious proceedings.
He described to the jury that he was called away from the final game at the old Yankee Stadium on Sept. 21 to work on the Goldman deal.
"What was the significance of being there on that day?" asked a prosecutor.
Judge Jed S. Rakoff, a Yankees season ticket holder and die-hard fan who is overseeing the trial, could not resist interjecting.
"As opposed to the significance of being there on any other day?" the judge said, eliciting laughter from the jury.
Mr. Pierce said that he had received a call from his boss about an emergency conference call with the bank's top executives to discuss strategies for raising capital. He said he was having trouble finding a quiet place at the stadium to have the conversation.
"The only place I could find was a janitorial closet, so that's where I did the call," Mr. Pierce said.
Judge Rakoff again interjected, asking Mr. Pierce if he was sure he had not been in the Yankees manager's office.
Mr. Pierce said that he walked out of the closet, went back to his seats to tell his cousin he had to leave, and then hailed a taxi back to Goldman's offices. The next two days, he said, were spent working round the clock to get the deal done.
On cross-examination, the defense tried to suggest to the jury that the Goldman news was not as confidential as Mr. Pierce had indicated. Mr. Gupta's lawyer showed an e-mail that Mr. Pierce sent to his own lawyer - David Scherl at Morrison Cohen - at 5:08 p.m. on Sept. 23, 2008 - about a half-hour before the capital raise was announced.
"Watch the tape," Mr. Pierce wrote, suggesting that Mr. Scherl look out for a news announcement on the financial wires. "Hard work pays off."
Right after Goldman released the news, at 5:50 p.m., the lawyer, Mr. Scherl at Morrison Cohen, replied to Mr. Pierce.
"I am psyched for YOU, STUD ... well done," he wrote. "Well done. Feel proud, Buddy."
Judge Rakoff's courtroom also had a chance to feature New York's other baseball team.
Mario M. Cuomo, the former governor of New York, took a seat in the back row of the spectators' gallery toward the end of Thursday's proceedings. Mr. Cuomo served as the mediator in the legal dispute between the Madoff trustee and the owners of the Mets.
At 5 p.m., after the Gupta trial broke for the day, Judge Rakoff approved a $162 million settlement between the two sides.

 BODY:
Weakness in Facebook Stock Adds to Pause in I.P.O.'s | In the days since the highly anticipated opening of Facebook turned into a flop, the effect has become worse as would-be issuers have taken a second look at what they are getting into.
In one of the latest setbacks, Kayak, a discount travel Web site, did not like what it saw and postponed its initial public offering on Wednesday, a person briefed on the matter said. The company's roadshow for investors, which was expected to begin soon, has been delayed for the time being, this person said.
Not all initial public offering troubles can be pinned on Facebook. Europe's economic woes have worsened and investors are seeking safety, not the risk of new stock issues from companies with little public track record.
Still, Facebook, by failing to instill confidence among investors and executives, has made a weak market weaker. No offerings have priced since Facebook's debut on May 18. And as of Wednesday, only one company, Loyalty Alliance Enterprise, was set to go public anytime in the near future. DealBook »

Graff had planned to price its I.P.O. on Friday and begin trading on the Hong Kong stock market on June 7, according to its prospectus. DealBook »
