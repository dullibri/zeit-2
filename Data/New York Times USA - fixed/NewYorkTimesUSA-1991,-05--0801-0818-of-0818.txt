HEADLINE: ECONOMIC SCENE;
A Balancing Act In Military Policy

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IN struggling to redesign its post-cold war, post- Persian Gulf war military policy, the United States is caught in a time warp between the short run and the long run.
In the short run, the main problem is the current recession and the likelihood that the recovery will be sluggish, with unemployment persisting in both military-related and nonmilitary industries. If the Bush Administration cuts military spending too much, it will aggravate the recession. In the long run, the main problem is the budget deficit, which gobbles up national savings and drags down rates of investment and economic growth. If the Administration cuts military spending too little, the budget deficit will worsen. 
 The Government's effort to deal simultaneously with both the short- and long-run problems is reflected in this week's agreement by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to reduce United States forces in Europe by 50 percent by the end of the decade, as well as in President Bush's plan for controlling arms shipments to the Middle East.
The Administration has yet to produce its overall plan for a military policy in the new era, but, as John Steinbruner, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institutions, observed yesterday, both the NATO cut in American forces and Mr. Bush's arms control plan for the Middle East may be regarded as parts of a "larger whole."
By the Pentagon's own calculations, the United States commitment to NATO accounts for roughly half the total American military budget, which is estimated at $289.9 billion in the current fiscal year. The long-run savings at NATO could go a long way toward ending the budget deficit.
That will awaken worries in some quarters that the economy will be squeezed. But in the next few years, such a squeeze is highly improbable. The NATO cuts are not scheduled to start until the end of 1994 or be completed until 2000. Indeed, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said the immediate effect of bringing troops home from Europe would be to increase costs, rather than reduce them. To realize large savings, it would be necessary to demobilize troops and cut outlays on maintaining them and their equipment.
That is not about to happen. The NATO agreement calls for building "an augmentation force," probably exclusively American, to reinforce existing NATO forces in the event of a threat of war. Such an augmentation force also means higher spending on airlifts and sealifts.
In the aggregate, the United States military budget is still on a gradual declining course of 3 percent a year in real terms, that is, adjusted for inflation. Mr. Steinbruner suggests that there is some possibility that after 1993, military spending might resume its upward course.
Mr. Bush has been warning Congress that he will veto any Federal budget that does not provide for continuing outlays for the Strategic Defense Initiative and the B-2 bomber, programs with enormous potential for growth. And there are strong local pressures against closing military bases.
Lacking other fiscal means of stimulating the economy, the Administration appears to be pressing for export-led growth -- including military exports. Mr. Bush's new arms-control proposal would ban nuclear, chemical and biological weapons in the Middle East, along with sales of surface-to-surface missiles.
Mr. Bush also proposed an early meeting of representatives of the five principal arms suppliers -- the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China -- to discuss ending sales of "destabilizing" conventional weapons to Middle Eastern countries. But which sales of conventional weapons are to be regarded as destabilizing, and which stabilizing, will be a subject of hot debate, with national interests clashing.
Mr. Bush's arms-control proposal will also have to be reconciled with his own plans for continuing to supply advanced arms to America's allies in the region, especially Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The Defense Budget Project, a Washington-based nonprofit research organization, notes that for 20 years the Middle East has been the largest single international arms market.
Countries in the region received about $89 billion in arms transfers from 1984 through 1988. Europe was the next biggest customer, with military imports of just over $50 billion.
If Mr. Bush can block the sale of strategic weapons to the Middle East while keeping conventional American arms flowing to favored countries, he may be able to further both his geopolitical and economic goals.
And if, in cooperation with America's allies and erstwhile adversaries, he can set a course for large cuts in United States military spending in Europe, there would be significant relief for the nation's yawning budget deficit. This week's NATO and Middle Eastern moves represented an impulse to redesign United States military strategy in the interests of a more stable economy and geopolitical system.

HEADLINE: Gloom on New York Farms As Milk Price Seesaws Low

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COBLESKILL, N.Y., MAY 30

 BODY:
Behind the picture-postcard beauty of rural upstate New York, where lush green alfalfa waves in the breeze next to the earth tones of newly planted fields of corn, the reality is grim as dairy farmers struggle to survive.
 "The dairy situation is terrible," said Peter Schuyler, who milks 100 cows on his 500-acre farm here in Schoharie County, about 40 miles west of Albany. "Last year prices were way up, but this year they are way down." As an emergency measure, the State Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, Richard T. McGuire, early this month ordered a 7-cent-a-gallon increase, effective June 1, in the price that farmers receive for milk.
That means consumers will probably pay more, too, industry spokesmen say. 
 "The cost side for consumers will be at least 12 cents a gallon," said Marc Goldman, president of Farmland Dairies of Wallingford, N.J., a major milk bottler supplying the metropolitan New York market.
Mr. McGuire's order will bring the farm price of milk up to almost 25 cents a quart, still much less than what most farmers think is needed to make a profit. In April farmers received an average price of $10.81 for a hundred pounds of milk, or 23.2 cents a quart, down 15 percent from April 1990.
 
Retailers' Margin Increasing
 The average supermarket price in metropolitan New York in April was 80 cents a quart and $1.45 a half gallon. Prices have been roughly the same since January 1990.
The retail price has not dropped in line with the farm decline because the difference has been largely retained by retailers, according to the state's Department of Agriculture. It said the retailers' margin above what they paid for a half gallon of milk in January was 49 cents, up from 34 cents the year before and from 23 cents in January 1989.
In announcing the new farm increase, Commissioner McGuire warned retailers against price gouging.
Citing the increased retail margins, he said, "We think it is only fair that retailers absorb this small increase without raising prices." Mr. McGuire took his action at a time when the minimum price paid to farmers, set under a complicated Federal milk marketing system, has continued to drop because of a national surplus of milk.
Paradoxically, even though the number of milk cows is at a record low of 755,000 in New York and many farmers have gone out of business, milk production is up because of increased efficiency on the remaining farms.
In 1990, New York's 12,000 dairy farmers produced 11.1 billion pounds of milk, slightly more than in 1989. They sold it for $1.59 billion, up 3 percent from the previous year. With that production, New York remains the third leading dairy state in the nation, behind Wisconsin and California.
 
A Bad Year Indicated
 All signs so far this year indicate that this will be a bad year financially for New York's dairy farmers because of the low milk prices. Commissioner McGuire has quoted industry spokesmen as saying that as many as 10 percent of the state's dairy farmers may go out of business this year.
Here in Schoharie County, the plight of dairy farming is told both in statistics and in the stories of two young farmers, both with college degrees in agriculture and struggling to stay in business.
Over all, the number of dairy farms in the county has fallen from 318 in 1982 to 175 this year, said Terry Batchelder, the local farm agent of the Cornell University Cooperative Extension Service.
The decrease is visible from the barn on Daniel Schuppel's farm on the Old Looneburg Turnpike, once the main route of travel by ox cart and stagecoach between the Hudson River and the West.
"Look out there," Mr. Schuppel said, pointing to the hills and fields across the road. "A year and a half ago you could see six other dairy farms in operation. Now I am the only one left."
 
Living on Negative Income
 Mr. Schuppel, who is 35 years old, lives with his wife, Susan, and their son, Sean, 2, on a 300-acre farm that he bought from his father last year. He is a graduate of Cobleskill College with a degree in animal science.
He gets up every morning at 3 A.M. to start milking his cows, which produce about 4,000 pounds of milk a day. He doesn't get to bed until 10 P.M. His cows, on the average, each produce about 19,900 pounds of milk a year.
Last year Mr. Schuppel's farm grossed $260,000. Of that, he said, he was able to keep $7,800. "That's what we lived on," he said.
Despite falling prices, Mr. Schuppel said he expected his gross income would rise this year because he has increased his milking herd from 70 cows to 90. "But my net income will be negative," he said.
"My current price is 94 cents a gallon and my production costs are $1.50," he said. "That means my loss is 56 cents a gallon."
 
'Too Beautiful to Give Up'
 How can he survive?
"You borrow, you beg, you make proper adjustments, you do without," he replied. "It's my love for the industry that keeps me going. It's a way of life, it's the rural atmosphere. It's too beautiful to give up. My father turned the farm over to me, and I intend to encourage my son to take over, if he wants to."
Five miles away, on the Stolzenburg farm, the economic picture is slightly better. Mark Stolzenburg, who is 33, and his father, Carl, are partners, growing crops on 220 acres and milking 65 cows. They produce 3,700 pounds of milk a day, with an average annual production of 22,000 pounds a cow, much higher than on most farms.
The younger Mr. Stolzenburg, who has a master's degree in plant pathology from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University, lives on the farm with his wife, Nan, and their daughter Lindsay, not quite 1 year old. His father is the chief mechanic, and his mother keeps the books.
"We're breaking even; we are paying our bills," Mark Stolzenburg said. "We are in a better situation than most farms because we have no debt load. But with the current price of milk, we're stagnant. We can't replace our equipment, and we've cut back on purchases."

HEADLINE: Marines Fear Glory of War Will Give Way to Old Stigma

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMP PENDLETON, Calif., May 24

 BODY:
The enlisted marines returning from the Persian Gulf have seen their social status rocket. Rounds of drinks are bought by strangers, signs of welcome adorn the stores, and homecoming parades have been thronged by cheering spectators.
But underneath the euphoria of victory these men, many from blue-collar families, remain aware that common soldiering is not always so highly prized in American society. They remember too well the hotels that once turned them away, fearing that unruly men might damage property; the car dealers who refused to give them financing, and the snubs of better-heeled classmates in high school who went on to college.
 
Sensing Glory Will Fade
"My parents didn't have money and I wanted to make something of myself," said Sgt. James W. Ohlstrom, who worked in a pizza parlor in Highland, Ind., before joining the Marines. "I didn't live in a military area and people would look at the recruiters funny when they came down the hall. They used to call me Mr. Marine, but I didn't have nowhere else to go and nothing else to do." 
 Now, with the war over, being a marine is giving these young men more than a sense of purpose; this has been a time of glory. But they suspect it will not last.
"When all this glory is over, it will be back to the same old stuff," said Lance Cpl. Roger E. Griffith, who has spent six years in the Marine Corps.
Over a period of two months in the gulf and a week at Camp Pendleton, dozens of enlisted men -- most from the First Battalion, First Marine Division, which was one of the first units into Kuwait -- discussed their feelings about their lives in the Corps. They repeatedly contrasted the widespread support they received during and after the war with their previous, bitter experiences in civilian society in peacetime.
Many said they were treated better as visitors to foreign countries during their frequent cruises in Navy vessels, including Thailand and the Philippines, than they had been in their own before the war.
Disdain toward enlisted men and women is not a new phenomenon. Even in World War II, property owners around San Diego and Camp Pendleton posted signs warning "dogs and sailors" to stay off the grass.
Marine Corps infantrymen, known to one another as "grunts" or as "jar heads" for their closely shorn hair, may have one of the most thankless tasks in the armed forces.
Even in peacetime, infantrymen spend long periods in the field. An array of officers tell them where to go and what to do. They are paid about $1,000 a month, and in many wars, infantrymen suffer high casualty rates.
The stigma of being an enlisted man burns deep in many marines. They have little love for their officers and even less affection for civilians.
"These civilians see us and they think we are jar heads who should stay away from their daughters," said Marlin L. Reeves, a 21-year-old lance corporal from Odessa, Tex.
Some marines say they believe this attitude still lurks behind some of the effusive welcomes they have received. And while many said they were deeply moved by their reception, they added that they believed the public would eventually turn its admiration somewhere else.
Although the aptitudes and the economic profiles of enlisted marines have risen since the end of the Vietnam War, there is still a perception in the all-volunteer force, and perhaps in society as a whole, that this is a job for the sons and daughters of blue-collar families. The loss of many blue-collar jobs has, indeed, meant that many young men and women of modest means have fewer opportunities than their parents.
"We are reaching a point in society where some people feel the only choice they have is the military because of the economic and social systems," said the Rev. Harold E. Palmer Jr., a United Methodist chaplain at Pendleton.
 
Enthusiasm and Guilt
 Many enlisted men say they believe that some of the current enthusiasm for the military springs from guilt among members of the upper middle class who did not have to send their sons and daughters in large numbers to fight in the gulf.
The feeling is not new; in his poem "Tommy," about the plight of the British common soldier, Kipling wrote: "For it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' 'Chuck 'im out, the brute!'/ But it's 'Savior of 'is country' when the guns begin to shoot."
"These people felt guilty," said Cpl. Michael J. Champagne of Iberia, La. "They didn't have to do nothing and their kids weren't involved."
"The military is left for us poor boys," said Lance Cpl. Joseph E. Smyth, 21, of Puma, Ariz., "and all those rich college kids out there know that."
But the marines are not blind to their own shortcomings. Many readily acknowledged that the stigma was rooted in the roughhouse image of enlisted military that has grown up in communities around bases.
"Marines are rowdy by nature," Corporal Griffith said. "We have to be. Compare our job to the Navy or Army. We take the jobs no one else will take."
Young enlisted men here often travel to Oceanside and other towns around Camp Pendleton in groups. They are instantly recognizable by their military haircuts and swagger. The arms of many are adorned with USMC tattoos and their cheeks filled with chewing tobacco.
Weekend liberty often consists of seven or eight marines pitching in to rent a cheap hotel room, where they guzzle beer and watch cable television movies.
 
Formulas for Trouble
 "Any group of young men in any organization can create trouble when they go out," said Lieut. Col. Michael O. Fallon, commander of the First Battalion during its deployment in the gulf. "You see it among fraternity members or gangs in the inner city."
"If you are trying to build a team on the base, you can't say the minute they are off duty and off base they can't build a team," said Colonel Fallon, whose battalion was instrumental in repelling an Iraqi counterattack in Kuwait.
And battalion commanders contend that behavior has improved in the last decade with the quality of recruits, most of whom have completed high school.
"I have been in hotels that won't rent to military," said Lieut. James M. Bright, whose platoon took out 33 Iraqi vehicles, "although lots of time it is our own fault because the military goes into a place, parties and tears things up."
While many marines admit they are sometimes rough, they also say they believe in their calling. They are hurt when they think the world fails to recognize what they have accomplished and what it means to be a marine.
A few years ago Sgt. Rene Reyna, 31, of Mission, Tex., dated a woman who was attending Oklahoma University. He had spent eight years in the Marines, cloistered in the hermetic world of the military, rising through the ranks.
"I thought I was one of God's chosen few," he said.
But when he showed up on campus for his first visit, he was stunned by his reception. "They equated me like a common laborer," he said of the students. "It made me feel very insignificant. It was very disheartening. My whole world was shaken up."
Many marines say the condescension they feel from outsiders serves to isolate young marines.
"The average soldier feels isolated from civilian society, but not by choice," said a Marine Corps chaplain who requested anonymity. "These soldiers want to be accepted for what they do because they believe very strongly in the ideals behind what they do."
Many marines said it was not just their profession that was misunderstood, but the nature of war itself. They said the parades and celebration, coupled with the sanitized news reports, had failed to convey the sordid reality of war.
The carnage suffered by Iraqi forces in the first few hours of armed clashes, some said, was enough to turn stomachs.
"I don't think the American public has a clue as to how terrible the war was," said Lieutenant Bright. "They watch war movies, or these documentaries, but they don't sense the confusion, the fear. They don't see their buddies get shot. It is all so ordered and clean on television. They don't know even 2 percent of it. It will never be easy for us who were there to wage war. It is a terrible thing to have to do."

HEADLINE: New Claims By Jobless Off

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
New applications for unemployment insurance benefits fell in mid-May, the Labor Department said today, providing fresh evidence that the recession may be bottoming out.
The departmnt said the number of new applicants for unemployment insurance benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 445,000 in the week ended May 18. That was 9,000 fewer applicants than the week before, when 454,000 unemployed workers filed for benefits, which was 5,000 fewer than the week before that. 
 Economists had expected the report to show about 451,000 new applications.
The latest jobless benefits report shows a continuing trend toward companies laying off fewer workers.
"It looks as though the worst may be behind us," said Paul Lally, an economist at Citicorp Investment Bank.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Drops 0.1%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
Consumers, lacking any appreciable increase in incomes, trimmed their spending one-tenth of 1 percent in April, the Commerce Department said today in a report that suggested the recovery from the recession would be sluggish.
"There's a strong indication in the latest numbers that the recovery is going to be quite weaker than normal," said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York securities firm. 
 Personal incomes, the department said, another key to recovery, rose just one-tenth of 1 percent, to $4.76 trillion at an annual rate, up from $4.75 trillion a month earlier.
Despite the small gain, it was the third consecutive advance in incomes. The department also revised the March increase to four-tenths of 1 percent, rather than the two-tenths of 1 percent in its original report.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which many expect to lead the economy out of the recession, totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.78 trillion in April.
That was down from $3.782 trillion in March and ended a two-month string of advances. Still, the revised 1.1 percent gain in March was stronger than the six-tenths of 1 percent advance first reported.
Consumer spending represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. But analysts said consumers were restrained by high unemployment and interest rates and weak income growth and tight credit.
 
Consumers 'On the Sidelines'
 "Consumers have taken it on the chin from a lot of directions and have hunkered down," Mr. Jones said.
Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Company of Chicago, agreed. "The consumer continues to sit quietly on the sidelines watching the world go by," he said.
The decline in personal consumption included an $11.9 billion plunge in spending on durable goods -- items ranging from cars to computers expected to last more than three years. It wiped out much of a $14.9 billion gain in March.
Spending on nondurable goods, including food and fuel, fell $5.2 billion after rising just $400 million a month earlier. Spending on services, which jumped $25.9 billion in March, slowed to a $12.9 billion gain in April.
On the other hand, disposable income -- income after taxes -- was unchanged in April after rising four-tenths of 1 percent in March and three-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier.
But reflecting the slower spending, Americans' savings rate inched up to 3.6 percent of after-tax income, from 3.5 percent in March.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Rose In April

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
Sales of new homes advanced 1.2 percent in April, the Government said today, and analysts cited the third straight monthly gain as further evidence that the housing sector is recovering slowly from its recession.
"We're forecasting a continuous but modest upswing," said David F. Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders. "Nothing much has happened to lead you to a rapid upswing in sales at this point." 
 In fact, he added, "our surveys of builders in early May contained signals that things might slip back a bit in May." But on balance, he said, "we do seem to be on an up trend."
The Departments of Commerce and of Housing and Urban Development said in a report that sales of single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 500,000 units, up from 494,000 in March.
The April increase was the third since sales plunged 10.8 percent, to a 414,000 rate in January -- the lowest since the 1981-82 recession.
Sales rebounded 18.1 percent in February and notched up another 1 percent in March.
Analysts were particularly heartened by a 46.8 percent jump in new-home sales in the Northeast, to an annual rate of 69,000 units, where the industry has experienced its greatest weakness.
"These data support the impression that the industry is recovering, albeit slowly," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist with the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation in New York.
The belief that the housing recession touched bottom in January has been reinforced by recent advances in sales of existing homes, in housing starts and in applications for buildings permits.
Nevertheless, new-home sales for the first four months of 1991 were 16.7 percent below those for the corresponding period last year.
And the Commerce Department also reported today that the median price of a new home slipped 1.1 percent, to $122,000, in April. The median means half of the homes cost more and half less.
The number of Americans behind on mortgage payments also rose by 341,000 in the first three months of this year, with states in the Northeast and the South suffering the most, the Mortgage Bankers Association said today.
The percentage of homeowners behind 30 days or more on their payments climbed in the first quarter to 4.95 percent of the 45.6 million mortgage holders.

HEADLINE: Broad Rise Lifts Dow Above 3,000

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
With investors more hopeful than ever that the economy is building up steam, the Dow Jones industrial average smashed through the 3,000 barrier yesterday for the first time in a month and a half.
Cyclical stocks, from paper and chemicals to heavy machinery and media, were among the strongest gainers. 
 Although the blue-chip barometer soared to 3,015 by a little after 3 P.M., it ended the day up 30.86 points, at 3,000.45, its second-highest close ever. The day's gain, slightly more than 1 percent, was the fourth straight increase.
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said that eight buying waves throughout the session lifted the Dow 35 points, suggesting that professional activity was a big factor in helping the blue chips.
The market's move followed a further sign of rebound in the housing market, as the Government reported that sales of new homes advanced 1.2 percent in April. Another report, though, showed that consumers, lacking any appreciable increase in incomes, cut back spending by a tenth of a percent. [Page D9.]
 
Transportation Gains
 The Dow transportation index, another important key to what investors think of the economy, jumped 2.1 percent, or double the gain by the industrial average.
The even broader-based Standard & Poor's 500-stock index spurted 1.1 percent, rising 4.17 points, to 386.96, with investors moving money into everything that consumers want when they have disposable income.
Smaller stocks also showed exceptional gains, with the American Stock Exchange market-value index rising 1 percent, slightly more than the Nasdaq composite for the first day in a long time.
And for a somewhat different reason, foreigners are also beginning to nibble at American stocks.
Noting that NATO discussions were under way to reduce the American military role in Europe, Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers, said he saw some foreign buying yesterday. "Foreigners see less downward pressure on the dollar now and are more inclined to buy stock here," he continued.
"I think the summer rally has begun," said Kenneth M. Spence, director of technical analysis for Salomon Brothers. Yesterday's rise "could signal a move to 3,100 soon," he added.
Trading soared to 234.4 million shares, the strongest since April 17, when the Dow industrials closed at their high of 3,004.46. Advances led declines on the New York Stock Exchange by a significant 2.5 to 1. Moreover, an impressive 149 stocks soared to new highs for the year while only 8 fell to new lows.
The sharply rising bond market, Mr. Spence said, "helped stocks a lot." On top of that, he continued, the market went through two important resistance levels -- 2,970 on the Dow and 384 for the S.& P. 500 -- where they had been stalled since almost mid-May.
"The Dow has been the lagging index among all the important indexes," he said, "and now, because of its heavier makeup of cyclical stocks, it's starting to catch up."
Asked what the sharp rise in the Dow transports means, he replied, "It means that investors are anticipating a recovery in the economy as evidenced by the increased demand for those companies that transport goods."
 
Widespread Advances
 Advances among the Dow industrials were widespread.
Except for Disney, which slid 2 Wednesday and 2 yesterday, to 116 3/4, after two analysts downgraded the stock, gains of a point or more helped Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Caterpillar, Procter & Gamble, Westinghouse Electric, Allied-Signal, Eastman Kodak, International Paper, Boeing, Du Pont, General Electric, Woolworth and J. P. Morgan.
Among the Dow transports, AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose 2 1/4, to 65 1/4, while UAL rose 4 1/4, to 152 1/8. Delta Air Lines advanced 1 3/8, to 74; Burlington Northern 1 3/4, to 33 3/8, and Conrail 1 5/8, to 55 1/4.
In chemicals, PPG Industries, which also makes glass, climbed 3 5/8, to 53 1/8; Olin 2 1/8, to 49 1/4; Dow Chemical 1 1/4, to 54 1/2; B. F. Goodrich 1 3/8, to 40, and Monsanto 2 5/8, to 69 1/8. Harvey Stober of Dean Witter Reynolds has been recommending PPG on the strength of its earnings forecasts and Monsanto because he expects a new share buyback program soon.
 
Groups Leading the Market
 Mr. Spence of Salomon Brothers said that among the groups leading the market -- and expected to continue to outperform the market -- were paper, steel, chemicals, aluminum and machinery among the commodity stocks; household furnishings, autos, newspapers, publishing, gaming and hotels and motels among the consumer cyclical stocks, and retailing and transportation stocks.
Upjohn, a perennial takeover stock, rose 1 3/4, to 45 1/4, with 3.5 million shares changing hands. Dan Dorfman, the financial commentator, reported a rumor that Hoechst had made an offer, but the German company denied it.

Stocks Advance in Tokyo
 TOKYO, Friday, May 31 (Reuters) -- Stock prices rose today in Tokyo. At about a half-hour before the close of trading, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks was up 214.52 points, or eight-tenths of a percent, to 25,861.92.

HEADLINE: Harlem's Apollo Fights to Keep the Lights On

BYLINE: By E. R. SHIPP

 BODY:
Chicago had the Regal. Philadelphia had the Uptown. Washington had the Howard. But Harlem had "the world famous Apollo Theater" and what was said to be the toughest audience in the world.
Now one of the few surviving theaters that catered to blacks before widespread integration, the Apollo is awash in nostalgia, from photographs of old stars to the stump of the Tree of Hope that would-be stars rubbed for luck. 
 But the Apollo, which has lost $2 million a year since 1988, is also in financial difficulty. A $20 million renovation that was to make it the center of revitalization on West 125th Street, Harlem's main commercial strip, has instead resulted in the development of a seldom used state-of-the-art entertainment complex, with a recording studio and television production center.
 
'Debilitating Investment'
 "The concept makes a lot of sense," said Donald J. Cogsville, the president of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, which has $1.4 million in loans tied up in the Apollo. "The concept may work several years from now, but it isn't working now."
The Apollo's losses prompted Percy E. Sutton, the entrepreneur who rescued it from bankruptcy a decade ago, to announce in February that he was ready to give it up. The project had been "an exhausting, debilitating investment of money, time, energy and family patience," he wrote the New York State Urban Development Corporation, which has loaned $9 million to Mr. Sutton's company, the Apollo Theater Investor Group.
Then Mr. Sutton heard from the public -- in Harlem, throughout the nation and as far away as Japan -- demanding that the theater be saved. Politicians and entertainers like Bill Cosby, Dionne Warwick, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder and Madonna, joined with financiers, urban development specialists and music industry executives in a scramble to insure the theater's future.
But it will not be an easy task. A review of the theater's financial documents and interviews with Mr. Sutton and state officials, show that efforts to rescue the Apollo for a decade have been driven almost as much by sentiment, community pride and political expediency as by sound business judgment. The renovation project that cost more than $20 million was originally to cost $5.7 million. Nonetheless, the theater remains the embodiment of the community's dreams of renewal after decades of decline.
"We cannot talk about Harlem coming back without talking about 125th Street and we cannot talk about that without talking about the Apollo," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Harlem native who is helping to save the theater.
 
Too Small to Afford Big Names
 Once the epicenter of entertainment life in Harlem, the Apollo is now the extension of Mr. Sutton's dream of empowering black people through ownership and control of communications outlets, including radio stations and cable-television franchises.
"Percy was doing this mostly as a labor of love," said Vincent Tese, the chairman of the New York State Urban Development Corporation. "If Percy was a cold businessman, he would never have touched this with a 10-foot pole."
For one thing, the Apollo, with 1,477 seats, is simply too small to attract big-name entertainers and turn a profit.
As Mr. Cosby said in an interview at the theater, where he gave three performances last week to benefit Harlem Hospital: "The Apollo still exists at a time when people are playing ballparks. They're playing 6,000-seaters. It economically makes no sense whatsoever for an act to come here."
 
Decline Began With Integration
 The decline of the Apollo began when New York's downtown nightclubs and the Las Vegas hotels began opening their doors to black entertainers.
"We fought for integration and as soon as integration occurred, the Sammy Davises and other performers that were well known no longer had to come to the Apollo to perform," said Mr. Sutton, a lawyer and longtime civil rights advocate.
Miss Warwick, whose gospel group won one of the Apollo's amateur night competitions in 1959, shared that view.
"The Apollo couldn't afford to pay what we were able to receive in other areas, which is not the greatest excuse to give since most people considered the Apollo a home base," she said in a telephone interview from Cancun, Mexico. "The Copacabana opened up. The Persian Room was calling for acts such as myself. It was sort of a step in the direction that I wanted to go."
 
Closed in 1978
 The Apollo, after struggling along for years, closed in 1978. Then came Mr. Sutton, whose Inner City Broadcasting Corporation was expanding its holdings to include cable television.
His Apollo Theater Investor Group paid $225,000 for the theater in a bankruptcy sale. Later, to obtain financing, the group transferred the property to the state, which leased it back to Mr. Sutton's group.
Mr. Sutton and his family have since had to learn about operating a theater and related activities, relying heavily on financial and entertainment consultants. While the consultants' predictions may have been sound in the early 1980's, they were less than sound when the project was completed in 1988.
The way to "expand" the number of seats in the theater, the consultants said, was to produce programs for network and cable television, including concerts that could be sold on a pay-per-view basis. To do that, the Apollo bought what Mr. Sutton described as "the Rolls-Royces" of television and recording equipment.
 
$5.7 Million Spent on Advisers
 "They said, 'It's Harlem and you're not going to be able to get people there unless you have a very beautiful and high-tech place,' " Mr. Sutton said of the advisers. "So little by little our costs increased."
By the time the renovations were completed, nearly $5.7 million was spent on consultants, accountants, lawyers, architects, surveys, inspections and financing fees alone. At the same time, adhering to conflicting Federal, state and local construction rules added to the project's cost, as did the difficulty in trying to obtain financing.
And construction delays, one of which occurred when a construction management company had "run up a bill close to $800,000 prior to any major construction at all," sent the Apollo project beyond original cost expectations, minutes from a 1986 meeting of the State Urban Development Corporation's board show.
During the 1986 meeting, Mr. Tese told the board's members that the state had been derelict because it failed to closely monitor the project, especially since "the job was started out with inexperience on one side."
Upon completing the renovations, the Sutton group discovered that the demand for independently produced cultural programming, for cable or network television, was not as great as anticipated. Only one of Mr. Sutton's programs has made it into syndication. "Showtime at the Apollo" is a variety show that features professional comedians and musicians, as well as an amateur night segment.
Compounding the problems, many performers and producers are unaware of the Apollo's recording and television studios, said Jerry Kupfer, the Apollo's production manager.
Mr. Kupfer said that arranging financing for and overseeing construction of the studios placed such a "drain on the management company, meaning Inner City and Percy Sutton, that it was really difficult to go out there and spend the millions of dollars to really inform every single person in the production community that this existed, to have the ads, to have the presence at conventions and everything else."
The performers and the producers are not the only ones staying away. The fear of crime still deters many people from going to the Apollo. But that fear is largely unfounded, said Sgt. Larry Gantt, who heads a team of police officers from the 28th Precinct who are assigned near the theater on performance nights.
 
State Yet to Be Repaid
 "There are usually no incidents at all," Sergeant Gantt said.
With all those difficulties and anticipating another $2 million deficit this year, Mr. Sutton asked the state for a further deferral of his loan payments, noting that "actual operation of the theater shows that many of the projections accepted and utilized were in error as to profit centers, revenues and expenses."
For instance, Mr. Sutton's group expected the production of videos to bring in $1.7 million last year; videos actually accounted for $280,000. The group also expected to pay about $1.3 million is salaries last year, but ended up paying a little more than $1.8 million.
Although the state has yet to be repaid, its loan is partly guaranteed by Mr. Sutton, who has been the big financial losers in this venture. Mr. Sutton is the majority shareholder in both Inner City Broadcasting and the Apollo Theater Investor Group.
After weeks of negotiations, the Harlem and State Urban Development Corporation and the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, which has loaned the project $2.9 million, agreed last month to suspend loan payments for six months. They are now trying to help Mr. Sutton develop what Mr. Tese of the state development agency described as "a better business plan."
The state development agency has also allocated $100,000 for a consultant to recommend ways to improve management, control costs and increase revenue -- despite reservations of some of the agency's board members about continuing to extend loans to the Apollo and postpone repayments.
But Mr. Tese has insisted that the Apollo is "a socially redeeming project," the kind the Legislature envisoned in 1981 in allocating money for high-risk loans in economically deprived areas.
"You have to take into consideration that the normal lending channels are very limited in depressed areas and therefore the state is performing its role of helping depressed areas get back on their feet by filling that void," Mr. Tese said.
The future of the Apollo, most involved seem to agree, is as a nonprofit performance center, similar to Carnegie Hall. Mr. Rangel and Mr. Cogsville are now leading efforts to establish such a corporation to take over the Apollo's lease.
But one person involved in the effort said that difficulties could arise if those supporting the idea of a nonprofit corporation also insist that all the loans to Mr. Sutton be forgiven.
If Mr. Sutton transfers his lease to the new corporation, he and his family would lose their investment, about $6 million.
Mr. Cosby is among those who have said they would be willing to serve on the board of a nonprofit corporation.
"I want this place managed properly," Mr. Cosby said. "It's a matter of hiring the proper person -- regardless of race, color, creed or gender -- to run and manage this. You can't mom and pop this theater."
Miss Warwick has also offered to help and suggested that the Apollo's alumni return to perform there.
"I'm sure that there are more than 365 people that went through there and it wouldn't be a bad idea for each of us to take a day and go in there and do what we have to do," she said.

HEADLINE: Bush Quandary: How to Aid Soviets

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
The steadily increasing Soviet demands for economic aid from the United States are beginning to pose a serious quandary for the Bush Administration.
Administration officials say they are reluctant to rebuff President Mikhail S. Gorbachev; they insist that they want to find a way to help him, and they recognize that a transformation of the Soviet economy to a free market probably cannot be accomplished without some Western financial aid. But they are concerned about what they describe as the increasingly unrealistic level and nature of Soviet demands. 
 "We're talking about peanuts and they are talking about elephants," said John Hardt, senior specialist in Soviet economics at the Congressional Research Service.
Officials say that American economic help cannot reach the multibillion-dollar levels now being broached by some Soviet officials. They add that American assistance will have to be tied to changes not only in Soviet economic behavior but in political, military and strategic behavior as well, so that American help can be justified on national security grounds as well as economic ones.
 
Cuban and Baltic Issues
 Specifically, that means tying American assistance to an elimination of Soviet aid to Cuba, an end to harassment of the Baltic republics and a slow-down in Soviet military spending.
The only economic assistance that the Administration seems inclined to provide immediately consists of technical advice and guarantees of $1.5 billion in commercial bank loans for the purchase of United States grain.
The guarantees depend upon the Bush Administration's extending in June a six-month-old waiver of a law that links trade with the Soviet Union to liberalization of its emigration policies. The administration is also considering submission for Congressional approval of a trade treaty signed with the Soviet Union that would allow the Soviets to get normal tariff treatment, known as "most favored nation" status.
The National Conference on Soviet Jewry, a Washington-based lobbying group, endorsed such a waiver today. Its associate executive director, Mark B. Levin, said the group's executive committee also agreed informally to support President Bush if he asked Congress to approve the preferential trade status.
"The Soviets are setting themselves up for a serious disappointment," one Administration policymaker said, "because of their own exaggerated sense of how much the West is required to save them, before they themselves are ready to demonstrate a real change in behavior. They have to check into a rehabilitation clinic before we'll think about paying the room and board."
A meeting in Washington on Wednesday between senior Soviet economic officials and the Administration has only added to the skepticism. Yevgeny M. Primakov, a senior aide to President Gorbachev, and Grigory Yavlinsky, a private economist who has been working with a group of Harvard-based economists on a plan for transforming the Soviet economy, met with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the White House economics adviser Michael J. Boskin to present the latest version of Mr. Gorbachev's rescue plan. Mr. Primakov is scheduled to meet with Mr. Bush on Friday morning at the White House.
Administration officials said they came away from Wednesday's meeting feeling that Mr. Yavlinsky's connection to Mr. Gorbachev was still unclear, while Mr. Primakov's economic proposals were vague and tended to be in line with previous official attitudes that no serious changes in the Soviet economy are possible without a prior commitment of Western help.
 
Little Credibility Left
 The Soviets do not seem to appreciate that after so many broken economic promises they have little credibility left on this issue in Washington. Asked today if the United States views the latest Primakov reform plan as workable, Mr. Baker told reporters, "There are some improvements, but I don't think it represents the really fundamental major effort that is going to have to be made if they are going to move to the free market."
Still another factor weighing against Mr. Gorbachev is a growing feeling that he could not implement reform even if he had more money. In a final interview before his retirement as director of central intelligence, William H. Webster said today that he saw little to suggest that Mr. Gorbachev could stem a tide of economic and political crises threatening his presidency and that his hold on power was "increasingly uncertain."
 
Administration Seems Paralyzed
 While stressing that he is not predicting Mr. Gorbachev's removal from office, Mr. Webster said that the Soviet leader's reform program appears to be in shambles and that he believes it possible that republics will begin leaving the union by the end of the year.
 Having said all this, American officials are aware that without Western help and advice Mr. Gorbachev is not likely to take the plunge -- a plunge that is in the Western interest, since it could mean a more politically open, pluralistic and economically free Soviet Union. Yet, the Administration seems paralyzed to act on this fact.

HEADLINE: The East Village Becomes Japan West

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
"KOMPAI!," said Taku Yoshimoto, as he lifted the ceramic cup of sake to his lips in a ceremonial toast: "Dry your glass!"
Mr. Yoshimoto, a 22-year-old student at the Fashion Institute of Technology who hails from Sennan, a small city near Osaka, Japan, was explaining why sushi restaurants were a mixed blessing for young Japanese artists like himself. "This guy I know, he came here to learn music," he said. As he spoke, a Japanese disk jockey at Avenue A Sushi, a sleek East Village boite, spun a Deee-Lite tune on a nearby turntable. "Obviously, he couldn't make money. So he became a sushi chef trainee. He got so good, he made so much money, that's what he does now." He has abandoned his music. 
 Mr. Yoshimoto looked behind Avenue A's glowing glass sushi bar to the silent row of black-clad Japanese chefs, several of whom had improbably blond hair and oddly shaved beards.
"I can tell you, I'm pretty sure they're not here to be sushi chefs," he said. "For one thing, sushi chefs don't dye their hair."
 Jaded sophisticates suggest that downtown is dead. Yet New York still represents freedom for creative spirits seeking refuge from the constraints of home. Now playing on the expatriate circuit are young Japanese artists, who have made the East Village of Manhattan their demimonde, their Bohemia, their "Bohemu.".
For them, as for the young Americans who flocked to Paris in the years after World War I, New York is a movable feast -- just substitute unagi (broiled eel) for steak frites and Candy B1, a basement karaoke, or sing-along, bar in the East Village for Deux Magots.
"An entire movement is here," said Yukimura S. Konishi, a 51-year-old painter who came to America in 1965. "It's not just artists. It's photographers, designers, choreographers, writers. Even bonsai artists. People say New York is finished because the economy is down, but that's not the point. The point is, the art world still needs New York."
While the Japanese artists who traveled to America in the 1950's and 60's led private lives, toiling at day jobs and assembling late at night over whisky in their studios, their young successors are more public. They congregate at karaoke bars like Candy B1 or saloons like Counterpoint, a narrow watering hole across East Ninth Street no wider than an udon noodle.
The artists' work, too, is receiving more attention. A show of Mr. Konishi's oil paintings, in which he said he tried to evoke "an Oriental concept, of life floating through the universe," was at the Humphrey gallery in SoHo this spring.
News about Japanese and other Asian artists working in New York can also be found in Godzilla, a new quarterly newsletter published by the Asian American Art Network in New York. The network can be reached at (718) 855-8385.
The Japanese have long been here, if to lesser notice. From Japan's opening to the West in 1868, its artists have flowed to the world's creative capitals in search of inspiration. In the late 19th century, they returned from Paris with the first Western-style oil painting Japan had ever seen.
Japanese expatriates have wielded some small influence over American art for most of this century. Yasuo Kuniyoshi, who came to the United States in 1906 and died in 1953, was a founder of the Art Students League and helped introduce modernism to America. By the 1950's, the expressiveness of Japanese calligraphy could be sensed in the work of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, while Zen Buddhism cast its spell over Merce Cunningham's choreography and John Cage's music.
For artists, emigrating from Japan has been driven less by romance than by necessity. Art is woven into the fabric of Japanese tradition, in the intricacies of the tea ceremony and flower arranging. While nihonga -- modern art utilizing ancient materials, like screens, and techniques, like brush painting -- is acceptable, most divergences from the traditional path are not appreciated.
"It's been the situation for many years that a fine artist must leave Japan and develop recognition abroad in order to get recognition in Japan," said Lynn Gumpert, an independent curator living in New York and an expert on Japanese art.
Mr. Konishi attributes the Japanese skepticism toward modern art to a lack of cultural confidence. "Japan is a long-tradition country; we have only had Western art for a hundred years," he said in halting English, over morning tea in his TriBeCa loft. "The Japanese are still learning about this Western manner of painting. They still love French Impressionism in Japan now -- Western oil painting, Monet, Renoir."
Even today, Japanese visitors to his studio prefer his two-dimensional paintings to the multi-textured, mixed-media collages favored by American art buyers. The flat imagery of the paintings, he said, is more in the nihonga style.
For the first wave of Japanese expatriate artists, who came immediately after World War II, and for their followers, like Mr. Konishi, life in New York was a continuing struggle; money was short and the language barrier separated them from the American avant-garde. Since the mid-1980's, however, a new, bicontinental class of young artists has arrived here.
"New York has become the third capital of Japan, part of a cultural axis with Tokyo and Kyoto," said Alexandra Munroe, a critic who has written extensively on the experiences of Japanese artists at home and abroad. "Young artists, in all areas of activity, are hopping back and forth. They are now bilingual. They have money. They are not cutting off Japan as earlier artists did."
In the smoky confines of Candy B1, the mop-topped karaoke band guitarist sucked on a Marlboro. "I have heard that 4,000 Japanese people are living in the East Village," said the young musician, who declined to give his name, shortly before taking the stage with his rasping rendition of Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze." "For one reason or another, the East Village became a Japanese city, in a way."
Taku Yoshimoto, with his broad, beaming face, his flawless command of English, his innocent's willingness to try everything American, may be typical of these new New Yorkers.
Mr. Yoshimoto, the son of a factory supervisor and beauty-salon owner, came to America soon after graduating from junior high school. He spoke no English but was compelled to come, he said, by his love of baseball. "It's a scary thing to do, now that I look back on it," he said. "But I was 15, so what did I know?"
He arrived at a language school in Charlotte, N.C., and after three months transferred to another language school in Sacramento, Calif. Deciding to stay stateside, he applied and was accepted as a foreign exchange student by the American Institute of Foreign Studies, which sent him to Milwaukie, Ore., south of Portland, for his sophomore year of high school and then to Niagara Falls, N.Y. There, he played piano in the LaSalle Senior High School jazz band and second base on its baseball team.
In his junior year, he visited New York City: "I'd never seen a city like this before. Filthy. Dark. I was fascinated. It changed me a lot."
Just before leaving for a band competition in Boston, Mr. Yoshimoto bought some magazines to occupy him on the bus ride. Flipping through GQ, he saw an advertisement for a fashion design school in Los Angeles. He applied and matriculated, but found New York nagging at his mind.
"L.A., you have to have a nice car, you have to dress nice, you have to have a lot of money," he said. "New York, I thought, you don't need to drive, so you don't need money." In 1989, he transferred to the Fashion Institute of Technology.
Through OCS News, a Japanese newspaper serving the metropolitan area, he found an apartment and a job tending bar and playing electric piano at Candy B1, then a new karaoke bar. Every night, he could count on playing two tunes for the young Japanese office workers and expatriate artists like himself who found in Candy's claustrophobic basement a tiny memory of home. Every night, they asked for the same two songs: "A Girl Who Was Born in Osaka", a plaintive melody usually sung by men; and "Listening to Olivia", a ballad, warbled mostly by women, that may or may not be about Olivia Newton-John.
Although he left Candy B1 late last year to concentrate on his studies, much of Mr. Yoshimoto's life still revolves around the bar and its East Ninth Street neighborhood. He occasionally returns as a patron, but prefers singing "Jumping Jack Flash" to Japanese songs.
Strolling east on the street from Fourth Avenue one recent evening, he talked about the expatriate life teeming behind the drab brownstone exteriors. He pointed to Shiroku, a restaurant known for its yakitori, or barbecued skewered delicacies, and for whose baseball team Mr. Yoshimoto plays his beloved second base. There was T.I.C. Akean, which sells Japanese videotapes, newspapers and magazines; T.I.C. stands for Total Information Center. He told the tragic story of Counterpoint, which only recently reopened, having closed for 49 days, in the Buddhist tradition, after its Japanese owner was murdered in a robbery.
"Tokyo, it's safe," he mused. "It's like kindergarten."
For all of New York's problems, Mr. Yoshimoto said he believed his time here would benefit him when he returns to Japan, although his stay is not without professional liabilities. "Japan has great fashion schools," he said. "The kids are so accurate in the way they sketch. New York would be an advantage for me after I go back, because I would be a little different. But once I'm in the studio, we compete on the same level."
However they fare when they return home, the imprint the young Japanese expatriates are leaving on American culture is murky, at best.
Magazine and advertising agency art directors say a Japanese mark can be seen in American graphic design, particularly in the Japanese use of words as meaningless design elements, a technique some call "rap typography."
Others, though, contend that Japanese artists in the United States suffer from a cultural separatism that still renders them almost invisible.
"Unlike the large African-American community and Hispanic community that are here, which have had an impact, I certainly can't see what the Japanese community's impact would be," said Jeanette Ingberman, the director of the Exit Art gallery in SoHo, which sponsored a show last year by the Japanese multi-media artist Hiroshi Kariya. "Maybe this is a gross generality, but more than some other cultural groups, their work still very much reflects Japanese concerns and is still very much culturally about Japan."
Perhaps integration and change are near. Not long ago, Taku Yoshimoto and several other denizens of Avenue A Sushi gathered at the Roxy, an enormous nightspot on the far western edge of Chelsea, to cheer Katsuake Oiwake, a hyperkinetic 26-year-old artist who created the phosphorescent mobiles that decorated the club's cavernous dance floor. The invitation to the event identified Mr. Oiwake, who came to New York two years ago, as the "Japanese sensation."
"Artwise, Tokyo is not deep," Mr. Oiwake said, nervously eyeing his installation. "New York is so very deep, so very wide, so very interesting. New York is a hot, hot, hot town. Every artist is coming here."
Mr. Yoshimoto, however, thinks the city may be losing its luster. Already, he said, young Japanese artists are leaving New York, even bypassing it, for Germany and Spain. "Maybe," he said, "New York was just another fashion."
Why, he was asked, were his countrymen compelled to find a new Bohemu?
"Japanese people tend to go through things quick," Mr. Yoshimoto said. "They move in, they move out. They're used to new stuff every five years."

HEADLINE: How to Stop a Civil War

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis ;Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Yugoslavia

 BODY:
The shouting match among Yugoslavia's ethnic rivals is becoming a shooting match.
Some Croatian leaders say the warning that civil war looms is only "Serbian propaganda" and that the country can and should peaceably break up into independent states. In vowing yesterday to secede from Yugoslavia by June 30 unless the turmoil dividing the country is solved, Croatia confidently asserted to the world that it can prosper on its own. 
 Tensions and tempers are high. There are minorities in too many places and interests are too intertwined to solve the dispute by redrawing maps. The U.S. and the European Community have made clear they will not support the breakup of Yugoslavia, as the President of the European Community Commission, Jacques Delors, repeated yesterday.
But the nationalists aren't listening. They shout past one other with such intensity that nobody knows what the arguments come down to any more. They are choking themselves with history, and as always when history becomes the tool of polemics it exacerbates conflict. Like statistics, history can be made to prove any point. It is true that the creation of Yugoslavia after World War I was an artifice to deal with the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire, a rich stew of peoples that never became a melting pot.
Now, the Serbs want either to maintain firm central powers or to achieve the old dream of a Greater Serbia at the expense of their ethnic rivals. Croatia and Slovenia want independence, in an alliance of sovereign states, or on their own. Others take sides, according to their hopes for benefit.
This month the U.S. dabbled with cutting off aid to Yugoslavia in an attempt to shock people to their senses, specifically citing Serbian human rights abuses against Albanians in the province of Kosovo. But Prime Minister Ante Markovic, whose economic reform program has been blocked by feuding republics, pointed out that sanctions would only accelerate a collapse. Slovenia and Croatia took it as all the more reason to break with Serbia, since it had provoked the punishment. Washington called off its aid suspension last week.
Yet, there is little chance of the Yugoslavs coming to terms among themselves. The tide has to be turned from outside, a delicate matter.
This is an urgent case for the new peacekeeping machinery set up last November by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The C.S.C.E. has no power, and ostensibly its concern is international disputes, not conflict within states.
But Europe has to be concerned with a crisis that is likely to spill over to neighboring countries. The C.S.C.E. should set up a commission to listen to all sides, identifying issues and reporting the points of contention. It could be a safety valve and provide a cooling-off period.
Rather than government representatives, it should be a group of eminent people experienced in statecraft. It's an idea that provokes interest here. Some names that have come up include Lord Carrington, Eduard Shevardnadze, Helmut Schmidt and Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
It is possible that with encouragement, the Yugoslav Government or one or more of the republics will invite such an initiative from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. If not, the organization should propose it.
A basic C.S.C.E. principle is that borders cannot be changed by force. If this could be made to apply to the republics' borders, it would go far toward satisfying Croatia and Slovenia. Serbia would object at first, but it might be persuaded in return for assuring the integrity of the Yugoslav state.
It is a test of whether the new Europe can keep its own order, with implications far beyond Yugoslavia.

HEADLINE: Pretending to Fight the Recession

 BODY:
The "action plan" to fight recession announced by Democratic leaders in Congress doesn't call for action, isn't much of a plan and is irrelevant to recession. The leaders advocate extending unemployment benefits, building roads and bridges and cutting taxes for the middle class, all of which would stimulate a sluggish economy. But they provide no specific proposals, no specific costs and no specific commitments.
Some of these ideas deserve support -- those that promote long-term growth and not just short-term recovery. The sobering fact is that Congress doesn't have the tools needed to fight this mild recession, and if it tried, it would risk doing more harm than good. 
 Spending programs and tax cuts take time to conceive, negotiate and carry out. They take even longer to affect the economy. Often in the past, anti-recession initiatives have not kicked in until after recovery began, destabilizing the economy.
That's the danger now. The economy is mired in recession. But the legislation now proposed might take as long as a year to work. Yet the recession is already 11 months old, the average length of recent downturns. It may or may not be over already. But it will probably be over by the time the Democratic plan could take hold.
Uncertainty about timing is reason enough to put fiscal policy on a back burner. Monetary policy -- manipulation of the money supply by the Federal Reserve Board -- suffers from some of the same uncertainty. But at least the Fed can respond instantaneously to news and events, which is one reason it bears heavy responsibility for keeping the economy stable.
Of course, if the economy were collapsing into a major slump, delicate issues of timing would lose importance and Congress would have to turn to countercyclical tools. But current data suggest no such catastrophe. The "action plan" is misguided as a weapon against recession.
Even so, parts of the plan offer welcome answers to problems of long-term stagnation and individual misfortune. The economy desperately needs investments in infrastructure, schools and workplace training. And unemployed workers need and deserve support until they find new jobs. Pressed to balance budgets, states have severely cut back eligibility for benefits so that only a minority of the unemployed now qualify. This is a cruel, unnecessary predicament.
Hastily conceived tax cuts and other projects for short-term relief can't be timed to bring the economy out of this recession. What the economy needs from Washington now is the same thing it needs during prosperity: policies that promote long-term growth.

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 30

 BODY:
The Connecticut Legislature gave final approval today to a no-income-tax budget plan that Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has already said he will veto. That would leave the state government, which has one of the worst budget crises in the nation, stranded without a budget less than a week before the legislative session ends next Wednesday.
Some lawmakers said today that the state would face turmoil if Mr. Weicker makes good on his threat to veto the plan, which legislators substituted for the Governor's proposal to impose an income tax. If the legislators' opposition to an income tax remains firm, especially in the Senate, which led the way in passing the alternative plan, any budget could prove unworkable, the lawmakers said. 
 Others say the crushing pressures with the approach of July 1, the start of the new fiscal year, could transform the debate yet again. Some House Democrats are already testing the waters for a revival of an income-tax proposal.
"We're back to square one," said Representative Richard T. Mulready, Democrat of West Hartford and co-chairman of the joint Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
 
Effect on Economy
 Lawmakers are uncertain of all the implications of starting the new fiscal year without a budget, but it would almost certainly mean a curtailment of state services and necessitate borrowing money in a credit market that is already wary of the state's fiscal condition.
The $7.7 billion budget passed today, which was written and sponsored by a coalition of Republicans and Democrats, would raise $960 million in new revenue through a drastically expanded sales and corporation tax system and the creation of some entirely new taxes, like a 5 percent tax on residential and commercial mortgages over $150,000. It would be the biggest one-year tax increase in state history, as would Mr. Weicker's.
But lawmakers supporting the plan, using some of the most strident language in the budget debate so far, said that the issue was where the taxes would fall and that their plan would keep more money in people's pockets to fuel economic recovery.
As the Northeast remains in a recession, the state faces a projected revenue shortfall of about 30 percent of its budget over the next 13 months.
"This budget is about protecting hard-working families from the phony promise that an income tax will sooner or later trickle down and benefit them," said the President pro tem of the Senate, John B. Larson, a Democrat from East Hartford and a leader of the coalition group. "This budget says no to the Governor's 'voodoo economics.' "
 
Difficulty of Overriding Veto
 Mr. Weicker, an independent third-party Governor whose own tax plan was shelved by lawmakers without so much as a committee vote, said last week that the coalition plan would leave the state in "perpetual recession" by increasing taxes on business, which are already high, and that he would have no choice but to use the veto.
Lawmakers on both sides of the income-tax issue and in both parties said it would be difficult if not impossible to obtain the two-thirds majority of both chambers needed to override the anticipated veto. In the House, for example, the plan was approved shortly before 5 A.M. on a vote of 77 to 71 after an all-night debate. To guarantee an override, 100 votes -- or 30 new converts -- would be needed to guarantee passage in the 151-member House. The Senate also fell short of a two-thirds majority, approving the plan by a 22-to-14 vote.
Mr. Weicker, who said tonight that he wanted to have the budget on his desk and vetoed by Friday, may not receive it until next week. The Senate declined today to speed up the regular schedule, and leaders said they would discuss the issue again on Friday.
The question that began to absorb the Capitol even before the final votes were counted is what happens now. With Mr. Weicker's plan still smoldering -- soon apparently to be joined by the legislative plan -- lawmakers on all sides spent the day looking for sparks of life in either package that might be combined in some viable form.
The likeliest surviving element -- and the likely foundation on which a new revenue proposal will be grafted -- is the system of spending controls and government consolidations that were included in the coalition plan. The spending controls are considered fundamental elements, especially by many Republicans. They include a proposed constitutional amendment that would prohibit the state budget's growing faster than the rate of inflation or the growth in personal income.
But some lawmakers also said the very act of passing a budget that the Governor has rejected will have its own consequences as the debate continues. Whatever emerges will do so from a changed foundation, they said: a bipartisan majority has flexed its muscle and will not be denied or bullied.
Income-tax proponents, by contrast, say the invective against the income tax has been smashed by the realization that a huge increase in the sales tax may be almost as unpopular, and by the weak majority that the final package attracted.
A poll conducted by the University of Connecticut and released on Wednesday in The Hartford Courant only hours before the debate in the House began said the public dislikes both plans equally. Of 237 randomly selected residents interviewed between May 25 and May 27, well more than half said they opposed both options.
Forced to choose, 42 percent picked Mr. Weicker's plan, compared with 39 percent for the sales-tax alternative passed by the legislature. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 7 percentage points.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 1, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the budget passed by the Connecticut legislature misstated provisions of a proposed tax on mortgages. It would be 0.5 percent, not 5 percent, and would be applied to amounts over $150,000 for first mortgages on residential property and to the full amount of commercial mortgages and second mortgages.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Critics Seek F.T.C. Action On Products as Movie Stars

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
When the alien and Elliot shared some Reese's Pieces in the film "E.T. -- The Extra-Terrestrial," sales of the little-known candy zoomed.
So, apparently, has the practice of buying exposure for products and services in the movies. Now, growing scrutiny of "product placement" is reaching the point that Federal and state lawmakers are being forced to take notice. 
 Already, cigarette makers have told the Federal Trade Commission that they have been eliminating product placements. And several leading brokers who arrange deals between manufacturers and movie makers said they would welcome disclosing those arrangements on screen -- a practice that could make a movie's credits resemble those on television game shows.
The latest salvo against product placements came today, when the Center for the Study of Commercialism, a consumer group here, announced that it would petition the F.T.C. to declare product placements an unfair business practice and require on-screen disclosure of products advertised in the films.
At issue are some thorny questions about advertising, artistic license and freedom of speech. While the F.T.C. is allowed to go after unfair or deceptive advertising, what constitutes an advertisement, especially within a movie, is ambiguous.
Whether it is Patrick Swayze carrying a pair of Reebok sneakers in "Ghost" or Julia Roberts trying to open a Diet Pepsi bottle in "Pretty Woman," is it an advertisement if a product is merely shown in a film? Or must there be an overt endorsement by a character? Is an advertisement a promotion paid for in cash, or do barter arrangements between producers and marketers qualify?
Most important is whether anyone is harmed by a product's appearance in a movie -- a requirement for an advertisement to be deemed unfair, said C. Lee Peeler, the F.T.C.'s associate director for advertising practices.
Daniel L. Jaffe, the executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers, asked, "How is the moviegoer harmed by seeing the hero driving one brand of car or another, or staying in one hotel or another?"
But Michael Jacobson, a co-founder of the Center for the Study of Commercialism, said: "We contend that there is economic harm. Moviegoers are being persuaded to develop a highly favorable opinion of a product by having the product associated with the glamour of Hollywood and the fame of actors. That obviously accrues to the advantage of the marketer, because moviegoers are likelier to buy that product."
 
'Infomercial' Cases
 The F.T.C. has brought cases against producers of program-length television commercials, called "infomercials," charging that the producers deceived the public by representing their shows as news or talk programs, not advertising.
The Center for the Study of Commercialism, founded in 1990 to oppose what Mr. Jacobson calls "the overcommercialization of American life," said the infomercial cases provided a precedent that would allow the F.T.C. to investigate product placements.
Earlier this year, the tobacco industry agreed to stop buying placements in films after the F.T.C. began investigating whether such placements required health warnings on films and whether, when these movies are shown on television, they violate the 1971 ban on broadcast tobacco advertising.
The idea of promoting products on film dates to the early days of the movies. In the 1930's, MGM even had a placement office, said Mark Crispin Miller, a media professor at Johns Hopkins University. But the practice, he said, was infrequent.
 
Blossomed in the 1980's
 Marketing people say placements blossomed in the 1980's, with dozens of brokers setting up shop in Los Angeles and New York, in large part because of the growth that Reese's Pieces attributed to its appearance in "E.T." in 1982.
Nowadays, marketers are said to spend from $10 million to $50 million a year seeking cinematic placement. And while some placements cost a great deal -- Philip Morris paid $350,000 to have Lark cigarettes featured in the James Bond movie "Licence to Kill" -- most cost far less.
"It can be anywhere from $10,000 up," said Richard E. Gore, the president of the Entertainment Marketing Group, a placement broker in New York. "I've never charged six figures for a placement."
How well do placements work? In a 1989 report, the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency called placements "as powerful as a celebrity endorsement but more subtle."
"In society's zeal to imitate stars, it's conceivable that viewers will acknowledge and buy products used by idols on the big screen," the agency said.
 
70 Percent Gain for Reese's
 But Alice K. Sylvester, a senior vice president who helped prepare the agency's report, said there was little research showing that placements would actually lead to increased sales. "It certainly doesn't have the kind of impact we look for in other media," she said.
Nonetheless, some companies have attributed sharply higher sales to product placements. Reese's Pieces sales grew 70 percent after the appearance in "E.T."
Mr. Jacobson said placements worked through "insidious" means. He showed clips from several recent films, including "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," in which a Domino's Pizza delivery man was shown bringing a pie to the heroes' lair, an inner-city sewer. "People don't run out of the theater and buy a Domino's Pizza," Mr. Jacobson said. "These are part of a web of advertising in which companies seek to enmesh their target audience."
But marketing experts say placements work best not when they are hidden, but when they are part of an overt promotional campaign trumpeting a product's appearance in a film. So some placement brokers say they would welcome disclosing it in the credits.
 
'An Additional Plug'
 "It might be an additional plug for our clients to have disclosure at the end," said Devery Holmes. director of marketing for Norm Marshall & Associates, a Sun Valley, Calif., placement and promotion company,
Her company recently assembled a promotional campaign for American Airlines and Nestle that is keyed to the release of the home-video version of "Home Alone," a 20th Century Fox release, in which the airline and Nestle's Juicy Juice are featured.
The two companies have bought ads and put signs in thousands of grocery stores to promote a sweepstakes tied to the movie. So the producers not only got use of the American Airlines terminal at O'Hare Airport for filming, Ms. Holmes said, they also received millions of dollars' worth of additional publicity.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 5, 1991, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday about product placements in movies referred incorrectly to a promotion sponsored by American Airlines and Nestle. The two companies joined to promote the release of the film "Home Alone" in theaters, not the home video release.

International Data Corp. Appoints a New Chief

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
The International Data Corporation has named Kirk S. Campbell president and chief executive. Mr. Campbell has been chief operating officer at International Data, based in Framingham, Mass., a leading research and consulting concern for the computer industry.
Mr. Campbell, 37, succeeds Axel Leblois, who resigned to become president and chief executive of Bull HN Information Systems Inc., the United States subsidiary of Groupe Bull of France. Before joining International Data, Mr. Campbell was vice president of planning and worldwide analysis at the International Data Group, the parent company. The parent also controls I.D.G. Communications, which publishes computer magazines and newspapers in 49 countries. 
 Mr. Campbell, whose appointment was announced on Wednesday, plans to continue the company's current direction rather than implement significant changes. "The main thing is to push I.D.C.'s success as a market research organization," he said. "Right now I.D.C. is a very successful operation."
While much of the computer industry is feeling a pinch, International Data is buffered by the diversity of its business, Mr. Campbell said. "At a time when companies are in trouble, they need advice about how to reposition themselves for the market conditions," he added. "That's where our consulting services come into play."
Mr. Campbell came to International Data in March 1990 from the parent company, which he joined in 1983. Previously, he spent four years with the Pennwell Publishing Company, a Tulsa, Okla., energy and high-technology publisher. He began his career with the Exxon Corporation in a variety of financial positions.
Mr. Campbell received a bachelor's degree in history from Stanford University, and a master's degree in public affairs from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University. He was a Fulbright Scholar at the Free University in Berlin.

Executive to Oversee 2 Columbia Studios

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Jonathan Dolgen, who is president of the theatrical division of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., has been named president of a newly formed motion picture group at the company. The new division encompasses Columbia Pictures Entertainment's two motion picture studios, Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star Pictures Inc.
Under the new structure, Mr. Dolgen will work with Frank Price, the chairman of Columbia Pictures, and Michael Medavoy, the Tri-Star Pictures chairman. Mr. Dolgen will report to Alan J. Levine, president and chief operating officer of Columbia Pictures Entertainment's filmed entertainment group, creating another layer of management. 
 Although Mr. Dolgen said he viewed the change as "fine tuning rather than restructuring in a major way," several industry experts viewed it as an attempt to increase control over film costs.
Both studios have a number of high-budget films already in release or scheduled to come out in the next months, including Tri-Star's "Hudson Hawk," which features the actor Bruce Willis and opened last weekend to devastating reviews.
Mr. Dolgen has historically been more involved in the financial side of the business than the creative side, and he said yesterday that he would continue in that vein. He denied that his first priority was costs.
"Good movies are the first issue," he said. "That is about story and casting. Then the movie is supposed to live inside an economic framework. There is no single key to wisdom in this thing. You have to make great movies at a reasonable price."
In addition to his motion picture activities, Mr, Dolgen will work directly with Peter Guber, chairman and chief executive officer of Columbia Pictures Entertainment, on overall strategies.
Mr. Dolgen, 46 years old, was named president of the theatrical division in September 1990. Before that, he was president of Fox Inc., where he held a number of other postions. Before joining Fox, he was an executive at Columbia Pictures.
Mr. Dolgen attended Cornell University and received a law degree from New York University.
