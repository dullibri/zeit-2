HEADLINE: Companies Capitalizing on Worker Diversity

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
From the palm-fringed Burger King headquarters in Miami to the Towers Perrin offices on Park Avenue in Manhattan, corporate managers and employees are playing the diversity game, literally and figuratively. They are trying everything from board games to real-life case studies to learn how to turn diverse groups of workers to their advantage.
The games and case studies are the brainchildren of consultants -- anthropologists and psychologists, as well as M.B.A.'s. Such consultants are increasingly being hired by employers who need help managing a diverse work force, in which members of minority groups, immigrants and women now hold more than half the jobs. 
 Managing diversity, or multi culturalism, has been defined as a desire to recognize, respect and capitalize on different strands and backgrounds in American society, like race, ethnic origin and gender. Over the years, the definition has been broadened to incorporate age, sexual orientation, physical disabilities, socioeconomic background and ways of living.
Only a few years ago, the idea of diversity in the work place was being dismissed by employers as an amorphous theory with little or no relevance to production and profit. Many employers believed that changing the corporate status quo would alienate their predominantly white, male work force.
Today, more and more employers view diversity as good business as well as good public relations. The executives who set aside company time -- and money -- to cultivate diversity hope the results will be fewer costly discrimination suits and a more tolerant, innovative work place.
What's more, dealing with diversity, one of the most popular management concepts of the 90's, is becoming a booming multimillion-dollar business.
"In the next two to five years, diversity might very well be a billion-dollar industry," said Dr. Ron Brown, the president of Banks Brown and a San Francisco consultant, whose firm specializes in fostering and managing diversity in the work place.
Neil Pickett, director of program management at the Hudson Institute, said, "Diversity has created a new career, a new vision of service."
But Mr. Pickett, along with many others who have witnessed the rapid growth in the industry, fears that some consultants may be entering the business primarily for the money. Dr. Sondra Thiederman, a consultant from San Diego, said, "Some are in it because they want to do good, others because they see it as a lucrative business."
Dr. Thiederman said she receives three or four queries a day from people asking how to get into the business. Many of these requests, she added, come from people with little training in work-place diversity, including former Peace Corps volunteers and spouses of corporate executives who have worked overseas.
And, she went on, some of those touting themselves as experts on managing diversity are minimally qualified to advise a company on the subtleties of issues involving race and gender in the work place. Of equal concern to some industry experts is the unsettling reality that some companies are hiring diversity consultants merely as window dressing. Reducing the effort to pure public relations, they argue, subverts the whole idea of diversity.
In 1987, the Hudson Institute produced "Workforce 2000," a study on work and workers for the 21st century that is credited by advocates of work-place diversity with giving an important impetus to the turnaround in the industry.
The study, which was done for the United States Labor Department, concluded that the overall work force would increase to 150.7 million in 2005, up from 124.7 million in 1990. Of the 26 million new workers, 85 percent would be members of minority groups, women and immigrants.
As one indication of the demand for specialists in managing diversity, Diversity Consultants Inc. of Atlanta, one of the nation's leading authorities on the subject, has seen its revenues double since 1989. In February, Towers Perrin, an international consulting firm, acquired Diversity Consultants. Diversity Consultants, founded in 1984 by Dr. R. Roosevelt Thomas Jr., has already trained several dozen Towers Perrin employees in diversity planning and strategy. The revenue figures were furnished by Robert L. Lattimer, the managing director.
 
Problems Followed Affirmative Action
 In the 1960's and 70's many corporations adopted affirmative-action programs and hired professionals in human resources to find, hire and promote blacks and women in fields that were previously closed to them. But then many companies failed to deal with the internal problems that arose after these hirings.
While programs dealing with diversity incorporate the traditional approaches, consultants also try to help a company and its employees to adjust psychologially and emotionally to the changing work force.
Consultants agree, however, that they can only do so much to overcome years of ingrained organizational behavior and established management patterns. Indeed, several conceded that they are sometimes temporary crutches for a company and that unless a company's management accepts what it has learned and applies it daily, the impact will be negligible.
Many consultants first conduct what they call a "corporate audit." They interview groups of employees about the company's corporate culture: the ways employees are selected, assigned jobs and promoted; whether extroversion is valued over introversion, and whether employees' ideas are routinely sought. Managers are asked to review the information to identify perceived or real obstacles to advancement.
Besides these audits, some consultants have managers and employees take personality tests like the Myers-Briggs Test, which helps determine how certain personality traits lead to race or gender stereotypes.
Nancy Hutchens, an anthropologist who has conducted numerous diversity workshops with Dr. Benjamin Reese, a clinical psychologist, said, "People tend to react to each other based on race and gender without realizing that what they were responding to was personality characteristics."
 
Diversity Programs And Individuals
 Trainers can also do fine tuning with specific employee problems. In one instance, Dr. Thiederman, was able to convince a white male manager that an Asian employee's reluctance to give an oral presentation was motivated by cultural differences, not caused by a professional inadequacy.
Dr. Thiederman suggested that the manager team the Asian woman with a colleague and have them present the project as a team. The manager agreed and, in Dr. Thiederman's word, the Asian employee was "eloquent."
Diversity programs appear to be having an impact. On the advice of Dr. Thomas, Avon Products, for example, capitalized on its own diversity. It gave black and Hispanic managers substantial authority over its unprofitable inner-city markets. The result: these markets are now among Avon's strongest performers.
Meanwhile, the Burger King Corporation, a unit of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., is using everything from "The Diversity Game," a board game, to three-day training seminars and has expanded the percentage of blacks and members of other minority groups in its work force to 28 percent last year, from 12 percent in 1986. And it has increased its business with suppliers owned by members of minority groups to $74 million this year, from $2 million in 1986, said Ray Hood-Phillips, vice president of human resources and diversity affairs for Burger King.
 
A Training Method: Ruffling Feathers
 "Upper-level white managers in charge of large numbers of people that include minorities can be taught to lead and manage those below them in a way that gets better business results across racial, ethnic and gender lines," said Floyd Dickens Jr., who with his wife, Jacqueline, founded 21st Century Management Services, in West Chester, Ohio. "But you first have to get inside people's heads and change behavior, and you can't do that without ruffling some feathers."
Around the country, conferences on diversity are attracting hundreds of managers from government and industry. Several colleges and universities now offer courses on diversity awareness, and a body of literature, including how-to books, has blossomed.
Among the most popular new training tools are videotapes, in which actors play out work situations illustrating everything from "exclusive old-boy networks" to racial and sexual discrimination.
According to various industry reports, 40 percent of American companies have some form of diversity training. One-fourth of some 1,400 companies polled last January by Haygroup of Philadelphia said that "adapting to work force diversity" is "a priority."
Of 645 national companies surveyed in 1990 by Towers Perrin, 29 percent offered programs in managing diversity. A 1991 follow-up of more than 200 of the same organizations found that work-related programs had increased since 1989, recession and economic woes notwithstanding.
 
Is It 'Touchy-Feely' Or the Real Thing?
 But more than a handful of blacks, Hispanic people and women express doubts about whether employers are sincere in their efforts to understand diversity or are merely paying lip service to it. These skeptics say that most employers have training in diversity awareness, but stop short of making extensive systemic changes.
"It's all this touchy-feely stuff -- 'I'll respect you, if you respect me,' " said a black woman, an account executive at a large consumer-products company in New Jersey, who spoke on condition that she not be identified. "Once you leave the room, it's back to business as usual. Nobody wants to hear about your day-care problems or your sick parent."
Indeed, a few employers acknowledge that the change of heart in favor of diversity came more from the business imperative than from altruism.
"There is some variation in the degree of commitment to diversity," Mr. Lattimer said. "Nearly all companies report that progress is occurring. However, results are not improving as quickly as had been previously anticipated or desired."
Of 11 companies -- among them Aetna Life and Casualty, A.T.& T., Gannett, Eastman Kodak and Mobil -- that participated in a Towers Perrin study of diversity, every one cited bias as a primary obstacle to upward mobility.
"Bias is reported to be particularly acute among middle managers who have not bought into the vision of senior management and are ignorant of the cultural issues of concern to women and minorities," Mr. Lattimer said. "One company found that managers are perceived as not believing upward mobility was a problem, or that discrimination exists."
Nevertheless, many consultants say, most employers are gradually facing the fact that the future of America in a global economy will rest with people who can understand cultural differences and can function across racial, ethnic, cultural and linguistic lines.
 
Diversity Leads To Better Performance
 "There is also a growing sentiment that diverse employee teams tend to outperform homogeneous teams of any composition," Mr. Lattimer said. "Managers tell us that homogeneous groups may reach consensus more quickly, but often they are not as successful in generating new ideas or solving problems, because their collective perspective is narrower."
Among the early converts was Burger King, which tells its customers, "Have it your way."
Since 1986, the 170 senior managers and 700 employees at Burger King's headquarters have gone through what is now described as their "basic training" in diversity awareness: a three-day session, including three hours playing "The Diversity Game."
The creator of the game, Dr. Alan Richter, vice president of Quality Educational Development in Manhattan, said: "The game tests players' knowledge while raising their awareness of diversity issues. Four teams of up to 20 players compete to answer multiple-choice questions in different categories, including demographics, jobs, legislation and society."
Mrs. Hood-Phillips said, "It's a wonderful way to learn, because it's interactive." After playing the game, she ordered 20 copies (retail price, $395 each) for franchise managers.
Dr. Lawrence G. Flores, designer of the Multicultural Promotional Track Game, uses a game strategy different from that of Dr. Richter. Players choose roles opposite to their own sex, racial or ethnic identity and try to reach the top of the corporate ladder, not necessarily by answering correctly, but by most closely simulating the methods, including office politics, traditionally used to advance in their own work places.
Dr. Flores, a former social worker who now works as a consultant, said, "I felt I wanted to take people to the action level to begin to see what it might feel like to be black, Hispanic or female and work your way up the promotional ladder."
 
Humor, and a Quest For Standards
 While some consultants use games, others use humor.
"I usually start out by telling an audience to impulsively raise their hand or keep it down," said Donald Kao, an Asian-American who is a New York City youth worker. "Then I ask, 'How many racists are in the room?' and then I immediately raise my hand and people are confused."
He conducts what he calls "supportive confrontation" workshops on college campuses. "I see the confusion on their faces," he continued. "Then I say, 'For the next two hours we are not going to worry about who is or isn't racist, but who is going to do something about racism and who isn't."
Dr. Sylvia S. Wagonheim, director of the Center for the New American Workforce at Queens College of the City University of New York, a resource network for business, education and government, said the center hoped to cut down on the confusion by creating minimum standards and criteria for professional trainers and consultants in diversity.
"Because diversity in business is so relatively new and there are so few hard facts, you have to sell it from a standpoint that it is competitive, effective and efficient," Dr. Wagonheim said. "Everybody has gone through the sensitizing stage, where there is an awareness. Now what? How do you resolve conflict? How do you try to make sure that person is happy in his or her work, that they can move ahead to fulfill their self-actuation?"

HEADLINE: ConEd Request Faces Challenge

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Consolidated Edison will seek a 6.5 percent increase in electricity rates in hearings that begin today, and the request has won preliminary approval from the Public Service Commission as the second of three increases over three years. But two consumer advocates are preparing to challenge the request and the concept of a three-year rate agreement, contending that they are harmful to consumers' interests.
The challenge comes from Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the state Consumer Protection Board, and Peter L. DiCapua, president of the Owners Committee on Electric Rates, a group of large commercial customers. Mr. Kessel said yesterday that if Con Ed had to ask for increases annually, it probably would not have asked this year. 
 The increase, he said, is twice the rate of inflation and comes as the company's service territory -- New York City and most of Westchester County -- struggles with a recession.
 
18.9 Percent Over Three Years
 The deal, announced a year ago, would give the company an increase in electric rates of about 18.9 percent over three years. The first increase, 5.1 percent, took effect in April; at issue now is an increase that would be effective in April 1993. It was originally supposed to be 6.7 percent, but Con Edison said yesterday that it would be 6.5 percent, or about $330 million.
At the company, Richard Robinson, the manager of rate design, said the increases were being driven by two factors: paying for efficiency programs and buying power from outside sources. The efficiency programs include rebates to customers who buy lamps, motors and air-conditioners that do the same work with less energy, and reimbursement to the company for the drop in electricity sales that result. The purchases come from independent generators, which Mr. Robinson said were needed as demand gradually rises and the company's own plants age.
Mr. Kessel argued, however, that economic conditions mean that no increase is justified. The company's allowable return on equity looks higher and higher when compared with prevailing interest rates, he said.
But Joan Freilich, Con Edison's vice president and controller, said the return on equity was "below the average rates being allowed in other states" and about average for utilities in New York State.

HEADLINE: Will Jawboning Ease U.S. Credit Squeeze?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Last Thursday, the Small Business Administration ran out of money and stopped issuing approvals to guarantee new bank loans to businesses until after Jan. 1, when more funds become available. The agency is still encouraging new applications, but at its recent pace of lending -- $25 million a day -- it will exhaust the $817 million loan quota for January through March well before that quarter ends.
During the recession, the S.B.A. has stepped in as banks became more wary of lending. And its budget shortfall is just one reminder that after two years of clamor about how the credit crunch has hurt the economy, there is not a cohesive Federal program to address the issue. 
 Clinton advisers have not tipped their hand about what banking changes they may recommend. But bankers hope that any proposal that emerges during President-elect Bill Clinton's economic conference in Little Rock this week will include more carrot than stick.
For the last two years, banks have been accumulating deposits and have the capacity to issue more loans, but they have been waiting for the economy to improve and bring with it increased loan demand and financially stronger borrowers. With those improvements still shadowy, many think lending is unlikely to pick up without jawboning of bankers or examiners or an increase in funds for the S.B.A.'s Government-guaranteed loan program.
For bankers, an attempt to increase lending by fiat is the least desirable of any near-term solution. "There is a lot of room for banks to change their behavior and do more lending, but I would hesitate before letting Congress legislate limits on where and how much banks should lend," Michael Forbes, the departing regional administrator of the S.B.A. in New York and New Jersey, said. "If the President and the Secretary of the Treasury make it a priority, they could jawbone the banks and embarrass them into lending more to small business."
Others say that the jawboning could be more effective if directed at bank regulators and examiners rather than at banks. Bankers widely agree that examiners have not become any kinder or gentler in their treatment of banks, despite the exhortations of the Secretary of the Treasury and other officials in the Bush Administration. The promptings of politicians have carried little weight because examiners still wince at the memory of testifying before Congressional committees to explain how they could have tolerated the practices that led to the failures of the Bank of New England and the National Bank of Washington.
 
 
Real Estatge Loans
 Top-ranking regulators were also blamed for letting banks get into trouble with real estate loans during the mid-1980's. Robert L. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, in charge of regulating most of the country's largest banks from 1986 till early this year, was blamed during his reconfirmation hearings in 1991 for controlling banks too loosely while other members of Congress and bankers were calling him the "regulator from hell." Mr. Clarke, who was not confirmed, disavowed the title, saying he was from Texas.
Another problem with jawboning is that it is uneven in effect and can lead to another cycle of excessive laxity in bank lending standards and examinations that would lay the seeds for heavy bank losses when the economy next weakens.
Christopher L. Snyder, president of the Loan Pricing Corporation, a company that works closely with banks to develop procedures for setting interest rates on loans that accurately reflect the risk of default, noted that previous episodes of jawboning had had unfortunate consequences. "In the early 1980's, Congress admonished bank examiners to lighten up and encourage business loans to flow," he said. "The message got through, and for several years the bank examination amounted to little more than a pleasant encounter."
Ira Stepanian, chairman of the Bank of Boston, recommends that jawboning be supplemented by a 50 percent reduction in the amount of capital banks must hold for loans to small businesses. By counting only half of small business loans -- the same percentage as for residential mortgages -- "regulators would free up a substantial portion of the capital base of banks, enabling them to do additional small business lending," he said.
Some analysts doubted Mr. Stepanian's recommendation would be accepted because it would undermine efforts to apply uniform capital rules on large banks around the world. They also worry about setting a precedent for using the capital adequacy rules as a tool for allocating credit to different areas of the economy.
Increasing the scope of the Small Business Administration is another widely prescribed remedy for tight credit. Last year, Congress twice increased the S.B.A.'s lending, so that by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, it had guaranteed $5.62 billion of loans, up from $4.15 billion the previous year.
Last August, Congress voted to authorize a $6.2 billion increase in new loan guarantees, but failed to make needed appropriations; the agency is currently authorized to guarantee only $3.27 billion of new loans this fiscal year, plus the $368 million in unused authority left over from the previous year.
Even if money were available for all $6.2 billion, some bankers say the amount is small relative to the need.
 "You could hardly call these budgets a serious effort to end the recession," Louis J. Cappelli, chairman of the Sterling National Bank and Trust Company in New York, said. Mr. Cappelli added that local governments could double the budgets of various business loan guarantee agencies, which would make it easier for banks to find partners to share the risks of loans to businesses that might be weak now, but have potential.
But before the S.B.A. and local government agencies can be put to work, banks must be willing to make the loans. Among the nation's nearly 12,000 banks, only 157 are "preferred" lenders that have authority to make Government-guaranteed loans without prior approval by the S.B.A. Only 670 banks are certified lenders that use the program often enough to receive notice within three days about whether their loans are acceptable to the agency.
Mr. Stepanian of the Bank of Boston said that the credit crunch in New England was lifting, thanks in part to the initiatives of bankers. His bank, for example, recently changed its rules so that a single lending officer can approve a loan, but two officers are needed to issue a denial.
These are other ways to encourage more bank lending:
*Quick action by regulators to adopt a provision of the housing bill passed this fall that would eliminate the current requirement that there be an appraisal for any loans above $100,000 that are backed by real estate.
*New procedures to make S.B.A. programs easier for banks to use.
*Enactment of a Federal law that would protect banks from the costs of cleaning up environmental damages caused by a bank's customer in cases in which the bank did not knowingly contribute to the problem.

Leaving Behind Problems at Arkla

BYLINE: By Kurt Eichenwald

 BODY:
JAN. 20, 1989. In Washington, George Bush was being sworn in as President. And on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Arkla Inc., a gas pipeline company, closed at $20.875.
Almost four years later, fortunes have changed. Mr. Bush is getting ready to leave the White House as the country's chief executive, having lost the election on concerns about the economy. And at Arkla, the chief executive is also packing, leaving behind investors who have seen their share price collapse by more than 50 percent since then, closing yesterday at just $8.25 a share. 
 And where is that chief executive, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, going? To the White House, to take over the job of chief of staff for the incoming Clinton Administration.
Mack McLarty, a boyhood chum of Bill Clinton's and a virtual unknown to Washington politics, ran Arkla for almost eight years, leaving behind a company that is struggling to pay down its debt, regain its profit margins and reorganize itself into a leaner, more effective corporation. People looking for signs of Mr. McLarty's potential in running the White House may not be pleased with what they see at Arkla.
"They have been doing pretty lousy, no question about that," Foster Corwith, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said of Arkla. "They are barely earning any money right now."
The problems at Arkla are multifold, running from too much diversification to organizational problems in critical businesses like gas pipelines to a $530 million lawsuit brought against the company in October by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal regulator for savings and loans.
Some analysts also criticize Mr. McLarty's hands-off management style. For example, they noted that even though the company's headquarters were in Shreveport, La., Mr. McLarty lived in Little Rock, Ark.
Wall Street appears worried that Arkla's problems may continue. Early yesterday, investors and analysts, hopeful that Mr. McLarty's resignation would be used by Arkla as a chance to focus on its profit troubles in its pipelines business, bid up the stock to as high as $8.875. Analysts said they expected the company would elevate Daniel L. Dienstbier, the former chief executive of Enron, the nation's largest pipeline system, who was named to a top post at Arkla in July.
But, when the company announced that T. Milton Honea, Arkla's vice chairman, would take over as chief executive, while Mr. Dienstbier would continue as president and chief operating officer, a disappointed Wall Street started selling, driving Arkla's stock price down 62.5 cents to its closing price of $8.25. It was the most active issue on the Big Board yesterday, with almost 3.5 million shares traded.
Company executives said yesterday that Wall Street's initial chill came because analysts knew Mr. Dienstbier better. "As the result of his background, Dan is quite well known to the analyst community, and Milt is not," said Michael B. Bracy, executive vice president for finance.
But regardless of who is in charge, Arkla's challenges are immense. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arkla has been paying dividends to shareholders in excess of its earnings. This means that Arkla increased its debt just to keep its dividend, which was finally cut this year. The company's trend for years has been increasing interest payments on more and more debt.
And yet, Arkla's ability to service that debt has grown more shaky, as profit margins for its various businesses have been squeezed. Even as its strategy has caused an increase in revenues, it has failed to see proportionate increases in operating income, S.E.C. filings show.
One area where profits have been disappointing is an important pipeline, known as Line AC. The line moves gas out of Oklahoma producing areas to other parts of the country. But that strategy depended on a price differential with gas from the Texas Gulf Coast of about 25 cents a million cubic feet, according to Carol Coale, an analyst with Howard Weile, Labrouisse, Friedrichs. That spread has been much narrower, sometimes about 8 cents to 10 cents a million cubic feet.
The company must also fight the lawsuit from brought by saving and loan regulators. The suit stems from the failure of University Savings Association, a Houston institution owned by Entex Inc. before Entex was purchased by Arkla in 1988. The suit contends that Entex failed to disclose the condition of the association when it was sold. Arkla denies the charges and plans to fight them.
With all of these troubles, Arkla announced a sweeping restructuring last month. Arkla will sell several of its companies, including its exploration unit, to reduce debt.
With top executives frequently replaced as part of major reorganizations, some on Wall Street openly wondered whether Arkla was taking advantage of the election of Bill Clinton to part amiably with its former chairman. But Arkla executives say no. "The timing is coincidental," Mr. Bracy said. "But in some ways, it is fortuitous."

HEADLINE: Trenton Senate to Let Voters Decide on Sports Gambling

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Without a vote to spare, the Senate approved a resolution today that would allow voters to decide whether to permit sports wagering at Atlantic City casinos.
The vote today, a victory for the powerful casino industry, begins a complicated legislative process aimed at placing the issue on the ballot in November 1993. If voters approve the measure, New Jersey would become the second state after Nevada to allow casinos to offer wagering on professional and college sporting events. 
 The amendment would ban wagering on sports events involving New Jersey colleges and universities, but there would be no prohibition against bets on professional teams in the state or on out-of-state colleges.
 
Called Crucial for Economy
 "The exclusion of New Jersey colleges under this proposal is a weak bid to pour bad chlorine into the betting pool," said the Assistant Senate Democratic Minority Leader, Richard J. Cody. "It won't clean up the stench that permeates this entire plan to make a bad scene worse."
Supporters of the resolution argue that it will allow the state to create new jobs and raise money for programs for senior citizens and the disabled by diverting to the state much of the $2.5 billion that officials say is bet illegally in New Jersey each year.
New Jersey voters legalized casino gambling in Atlantic City in a 1976 constitutional amendment. While the amendment did not specifically prohibit sports betting, the amendment's supporters said it would not be allowed.
Some of those same proponents and their new allies argue that sports wagering is now vital to the survival of the gambling industry in Atlantic City, which faces competition as diverse as riverboat gambling on the Mississippi River and casinos on Indian reservations in Connecticut.
Opponents of sports wagering, including the commissioners of every major professional team sport and officials of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, have based their campaign on the specter of criminal influence on players or game officials and on its potential to increase gambling addiction.
 
Facing 1994 Deadline
 Trenton is now caught up in a make-or-break debate over the issue, working under the pressure of a deadline imposed by a new Federal law that banned sports betting in most states but gave New Jersey voters until January 1994 to decide what to do. Four states other than Nevada have state-sponsored sports-betting lotteries.
In the Assembly today, members of the Financial Institutions Committee decided not to vote on the measure in order to allow time for more testimony.
In the Senate, intense lobbying efforts had placed the outcome of the vote in doubt up to the last minute. Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco had to take two roll-call votes before two of his Republican partymen who had abstained -- Senators John O. Bennett and John E. Dimon -- cast "yes" votes, providing the margin for victory. The vote had stalled at 19-16, two shy of the constitutionally mandated 21-vote majority. The final vote was 21-16.
"At last, the people of our state will be allowed to cast their vote on sports betting," said Senator C. Louis Bassano, a Republican from Union who sponsored the bill. "I am confident that our citizens will vote in favor of legalized betting, particularly in the light of our dire fiscal times."
 
Sports Officials Assailed
 Holding aloft copies of a newspaper's sports page turned to betting lines and picks of games, Mr. Bassano called the opposition by professional sports officials to his resolution hypocritical.
"The leagues that have been campaigning so vigorously against this bill, spending millions of dollars in the process, have never once raised a note of protest about the daily promotion of illegal gambling on sporting events that takes place in this country," Mr. Bassano said. "You can hear it on the radio, see it on TV or you can read it in the newspapers."
Today's Assembly committee hearing made clear the intensity of the fight, with a witness list that included the developer and casino owner Donald J. Trump, commissioners of professional sports leagues and representatives of other interest groups.
"Atlantic City is in very deep trouble," said Mr. Trump, who owns three casinos there. "This industry may not exist if it's not allowed to continue to grow."
 
Fierce Debate
 The commissioner of the National Basketball Association, David Stern, was among those speaking against the idea.
"The issue here is whether the state should lend its seal to teaching kids about gambling and turning them into gamblers," he said. "You don't legalize something just because there's illegal activity."
Earlier this year, backers of legalized sports wagering failed in an attempt to place the issue on the ballot. The opposition included United States Senator Bill Bradley, a former N.B.A. star for the New York Knicks.
Yet it was an attempt by Mr. Bradley to quash legalized sports betting nationally that led to the new effort to put the issue on the New Jersey ballot. Mr. Bradley was chief sponsor of Federal legislation that would have banned sports betting anywhere.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Tension Over Europe Eases; Trading in Dollar Is Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed yesterday against leading foreign currencies in subdued year-end trading. Tensions in the market eased somewhat after progress was apparently made toward unity at the European Community's weekend summit meeting.
Gold prices rose marginally in Asia, turned mixed in Europe and fell slightly in the United States. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, bullion for current delivery fell 60 cents an ounce, to $334.60. At the Republic National Bank, the spot price was $334.60 as well, down 50 cents from Friday. 
 Foreign exchange traders said some of the anxiety in the market on Friday before the European Community meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland, had faded. Leaders of the 12 community nations said after the meeting that they had successfully revived a flagging movement toward economic and monetary unity.
Doubts about Europe's ability to evolve toward a single-currency economy have played a crucial role in the foreign exchange turmoil sweeping through the market in recent months. A prime beneficiary of that turmoil has been the powerful German mark.
The mark continued to gain value yesterday. Traders ascribed the rise to the German central bank's strategy of keeping interest rates high, making investments denominated in marks worth more.
Traders said the mark's strength was putting pressure on some weaker European currencies, notably the French franc, but having no significant impact on the dollar.
"For the rest of the year, there's really no direction for the dollar," said Peter Iversen, assistant chief dealer at the foreign exchange desk of Shawmut Bank in Boston.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 123.88 Japanese yen, up 0.10 yen from the Friday close. Later, in London, it rose to 123.70 yen. In New York, the dollar fetched 123.765 yen, down from 123.90 late Friday.
The British pound strengthened in London at $1.5650, up from $1.5585 late Friday. In New York, 1 fetched $1.5665, up from $1.5570 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Friday, included: 1.57025 marks, down from 1.5785; 1.4090 Swiss francs, up from 1.4085; 1.27475 Canadian dollars, up from 1.27425, and 1,394.25 Italian lire, down from 1,396.50.
In Hong Kong, gold rose 39 cents to close at $335.51. Later, gold traded in London at $335.15 an ounce, up from $335.10 late Friday.

HEADLINE: Bad Tidings for California Banks

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Even without tougher national banking regulations that take effect on Saturday, California banks face serious problems in the coming year because of continued weak real-estate markets and a stubborn regional recession.
Federal regulators, banking analysts and officials of small and large banks agree that -- new rules or not -- there may be as many as 30 fewer banks in California next year as a result of the current problems. 
 The new rules require regulators to start closing a bank or savings and loan if its shareholder capital drops to less than 2 percent of its assets. The rules are intended to reduce taxpayer and deposit insurance losses from failed institutions by allowing regulators to seize them before they are insolvent.
 
Rules Known for a Year
 During the Presidential campaign, the independent candidate Ross Perot, among others, charged that the Bush Administration was hiding bank problems and that once the new regulations took effect the problems would suddenly flood the nation. But most banking experts contended then, as they do now, that there would be no such "December surprise."
The banks have known about the new requirements for a year, the experts say, and have been raising capital to comply with them. Indeed, nationwide, the condition of many banks has vastly improved in recent months, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said last week.
In California, banking troubles are particularly acute in regions where real-estate values dropped sharply and the military and aerospace industries retrenched, eliminating hundreds of thousands of high-paying engineering, manufacturing and construction jobs.
A bank's health mirrors the economy the bank serves. Most economists here say that California's economic slump has not bottomed out and that it may grow worse before the earliest projected recovery, in 1995.
"This is Armageddon for California banks," said George M. Salem, a banking analyst for Prudential Securities. "There will be great pain, and by the time it's finished banks will be forced to close or to merge, or they will be taken over by the F.D.I.C."
Banking experts maintain that small, independent banks in the southern part of the state are most vulnerable because they operate primarily in a region where the recession hit hardest and where bankers relied too heavily on loans backed by real estate -- an assertion that many small banks dispute.
The regulators and people in the banking industry see one positive aspect to the bank closings: they will eliminate overcapacity and ultimately reduce the cost of doing business.
F.D.I.C. officials point to a number of trouble spots in California's banking system that have caused regulators to view the state with great concern. As of Sept. 30, for example, 29 percent of California's 462 banks were showing losses for the year to date, compared with 6.5 percent of banks nationwide.
These losses were due in large measure to bad real-estate loans, particularly loans for the development of commercial buildings. At the end of September, 37 percent of all banking assets in California were tied to residential and commercial real estate, compared with a national average of 25 percent.
At the end of September, 63.7 percent of California's problem loans -- those that were more than 30 days past due -- were tied to real estate. That compared with 53.6 percent for the entire country, according to the Federal agency. The reason: commercial property owners are struggling to make loan payments because of high vacancy rates and pressure from tenants to lower rents.
 The F.D.I.C. estimates that problem real-estate loans totaled $7.5 billion in California at the end of the third quarter and $37 billion for the nation.
"We are watching California's banks more closely and have instructed our examiners to be sensitive to individual banks' performance and their real estate exposure," said Allan Whitney, the F.D.I.C.'s director of corporate communications. "But we also do not want our examiners to overreact."
 
'Troubled' Banks Quadruple
 As a matter of policy, mainly to prevent bank runs, the F.D.I.C. does not disclose information about the health of specific banks. But F.D.I.C. officials said the number of banks in the West, particularly in California, that were classified as "troubled" more than quadrupled from June 1990 to March 1992.
F.D.I.C. officials say that there have been 110 bank failures nationwide this year, involving $38 billion in assets, and that they expect a similar number of failures in 1993. But those failures will involve twice the amount of assets, or about $76 billion, and the largest number will occur in California, the nation's most populous and economically productive state, the regulators say privately.
Students of American banking say they think that generally speaking, the industry is prepared for the new regulations. "The 2 percent rule is similar to taking a final exam where the questions have been announced a year in advance," said Warren Heller, research director for Veribanc, a bank research firm. "You would have to be pretty stupid not to pass the exam, and banks would have to be in very bad shape not to meet the new rules."
Mr. Heller predicts that about 20 California banks will be closed next year because of bad real estate loans and a weak economy, especially small and medium-sized banks in Southern California, where the recession has hit hardest.
A recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that California's small banks, those with less than $300 million in assets, were more vulnerable than larger banks because they had relied more heavily on real estate loans that later turned sour. About two-thirds of all loans at the state's smaller banks were backed by real estate, and three-fifths of all real estate loans were for commercial property and construction, the study found.
But the independent banks say that they are not down for the count and that in some ways they are in a better position than larger banks to ride out the recession and the real estate decline. They say they are more flexible, less bureaucratic and easier to manage.
"I'm not minimizing the problems that we are facing," said Craig Hudson, director of the western region for the Independent Bankers Association of America, representing 260 small banks in California. "And yes, most of the closures that do take place will probably be smaller banks, but I don't think there will be a tremendous upsurge in problem banks."
Richard Korsgaard, president of Mariners Bank in San Clemente, which has $90 million in assets and is considered healthy, disputes the notion that smaller banks are worse off. He maintains that the independents are being hit hard by a wave of more stringent regulation, creating the appearance that they are poorer than they really are.
 
 
Strength of Large Banks
 California's large banks are not as susceptible as smaller ones, industry analysts say, because their business is spread throughout the state, they have been more closely scrutinized by regulators, and they have set aside larger reserves to cover potential loan losses. But the big banks are still feeling the bite of the recession.
Of the state's three largest banks, industry analysts say that Wells Fargo is perhaps the most vulnerable because it has the highest concentration of commercial real estate loans in Southern California. Still, Wells Fargo shares have performed well, partly because of large stock purchases by Warren E. Buffett, the prominent Omaha-based investor.
Bank of America, which recently merged with Security Pacific, did not become heavily involved in commercial real estate loans because of its problem loans in Latin America. But Mr. Salem of Prudential said he thought that cost savings achieved from the merger would be more than offset by losses from bad real estate loans at Security Pacific.
First Interstate has become the darling of the state's big banks because it recognized early where the state's real estate lending market was heading and bailed out, selling off assets and taking a huge charge that reduced its earnings. "Our bad experiences with real estate markets in Texas and Colorado in the 1980's taught us a valuable lesson," said Bruce Willison, chief executive of First Interstate Bank of California. "The usual path for bankers during a rolling recession is a prolonged denial phase, but this time we didn't stick our heads in the sand."
 
 
Rumors About Hollywood Bank
 City National Bank, known as the bank to the stars, was forced last month to increase its capital by $65 million as a cushion against losses, largely from real estate loans. The bank's parent, the City National Corporation, lost $60.2 million in the nine months that ended on Sept. 30.
For weeks, rumors have circulated in the entertainment industry that the bank, which is still strong enough to meet Federal capital requirements, is ripe for a takeover by regulators. George Benter, the president of City National, said that top bank officials had been holding meetings with concerned customers to assuage their doubts. About 40 percent of the bank's loans are in real estate.
Mr. Benter said he thought City National now had a "more than adequate" reserve to cover losses from real estate loans. The bank is concentrating on cutting costs, expanding its medium-size business and serving wealthy individuals.

GRAPHIC: Graphs show how California's banking industry compares with the U.S. industry as a whole. The percentage of loans that are more than 30 days overdue and the percentage of these 'problem' loans that are real-estate related are tracked quarterly since the first quarter of 1991. Also shown are the percentages of Californian banks reporting losses year-end 1990 and 1992 and year-to-date 1992. (Source: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation)

HEADLINE: 25 Years to Life in Slaying

 BODY:
An unemployed handyman received the maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison yesterday for the murder of a Hasidic woman who was stabbed to death in February in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The defendant, Romane LaFond, was convicted on Nov. 11 of slaying the woman, Phyllis LaPine, who was killed during a burglary in her apartment on Feb. 6. The crucial evidence in the eight-day trial was the defendant's bloody palm print, which was found on a wall next to Mrs. LaPine's body. Justice Francis X. Egitto, who conducted the trial, imposed the maximum sentence on the 24-year-old defendant in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.

Consumer Surge Is Facing Tests

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
CONSUMER confidence is a fickle thing. The economy has surged since October, in large part because Americans seem to be feeling more confident about their jobs and their incomes. So they have gone shopping. But sometimes a major event, like a military victory or a Presidential election, can cause people to feel better off than they actually are. And after a while, the optimism disappears, along with the surge in shopping and economic growth.
That possibility makes the consumer confidence surveys that will be conducted over the next six weeks very important in gauging whether a strong recovery has finally arrived after nearly four years of weak growth or outright recession. Consumer confidence has shot up since Election Day, but that is also the problem. Is Bill Clinton's election the only reason for the surge in optimism about jobs and higher wages? If so, can the optimism endure? 
 "Without doubt, there has been a Clinton effect on the polls, just as there was a Persian Gulf effect," said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan Consumer Surveys, referring to the brief surge in consumer confidence and economic growth in 1991, after the gulf war ended. "People have a firm expectation that Clinton will do something to steer the economy to better times. It is the anticipation of the change that has provided the initial stimulation, and it can wear off quickly."
What the anticipation has done is to encourage people to increase their spending by more than the rise in their incomes. To cover the shortfall, people have cut into savings or they have borrowed more. The hope is that the increase in retail sales, particularly for Christmas, will push up production as stores are restocked. And companies will finally hire more workers to produce the extra goods, spreading fresh income through the nation that can be used for more spending, thereby sustaining a recovery.
The increased hiring did not happen during the surge after the gulf war. Nor did it happen during another brief surge in consumer confidence and the economy last spring.
Corporate America, bent on becoming more efficient and cutting costs, has managed to increase output, when necessary, without raising payrolls. And that resistance to hiring or raises, still in evidence, soon saps public confidence and takes the pleasure out of shopping.
"The problem is that we have been burned twice and people are nervous that they might get burned again," said David Wyss, chief economist at DRI/ McGraw-Hill, which produces economic forecasts.
Nothing seems to catch the public's swings between hope and disillusionment as clearly as the monthly consumer confidence surveys conducted by the University of Michigan group, which polls people by telephone, and the Conference Board, a business group whose results are obtained from mailed questionnaires. The index tabulated from the Michigan polls reached 91.4 in early December from 73.3 in October, while the Conference Board's index jumped to 65.5 by late November from 54.6 in October.
What the polls try to capture is not some abstract view of the economy, but a citizen's own "economic environment," Fabian Linden, director of the Conference Board's survey, said. "Their companies are either hiring or firing, cutting back hours or adding work, and their own behavior is sensitive to these changes. They have friends and neighbors who are hired or fired, and that affects their purchases. They talk to local merchants who say business is better or worse, or they walk down Main Street and see another store closed."
The surveys try to capture two aspects of this personal experience. One is the present situation. Are jobs becoming more plentiful or are they harder to find for the people polled, and what is happening to their incomes? The second aspect measures expectations. Will jobs be easier or harder to get six months from now? Does the person think his income will be higher? Does he or she plan to purchase a car or a home or a major appliance by June?
The most recent surveys reveal that people do not consider their present situations much improved. Indeed, Albert Sindlinger, chairman of Sindlinger & Company, who tries through a telephone poll to measure household liquidity, or a family's purchasing power, finds that liquidity has risen lately in only six states, all in the West.
But when it comes to expectations for the future, all of the polls show a sharp improvement, apparently in response to Mr. Clinton's campaign promises to create jobs and improve wages. In each case, this optimism for the future has pulled up the overall consumer confidence index.
That saddles Mr. Clinton with a critical decision. To maintain people's hopes, should he push for quick approval of new public works spending or some other job-creating stimulus?
"The consumer confidence numbers are going to be critical in making that decision," said Lawrence H. Meyer, an economic consultant.

HEADLINE: Medical Research Boosts New York Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was delighted, at long last, to see mention of the contribution of medical scientists to the economic health of New York City (news article, Nov. 17). It is unfortunate, however, that the first mention of the vast sums that individual scientists, directly and indirectly, bring to the city was in an article with a negative cast. 
 Each year scientific investigators in New York City are awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in competitive grants. In addition, we attract large amounts of research money from private foundations, organize large international and national scientific conferences in New York, and attract thousands of scientists from other cities and countries to visit or work in our laboratories. These activities bring both funds and jobs to New York and great prestige to our city.
Despite these enormous benefits, the contribution of scientists to the economic health of New York City is virtually unknown to the general public.
Governmental organizations spring into action when a business with 50 or 100 employees threatens to leave New York; however, to my knowledge, no incentives have been given to attract scientists to New York or to retain those already here despite the fact that scientist-initiated medical research constitutes one of the largest enterprises in the city.

HEADLINE: German Asylum: Too-Liberal Policy?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Our German Crisis" by A. M. Rosenthal (column, Nov. 24) warns of one side of the German crisis: rising Nazism. But he fails to show that in contrast to the 1930's, the crisis in large part stems from Germany's policy on political asylum, the most liberal in all Europe. 
 The population of Germany is almost one-third that of the United States, while its geographical area is less than the state of Montana. Yet the U.S. is fearful of an invasion of tiny numbers of Haitians, many of whom have been terrorized and need political asylum. Moreover, Germany agreed to let in 220,000 Bosnian refugees when it was under siege from refugees all over Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The U.S. has agreed to the magnanimous quota of 1,000 Bosnians.
Perhaps Germany was too liberal in its political asylum policy. Clearly it has led to conflict between unemployed Germans -- especially East Germans -- and the rising number of refugees.
Mr. Rosenthal's solution of creating permanent international machinery to combat Nazi organizations is zealously single-minded. Instead of throwing stones, let us be consistent with our own ideals. If countries are to coordinate policy, should it not include coordinating refugee laws?

HEADLINE: I.B.M. AIMS TO CUT 25,000 MORE JOBS; SEES RECORD LOSS;
Shifting Role In Technology

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
The big cutback that I.B.M. announced yesterday has underscored what some of the nation's experts on technology have been saying for several years: While the world's largest computer maker remains a huge enterprise, it no longer can be expected to set the pace for technological innovation in the United States.
I.B.M. will slash its development spending by $1 billion, or 17 percent, next year, an amount unprecedented in its history. The company spent about $6.6 billion in 1991, the last year for which figures are available. Analysts believe it will spend a similar amount this year.
 
Role of Follower
 "I.B.M. as the I.B.M. that defined computing is over; it's gone," said Nathan Myrthvold, the Microsoft Corporation's vice president for advanced technology and business development. "As a result of new technology developments during the past 10 years, I.B.M.'s role in the computer industry has fundamentally changed." 
 The consequence is that what was once one of the world's most vaunted high-tech companies has been reduced to the role of a follower, frequently responding slowly and ineffectively to the major technological forces reshaping the industry. It has become increasingly clear that I.B.M. will no longer be the technological bulwark against foreign economic competition, a role it often played in the past with such inventions as the Winchester disk drive for data storage, a seminal achievement in 1973.
But rather than being a sign for despair, some technology experts say that I.B.M.'s decline may instead mark the emergence of a new model for computer and technology development in the United States that will become powerful in its own right. Alliances of smaller, more innovative companies -- sometimes working with Government support and sometimes on their own -- will come together quickly to attack crucial problems.
"We have watched while a small number of very important development organizations in the United States, including I.B.M., Bell Laboratories and Xerox, have slowly taken apart the engines behind their innovation," said R. Andrew Heller, a former I.B.M. engineer who now runs a Silicon Valley start-up company. "But we're seeing new centers of innovation emerge."
This year, for example, the United States will recapture the lead in market share in the world semiconductor market after lagging behind Japan for several years. And the Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., is poised to reclaim its title as the largest and most successful chip maker.
Moreover, despite fears of overwhelming international competition, American personal computer and disk drive companies have largely held the line against Asian and European competitors.
 
Sematech Given Credit
 A share of the credit for the semiconductor industry's remarkable turnaround is being given to Sematech, the industry-Government research consortium created five years ago to revitalize the country's chip makers. The consortium, based in Austin, Tex., developed new techniques to make chips to counter strides by Japanese competitors.
Sematech's success could point the way for further alliances in areas where in the past giant multinational corporations like I.B.M. and Digital Equipment would have carried most of the financial burden.
"It's fortuitous that the Clinton Administration has arrived when it did," said Samuel H. Fuller, vice president of research at Digital Equipment. "It's important that we have these underlying technologies and when companies like I.B.M. can no longer entirely fund development, its important that the Government step in."
This new alliance-based model of development and competition is one that I.B.M. has had a large hand in creating. As it found itself increasingly unable to compete and simultaneously sustain the burden of new technology development, the computer maker has reached out and built hundreds of alliances in recent years, ranging from one with Apple Computer to develop software to one with Supercomputing Systems Inc. in Eau Claire, Wis., to make supercomputers. And while some of these alliances have been successful, they have not been enough to turn the much greater tide of competition and shifting market forces.
But despite optimism about future research and development alliances, a deeper, more troubling issue still remains: Has I.B.M.'s technology spending nevertheless translated into an American advantage that will now be lost? The answer coming from many analysts and computer industry executives is no.
They now argue that the company's vast laboratories have frequently done much to bottle up needed technologies.
"We need to invest differently and what I.B.M. didn't do is figure out how to invest in things that paid off," said David Ditzel, director of advanced systems at Sun Microsystems, now a giant but a few years ago a tiny company that through quick moves came to dominate the engineering work station market that I.B.M. was slow to enter.
I.B.M.-watchers also argue that by spinning off tens of thousands of engineers and programmers in the last five years, the computer maker has increased the pace of innovation.
For example, while I.B.M. invented a way of speeding up computer hardware called reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, it was commercialized elsewhere first, in part by former I.B.M. researchers who left to join other, more nimble companies.
The company developed a fundamental data base computer technology called SQL, but it was the Oracle Systems Corporation in Belmont, Calif., that took the technology and turned it into a company with sales of $1 billion a year, eclipsing I.B.M. in the data base market.
Underlying I.B.M.'s collapse is simply what the economist George Gilder has called "the law of the microcosm." That is, every three years the world's chip makers have been able to put four times as many transistors on a single piece of silicon, leading to vast increases in power and miniaturization.
Each new powerful generation of microchip has created a new computer industry and overthrown the previous one: mainframe computers in the 1960's gave way to minicomputers in the 1970's, then personal computers, work stations and now palm-sized personal digital assistants.
Although over the years I.B.M. often became a significant, if not dominant, player in new computing businesses, the pace of change has been so swift that the company, growing ever larger, could not alter its course fast enough.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton Economic Session Yields Clear Goals, but Solutions Clash

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 15

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton's economic conference ended today with a consensus on the need to spur growth in the short term and reduce the deficit over the long haul, but with a welter of contradictory advice on how to achieve these goals.
The President-elect took in all the comments from the economists, business executives and labor leaders gathered here. But he refrained from tipping his hand over what approaches he intended to take at first.
 
Toughest Issue Ahead
 Participants at the conference proposed solutions ranging from spending a few million dollars to spending $60 billion on roads, bridges and education training to help create jobs and jolt the economy. And they suggested various timetables for reducing the deficit; some would start at once, others would phase in cuts starting several years from now. 
 But with all the give and take of the last two days, Mr. Clinton has still not addressed the most difficult economic issue and perhaps the hardest political question he will face as President: Which Government programs should be cut and which taxes should be raised to lower the deficit? [Page A27.]
Today's session at the Robinson Auditorium was a rare, although staged, glimpse of the President-elect and his top economic advisers thinking aloud about their choices. Whereas on Monday Mr. Clinton and his advisers mostly listened, today they probed the specialists who offered their wisdom. [Excerpts, page A26.]
The give and take disclosed how much the Clinton team is still groping for answers, and how experts in basic agreement with Mr. Clinton's general views could still disagree sharply.
At a news conference following the 19 hours of discussions over two days, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that "no two participants agreed on the details." But at the same time, he insisted, there were several areas of agreement that he would take into account as he makes the "tough choices" in shaping his first budget.
For instance, Mr. Clinton said there was an "absolute consensus" on the need to increase investment, not only in roads and bridges, but also in education and training, to improve the long-term productivity of the work force.
He said there was also accord that the Clinton Administration must "increase access" to bank loans and other capital so that small businesses and entreprenuers can flourish. This could be done to some extent through deregulation. Finally, he said, there was a complete consensus that there is a "huge undercapacity" in the economy so that the threat of inflation from some increased government spending is minimal. Therefore, he added, the Federal Reserve should not raise interest rates as soon as growth picks up, but should wait instead until there are real signs of inflation.
These were the President-elect's most pointed comments yet about Federal Reserve policy, and they were in line with the views of many of the bank's governors.
About the only policy issue on which Mr. Clinton committed himself was his intention to make health-care costs his top priority. Without controlling them, he told the gathering, none of the advice about deficit reduction or spending would be relevant.
 
Pounding His Fist
 "We are kidding each other," he said, pounding his fist on the table. "We are all just sitting here making this up if we think we can fiddle around with the entitlements and all this other stuff and get control of this budget, if you don't do something on health care. It is a joke. It's going to bankrupt the country."
Mr. Clinton, who conducted the 10 hours of discussions on Monday, sat at the helm for all nine hours today, dispensing with a flick of the wrist calls from his aides to cut off by 4 P.M. so his closing news conference would make the evening news.
If Monday's session was economics 101, today's often sounded like a postgraduate seminar for economists. At one point, a political scientist interrupted to remind Mr. Clinton and his advisers that they may have only a little time before the President-elect's honeymoon expires.
"There are two topics on the table: short-term stimulus and long-term deficit reduction," Elaine Kamarck, a political scientist from the Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington-based research center, told Mr. Clinton. "The first one requires very little political capital. The second one requires enormous amounts of political capital.
 
Window of Opportunity
 "What we know historically is that Presidents come in and they have a honeymoon," she added. "That honeymoon last six months, if they are lucky. You have a window of opportunity to achieve real progress on the long-term problems that we have heard about in the last two days."
Despite that caveat, deep and longstanding differences were manifest throughout the day. Isabel Sawhill, senior Fellow of the Urban Institute, said slow productivity growth was the "cancer" killing the economy, while economist Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution said the soaring deficit was the "slow, wasting disease" sapping the economy.
James Tobin, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who served on President John F. Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers, told Mr. Clinton he should opt for tax cuts or spending programs totaling $50 billion to $60 billion for each of the next two years. During the campaign Mr. Clinton spoke about $20 billion in public-works spending over four years.
But Mr. Tobin contended that only an injection at the higher level would be able to create about nine million jobs that will be needed over the next four years to absorb new workers entering the marketplace, bring down the unemployment rate and lure back those workers who have simply dropped out.
"Almost every recovery since the Second World War has been helped by fiscal stimulus," said Mr. Tobin. He said such prodding raises the deficit "temporarily."
"We're fooling ourselves if you think there's a way of having a fiscal stimulus that doesn't have that result," he said.

HEADLINE: Bush, in Texas Valedictory, Defends His Foreign Policies

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLLEGE STATION, Tex., Dec. 15

 BODY:
President Bush flew to the Texas heartland today to begin staking a claim to history, arguing in an occasionally vivid speech that he correctly spent his four-year term asserting America's global leadership in an era of change.
Mr. Bush said the crises of his Presidency -- in the former Soviet Union, in the Persian Gulf and now in Somalia and Bosnia -- proved that American military and moral force were "indispensable" to the spread of democracy and political stability. 
 And in passages that seemed aimed at his Democratic successors, who captured the White House last month by dwelling almost exclusively on the nation's domestic problems, he warned that future leaders could shun the United States' unique global role only at the nation's peril. [Excerpts, page A25.]
 
'Frightening' Price
 Dismissing those who "assert that domestic needs preclude an active foreign policy," he asserted that "the alternative to American leadership is not more security for our citizens, but less; not the flourishing of American principles, but their isolation."
"Destiny, it has been said, is not a matter of chance," Mr. Bush warned. "It's a matter of choice. Our choice as a people is simple: We can either shape our times, or we can let the times shape us. And shape us they will, at a price frightening to contemplate -- morally, economically and strategically."
American leadership is not only an imperative in a world that lacks any other dominant force, Mr. Bush said, but it is also a "hard nosed" calculation of what is in the nation's own interest. Otherwise, he said, the United States risks being overwhelmed one day by the global forces of despotism and anarchy that it now leads the fight to contain.
In effect, Mr. Bush's 34-minute address at Texas A&M University played the political ace -- his dominance of foreign affairs -- that some advisers had urged him to lay down during his autumn campaign against Bill Clinton. Beyond boilerplate allusions to foreign affairs in his standard campaign speech, Mr. Bush seldom made the case for his importance as a global leader during his campaign, largely because opinion polls suggested that the public was not interested.
Today's forceful endorsement of America's worldwide role came 36 days before the end of Mr. Bush's Presidency, in a coliseum near the flat expanse of horse pasture where Texas A&M plans to erect a library and museum memorializing his four years in office.
The address was a valedictory of sorts, not just for Mr. Bush's role on the world stage, but for an entire generation of World War II youths, beginning with John F. Kennedy, who maintained America's role as the free world's bulwark during the tense moments of the cold war.
Mr. Bush made that point several times, with some passion and often with evident pride, as he outlined his argument for a United States anchored firmly at the forefront of worldwide change.
 
Images of Cold War
 "Steadfast and sure," he said, "generations of Americans stood in the path of the Soviet advance, while our adversary probed for weaknesses that were never found. Presidents from both parties led an Atlantic alliance held together by the bonds of principle and love of liberty; facing a Warsaw Pact lashed together by occupation troops."
Now, with the world facing new threats from ethnic strife, nationalism and the spread of hugely destructive weapons, Mr. Bush said the nation must summon the same resolve to consolidate the victories it won with the collapse of the Soviet empire.
Early in his term, Mr. Bush often suggested in self-deprecating fashion that he was a pragmatist who lacked what he called "the vision thing." Today, by contrast, he appeared to say that he indeed has a vision, and that it is of a world led by the United States to global peace and the rule of law. He did not hesitate to list his contributions toward that goal.
"Some will dismiss this vision as no more than a dream," he said. "I ask them to consider the last four years, when a dozen dreams were made real." Among them, he said, were the spread of democracy in the East; the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany; the victory in the Persian Gulf war and the start of peace talks between Israel and its Arab enemies.
 
U.S. as Moral Force
 "Each one of those once seemed a dream," he said. "Today they are concrete realities, brought about by a common cause: the patient and judicious application of American leadership, American power and American -- perhaps most of all -- American moral force."
This was Mr. Bush's first substantive speech since his Nov. 3 election loss to Bill Clinton, but aides said he could deliver one or two more before his term ends, all on major issues facing the nation. The next, if it occurs, is likely to be at a military service academy, probably West Point.
The genesis of the addresses is intriguing, if not entirely clear. Mr. Bush had seemed to shun public appearances after his defeat, and some advisers say the speech was suggested to him in mid-November in an effort to remind Mr. Bush that, defeated or not, he had responsibilities and a place in history worth noting and defending.
White House aides said the speech was roughly modeled after the famous farewell address delivered by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in January 1961, as Kennedy prepared to assume power. Eisenhower elevated his place in history, coined an enduring phrase and helped set policy for a generation of leaders by warning "against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Address by President Bush at Texas A&M

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: COLLEGE STATION, Tex., Dec. 15

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's address at Texas A&M University today, as transcribed by Reuters:
In 36 days I'll hand over the stewardship of this great nation, capping a career in public service that began 50 years ago in war-time skies over the Pacific. And our country won that great contest, but entered an uneasy peace. 
 You see, the fires of World War II cooled into a longer cold war, one that froze the world into two opposing camps. On the one side, America and its allies, and on the other, the forces of freedom thus against an alien ideology that cast its shadow over every American.
And three years ago, when I was honored to address the graduating class here at Texas A&M, I spoke of the need to move beyond containment, and I said we seek the integration of the Soviet Union into the community of nations. Ultimately, our objective is to welcome the Soviet Union back into the world order. And was this aim too ambiguous? Not for And today, by the grit of our people and the grace of God, the cold war is over, freedom has carried the day and I leave the White House grateful for what we have achieved together.

 	 	 		. . .	 	History's lesson is clear. When a war-weary America withdrew from the international stage following World War I, the world spawned militarism, Fascism and aggression unchecked, plunging mankind into another devastating conflict. But in answering the call to lead after World War II, we built from the principles of democracy and the rule of law a new community of free nations, a community whose strength, perseverance, patience and unity of purpose contained Soviet totalitarianism and kept the peace.
And in the end, Soviet Communism provided no match for free enterprise beyond its borders or the yearning for liberty within them. And the American leadership that undermined the confidence and capacity of the Communist regimes became a beacon for all the peoples of the world. Steadfast and sure, generations of Americans stood in the path of the Soviet advance while our adversary probed for weaknesses that were never found.

 	 	 		. . .	 	And the American people demonstrated that they would shoulder whatever defense burden, make whatever sacrifice was needed to assure our freedom and protect our allies and interests. And we made use of this superb technology that our free enterprise system has produced. . . .
And as the Soviet system stalled and crumbled, so too did the ability of its rulers to deny their people the truth about us and about them. And in the end, Soviet Communism was destroyed by its own internal contradictions. . . .
And the Soviet Union did not simply lose the cold war. The Western democracies won it. And I say this not to gloat but to make a key point. The qualities that enabled us to triumph in that struggle -- faith, strength, unity and, above all, American leadership -- are those we must call upon now to win the peace.
In recent years, with the Soviet empire in its death throes, the potential for crisis and conflict was never greater, the demand for American leadership more compelling. And as the peoples of Eastern Europe made their bold move for freedom, we urged them along a peaceful path to liberation. They turned to us, they turned to America, and we did not turn away. . . .
And when the people of Russia blocked the tanks that tried to roll back the tide of history, America did not walk away. I can remember speaking to Boris Yeltsin at that terrible moment of crisis, and at times the static on the telephone made it almost impossible to hear him. But there was no mistaking what he wanted to know. He asked where the United States of America stood. And America answered for all the world to hear: We stand with you.

 	 	 		. . .	 	No society, no continent should be disqualified from sharing the ideals of human liberty. The community of democratic nations is more robust than ever, and it will gain strength as it grows. . . . By working with our allies, by invigorating our international institutions, America does not have to stand alone.
And yet from some quarters we hear voices sounding the retreat. We've carried the burden too long, they say, and the disappearance of the Soviet challenge means that America can withdraw from international responsibilities. And others assert that domestic needs preclude an active foreign policy, that we've done our part; now it's someone else's turn.
We're warned against entangling ourselves in the troubles that abound in today's world, to name only a few--clan warfare, mass starvation in Somalia, savage violence in Bosnia, instability in the former Soviet Union, the alarming growth of virulent nationalism.
And it's true, these problems, some frozen by the cold war, others held in check by Communist repression, seem to have ignited all at once, taxing the world's ability to respond.
But let's be clear. The alternative to American leadership is not more security for our citizens but less. Not the flourishing of American principles but their isolation in a world actively held hostile to them. . . .
Our choice as a people is simple. We can either shape our times or we can let the times shape us, and shape us they will, at a price frightening to contemplate -- morally, economically and strategically.
Morally, the failure to respond to massive human catastrophes like that in Somalia would scar the soul of our nation.

HEADLINE: FISCHER IS INDICTED OVER CHESS MATCH

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Bobby Fischer, the mercurial chess master who returned to the game professionally in September after 20 years, was indicted today on charges that he had violated economic sanctions against Yugoslavia by playing a match there.
A Federal grand jury here handed up the single-count indictment that accused Mr. Fischer of violating an executive order issued by President Bush in June that restricted commercial relations with what remains of Yugoslavia. 
 In the match, Mr. Fischer defeated the Russian-born grandmaster Boris Spassky in an exhibition rematch of their celebrated 1972 world championship.
Immediately after the indictment, Federal officials issued a warrant for his arrest.
Mr. Fischer, who was believed to be in the former Yugoslav federation, faces the choice of living in exile or returning to the United States for a trial that could result in up to 10 years in prison and a fine as high as $250,000.
 
Prosecution No Surprise
 Action against Mr. Fischer appeared a virtual certainty after his brooding and bitter news conference in September in Sveti Stevan, Yugoslavia, 70 miles from the killing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a former Yugoslav Republic. He produced a Treasury Department letter ordering him not to play and warning of possible prosecution, held it up and spit at it.
The indictment came as Mr. Fischer appeared ready to resume a more active playing schedule. When he captured the championship 20 years ago, his strategic brilliance and relentless accuracy earned him the reputation as one of the greatest chess players ever. His most recent performance reflected an inconsistent, though promising foray back into the game.
 
Trial or Exile
 Prosecutors said that since he had also violated a United Nations economic sanctions measure they would try to have him extradited if he traveled outside of the former Yugoslav federation, although experts in international law said that would be very difficult.
"Mr. Fischer faces the choice of returning to this country or being checkmated to Yugoslavia," said Jay B. Stephens, the United States Attorney in Washington, who said that the Government could also try to seize his winnings of $3.35 million and 10 percent of the match's royalties.
International law scholars expressed surprise that, of all the possible violations of the economic embargo by arms salesmen and other commercial ventures, the Administration had chosen to go after a former chess champion.
"I'm amazed," said Andreas F. Lowenfeld, a professor of international law at New York University who was a deputy legal adviser at the State Department in the 1960's. "With all the criminals in the world, it's hard to believe you go after Bobby Fischer. I understand you want to be serious about economic sanctions. But he would not be my prime target."
But Mr. Stephens defended the indictment for conveying an important message about the devastation in the former Yugoslavia.
He said, "There is violence and there is ethnic cleansing. The world community has indicated that economic sanctions should be imposed and, in being imposed, should be enforced."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: The Budget - Economic Solutions: a Sampling of Advice, and Clinton's Response;
The Struggle to Reduce the Deficit

 BODY:
Selections by The New York Times from a transcript recorded by Reuters.
 
Elaine Kamarck
 
Senior fellow, Progressive Policy Institute
There's two topics on the table, short-term stimulus and long-term deficit reduction. The first one requires very little political capital. The second one requires enormous amounts of political capital.
What we know historically is that presidents come in and they have a honeymoon. That honeymoon lasts six months if they're lucky. You have a window of opportunity to achieve real progress on the long-term problems that we've heard about in the last two days. If you look at the four sectors of this budget, every single one of them is a political nightmare that you will have to get through to make honest-to-goodness, long-term deficit reduction. 
 Spending money, on the other hand, is quite an easy thing to do. We Democrats do it quite well; we do it quite often.
Henry J. Aaron Economist, Brookings Institution It may be that stimulus is necessary. But if the economy shows continuing signs of recovery, I think it should be extremely small or possibly shelved. I'd like to turn and focus most of my attention, however, on long-term deficit reduction which has been likened to a disease.
If the Federal deficit remains just an abstraction, a number too large for human comprehension, a quantity that floats unconnected with human loss and frustration that it inevitably causes, we are never effectively going to deal with it.
As you know better than I am sure anybody else around this table, the calls for increased spending and for tax breaks -- you've heard many of them here -- are endless. These claims are tangible and easily understood and many of them are deserving of approval.
But unless the public recognizes that the excessive Federal deficits affect the economic hopes and aspirations of U.S. businesses and U.S. workers, the deficit and the pain it inflicts are going to persist indefinitely.
The United States needs more private investment, not less. That means, I think, that all new Government spending should be paid for by either cutting other spending or by raising taxes, not by even more borrowing.
 
Leon E. Panetta
 
Representative, Democrat of California
The larger a stimulus package that you present to the Congress, the longer it's likely to take the Congress to enact a stimulus package. That was the experience in the Carter years.
The second point I would make is that . . . the more you can set out your long-term investments and then speed up some of those investments in the early period, then you've got a long-term strategy that you're implementing as part of your stimulus package. I think that makes sense.
And the third thing is obviously to tie it to deficit reduction. . . . If you do a stimulus package, let me assure you, Congress loves to pass the sugar, but hates to deal with the vinegar, which is the deficit part of it. So it does have to be locked into a single package if you're going to be able to get it through.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: Banking - Economic Solutions: a Sampling of Advice, and Clinton's Response;
How Easing Rules Would Help

 BODY:
Selections by The New York Times from a transcript recorded by Reuters.
 
Vice President-elect Al Gore
We heard earlier about other options for stimulating short-term economic growth, in addition to a new fiscal package, and one of them, for example, was the easing of bank regulations to free up a lot of money that entrepreneurs could get ahold of to expand and so forth. . . . What order of magnitude stimulus would you expect to come from easing those bank regulations?
 
Bill Brandon
 
National Bank of Phillips County, Arkansas
If you were to increase lending in the banking system just 4 percent, which we can do, Mr. Sinai, with no effect on safety and soundness, and we can demonstrate that, you would increase the amount of capital coming out $86 billion, which would be a tremendous input back into small business. 

Mary Houghton
 
 President, Shorebank Corporation
My own very small bank makes $30 million of new loans each year into targeted inner city communities. That's three times our capital base. If a large bank were doing the same thing, they would be generating $5 billion a year of credit into inner city communities. So the capacity of the banking system and the capacity of the nonprofit development system are there today to be used, if they can be incentive in any of a thousand ways, to get to work in the inner cities.
 
 Andrew F. Brimmer
 
Former governor, Federal Reserve, and president, Brimmer & Company
 In December 1991, the Congress adopted and the President signed something called the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. This was, in my judgment, the most Draconian rollback of ability of financial institutions to lend, especially the commercial banks. I would hope you would provide some leadership in trying to persuade the Congress to roll back those regulations.

HEADLINE: Trump's Back and May Be Bankable

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Is Donald Trump back, as big and as bankable as ever?
The irrepressible New York developer says yes, absolutely, without a doubt. 
 He has been saying so since last May, when he called reporters to crow about a rebound in the prices of his junk bonds. But now there are signs that at least some people on Wall Street agree with him.
Investment bankers approached about the deal report that Merrill Lynch has been put to work on a proposal to refinance the debt of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, the healthiest of Mr. Trump's three gambling halls in Atlantic City. Merrill declined to comment, but the deal on the drawing board reportedly calls for the sale of as much as $335 million in new bonds, at today's low interest rates, and the use of that money to retire $300 million in more expensive debt, with funds left over -- presumably for Mr. Trump.
Would bond buyers actually invest again with a man whose record includes no fewer than four bankruptcies in the last two years, each of which left creditors with far less than they had originally bargained for? "There's a big pool of capital out there," said a senior junk-bond trader at a major Wall Street firm. "And not everybody in it has been burned by him."
The bankruptcies were Trump Plaza, the developer's two other casinos, Trump Taj Mahal and Trump Castle, and the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.
Reports of a Plaza casino refinancing plan first arose in August in Mergers and Corporate Policy, a newsletter. But the proposal apparently languished after holders of the casino's preferred shares gave it a cool reception. More recently, a number of people have said privately that they heard Mr. Trump boast, in what one called "cocktail party talk," that he soon plans to try again as both the junk market and the casino's performance have strengthened.
Ernest E. East, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said yesterday that he was "unaware of any public statements Mr. Trump has made." He added, "It would in fact be highly inappropriate to talk about any refinancing plans, since we are talking about publicly traded debt." Such chitchat would become appropriate, he said, only "if and when we file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
"And I just don't want to speculate on the future," he added.
Speculating on the future is, of course, Wall Street's stock in trade. And a surprising number of analysts and traders now think that a deal is not only financially possible but highly marketable. If they're right, Mr. Trump could pull as much as $25 million in cash out of the Plaza casino after paying his investment bankers.
"I think the Plaza is eminently financeable," said Ben Nickoll, a bond trader at Lehman Brothers.
The bankers who originally helped finance that casino would be first in line for that $25 million, of course, since Mr. Trump's equity is pledged to them as collateral for loans. But some lawyers who have been negotiating with Mr. Trump since his personal debt crisis began in 1990 speculate that the bankers might let him keep some of the money just to reduce their exposure to him.
There is a fly in this ego-soothing ointment, however. The New Jersey Casino Control Commission must approve any change in the Plaza casino's capital structure. Mr. Trump's debt-defaulting habits have already caused considerable embarrassment and worry for state regulators, who originally let him acquire his dominant stake in New Jersey's casino industry on the strength of his billionaire credentials. It therefore seems unlikely, one senior state official said, that they would approve any deal that lined Mr. Trump's wallet at the expense of the casino's balance sheets.
Steven Perski, the commission's chairman, said his agency had not received any refinancing proposals. "All three casinos are deemed to be financially stable within their present capital structures," Mr. Perski said. And all three casino licenses are due for commission review and renewal next spring, he added.
 
'More Careful About Covenants'
 Regulators notwithstanding, Wall Street clearly sees Mr. Trump in a new light. One measure of its enthusiasm came last week, when Salomon Brothers, one of the street's leading bond-trading houses, recommended the Plaza casino's preferred stock, in part on the strength of a possible refinancing deal that would redeem the stock for cash.
In making that recommendation, the Salomon analyst, Thomas F. Doyle, outlined the advantages of a refinancing plan and said, "We believe that Donald Trump will attempt such a recapitalization during 1993."
Max Holmes, director of bankruptcy research at Salomon, called the Trump preferred "a pure play on The Donald's greed." He added: "This is the only property where he can take money out and get 100 percent control back. So if you buy the preferred at $23 a share, you're betting he will pay you $25 a share to redeem the stock in a refinancing."
But one senior junk-market analyst noted, in Wall Street's defense, that any public bond deal floated these days for Mr. Trump would certainly carry stricter terms and restrictions. "For one thing, the market has gotten more careful about covenants," he said. "For another, in the earlier issues, the market just looked at the aura of Mr. Trump and assumed that they could look to him, without any formal guarantees. Now, people have enough sense to see that didn't get them very far last time out. They'll want formal protections."
 
'People Learned Their Lesson'
 Nor is the junk-bond market the only place where Mr. Trump is being seen in a new and more accommodating light. Even as the bankers who got burned on his last round of defaults are haggling over final details, there is talk that they might make new financing available to Mr. Trump -- if the terms were right.
"People have learned their lesson," said one finance executive familiar with the terms of some recent credit supplied to Mr. Trump. "They're not going to give him money carte blanche. People view him more as a venture capital guy now." And people who finance venture capitalists don't settle for promises to repay, he said. They insist on a share of the ownership and a strong say in the operation. "In the old days, guys would lend to Mr. Trump without even inspecting the property," he added. "I think those days are over."
Would bankers actually be willing to go to the loan committee at their shell-shocked institutions and propose lending to Donald Trump? "Listen, with interest rates this low, some banks will do anything to earn a fat fee and a nice spread over current rates," said one rueful lawyer. "The first calls would probably be to the last people who financed Robert Maxwell." Mr. Maxwell was the British publisher whose death in November 1991 left his tangled trans-Atlantic empire awash in debt.
 
Health, and Healthy Skepticism
 Wall Street veterans will no doubt be quick to remind Mr. Trump's new boosters that the most dangerous words in finance are "it's different this time." But even skeptics agree that Mr. Trump's casino empire is looking much healthier.
The Plaza is the only property in which Mr. Trump can credibly claim any equity, even on paper. But all three Trump casinos are doing fairly well, as Atlantic City edges out of its recession. A proposed expansion of Atlantic City gambling into sports betting would presumably help the casino industry even further by offering new wagering profits without requiring much in the way of investment, said Wilbur Ross, a bankruptcy specialist with Rothschild Inc., an investment banking firm.
And the state's expressed desire to have additional hotel rooms constructed in Atlantic City "could outweigh objections to increased leverage on Trump Plaza," said Mr. Doyle, the Salomon analyst.
And after a slump this fall, the market for poorer-quality bond issues also looks more promising. Cash began to flow back into junk-bond mutual funds during November, Mr. Doyle noted. And while investors have shown no appetite for new issues at the lowest end of the credit spectrum -- where the Taj Mahal and the Castle bonds are trading -- the Plaza bonds are now seen as a relatively high grade of junk.
The only rein on Mr. Trump's renaissance, then, would seem to be the New Jersey casino agency. Without its approval, Mr. Trump will simply have to live with the deals he has now -- or relent and sell some of his own stake in the casino in the form of a public stock offering to raise money. It remains to be seen if casino regulators have longer memories than investment bankers.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Dodging the Big One

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 15

 BODY:
Bill Clinton has still not addressed the most difficult economic issue and perhaps the hardest political question he will face as President: Which Government programs should be cut and which taxes should be raised to lower the budget deficit?
Anyone looking for the answer at the two-day economic conference this week was disappointed. Not only did Mr. Clinton skirt the question, but so too did most of the prominent economists and business executives he invited here to chew the fat at his seminar on the economy. 
 They had plenty of ideas for how to cut taxes and increase spending to give the economy a quick jolt: Give business a tax break for investments; construct roads, bridges and airports; improve education and job training; build low-income housing; invest in environmental cleanup; subsidize agriculture exports; immunize poor children against diseases; help American companies compete with those abroad.
But while nearly all the participants agreed that the short-term honey should be coupled with bitter medicine to reduce the deficit over the long haul, hardly anyone was willing to prescribe a specific dosage.
For the most part over the last two days, Mr. Clinton showed a remarkable command of the most complicated economic issues. But in the rare instances when a panelist dared to focus on the specifics of deficit reduction, the President-elect basically had nothing to say.
"This was not the time to do it," said George Stephanopoulos, his communications director. Raising such unpleasant matters now, he explained, would almost assure their defeat later on.
Maybe so. But throughout his Presidential campaign and the transition period so far, Mr. Clinton has shown a talent for stating the country's economic problems in a way the public can understand them. This, after all, is primarily what got him elected. Speaking today of the deficit, he said, "We all understand the price we're going to pay if we continue with this deficit."
But Mr. Clinton has demonstrated little capacity for telling people what they do not want to hear. Beyond saying that families with incomes above $200,000 and foreign corporations should pay more taxes, Mr. Clinton has not tried to prepare individuals, companies, interest groups and communities for the pain they might have to bear to lower the deficit.
The President-elect has borrowed a great deal from John F. Kennedy. But he has never used the Kennedy line about asking what you can do for your country.
 
Running Out of Time
 If Mr. Clinton was as eager as he said he was at the outset of the conference to get advice from the experts about how to proceed on the economy, he might have been expected to seek their counsel here this week on the tough issues and not just the easy ones.
Mr. Clinton has assured Representative Leon E. Panetta, who is to be his budget director, that as President he will lead the drive to bring the deficit under control, said associates of Mr. Panetta.
With only five weeks before he takes office and having promised to get his economic package enacted in his first 100 days as President, Mr. Clinton is running out of time.
History has shown that the difficulty in lowering the deficit is in the details, not in the principle. One reason such efforts generally failed over the last four years is that President Bush refused to stick his neck out on the details.
In the absence of Presidential leadership on such matters, Congress is incapable of acting.
 
Nudges to No Avail
 A few of the participants here tried to force Mr. Clinton's hand, or at least to nudge him gently.
Marion Sandler, who runs a savings and loan in California, called on politicians to "demonstrate some courage" and reduce Social Security and Medicare payments to affluent retirees.
Elaine Kamarck, a political scientist close to many top Clinton advisers, urged the President-elect to invest "political capital" while he still had some during his first six months in office to deal with the "political nightmare" of raising taxes or cutting spending.
Henry Aaron, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, suggested that such potentially unpopular steps as reducing agriculture subsidies, cutting veterans' pensions and charging fees for using the country's air space, waterways and radio waves might be needed to keep overall spending down.
 
'Tax System Out of Whack'
 But Mr. Clinton, who responded so enthusiastically to panelists who spoke on other issues, basically disregarded the advice on the deficit.
In response to Ms. Kamarck, for instance, he talked about the importance of overhauling the medical care system.
In answer to Mr. Aaron, he spoke about the importance in changing "the character of Federal spending" so that more goes to investment and less to consumption. Mr. Clinton did not say what consumption he had in mind.
When someone during the call-in period suggested that Mr. Clinton drop his proposal for a middle-class tax cut and impose a higher tax on gasoline, the President-elect responded only that "the tax system is way, way out of whack."
In his opening address, Mr. Clinton said that one of his intentions at the conference was to "reconnect the American people to their Government and to ask for their help too in making economic progress."
He never really got around to asking for the help.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: Long-Term Investing - Economic Solutions: a Sampling of Advice, and Clinton's Response;
Ideas on Where the Government Should Spend More

 BODY:
Selections by The New York Times from a transcript recorded by Reuters.
 
Vincent Lane
 
Chairman, Chicago Housing Authority
We have a double standard in this country, one for normal people and another for poor and minority people. And that double standard has led to bad public policy, public policy which assumes that poor people can do nothing to help themselves.
We have got to now not only invoke sanctions with people, but we have to put incentives in place to change behavior. How we do it, how do we restore our urban communities? 
 Economic incentives to encourage people to do -- to put into place public safety, and clean and decent housing, will start the rebuilding of that, our communities.
 
John A. Young
 
President, Hewlett Packard
The computer companies did an interesting comparison. If you take the 12 computer systems companies and you aggregate their R.& D. spending, it accounts for more than 20 percent of all the private sector R.& D. in the United States. If you do a budget crosscut through the government's half of our R.& D., the total spending for computers is 2 percent. There's really a dramatic mismatch.
So what do you do? Well, in the long run, the Government has spent about half of its half on defense, and the other half on these other things. If you went back to that ratio, you could redeploy $7 billion in commercially relevant R.& D. And, in fact, if you decided economic warfare was more important than cold warfare, you might even go 60-40 the other way, which means you could reprogram $15 billion in R.& D. over the rest of this decade -- a big opportunity.
 
Earl G. Graves
 
Publisher, Black Enterprise magazine
 There are three policy recommendations I would have. I would suggest establishing a White House initiative for growing minority- and women-owned businesses. I would emphasize the importance of identifying an experienced business person to run the Small Business Administration, as well.
My second recommendation is for the Federal Government to provide economic incentives for state and local municipalities that receive Federal funding to establish effective M.B.E. [minority business enterprise set-aside] programs. My final recommendation is to establish Federal mandated enterprise zones.
 
Robert B. Reich
 
Secretary of Labor-designate
I heard people beginning to frame a conversation around a supposed choice between deficit reduction and public investment. You know, it's a little bit like that false choice between jobs or the environment.
Only a very tiny proportion of the Federal budget actually goes to anything that any of us around this table would call public investment. The General Accounting Office did a study recently that only 9 percent -- 9 percent -- of the Federal budget went to any of the things we've been talking about, that is, infrastructure, childhood health and education and welfare, training, education -- any of the issues we talked about with regard to building the economy. Only 9 percent.
 
W. Graham Claytor Jr.
 
President, Amtrak
 We have 80-year-old facilities that we are using to maintain all of our equipment. We've got detailed plans for making those modern up-to-date facilities that would provide more productivity. We are ready to start that instantly.
Where would the money come from? This will take about a billion dollars to get our national railroad passenger system in first-class shape. Long-term solutions don't come about unless there's short-term action.
 
Felix G. Rohatyn
 
Partner, Lazard Freres
The reason that I feel that public investment is so important isn't necessarily to stimulate the economy, but because we're about $2 trillion under-invested in the public sector. And most of the public investment is done at the state and local government level, and those state and local governments are tapped out in terms of debt service.

HEADLINE: An Empty Plant, Missing Jobs and Residents' Doubts

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HORSEHEADS, N.Y.

 BODY:
Along Route 17 here on the way to Elmira lies a riddle as big as the Sphinx -- bigger, actually.
The sprawling 1.5 million-square-foot building covers almost as much ground as the Pentagon, which it resembles. Many residents believe the unused property, which belongs to the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, a.k.a. A. & P., is run more secretively than the Department of Defense. 
 Why this building, once the largest food processing plant in the world, has remained vacant for 10 years is a mystery. It baffles elected officials, real estate analysts and even some prospective buyers, who see the building as a place where a new owner or tenant could create jobs.
 
Offers and Dark Suspicions
 It has obsessed Elmira's 34,000 residents. They view the question so passionately that the Chemung County Executive, G. Thomas Tranter Jr., was elected to office in 1990 on a campaign pledge to travel to A. & P.'s headquarters in Montvale, N.J., and confront its chairman, James Wood -- a little like the film maker Michael Moore stalking the chairman of General Motors, Roger Smith, in the documentary "Roger and Me." (In Montvale, Mr. Tranter got only as far as the chief financial officer, Fred Corrado.)
"It has been very frustrating," Mr. Tranter said. "This has been the biggest puzzle in this community for many years."
A. & P. insists it desperately wants to sell the property, but so far the company has rejected all offers. Almost all the town's residents harbor dark suspicions that the company has secret reasons for keeping its fortress-like property empty. They view the matter as a contemporary Grimm's fairy tale, pitting their community against a vast multinational corporate empire.
To outsiders, the struggle is a textbook case of how the interests of absentee corporate landlords can clash with those of a community, even one as soberly conservative and pro-business as Chemung County.
There are many theories about why A. & P. has not sold the building, none of them wholly persuasive, but in the Elmira area they fall into two main schools of thought -- venality or indifference.
"It's a tax write-off for them," Dawn Genung-Dunn, a saleswoman at the J. C. Penney store in the Arnot Mall, said disdainfully. "Maybe it makes sense to a big corporation," she added, "but to people who need jobs it's frustrating."
 
Maybe, Corporate Myopia
 Variations on the money motive abound. Marty Muggleton, assistant director of Southern Tier Economic Growth, a local economic development agency, suggested a cover-up. "If it's on their books for $25 million, and they sell it for 14," he said conspiratorially, "C.E.O.'s could lose their jobs." Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who appealed directly to Mr. Wood to lease space in the building to Xerox, said he also believed the corporation did not want to show a loss.
Mr. Corrado, however, said the plant's book value is around $13 million. In fiscal year 1992, moreover, earnings at A. & P. dropped 50 percent from 1991 -- even though revenues increased slightly. That setback did not prevent Mr. Wood from taking home $3.6 million in salary and bonus, as well as another $7 million from a one-time stock option purchase. Forbes listed him as the ninth highest paid executive of 1992.
Outside accountants insist that such a property offers no tax write-offs. A. & P. pays more than $1 million a year in local taxes and in building maintenance. Depreciation allowances ran out five years ago.
Representative Amory Houghton Jr., a Republican from Corning, who was chairman of his family's company, Corning Inc., before entering Congress, espoused the alternate explanation: corporate myopia. "I used to be in business myself," he said. "You manage by exclusion -- the plant really hasn't been A-No. 1 important to them."
 
Faint Hint of Chocolate
 Erected here in 1964, the stately plant was designed as an industrial Xanadu to prepare and distribute A. & P.'s own brands of food, everything from French dressing to candy. (Inside, some vast storage rooms still smell slightly of chocolate) At its height, the plant employed 1,800. By 1982, A. & P. was in financial trouble and closed the plant. Since then, there have been few serious prospective buyers. But there have been enough to persuade the locals that A. & P. is a key impediment to a sale.
Last winter, Xerox expressed interest in leasing a portion of the space to refurbish office equipment. The prospect of a Fortune 500 tenant pricked the interest of John Summers, a Rochester developer, who offered to buy the building if Xerox moved in.
Beside themselves with excitement, community leaders pulled out all the stops to sweeten the deal. The county offered to lower taxes on the property 33 percent, the Governor's office threw in a $1 million grant for improvements, the Legislature scraped together another $500,000 for training employees.
The deal fell apart, said Robert W. Bivens, executive director of Southern Tier Economic Growth, because A. & P. was slow to respond to Xerox's interest and only lowered its rental price from $3 a square foot to $2.50 after incessant needling -- and far too late. In May, Xerox chose a property in Monroe, Ohio. "I sincerely believe Xerox wanted the building," Mr. Biven said.
 
Plant Called Hard to Sell
 Mr. Corrado insisted that Xerox was never sincerely interested, saying Xerox had feigned interest to win leverage in its negotiations in Ohio. "It's standard business practice -- they used Elmira," Mr. Corrado said, "It was pretty clear they were focused on Ohio."
Mr. Tranter and others bitterly dispute this view. Xerox officials declined to comment, but Ronald R. Pollina, a Chicago-based corporate real-estate broker who represented Xerox on the deal, said the company in Ohio offered a better economic package. "We are dealing in a market that is very soft." He added, "The lack of aggression on the part of A. & P. was most striking."
A. & P. executives seemed unaccustomed to such criticism. Calling elected officials' laments "unproductive," Mr. Corrado said testily: "I would very much like to tell those giving interviews to see how easy it is to sell this big a property."
Mr. Corrado did not shed much light on the mystery. Indeed, he only added to it. Prospective buyers say they have offered as much as $14 million and been rejected, but Mr. Corrado said he would be happy "if someone could come in with a buyer, even at $7 million." He said A. & P. wanted to rid itself of the plant, "but no one has really made a legitimate offer that I can remember."
A Rochester developer, Thomas Maguire, says that he offered $14 million but that A. & P. turned him down. "A. & P. is very difficult to do business with," he said. New York State offered to buy the building for $13.7 million in 1989 and turn it into a prison, but backed off when A. & P. declined to drop its price below $25 million. That display of intransigence, unlike others, did not anger leaders in the Elmira area, however. Much of the community was opposed to a third prison in the area.
The area's fortunes have mirrored the ups and downs of A. & P. In the mid-80's, when the once-mighty grocery store chain was mired in red ink, Elmira was calling itself the "buckle of the rust belt" and was rated the sixth-most distressed city in the country. Its turnaround began six years ago, when the Toshiba Corporation moved into a closed Westinghouse plant near the A. & P. plant and put 1,300 people to work.
The town's comeback was also oiled by local civic leaders' belated recollection that Mark Twain was buried in Elmira. They shamelessly promoted Elmira as a Twainophile tourist attraction (among other things, the chamber of commerce changed its phone number to 1-800-MARK TWAIN.)
A. & P. experienced a major turnaround of its own in the late 80's after a German conglomerate, the Tengelmann Group, bought a controlling interest in the company and put James Wood in charge in 1980. The current recession, however, has eaten away at the corporation's burst of prosperity. It has also intensified ill will between A. & P. and the Elmira area, where unemployment has risen to 6 percent, up 50 percent since 1988.
Many in town bitterly recall lost opportunities, including an inquiry from the Campbell Soup Company in 1989. Local officials believe A. & P. raised its price from $18 million to $25 million when Campbell showed interest.
Mr. Corrado said he could not recall the details, and the executive who had represented Campbell declined to comment. But at the time, Vincent Tese, the State Commissioner of Economic Development, complained that by raising its price, A. & P. had sabotaged "a done deal."
A tax dispute has further soured relations between A. & P. and local officials. The corporation has kept the selling price for the plant at $25 million dollars, but it recently went to court, seeking to have its tax assessment reduced from $16 million to $7.5 million. The county is disputing the reduction.
A. & P. is aware that its reputation in upstate New York has suffered. "It's not pleasant," Mr. Corrado said. "People get a negative impression of us as a corporate citizen." Last month, A. & P. gave a Rochester real estate broker, Douglas C. Berkhardt, an exclusive contract to market the property -- a gesture that local leaders applauded.
But Mr. Bivens of the regional development group said he would believe that A. & P. was sincere until it lowered the cost. "Dropping the price is the only thing that is going to get some motion," Mr. Bivens said. He added that he could not explain why A. & P. did not take his advice. He shrugged. "It's a mystery."

B1); While A. & P. claims it wants to sell its 1.5 million-square-foot building, which has been vacant for 10 years, the residents of Elmira are suspicious.

The Dilemma: Balancing the Needs of the Economy

 BODY:
Selections by The New York Times from a transcript recorded by Reuters.
 
President-elect Bill Clinton
Let me try to frame what I consider to be the dilemmas here.
I think we all understand the price we're going to pay if we continue with this deficit. We now have this huge structural deficit, and I take it we all agree that that's a bad thing; certainly the rate of growth is a bad thing. Not only that; obviously it doesn't necessarily promote any kind of economic activity. 
 On the other hand, we plainly have a huge investment gap here, so we're not generating jobs and income growth. . . . If you sacrifice investment, you still may not get growth. And if you don't get growth, I don't care what our budget plan says, the revenues won't come in to support the new budget package.
So if there's going to be a permanent increase in investment, what does that do to the debt reduction strategy? This is a very tough call. This is the major economic policy decision we're going to have to make.
We're all talking about the stimulus package in the area of -- let's just take the low-side number, $30 billion -- as if the whole future of the republic depended on it. . . . The stimulus is peanuts compared to increasing bank loans.
You heard the $86 billion figure. I've just been sitting here all day thinking this. I went all over the country talking to people who couldn't get any loans from banks any more, and that's still the main source of small business credit. And if you don't do anything about that, you can run the deficit up another $50 to $60 billion -- we'll still have a very restricted impact, I think.
I don't mean we shouldn't do the stimulus. I haven't made the decision about how much and what. But I'm just saying, let's don't get fixated on stuff that is not as big as the stuff that's also out there that has to be dealt with.
On the spending side, it's health care; and on the stimulus side, it has to be something that gets the private sector more active, too.
It wasn't until the last few months that the whole idea of a stimulus even came up when it looked like this long business cycle recession would just never end.
My real concern is with that group of people who have a far smaller percentage of their income to spend raising their children than their counterparts did a generation ago. That's the one place where our tax system is just way, way out of whack compared to the way it has always been.
For the last seven years, for the first time in our history, our retiree population is less poor than the rest of the population; it never happened before. And that's because of some of those entitlements, Social Security, Medicare, S.S.I. -- and I think some adjustments may be in order, particularly for upper income people who are getting a lot more out of it than they ever paid in.
If you take any money you raise in taxes or any money you generate from spending cuts and you divide it 50 percent in deficit reduction and 50 percent to public and private sector investment, that by definition is not a stimulus package. That increases the deficit. It may be the right thing to do.
Any multiyear deficit reduction program is not going to have any credibility unless there is some sort of enforcement mechanism. And I would respectfully suggest that the so called Gramm-Rudman-Hollings enforcement mechanism is not a very good one for us to follow for the future, because No. 1, it always gets evaded. But No. 2, it's based on revenue estimates, to some extent. And thirdly, it's based on a fire wall between defense and domestic spending that may or may not be relevant depending on rapidly unfolding events abroad and at home. You've got to have some stick in that thing that goes from year to year or it doesn't mean much.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We want to thank all of you for being here today and for being here yesterday, and to assure you that we have kept detailed notes. But I want to again say I want every participant in this conference to give us between one and three pages of specific suggestions of things you think we ought to do. . . .
I'm glad we're ending on this. I hope that the taxpayers who watch this and are going to pay for all these things we do for good or ill feel that they're going to get their money's worth. I certainly think they got their money's worth out of the last two days.
And I'm very, very proud just to be a citizen of this country after listening to all of you. And stick with us, work with us, we'll follow up on this, we'll get back together, and we'll do our best to make good decisions. Thank you very much.

The Case for Government Stimulus

 BODY:
Selections by The New York Times from a transcript recorded by Reuters.
 
James Tobin
 
Nobel laureate and emeritus professor of economics, Yale University
Is there a case for [fiscal] stimulus to create the jobs we need by 1996? I think there is.
The labor market is weaker than the unemployment rate suggests, for several reasons. Many workers are involuntarily working short time when they would like to be working full time. As everybody knows, we're experiencing an unusual series of layoffs by businesses, permanent layoffs, not temporary cyclical layoffs.
Why can't the Federal Reserve do this job by itself? Well, we heard about the bank credit crunch yesterday and we see that the Fed has more or less given up on doing anything more to stimulate demand, even though it has 300 basis points left between interest rates, short-term interest rates now and zero. I think maybe the Fed did things so late and so little during the recent downturns that they let the economy and business expectations slip away from their grasp.
That's why I think the country needs some fiscal stimulus in the short run. I would be willing to see something like 1 percent of G.D.P. stimulus, which would be about $60 billion a year, and for a couple of years. Other people may prefer a smaller amount.
Now fiscal policy for recovery is bound to raise the deficit temporarily. And we're fooling ourselves if we think there's a way of having a fiscal stimulus that doesn't have that result.
The thing to do, I believe, is to combine the short-run fiscal stimulus with credible deficit reduction policies that will be phased in at a later time, so far as possible enacted, so that they will come into effect at a later time, whether they're tax increases or expenditure reductions.
In today's weak economy, fiscal austerity would be counterproductive and would actually reduce investment in plant and equipment, in technology and human capital for the future. So it actually would damage the prospects of our children and grandchildren, rather than improving them.
 
Allen Sinai
 
Chief economist, Boston Company
Short run, a modest dose of net fiscal stimulus probably is necessary to lift growth and jobs as part of the task of raising potential growth in the long run, as well as to sustain a fledgling business expansion. A $20 billion to $30 billion program of short-run fiscal stimulus I believe should be ready to go, legislated as needed in early 1993.
The measures used in this fiscal stimulus I think should . . . do double duty in the sense of being measures that lift short-run growth in jobs but also raise long-run potential output. Candidates . . . include infrastructure spending on roads, highways, buildings, airports, rail and telecommunications and equipment investment tax credits.
Investment tax credits would produce the greatest bang for a buck if they were targeted towards productive equipment, incremental and refundable. Other possibilities: measures such as inflation indexing of capital gains, R.& D. tax credits, education and manpower training programs and incentives for small business.
A major effort should be made to find measures that can raise growth without raising the Federal budget deficit. Some possibilities include an easier bank regulatory environment for bank lending to improve growth at little cost to the budget, a shift in the composition of Treasury financing further away from long-term issues to reduce interest costs of Federal Government financing and greater efficiencies and reduced costs for the provision and delivery of health care services.
On timing, you should do it right away and [make it] retroactive . . . to early December. I think the impact would be in the second through the fourth quarter of next year when the current impulse of the economy may indeed be fading and so it would come at the right time. If you wait longer, it's dangerous.

HEADLINE: Salvadorans, Ending a War, Are Cautioned on the Peace

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Salvadorans officially ended their 12-year civil war today, but with many reminders that they are still going to be leaning on others, particularly the United Nations and the United States, to learn to live together in peace.
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of the United Nations and Vice President Dan Quayle said that such support would be forthcoming, but Mr. Boutros-Ghali reminded Salvadorans that "the primary responsibility" for continued peace fell on them. 
 Before an audience that included President Alfredo Cristiani and the leaders of the former guerrilla front, Mr. Quayle announced that the United States was forgiving three-fourths of the nonmilitary loans it made to El Salvador in the course of the war.
Nothing was signed except a statement of support by foreign dignitaries present, but the ceremony represented the formal end of war after a cease-fire that took effect Feb. 1 under peace accords signed on Jan. 16 in Mexico.
 
'An Elusive Goal'
 During the cease-fire period, the Government and the former insurgents, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, worked their way through commitments that included demobilization of 8,000 rebels, reduction of the army, creation of a civilian police force, provision of land and other benefits to former combatants and guerrilla sympathizers, and numerous electoral and judicial reforms.
These measures moved forward in fits and starts and with lots of mutual recrimination in the last 10 months, but most were finished or far enough along to seem irreversible, making it possible for Mr. Boutros-Ghali to declare today that "the armed conflict in El Salvador has come to an end."
But seeming to allude to the history of intolerance that contributed to a war that took 75,000 lives, he said "democracy is an elusive goal" and to reach it Salvadorans "must become accepting of tolerance, must accept that others could have different ideas, different attitudes and different politics."
A major step toward opening up the political spectrum came on Monday when the Marti Front was formally registered with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal as a legal political party.
 
Disarming Certified
 This had been planned for months, but was not possible, under electoral laws, until the front was completely disarmed. At 6:40 P.M. Monday, officials of the United Nations peacekeeping mission certified that the front was officially disarmed.
Military leaders have charged that the former rebels are keeping some weapons in clandestine locations. But guerrilla leaders said today that, while it had not yet been possible to finish the destruction of all their weapons, all were in United Nations containers or in places known to the peacekeepers.
American officials said the loan forgiveness that Mr. Quayle announced amounted to $456 million out of a total of $617 million owed for loans from the Agency for International Development and food aid. They said the action would reduce El Salvador's annual debt payments by $19.3 million.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Aspin Is Called Likely Choice as Pentagon's Chief

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Representatice Les Aspin, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has emerged as the leading candidate for Secretary of Defense in the Clinton Administration, transition and Congressional officials said today.
The Wisconsin Democrat is the likely choice on what had been an extremely short list of candidates to head the Department of Defense, and several people familiar with the process said a formal announcement was expected soon. 
 Like President-elect Bill Clinton, the 54-year-old Mr. Aspin is considered a moderate Democrat, opposed the war in Vietnam and studied at Oxford University. But he supported financing for the MX missile and aid to the Nicaraguan contras and is not considered by Republicans to be a proponent of major cuts in the military budget.
Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, a 42-year-old Democrat who is an influential member of the House Armed Services Committee, has also been considered a possible nominee for Secretary of Defense.
Mr. Clinton is also expected this week to name Representative Mike Espy, a Mississippi Democrat, as Secretary of Agriculture, transition aides and Congressional officials said. Mr. Espy, 39, would be the first black to hold the Agriculture post. He was elected to Congress in 1987 and represents a largely rural district.
In turning again to Congress for top-level appointments to his Administration, Mr. Clinton would be demonstrating anew that the Washington bureaucracy he once derided is a fertile source of expertise for a party that has been out of power for 12 years.
Mr. Aspin's nomination would rob the House of another senior Democrat committee chairman and set up a struggle for control of the House Armed Services Committee, where Representatives Ronald V. Dellums of California and Patricia Schroeder of Colorado are in the immediate line of succession.
 
G.O.P. Signals Approval
 But one senior Congressional Republican called Mr. Aspin "clearly an excellent choice," and signaled that the appointment would be generally well received on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Espy serves on the House Agriculture Committee with Representative Jill L. Long of Indiana, who had also been considered for the Cabinet post. A former Assistant Secretary of State in Mississippi, Mr. Espy represents the poor Delta area of Mississippi, which shares a border with a similar region of neighboring Arkansas.
Mr. Espy was an early supporter of Mr. Clinton and was one of several black politicians who defended him against charges that he was distancing himself from black voters by alienating the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Mr. Espy lobbied his friend, the President-elect, for the post after meeting with him in Washington last week. At a black-tie dinner they attended here last week, the Mississippi Democrat sent Mr. Clinton a note describing why he would make a good Agriculture Secretary.
And in a coordinated effort to defuse criticism of Mr. Espy's environmental record, six environmental organizations sent a letter of support on behalf of Mr. Espy's nomination to Mr. Clinton this week.
Mr. Clinton has already turned to friends and political acquaintances on several occasions to fill senior positions in his new Administrations. Several aides close to the process said they expected him to continue on that track by naming David Wilhelm, a political strategist from Chicago who managed his campaign, as his chief political liaison.
Mr. Wilhelm, 37, would head a revamped White House political operation, either as the Democratic national chairman or as White House political director, transition aides said. Acting in much the same role as he did in the campaign, Mr. Wilhelm would serve as the linchpin between the White House and state party operations.
As Mr. Clinton continued to work with transition planners against a Christmas deadline for completing his major Cabinet announcements, two other likely candidates for high-level jobs also repositioned themselves.
Judge Patricia Wald of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, a leading candidate for Attorney General, has taken herself out of consideration, transition officials said. Judge Wald informed Clinton aides that she did not want to be considered for the post.
The transition team has been focusing on a group of female lawyers to head the Justice Department.
 
Three Other Candidaters
 Besides Judge Wald, the other candidates are Brooksley E. Born, a Washington lawyer active in the American Bar Association and public interest groups; Judge Judith M. Kaye of the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, and Judge Amalya Lyle Kearse of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York.
Judge Wald, who is 64, has told friends that she enjoys her current job. In addition, she faced the loss of a lucrative judicial pension if she left the bench.
Former Mayor Henry G. Cisneros of San Antonio had been mentioned as a possible successor to Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chosen last week to be Treasury Secretary, but he told reporters this week that he would not seek the Senate seat, which will become vacant if Mr. Bentsen is confirmed.
By taking himself out of the race for the Senate seat, Mr. Cisneros appears to be firmly in line for an Administration post, probably as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

HEADLINE: Seoul Looks North, Balancing Hope and Anxiety

SERIES: Uncertain Strides: Change in South Korea -- Last of three articles.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 15

 BODY:
President Roh Tae Woo said here not long ago that he wants to be remembered as the man who fulfilled South Korea's "aspirations for democratization."
But for Asia and the United States, perhaps most important has been his paramount role in isolating North Korea, a three-year diplomatic campaign that has left one of the world's most menacing powers bereft of its cold-war allies and on the defensive about a nuclear-weapons project that ranks among the biggest threats in Asia. 
 Yet in Seoul, only 35 miles from the mines and tank traps of the demilitarized zone that divides Korea, South Koreans are hardly celebrating. As President Roh (pronounced NO) leaves office, the former general who was once feared as a military strongman in a business suit is now often criticized for going soft, signing empty agreements with the North rather than speeding its collapse.
 
The Generation Gap
 A rising generation of educated young South Koreans, with no memory of families fleeing across the border, have begun to question whether their parents' preoccupation with reunification is even worth the price. Mindful of Germany's experience, they fear that unification could nearly bankrupt the South, derailing the nation just as it begins to focus on the cold realities of competing with Japan and China.
How Mr. Roh's successor, who is to be elected on Friday, manages relations with North Korea may well determine when and how peacefully the cold war ends in Asia. For all their new-found prosperity and democratic values, South Koreans are acutely aware that for most of the last century, their peninsula has served as a battleground for far larger powers maneuvering for strategic advantage -- first Japan, then the Soviet Union, China and the United States.
If the Koreas reunify peacefully, the nation could become a regional powerhouse of 70 million people. If relations between North and South collapse totally -- and many American military officials and diplomats fear they easily could -- that could rekindle the first battle the United Nations ever tried to settle with force.
 
Question for Clinton
 "North Korea could explode or implode," said Gen. Robert W. RisCassi, the commander of the 40,000 United States troops who remain here. As the Stalinist Government of Kim Il Sung is driven further into a corner, its economy shrinking and its people running short of food, General RisCassi contends, "it is a debatable matter" whether the country will change peacefully or lash out as it did once before.
That question, endlessly debated these days in Washington and Seoul, is at the heart of the question of how many American troops the Clinton Administration will decide to keep here, and for how long. On the streets, where radical students, nationalists and political opposition leaders once demanded an American pullout, all three candidates for President of South Korea are now urging the United States to stay.
"It's true that America's presence here has sometimes hurt our standing in the international community and hurt the pride of the people of South Korea," said Lee Chul, a former student leader who is now a top official of the opposition party headed by Kim Dae Jung, a leading contender in the presidential race. "But when you look at the growing military power of Japan and other countries, it is important to have balance. If America pulled out, it would be very destabilizing."
The other candidates for President are Chung Ju Yung, the founder of the Hyundai manufacturing comglomerate, and Kim Young Sam, of the Democratic Liberal Party.
 
Finding Allies in East Europe
 When Mr. Roh took office in early 1988, the North and the South were locked in the same standoff they had been in since an armistice was signed in July 1953, and foreign policy was low on the national agenda.
But a year after he took office, Koreans watched on television as the Berlin wall fell, seeing it all through the prism of the DMZ.
"There was a wistful period for a while," Donald P. Gregg, the United States Ambassador, said recently. "Everyone thought it could happen as quickly as it did in Germany. Then they watched, and added up the costs, and that was sobering."
President Roh, by his own account, seized the moment.
Instead of surrounding himself with his old military advisers, he gathered academics and foreign policy specialists advocating a vast change in South Korea's strategy.
Working quietly, he began to court several Eastern European nations and then the former Soviet Union, eventually welcoming Mikhail S. Gorbachev to a country where Russians had been barred. In return he offered Russia $3 billion in aid, a figure North Korea angrily denounced as a huge payoff.
 
Melting the Ice
 But the effects were clear: After nearly two decades of silence, the Prime Ministers from North and South began to meet regularly, though the talks always seemed on the verge of foundering, with both sides often shouting accusations at each other.
Mr. Roh, following a path charted largely by his national security adviser, Kim Chong Hwi, began to dangle the investment carrot in front of the North, whose economy is a tenth the size of South Korea's. Eventually he even allowed South Korean business leaders to travel North to talk about potential factories.
A year ago this week, the two sides finally struck what seemed like a historic accord on "Reconciliation, Nonaggression and Exchanges and Cooperation."
It fell short of a peace treaty, but it seemed bound to break down the isolation, calling for a military hot line, regular exchanges of news, even telephone, mail and rail service between nations and families that had been totally cut off from one another.
 
Just a Piece of Paper
 So far, though, no major provisions have been put into effect. To Mr. Roh's critics, the agreement was an empty gesture that allowed North Korea the appearance of compromise while still building its bomb.
"In the past year, Roh's Government was in far too much haste to put together an agreement," said Cha Young Koo, the director of the security policy division of the Government-financed Korea Institute for Defense Analysis. Mr. Cha attributes the agreements to "personal ambition" on the part of those surrounding President Roh. "They pressured to make something happen in the hope that the North would change," he said.
Government officials defend their approach, saying there is evidence the "pragmatists" are in the ascendency in the North. Last week North Korea dismissed the Prime Minister who led the talks -- some speculate because he was moving too slowly -- and promoted several officials who have talked about copying China's combination of limited economic freedom and strict political control.
 
Pleas for Patience
 "It takes time," said Lim Dong Won, the vice minister of National Unification Board in Seoul and a key figure in the talks. "North Korea is not so weak that it will collapse suddenly. North Korean people have been poor for so many years that they are accustomed to it. They can eat one meal a day and not be tempted to revolt. You can't use a Western yardstick of progress. You have to use a North Korean yardstick."
Most United States officials seem to agree: A recent Defense Intelligency Agency report said, "This measured approach may hold more promise than more publicized attempts to twist the economic levers ever more tightly against Pyongyang."
"They are moving away from isolation," President Roh said in a recent interview. "There are a number of indications they are opening their doors." Asked whether it would last, he paused. "The fact is that Kim Il Sung is the decision maker in North Korea and the only decision maker," he said.
But to many South Koreans, Mr. Roh is fighting the last war.
"My kids, they don't know where North Korea is," said Park Yung Chul, a professor at Korea University and one of the millions who left family in the North when they fled as war approached in 1950. "When pictures of life in North Korea come on the television, they flip the channel. They focus on Japan -- they read Japanese comics and watch Japanese movies."
Mr. Park, a member of a Government advisory board on unification, says he is coming to agree that South Korea should focus its attention elsewhere. "We are wasting our time and energy," he said. "We should be building factories, exporting to the States. We have a lot other things to do."
In fact, polls and interviews suggest that South Koreans are unwilling to pay their share of the $200 billion to $400 billion that many private analysts say unification will cost. Government officials acknowledge that the younger generation shares little of its parents' interest in building a single nation.
"I know there is such a view, especially among young people in Seoul," said Chung Won Shik, who was Prime Minister until a few months ago and headed the South Korean delegation to the talks. "But unification is the goal and the fate of this nation. Our young people don't always see the agony of 10 million separated families."
 
Nervousness at the Pentagon
 For the United States military in Asia, North Korea remains the region's biggest potential diaster.
The Pentagon's classified five-year "Planning Guidance" describes several situations in which North Korea could lash out, even without Chinese and Russian help. The paper warns that United States troops should be "prepared to fight in a nuclear environment" and face a ground force of 1.2 million soldiers. It estimates that it would take 106 days of intense combat to defeat Kim Il Sung's forces.
Nonetheless, all the momentum seems on the side of reducing the United States presence. Every year the South Korean forces take more responsibility for defending their homeland. The Bush Administration reduced the troops here by 7,000 -- more cuts are to come -- and removed tactical nuclear weapons. The latter was largely a gesture to the North because nuclear-armed submarines could come right up to the coast.
Increasingly, South Koreans acknowledge that a smaller conventional United States force would also serve the purpose. "We are well enough trained and armed now that you could probably withdraw all but a few regiments of ground troops," Mr. Cha said.
 
Then, There's the Bomb
 What is likely to turn the debate for the new Administration are the continuing doubts about the North's nuclear program. Under tremendous pressure from Seoul, Washington and Tokyo, Pyongyang allowed in international inspectors. But in recent weeks officials here and in United States intelligence have suggested that new evidence has turned up hidden arms sites.
One senior Bush Adminstration official said last week that North Korea already had enough plutonium to build a crude nuclear weapon. The fear is that a nuclear-armed North would force Japan, Taiwan and the South to follow the same path, something each is capable of.
All this has helped fuel one of the periodic swings toward fear -- fear that the country that has bombed airliners and tried to kill the South Korean Cabinet would make one last lunge for survival.
"The events of the past several years have encouraged optimism," the American commander, General RisCassi, said recently. But, he added, "there is certainly an equal, if not stronger, case for pessimism."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Promises Business A More Hospitable City

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins assured an audience of business people yesterday that he was committed to making New York a more hospitable place for small and big companies.
In a breakfast speech he billed as a major address to outline his long-term economic vision, he said the city should concentrate on strengthening its position as an international center for business, culture and the United Nations, which is considering moving some agencies out of New York. 
 And, he said, New York should be a nurturing place where small businesses, from neighborhood stores to biotechnology companies, can thrive. New York should be "a global city of opportunity" for everybody, he said.
"Ours is a private-sector-oriented vision, and that means the mission of government must be to help the private sector," he said. "We understand that, above all, businesses need stability and predictability to make long-term investments in our city."
 
Pro-Business Tone
 Business executives, whose relationship with Mr. Dinkins has sometimes been rocky, took comfort from his pro-business tone.
That tone was particularly interesting because Mr. Dinkins is on the verge of his re-election campaign. His core support comes from groups like the labor unions and social-service advocates who would be happy to support tax increases in favor of higher wages and more services, a prospect that frightens many business people. Mr. Dinkins was in effect offering assurance to the business community that he would not forget them.
Mr. Dinkins offered strong words but little detail. He also rattled his saber at New Jersey over its use of incentives to woo New York businesses. "We will rise to such challenges," he said, "and ultimately we will prevail." But the city should strive to be "the hub of a vibrant regional economy" that "works hand in hand with its neighbors to promote the growth of the entire region," he said.
Barry F. Sullivan, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, later hinted that the city was considering new incentives to respond to New Jersey's taking of ownership positions in commercial buildings to help landlords recruit tenants.
Vincent Tese, New York State's director of economic development, has threatened to begin wooing New Jersey companies. But he also has asked the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to arrange talks between the two states.
Mr. Dinkins did not hold out his vision as a quick cure for the sick economy. He predicted that "economic growth will be slow to moderate for the rest of this decade."
He indicated that the days of the Government serving as an ever-growing source of jobs were over. "It is not Government," he said, "but the entrepreneurs and businesses of New York that will be the key engines of growth." He added that the Government must create a fairer tax system, improve quality of life and adopt "a more customer-sensitive approach" to economic development.
"Many of the small business owners I talk with still see the city as anti-small business," he said. Businesses of all sizes complain about high taxes, unwarranted sanitation and parking fines, torn up streets, crime and dealing with the city's bureaucracy.
A survey of 191 small and midsized businesses in the city by Crain's New York Business found that 85 percent were dissatisfied with city services.
The Mayor cited his administration's steps to improve the business climate -- like its pledge to freeze the corporate- and property-tax rates for four years and its initiatives to make life easier for small businesses.
Responding to questions, he said the city was "seeking to address" problems like fines levied against merchants for litter left by pedestrians. Agreeing that taxes were unfairly higher for apartment buildings than for single-family houses, he vowed to try to do something about it.
Some executives were disappointed that the Mayor did not outline new initiatives. Several weeks ago, Deputy Mayor Sullivan said a page outlining policies to bring about the vision would accompany the one-page vision. When asked yesterday why it was missing, he said, "I'm doing some further work on that, particularly in the small business area."
But many welcomed the vision. "It's a mission statement which is a very positive statement," said Frank E. Flores, owner of Marsden Reproductions, a Manhattan printing, graphics and video company. "Now we need the implementation."
Richard A. Jalkut, president of the New York Telephone Company, said, "What he has done very nicely is lay out the standard for what New York City has the potential to be."
Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: "From the business community's point of view, the elements of the vision would be very much agreed with. The real test, though, will be and should be whether every economic initiative is taken in the coming months flows from or reinforces the vision."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Aircraft Lessor Places Orders for 82-Jet Fleet

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 15

 BODY:
In the midst of a protracted slump in the airline industry, the International Lease Finance Corporation today ordered a total of 82 new jets from the Boeing Company, Airbus Industrie and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
The orders included 53 jetliners from Boeing Company with a value of $3.6 billion and 28 aircraft from Airbus with a value of $1.5 billion. 
 I.L.F.C. converted an option to an order for one MD-11 aircraft from McDonnell Douglas valued at about $100 million.
I.L.F.C., a leading aircraft lessor that is a unit of the American International Group insurance company of New York, also obtained options for 25 more aircraft -- 17 from Boeing, 7 from Airbus and one from McDonnell Douglas -- worth $1.3 billion if all are exercised. Initial deliveries on the firm orders will begin in 1994.
 
Big Order for Slumping Market
 The announcement comes one day after United Airlines indicated that it would have to reduce significantly the number of aircraft it has on order from Boeing. I.L.F.C.'s chief rival, GPA Group P.L.C. of Ireland, is in serious financial trouble and has been scaling back aircraft orders.
"We have had tremendous demand for leases of new-technology aircraft, particularly in international markets," Steven Udvar-Hazy, I.L.F.C.'s president, said. "There are lots of bright spots in the industry. China is very dynamic right now."
Mr. Udvar-Hazy said that his company's 1993 aircraft deliveries were all leased and that its 1994 deliveries were 80 percent leased.
The order is "refreshing news for an otherwise nervous industry," Dean Thornton, president of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, said. "We appreciate their confidence in Boeing products."
Analysts said I.L.F.C., based in Los Angeles, had prospered in a tough environment because of a conservative ordering policy, only ordering planes for which it has lease commitments or is close to securing. Today's orders position I.L.F.C. for the 1990's with very new aircraft acquired at attractive prices, they said.
"I.L.F.C. is the best-informed buyer in the business in terms of knowing when to buy and at what terms," said Wolgang H. Demisch, an analyst with UBS Securities in New York. "I would view their decision as a positive signal that we are approaching a bottom in the civil air transport market."
The order is the first by a leasing company for Boeing's newest jetliner, the midsize, long-range 777. I.L.F.C will also be one of the first customers for the new 130-seat Airbus jetliner, the A319.
The 53 aircraft ordered from Boeing consist of 15 of its 737's, 19 757's, 3 747-400's, 10 767-300 extended range, and 6 777-200B's. The order includes the exercise of 18 previously held options. The Airbus order comprises four A300-600R's, one A310-300, six A319's, five A320's, nine A321's, one A330 and two A340's.

HEADLINE: Connecticut and New Jersey Seek Disaster Aid for Storm

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
The Governors of Connecticut and New Jersey yesterday formally asked the Bush Administration for Federal disaster relief for last weekend's winter gale, citing preliminary estimates of well over $130 million in storm damage to their two states.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York is expected to make a formal request for Federal aid sometime next week, officials said. Yesterday, as teams of inspectors began visiting some of the state's worst-hit neighborhoods, officials said they had already accounted for over $100 million in damages -- a figure they predicted would more than double before final damage assessments were completed. 
 "The figures are just mushrooming," said Donald L. Maurer, a spokesman for the New York State Emergency Management Office. "When you talk about the economic impact, the loss of Christmas shopping, the damage to property, the number gets huge."
The Governors' letters to President Bush are the first official step toward obtaining Federal grants and low-interest loans for home and business owners in storm-ravaged communities.
 
Approval Called Likely
 The requests must be reviewed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which will make a recommendation to the President. State officials said they did not expect any action by the Bush Administration for at least a week.
New York State officials said they wanted to compile better information on storm damage before they file their formal aid request. Mr. Maurersaid the magnitude of the damage in New York State and the fact that many neighborhoods remained under water had made it difficult to complete damage estimates.
But he said the state was not behind. "We're going ahead," he said. "I can't recall anything that has worked as well as this has."
State and Federal emergency management officials said it was uncommon for a state's request for disaster aid to be rejected. "Most of the time, the recommendation is for relief," said Stan Losak, a federal emergency agency spokesman in New York City.
In a letter sent to the White House yesterday, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut said that the coastal counties of Fairfield, New Haven and Middlesex had sustained $60.1 million in damage from two days of bruising winds, rain and snow.
In addition to $53.8 million in damage to 3,700 homes, he said, state roads, bridges and sewer systems had suffered $4.3 million in damage. The Governor also said that the state's shellfishing industry had sustained more than $2 million in losses because the storm had overloaded sewer systems, causing raw sewage to be dumped into the Long Island Bay. State health officials suspended shellfish harvesting.
In New Jersey, where damage assessments are still under way, Gov. Jim Florio said inspectors had found $76 million in damage to roads, bridges, beaches and other state-owned properties in the three worst-hit counties: Atlantic, Monmouth and Ocean.
Estimates on damage to private property in those three counties had not been finished yesterday. But in his letter to President Bush, Mr. Florio said that 166 homes had been destroyed, 1,353 had been seriously damaged and 24,662 had suffered minor damage.
Jon Shure, a spokesman for Mr. Florio, said New Jersey would be seeking Federal aid for other storm-damaged counties as well.
Despite the clear skies yesterday, scattered neighborhoods in Long Island and along the New Jersey shore remained under water, slowing efforts to estimate storm damage.
The American Red Cross said it planned to open emergency relief centers today in Sea Bright and Highlands in New Jersey, in Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island in New York City and in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
Problems on the PATH Hoboken line persisted yesterday, and Port Authority officials said that service would probably not be restored until later this week because of damage to electrical wiring and safety signals. About 40,000 people use the Hoboken line each morning.
Until service is returned, PATH will provide free shuttle buses from the Hoboken terminal to the Newport-Pavonia PATH station, where commuters can take trains to the World Trade Center or West 33d Street, said D. Joy Faber, a PATH spokeswoman.
In New York City, the Dinkins Administration said it would not fine business owners who filed their quarterly tax returns late because of the storm and that tax inspectors would visit flooded neighborhoods to adjust tax assessments for storm damage.

HEADLINE: Zuckerman Discussing Terms on Coliseum Sale

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Rather than forcing the developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman to come up with the $338.6 million purchase price for the New York Coliseum site, city and state officials are trying to strike a new deal with him.
Through the development concern Boston Properties, Mr. Zuckerman is under contract to buy the 3.4-acre site on Columbus Circle, where he is to build a 2.1 million-square-foot, multi-towered office, apartment and retail complex called Columbus Center. 
 A closing could have been scheduled as early as this month. But officials have not set a date while negotiations are under way.
All that the participants will say is that Boston Properties is still committed to the project and that the talks concern an extension of the deal.
It may be that officials do not wish to force Mr. Zuckerman's hand at a time when he is also trying to buy The Daily News, which could be an economic boon to New York if he decided to build a new color printing plant in the city.
It is unclear whether a new arrangement would simply delay the Columbus Center project until the real-estate market improves -- as happened with the Times Square Center project on 42d Street -- or whether the size and nature of the development would change again.
Columbus Center was announced in 1985. Salomon Brothers, which was to have been the main tenant, withdrew in 1987. After lawsuits and public criticism, the building plans were significantly modified in 1988 and 1989.
The last legal obstacle to the project was removed in June when a Federal appeals court ruled that the development would not violate the Federal Clean Air Act.
 
Letter of Credit
 Since Sept. 21, when the deadline passed for further legal appeals, officials have been in a position to schedule a closing on the Coliseum and its adjoining office tower, 10 Columbus Circle. Should Mr. Zuckerman be unwilling or unable to purchase the property, officials could draw down a letter of credit at Citibank that served as a deposit. The letter of credit is worth $33.8 million, or 10 percent of the purchase price.
Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, who represents the area, said of Mr. Zuckerman: "He doesn't have financing. He lost his tenant. He's obviously not going to build the building. So he owes us $34 million."
Boston Properties is committed to "proceed as soon as it is economically feasible," said Robert Selsam, vice president of the concern. Mr. Zuckerman's partner in Boston Properties is Edward H. Linde.
"The objective of both parties is for the project to proceed, not to create arbitrary deadlines for each other," Mr. Selsam said. "We have, in fact, an approved project, with years of litigation having been cleared away."
The director of real estate for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Susan Fine, said the discussions concerned "whether, and under what terms, we'd extend the transaction, in light of today's real-estate market."
The M.T.A. owns the Coliseum through its subsidiary, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.
The delay in resolving the Columbus Center deal effectively inhibits all but the most temporary re-use of the Coliseum, which has been largely empty since 1986.
 
'Tough Budget Year'
 Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, who advocates reopening the Coliseum, said: "We're about to enter a tough budget year. It would be nice to know whether we're going to have these monies, or some alternative, or some revenue-generating use for this site."
Ms. Eldridge, whose district office is at 10 Columbus Circle, said she understood that the Coliseum talks hinged in part on what happened at The News. But Ms. Fine said "there is no connection, in my mind," between the two issues.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton Chooses Arkansan for Surgeon General

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 15

 BODY:
The top Arkansas health official, Dr. Joycelyn Elders, has been asked by President-elect Bill Clinton to be the new surgeon general, according to transition official.
Dr. Elders, a 59-year-old pediatrician here and the director of the State Health Department, was offered the position over the weekend and accepted it immediately, the official said on Monday. She would become the second black and fifth woman to be named to a top post in the Clinton Administration. 
 Dr. Elders's appointment was first reported by The Associated Press on Monday night.
 
'Conscience of Health Care'
 Dr. Harry Ward, chancellor for medical sciences at the University of Arkansas, said, "She has become the conscience of health care in our state, speaking out in a very candid way on every major health-care issue from teen-age pregnancy to poverty to violence."
If confirmed, Dr. Elders would replace Dr. Antonia Novello as head of the Government's Public Health Service.
Dr. Elders has battled with conservative groups in Arkansas for her advocacy of distributing contraceptives at school health clinics to combat AIDS and pregnancy.
"I really feel we must put our children first and I'm willing to do whatever we have to do to save the children," she has said when confronted on the issue.
Dr. Elders is the first black and first women to head the Arkansas Health Department. She came to the job in 1987 after a 26-year career in pediatrics at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.
She is a 1952 honors graduate of Philander Smith College, a predominantly black college in Little Rock. She earned a master's degree in biochemistry and her medical degree from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, and did pediatric training at the University of Minnesota.
Dr. Elders and her husband, Oliver, a high school basketball coach, have two sons, Eric, 29, and Kevin, 27.
According to an article in The New York Times Magazine in 1989, Dr. Elders wrote or helped to write 138 published monographs, many of them dealing with growth problems and diabetes, the treatment of which first brought her to the attention of the state's medical community. Her level of expertise was such that doctors around the state routinely began to refer their juvenile patients with insulin-dependent diabetes to her.
On Saturday, Mr. Clinton named another black, Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic Party chairman, as his Commerce Secretary. The other women Mr. Clinton has named so far are Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; Alice M. Rivlin, deputy budget director; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Big Blue Bites Another Bullet

BYLINE: By Kurt Eichenwald

 BODY:
HOW low will it go?
That's the question that was being asked yesterday on Wall Street about the stock of the International Business Machines Corporation, which plunged to a 10-year low of $56.125, down $6.75 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange after it announced plans to take a $6 billion charge in the fourth quarter to cover the costs of 25,000 new job cuts.
Once the bluest of the blue-chip 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, I.B.M. has been something of a religion among investors. And that faith has been hard to shake: some investors have been unwilling to accept the ferocity of I.B.M.'s tumble since July, when it was trading above $100. 
 In recent weeks, some money managers privately boasted that they were taking advantage of the computer giant's troubles to scoop up shares based on a certainty that the stock would bottom in the low 60's, close to its book value of $64.80 a share. It didn't.
Now, analysts say, with yesterday's changes the book value will drop to the low 50's, providing what they expect will be a new floor for the stock. That depends, of course, on a successful turnaround soon without more cutbacks. And the stock is likely to sink further if the company cuts its dividend, as its directors indicated yesterday they would.
Despite the repeated surprises for investors, the stock market has been signaling the troubles at I.B.M. for more than five years, dating back to the stock market crash.
For most companies in America, the 1987 crash proved to be an unimportant event, a trauma that ended up being a buying opportunity for investors.
But for the I.B.M., the 1987 crash marked the end of an era in the stock market. It ended a period in which Big Blue outperformed the stock market and ushered in one in which the company has been a drag on the market.
That performance has been so bad that it has wiped out I.B.M.'s gains since the early 1980's. For example, if an investor put $1,000 into I.B.M. stock on July 31, 1982, just before the bull market began, those holdings, not counting dividends, would have been worth only $857 yesterday -- the worst performance of any stock in the Dow. A similar investment in a stellar stock like Coca-Cola would now be worth $13,392, while an investment in a laggard like Sears, Roebuck & Company would be valued at $2,261.
The reasons for I.B.M.'s poor performance are, in retrospect, all too clear. As computers got better, customers were more likely to need smaller and cheaper ones. I.B.M., the dominant player for a generation in big mainframe computers, became a leader in personal computers but did so on terms that left it vulnerable.
I.B.M.'s worst move came in the early 1980's, when it chose to use semiconductors from Intel and software from Microsoft in its own I.B.M. PC. Soon, any computer maker with the phone numbers for those companies could boast of having a comparable, but cheaper I.B.M. clone.
Meanwhile, Microsoft and Intel raked in profits from I.B.M.'s design. Had I.B.M. developed its own operating system, the higher profits might have helped to swell Big Blue and helped keep the company a solid investment in the computer world of the 1990's.
The company's problems were also intensified by its own culture, which barred layoffs and made it hard to deal with a fundamental shift in the market.
As I.B.M. began to deal with its problems in recent years, there were often rallies in the stock as analysts cheered that the company had finally bitten the bullet. But it always turned out that there was one more bullet to bite.
Even yesterday, all of the job cutbacks announced were voluntary. That leads some analysts to believe that I.B.M. is following an optimistic scenario that a revived American economy will lift its sagging fortunes.
"I.B.M. is not going to shoot for anything other than the most optimistic side of the target," said Martin Ressinger, a computer industry analyst with Duff & Phelps. "Realistically, you have to expect further changes down the line."
The apparent reluctance to make more drastic changes at I.B.M. led some analysts to speculate privately that the company might see pressure to follow the path of General Motors and American Express and toss out its chairman, John F. Akers. Such an action might make the stock move up as much as $10 a share if it was part of a larger restructuring, some analysts speculated.
Without some additional changes, the chances are that job cutbacks will not be enough to turn things around. A recent study by the American Management Association found that fewer than half the companies that trimmed down since January 1987 reported increased profits, while 24 percent reported that profits decreased.
Yesterday's selloff may be the final signal that investors are no longer willing to be patient based on faith or to assume that the worst is over. To contrarian investors, that may again be a sign that I.B.M. is near a bottom. But it may also signal only that a stock that was one of the premier investments in the decades after World War II has finally lost its mystique.

HEADLINE: Neediest Cases Finds Counseling for a Jobless Mother and Her Daughter

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
After 15 years of working for the same company, Carol C. was laid off from her job as a clerk for Alexander's, an event that sent her into a dizzying fall from the reality and stability she had known for so long.
For years, she would take the train from her Harlem apartment to Alexander's warehouse in the Bronx, until she lost her job shortly before the company went under. Now, Carol spends her days applying for one position after another, or attending job-training classes. "Only one place called me, and then they said they'd get back to me," she said recently. "But they never did." 
 As unemployment continued to erode her meager savings and her self-confidence, Carol, normally stoic and self-sufficient, also found herself trying to cope with an adolescent daughter who was getting into the kind of trouble that drove her to tears.
But with the help of the Children's Aid Society, Carol has found solace. Every week, she and her daughter see a Children's Aid counselor from the mental health program at her daughter's old elementary school. Carol, who is 38 and trying to bring up her daughter on her own, has been trying to smooth out the rough edges of their life together, a life that has been tested by the twin effects of unemployment and growing up.
 
Counseling and Clothing
 Children's Aid, one of the seven charities assisted by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which pays for counseling for Carol and her daughter, has also helped Carol with employment referrals, and has provided money for food and clothing. For years the Neediest has used donations to help improve the lives of tens of thousands of New Yorkers. All contributions go directly to the charities because The Times pays for the fund's overhead. This year's Neediest drive ends Feb. 28.
Although Carol's daughter, Karlene, an eighth grader, is a good student and is considered very bright for her age, she was coming home from school later than she had told her mother, she was not completing her schoolwork and she was associating with young people her mother did not approve of.
"She's 13 going on 31," Carol said.
But their relationship worsened when Carol suspected that Karlene was taking money from her and her father, who also lives with them in their small apartment in Harlem. It was then that Carol went to see the principal at the elementary school, who referred her to the Children's Aid Society, where counselors help families with problems that can range from drug addiction to child abuse to stress.
Carol and Karlene's battle of wills has to do with the many unresolved issues that the two have never dealt with, said their counselor, Jenny Diaz. Those issues include Carol's trying to raise her daughter without a partner, she said. The unemployment "has overwhelmed her," Ms. Diaz said. "I don't know what's holding her back. She feels she isn't skilled, and she's having trouble completing the job-training courses."
Carol, who was born in Jamaica, has been in New York since she was 21. An independent woman, Carol has tried to instill in her daughter a respect for hard work and the value of an education. But while Karlene manages to come home with good grades most of the time, and is trying to qualify to attend a specialized high school, her behavior is sometimes disappointing.
It was the stealing that stunned her the most. Carol kept a jar of about $50 in bicentennial quarters under her bed, and noticed one day last year that they were missing. Her father told her that his coin collection was missing. When they asked Karlene about it, she denied taking the money, but later wrote her mother a letter saying that she would run away.
Karlene spoke of what her mother's unemployment has meant for her.
"When she was working, when I wanted stuff, sometimes, but not all the time, I would get it," she said. "But now I have to wait a long time. It's not like I want to be in style or nothing. When she worked I only got two pairs of sneakers a year. She's not working now, so I understand why I can't get them."
Karlene, who says she wants to be a pediatrician, conceded that it must be difficult for her mother to raise her alone. She referred to the "money problems" that led her mother to seek help, but she could not explain why she might have taken the money from her mother and grandfather.
"I would say I'm a good daughter," she said, when asked to describe herself. "Yeah, I'm a good kid. I'm not bad."
Ms. Diaz, their counselor, has hope for Carol and Karlene. In their separate sessions with her, they talk of responsibility and guilt, and they learn new ways to show affection for each other. She tries to help Carol see that much of Karlene's behavior is her way of getting her mother's attention. And she tries to show Karlene that she must not manipulate her mother by making her feel that she is responsible for every mistake she herself makes.
"A lot of our families have children addicted to drugs," she said. "This is one of our better-functioning families. The mother was actually employed for the longest time, unlike some of our other families.
"We don't always succeed," Ms. Diaz said, "but the more functioning the family, the more they get out of this."

HEADLINE: Sales of U.S.-Made Vehicles Maintain Their Strong Pace

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 15

 BODY:
In keeping with generally stronger retail activity, momentum in the automotive market carried over from last month as sales of domestically produced light vehicles surged 17.9 percent higher in early December compared with the corresponding period a year ago.
Sales of cars built in the United States and Canada rose 12.3 percent, to 148,079, while sales of light trucks, which include mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickups, rose 26 percent, to 113,890. Total light-vehicle sales during the period of Dec. 1 to Dec. 10 totaled 261,969. 
 The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales was 6.5 million, down from a strong 7.3 million at the end of November but significantly better than the rate of 5.4 million recorded during the corresponding period last year.
For months, car dealers have reported spurts of buying followed by quiet periods. But now, more dealers are noting a consistently improving trend.
"During this time of the year, things normally slow down, but we haven't seen that," said Mike Cody, new-car manager at Formula Ford in Barre, Vt.
Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York, said, "Early December sales keep alive the improving trend established in October and are consistent with better employment and consumer confidence statistics."
While sales of light trucks have been strong for some months, the latest results were noteworthy for the recovery in car sales. The Ford Motor Company posted a 49.9 percent increase over the corresponding 10-day period last year. Sales of the Taurus more than doubled as Ford discounted the model heavily in an effort to pass the Honda Accord, still the nation's best-selling car model.
Ward's Automotive Reports estimated a 30.1 percent increase for the Chrysler Corporation. Chrysler reports its sales only once a month.
But the troubled General Motors Corporation posted an 11.7 percent drop in car sales from last year. Part of G.M.'s slippage reflected a decision to sell less aggressively to daily-rental and other fleets. Particularly disappointing were big drops in sales of the Pontiac Bonneville, Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile 88. Saturn sales remained brisk.
The Honda Motor Company, the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Nissan Motor Company each posted double-digit increases in the sales of cars assembled in the United States.
The Mazda Motor Corporation more than doubled sales of cars built in the United States to 1,545, while the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation posted a drop in car sales of 46.3 percent. to 692.
G.M.'s light-truck sales surged a robust 16 percent in early December, heavily influenced by demand for its Jimmy and Blazer four-door utility vehicles, Suburban full-size utility vehicle and full size pickup trucks. G.M.'s Lumina, Trans Sport and Sihouette mini-vans continue to sell poorly.
All of Ford's light-truck models with the exception of the Bronco fullsize utility vehicle posted strong gains compared with last year.

HEADLINE: Dow Eases 7.84, Depressed a Bit by I.B.M.

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks ended lower yesterday after heavy selling of the International Business Machines Corporation put modest pressure on the market.
The Dow Jones industrial average eased 7.84 points, to 3,284.36. Declining issues led gainers, 973 to 844, on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume totaled 227.8 million shares. 
 I.B.M., a Dow component, sank 6 3/4, to a new 52-week low of 56 1/8, on huge volume of more than 12 million shares. The computer giant said it was unsure it could maintain its annual dividend of $4.84 a share. It also plans a $6 billion fourth-quarter charge and 25,000 more job cuts.
 
Other Technology Issues Hurt
 Some analysts said the impact of I.B.M.'s steep fall on the blue-chip index was surprisingly modest. They sensed that the market was perhaps more influenced by profit taking and other corporate news.
But the setback in I.B.M. hurt other technology stocks. Apple Computer dipped 7/8, to 56 3/8; Microsoft dropped 3/4, to 86 3/8; Intel dropped 5/8, to 77 3/8, and Novell fell 3/4, to 26 3/4.
Traders said the market might also be preparing for another upturn. "The market has been consolidating for a few days, but I say the bias is still up," said Robert Caputo, director of research at an investment banking unit of the Swiss Bank Corporation. "The economic background is improving; interest rates are improving. I think we're in pretty good shape until the end of the year."
Analysts said traditional year-end tax-related selling contributed to the market's decline. People are taking profits because they expect the Clinton Administration to raise income taxes, one fund manager said.
The Nasdaq index of over-the-counter issues fell 3.98, to 650.75, on further profit taking after a recent rally that took it to record highs.
Three of the Nasdaq's top 10 most active stocks were initial public offerings: the Snapple Beverage Corporation leaped to 29 from its issue price of 20; the Purolator Products Corporation closed at 15, unchanged from its initial pricing, and Vision Sciences jumped to 12 from its offer price of 9.
 
Other Selloffs
 Several companies that reported disappointing earnings or issued forecast warnings found their stocks also drawing heavy selling. Gerber slumped 5 1/4, to 29 7/8. The company expects lower per-share earnings for the current fiscal year. Topps, the baseball card and bubble gum maker, lost 2 7/8, to 12 1/8, after reporting disappointing earnings.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks slipped 0.27 point, to 432.57. The American Stock Exchange index fell 1.90 to 390.66. The New York Stock Exchange Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.14, to 238.02; the average share eased 2 cents.
The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of New York Stock Exchange, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 4,232.632, down 4.557, or 0.11 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
American Agencies Are Lining Up for Vietnam's Business

BYLINE: By Adam Bryant

 BODY:
GOOD morning, Vietnam.
That may best sum up the optimism this week at many worldwide advertising agencies after the Bush Administration signaled it might ease the trade embargo with Vietnam and allow American companies to take the first steps to compete there.
Anticipating the move, many agencies, including Backer Spielvogel Bates; Dentsu, Young & Rubicam Partnerships and J. Walter Thompson have commissioned studies on the market, visited Vietnam and begun work to establish ties with agencies there. 
 By many measures, any long-term investment of time and money is probably well placed in the Asia Pacific region, which, with the exception of Japan and its sluggish economy, is the world's fastest-growing media market. Advertising spending there is expected to grow 8.2 percent a year in real terms between 1993 and 1995, according to London-based Zenith Media Worldwide, which shared its forecasts last week at the annual Paine Webber media conference.
Even so, advertising executives familiar with the Vietnamese market caution that the going is slow and tricky for reasons that stretch from Government policies to quirks of the local culture.
"The currency is a problem, the media is a problem, the market is still very difficult," said Gary Burandt, chief executive of Dentsu, Young & Rubicam Partnerships.
Carl Spielvogel, chairman and chief executive of Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide, learned this first hand during a B.S.B. regional managers' meeting in Ho Chi Minh City in November, an event that took three months to arrange with the Vietnamese Government.
The agency's regional clients include Heineken and British American Tobacco, although B.S.B. is currently not doing business in Vietnam.
Mr. Spielvogel said he was struck by, among other things, the prevalence of outdoor advertising. Because the Government allows only products manufactured in Vietnam to be advertised on television, billboards are the most popular way to introduce Vietnamese consumers to the foreign products and brand names they seem to crave. Information, product shots and company logos are most important for making an impression; romance and ambience are unnecessary. "Eye it, try it, buy it," is how Mr. Spielvogel described the dominant marketing strategy there.
With few advertising outlets, large companies often turn to such basic marketing techniques as hawking their wares at trade fairs and exhibitions with product displays that typically attract long lines, said Alex Hamill, B.S.B.'s director in the Asia Pacific region.
The Vietnamese Government also screened and censored advertising that B.S.B. brought into Vietnam for its October meeting. All advertising for broadcast must be approved by the Government.
One reel that did not pass customs contained pro bono commercials by B.S.B. for the Advertising Council that prod Americans to vote by showing the result if they don't: an American flag sheds its stars and stripes. The problem: "It was not their propaganda," he said. "The tape is now in the Marxist maw."
Advertisers and companies see in Vietnam what many believe is a great opportunity that they do not want to concede to other countries. To help make the case that the American Government should thaw relations, they point to a recent $380 million loan from Japan to Hanoi, as well as an offer by Japan and France to repay Vietnam's loans from the International Monetary Fund.
Credible statistics about Vietnam are hard to come by. But the country's attributes include a literacy rate close to 90 percent, and a youthful populace with few memories of the Vietnam War that is eager to embrace Western culture. Mr. Spielvogel said a 24-year-old Vietnamese graduate student serving as his party's guide pointed out the Hanoi Hilton and said to him in fluent English, "In the old days, this was a prison."

HEADLINE: Yields Mixed At Banks This Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered on bank money-market accounts and certificates of deposit for the new week that begins today are mixed, with gains occurring mostly outside the New York area, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.
Robert K. Heady, publisher of the rate magazine, says deposit rates are on hold for the moment as banks wait to see President-elect Bill Clinton's strategy on handling the economy. 
 "Depositors will see little change in the direction of C.D. yields, with the key Government decisions centering on what stimulants will be needed to spark economic growth and ways to deal with the national debt," he said.
At the Treasury's weekly auction of three-and six-month bills on Monday, average discount rates were mixed, signaling an end to a rise in short-term rates that began in early October. The auction is often regarded as a harbinger of bank deposit rate changes. The average rate auction was down slightly for a three-month bill, to 3.26 percent, from 3.29 percent the previous week, while the six-month bill rose to 3.43 percent from 3.37 percent.
 
Little Change in New York Area
 In the New York area, returns were mixed with no changes on an average money market account or six-month certificate of deposit while a slight drop was registered in the shorter three-month certificate.
Savings banks, which traditionally offer the higher yields, were most active in cutting back on certificates of deposit. The average yield on a three-month C.D. is down 2 basis points, from 2.96 to 2.94 percent, and a six-month certificate is down 3 basis points, from 3.13 to 3.10 percent.
Two of the largest changes in yields this week occurred at Home Savings of America, where the average money market account yield was lowered to 2.78 percent from 2.84 percent, and Carteret Federal Savings in New Jersey, which dropped the yield on a three-month certificate by 20 basis points, to 3.20 percent.
Outside the New York market, yields at 20 large banks remained steady as the average yield on a money-market account remained unchanged at 2.68 percent and an average six-month certificate is up a couple of basis points, to 3.03 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Closes Mixed In a Day of Slow Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mixed yesterday in light trading on world currency markets. Gold prices eased worldwide.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $334.50 a troy ounce, off 10 cents from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold had slipped 5 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $334.55. 
 Analysts said currency trading was particularly quiet. "This market's on holiday already," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Much of the day's activity focused on the French franc, which continued to decline overseas. The German and French central banks stepped in, buying francs while selling German marks to prop up the French currency, Mr. Donney said.
The move appears to have been successful: the franc closed higher in United States markets.
The German mark's strength has been putting pressure on some of the weaker European currencies for some time, and now that pressure has come to rest on the franc. The German central bank's strategy of keeping interest rates relatively high has insured the mark's dominance on the foreign exchange scene.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 123.83 Japanese yen, from 123.88 yen on Monday. Later in London, it rose to 124.05 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 123.95 yen, up from 123.68 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5680, from $1.5650 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.5675 to buy one pound, more expensive than Monday's $1.5665.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.5685 German marks, down from 1.5703; 1.4105 Swiss francs, up from 1.4090; 5.3595 French francs, up from 5.3540; 1,403.00 Italian lire, up from 1,394.25, and 1.2788 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2748.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $334.95 a troy ounce, from $335.15 bid late Monday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $334.65 from $334.85. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 28 cents to close at a bid of $335.23.

HEADLINE: Inventories Drop Sharply, While Sales Remain Strong

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Business inventories fell three-tenths of 1 percent in October, the steepest decline in nine months, the Government said today. Sales were unchanged, remaining at the highest level since July.
Analysts said the report portended increased production and job growth as businesses attempted to meet with the increased demand. 
 The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and backlots totaled a seasonally adjusted $832.9 billion in October, down from $835.4 billion a month earlier.
It was the largest decline since backlogs shrank five-tenths of 1 percent last January and the lowest level since inventories totaled $831.9 billion in June.
Before September's drop of two-tenths of 1 percent, inventories had risen every month since January, except for May, when they slipped back one-tenth of a percent.
The department said sales at the manufacturing, wholesale and retail levels in October totaled a seasonally adjusted $558.5 billion, statistically unchanged from $558.7 billion a month earlier. It was the highest level since sales totaled $559.7 billion in July.
The 1.1 percent jump in September was the largest since sales advanced 1.5 percent in June and nearly reversed a 1.3 percent drop in August.
Economists at Mitsubishi Bank in New York said the October decline appeared to be an involuntary decline -- that is, strong sales -- rather than one caused by pessimism among merchants.
If so, it would mean that consumers are buying goods faster than factories are making them and businesses are stocking them. That, in turn, could mean increased production and job growth as companies attempt to meet demand.
The combination of inventories and sales produced a inventories-to-sales ratio of 1.49, meaning it would take 1.49 months to exhaust the backlog at the October sales pace.
The ratio equaled 1.49 in July, which had been the lowest since January 1989, when it was 1.48.
Manufacturing inventories dipped one-tenth of 1 percent in October, while the wholesale backlog dropped six-tenths of a percent for the second straight month. Retail stockpiles plunged 3 percent.
Sales from factories slipped seven-tenths of a percent in October and wholesalers reported a 1 percent decline. But retailers registered a 1.9 percent gain.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Clinton and the Economy: A Round Table of Experts

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
The Bill Clinton two-day television spectacular gave good value. Although the number of viewers of CNN and C-Span who stayed with the whole show (longer than "The Civil War" and "Civilization and the Jews" put together) would not have made a Nielsen blip, even the intermittent watcher could find rewards. There was information, human interest, glimpses of the new Administration's movers and shakers and, presumably as programmed, star power in the form of the President-elect.
For the most part personages from prestige-ridden institutions like Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Apple Computer, the Brookings Institution and the World Bank laid out the nation's problems in a reasonably clear way, even if repetition set in early and their small jokes did not always earn the big laughs they received from Mr. Clinton. The man who resorted to "paradigm," 11 times in his 11 minutes and mouthed muddy formulations like "overall macroeconomic environment" and "economies of scale are obsoleted" was the exception. Taken together, these Clinton supporters got across in an audience-friendly way the general economic perspective of the incoming Administration and the dilemma of trying to cure one ailment without worsening another. 
 The appearance of John White, Ross Perot's sometime economic adviser, was a reminder of the proposed electronic town hall. Mr. Perot, so recently wooed by candidate Clinton, had not been invited to join President-elect Clinton at this first victory party, where supporters were paid off with a few minutes of tube time. Yet phrases like "world-class educational system," the use of colorful slides to display gloomy facts, the call-ins from just folks, the bringing together of experts at a round table that King Arthur would have killed for were perfectly Perotian. Blessedly missing was an instant vote from out there on whether to concentrate first on cutting the deficit or, as everyone says now, picking up from Paul Tsongas, "growing the economy."
The Clinton Administration economics team was sighted but left stage center to the boss. Senator Lloyd Bentsen dropped a few easily forgotten comments that foreshadow the bromides he will soon be offering on Sunday talk shows. Often, when the camera paused at Robert Reich, Labor Secretary designate, he was writing something, perhaps the book he can be counted on to produce about his tenure.
The camera also kept returning to Hillary Clinton. She said nothing, but her presence was felt in the appearances of Marian Wright Edelman, the head of the Children's Defense Fund, and, as the first day waned, other lobbyists in behalf of children, teen-agers and working mothers, whose presentations had more heart, if less analysis, than the economists who started things off.
The word "empowerment" got quite a workout. Sprinkled along the way were criticisms of supply-side economics and trickle-down theory. Present difficulties were laid to past precepts. But the most striking difference from the Republican Administrations was the meeting itself. The notion of Ronald Reagan or George Bush consorting with so many bleeding hearts and pointy heads of varying hues, many of whom Mr. Clinton greeted by first name, defies imagining. And the notion of either former leader actually making grammatical contributions to such an exercise is an instant gag.
Which brings us to the star of the occasion. Mr. President-elect and Mr. Vice President-elect sat side by side like the brightest kids in the class, the ones who are always first to raise their hands. But here Al Gore was outclassed. He tended to lob leading questions on the order of whether we need more training in the workplace. His interventions improved somewhat during yesterday afternoon's discussion of the environment.
For his part, Mr. Clinton turned in a virtuoso performance. In addition to sitting and listening for hours without yawning, he evidenced an acquaintance with details of everything from California's troubles to immunization against measles, Social Security to health-care costs, the pros and cons of a strong dollar to arms exports to cheap oil. He even had enough energy left at the end of the first long day to make an apt quip, "When somebody tells you it's not a money problem, they're talking about somebody else's money."
Although very much a show, the event was not fun and games. Yesterday morning Mr. Clinton laid out the country's sorry economic condition in a direct, plain-talking way. Since none of his guests proved eager to take issue with the new favor giver -- "I couldn't agree with you more," one assured him -- you could not really tell how deeply he had thought through any issue. But a ban on fawning is too much to ask at a production paid for by the Democratic National Committee.
Most notably, without explicitly disavowing any of the promises that had helped bring him to Washington, Mr. Clinton displayed a fresh seriousness along with the eyeglasses that had not been so noticeable during the campaign. In trying to get across to his audience a recognition of reality and an appreciation of complexity, he seemed to be asking Americans for intelligence and patience rather than just votes.
It is hard to say for sure when a politician is in front of a camera whether one is watching the real man or the performer, but at the very least the past two days demonstrate that it is much easier to be your best, even on the tube, after you have been elected President than when you are hustling for the job.

HEADLINE: THE PURPOSEFUL CHEF;
A Simple Dinner for Those Condemned to Holiday Indulgence

BYLINE: By JACQUES PEPIN

 BODY:
AT this time of year, as I begin to get ready for the holidays, I purposely keep my everyday menus simple and economical, serving seasonal products in easy-to-prepare dishes. This method gives me more time to work on menus for the holidays, and eating simple fare early in the month makes me feel less guilty about the richer, more elaborate meals I know I will be consuming later in the month with family and friends.
This menu begins with a salad featuring sweet potatoes, which are plentiful and inexpensive now. Tossed with a vinaigrette dressing and served on salad greens, the potatoes have an unusual and pleasantly distinctive flavor that makes them appealing both as a first course and as an accompaniment to a roast or other main dish. 
 The main course is a flavorful stew containing sweet or hot sausage, whichever you prefer. I use one sausage -- weighing four to five ounces -- per person, browning the sausages first and then adding small, peeled potatoes, onion wedges and, finally, green beans. Although I use string beans in my version of this dish, you can substitute wax beans if they are easier to find or less expensive.
This is not the type of dish where the vegetables end up being crunchy; it is more in the Southern tradition, with the vegetables cooked until they have absorbed the flavor of the meat and are soft, with the exception of the green beans, which retain a little crunch since they are added last and cook only 10 minutes.
To go with the stew, there is a spoon bread made with yellow cornmeal and scallions. This is an easy recipe, best eaten as it emerges puffy and souffle-like from the oven, although it is still moist and flavorful after it cools and deflates a little. The spoon bread also reheats well.
A good wine with this menu would be a red Washington State table wine, like Latah Creek, which is flavorful and inexpensive.
 
Corn and Scallion Spoon Bread
 
Total time: 50 minutes
 
 3 1/2 cups skim or regular milk
 1cup yellow corn meal
 8 to 10 scallions, cleaned and minced (1 1/2 cups)
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
 1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce
 5 eggs
 1 teaspoon unsalted butter.
1. Bring the milk to a boil in a saucepan. Add the corn meal, and mix well with a whisk. Bring the mixture to a boil, and cook (partly covered to prevent splattering), stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes. The mixture should be quite thick.
2. Transfer the corn meal mixture to a bowl, and add the scallions, salt, pepper and Tabasco sauce. Let cool for 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl as you would for an omelet, and then add them to the corn meal mixture. Mix in well with a whisk.
4. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Butter a 6- to 8-cup gratin dish, and pour spoon bread mixture into it. Place on a cookie sheet, and bake for 30 minutes, until firm, puffy and brown. (If you prefer the spoon bread browner still, place it under a hot broiler for 1 or 2 minutes.) Cut into wedges or squares, and serve immediately.
Yield: 6 servings.
 Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 195 calories, 6 grams fat, 180 milligrams cholesterol, 310 milligrams sodium, 12 grams protein, 25 grams carbohydrate.
 
Sweet-Potato Salad
 
Total time: 40 minutes

 2 pounds sweet potatoes or yams
 1 onion (3 ounces), peeled and chopped ( 1/2 cup)
 3 scallions, cleaned and minced ( 1/3 cup)
 3 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped (2 teaspoons)
 1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard
 2 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
 5 tablespoons corn oil
 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
 1 tablespoon soy sauce
 2 cups mixed salad greens, cleaned and thoroughly dried.
1. Wash the sweet potatoes and remove any damaged spots. Place the potatoes in a single layer in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover and bring the water to a boil over high heat. When the water boils, cover the pan, reduce the heat to low, and boil gently until the potatoes are tender (20 to 30 minutes, depending on size).
2. Drain the potatoes and, when cool enough to handle, peel them.
3. Combine remaining ingredients, except salad greens, in a serving bowl and mix well. While potatoes are still lukewarm, cut into 3/4-inch slices and toss with the dressing. Serve at room temperature on the greens.
Yield: 6 servings.
 Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 240 calories, 12 grams fat, 0 milligrams cholesterol, 695 milligrams sodium, 3 grams protein, 30 grams carbohydrate.
 
Sausage, Potato And Green-Bean Stew
 
Total time: 30 minutes

 2 tablespoons corn oil
 6 Italian-style sweet or hot sausages (about 1 1/2 pounds)
 2 pounds small potatoes (about 15)
 2 onions (about 12 ounces), peeled
 2 pounds green beans, ends and strings removed
 1 teaspoon thyme leaves
 1/2 teaspoon salt.
1. Heat the oil in a large, deep saucepan. Add the sausages in one layer and brown, covered, over medium heat for 5 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and set them aside. Cut each onion into 8 pieces. Add potatoes and onions to sausage, cover, and cook for 10 minutes. Then add beans, thyme and salt, and mix until beans are under the potatoes and sausages. Cover, and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup of water to free solidified juices in the bottom of the pan.
3. Serve one sausage per person, with some potatoes, onions, beans, and a few spoonfuls of the pan juices.
Yield: 6 servings.
 Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 575 calories, 35 grams fat, 85 milligrams cholesterol, 1,235 milligrams sodium, 30 grams protein, 40 grams carbohydrate.

A FRIEND writes:
Glued to my television set during much of last weekend's storm, I found myself once again absolutely awed by the spirit, stamina and determination of people in this city. But my candidate for the title of Quintessential New Yorker -- no, make that All-Time Quintessential New Yorker -- is easily the woman from Brooklyn who was asked on the news how it all was affecting her. 
 "Do you have electricity?" she was asked by the TV reporter.
"Yes, we do," she said.
"And do you have gas?"
"No, we have no gas," the woman said sadly. "We have no gas at all."
"So you can't do any cooking," the interviewer sympathized. "What do you do for meals?"
"We sent out for Chinese," the woman said.

Sophie, our 3-year-old, has only the vaguest idea of who Santa Claus might be. But that didn't stop our baby sitter from taking Sophie to Bloomingdale's for an introductory visit to its version of St. Nick.
"And what would you like for Christmas, little girl?" went the usual query.
Not one to spurn any gift offer, Sophie replied, "We don't do Christmas, we do Hanukkah."
"That's O.K.," Santa said. "My wife is Jewish." -- KAREN VERSHBOW

Muscle man 1: So, how do I look?
Muscle man 2: You look great -- just like Adonis.
Muscle man 1: Madonna? Whadya say? I look like Madonna?
Muscle man 2: Not Madonna -- Adonis. He's a Greek god.
Muscle man 1: Oh yeah. That's what I want to look like -- a Greek god.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Dear Diary:
Shopping for toys in Herald Square this far into the holiday season is at best a harrowing experience. So I was slightly less than thrilled to be waited on by one of the most inept cashiers in all of Herald Square history.
She could not understand the concept of wanting to ship one, and only one, of several packages, so I had to tie it up myself. She was unable to locate her scissors, leaving me with a long piece of string trailing off the side of the box. She charged me for an item I had not bought. Finally, when it was discovered that she had neglected to give the promised 20-per-cent discount on one of the toys, she called her superior in desperation.
"What seems to be the problem?" he asked.
The cashier explained the situation, saying that she could see no other solution than ringing everything up again.
Seeing my impatience, he looked her in the eyes and commanded, "Put out your hand."
Dolefully, she obeyed, palm down.
"Bad!" he proclaimed, slapping it lightly. With that, he returned to his post. -- MICHELLE AU

 	 	 		. . .	 	Dear Diary:
The place is a Lexington Avenue subway; time, the other evening. At 14th Street, a young blond woman hops aboard. A seated woman, recognizing her, speaks excitedly.
Seated woman: I know you! Where are you from?
Me, thinking: Sweden? Denmark? Scotland?
Blond woman: "Days of Our Lives." -- CHANA FREIMAN

 	 	 		. . .	 	Notes from nostalgic friends:
It could simply be a coincidence, although it would be nice to believe it's more than that. An expression seldom heard in the last 20 or 30 years has recently been popping into numerous conversations, bringing with it memories of growing up. The expression is "When my ship comes in."
Irene Ashery of Great Neck, L.I., thought of the expression recently when the mailman handed her an abundance of holiday mail.
"I spent my childhood in Brooklyn," she said, "and when I was about 9 years old, I asked my father why there was so much mail for him and none for me. 'If you want your ship to come in, first you have to send it out,' he told me."
Lilly S. Ruttenberg of Clifton, N.J., heard the expression not long ago from friends she hadn't seen in years.
It also sailed back a month or so ago in "Kid Millions," a 1934 musical starring Eddie Cantor, which was shown on the American Movie Classics cable channel. The score, by Harold Adamson and Burton Lane, included a catchy ditty titled -- you guessed it. It was a song to be sung during a depression or recession. It was an assurance that better times were on the way. Maybe that's the reason for its revival.
Now, does anyone ever hear the expression "So's your Aunt Tillie"?

HEADLINE: Look Freshly at a Changed Korea

 BODY:
South Korea's next President won't be a general, unlike virtually all his predecessors since 1961. Friday's election will mark a new advance for Korean democracy, a gain for U.S. interests and a tribute to the outgoing Roh Tae Woo, whose reforms energized political life.
For Americans, the election is an occasion to reconsider familiar policies. There's now a strong case for shifting to a more regional approach to security, and for giving new emphasis to economic issues, especially trade barriers. 
 Americans needn't worry about any of the front-runners: Kim Young Sam, a veteran opposition figure now running as the ruling party candidate; Kim Dae Jung, long Korea's leading campaigner for democracy and human rights, and Chung Ju Yung, founder of Hyundai, the giant conglomerate. All three men favor democracy, markets and peaceful reunification with the North.
There as here, the economy is the main issue. Korea's 5 percent growth rate this year is down sharply from the recent double-digit pace. President Roh deliberately slowed growth to curb inflation and absorb wage increases. But Korea has stalled in its shift from heavily regulated, low-wage production to higher-tech, freer-market methods.
Kim Young Sam, the candidate of continuity, is handicapped by this economic malaise. He has had trouble articulating coherent economic policies. And he pledges to bar rice imports, inviting friction with the U.S. But Kim Young Sam also offers continuity with the Roh Government's Northern diplomacy: a combination of talks with Pyongyang and the embrace of old North Korean allies like Russia and China.
The heart of the North-South issue is now the timetable and format for reunification. The North, aware of its isolation, looks toward a federation to preserve what it can of its regime. The South, fearful of chaotic collapse, seeks to work with neighboring powers for an orderly transition.
Sustaining regional cooperation depends on Washington as well as Seoul. As America cuts back its military presence in the Western Pacific, it needs to foster new collective security arrangements. Otherwise, old conflicts between Japan, Korea, China and Russia could easily revive.
For 40 years, America has been South Korea's military guarantor against Communist aggression. An increasingly democratic, self-confident Korea calls for a different role: America as diplomatic linchpin of a regional security alliance.

HEADLINE: Mr. Gaidar Departs, Democratically

 BODY:
It's tempting to interpret the resignation of Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar of Russia as a startling rebuke to Boris Yeltsin and his program of radical economic reform. Yet even with the more- cautious apparatchik Viktor Chernomyrdin in the job, reform could still go forward, though at a slower pace and on a different trajectory. And though the infighting was brutal, the result was reached democratically.
That reaffirms the wisdom of not imposing a made-in-America brand of economic policy as the test for all United States aid to Russia. America's basic interest lies in consolidating democracy's tenuous hold on this vast and troubled country and preventing a fateful turn to ultra-nationalist demagoguery. 
 Some reform-minded Russians and American onlookers complain that Mr. Yeltsin might have showed a firmer hand, even a fist, in defending Mr. Gaidar. But it's also possible that Mr. Yeltsin concluded that Mr. Gaidar's austerity if left unchecked could lead to widespread disaffection and, worse, a turn toward authoritarianism.
Wherever the truth lies -- and it's hard for Americans to judge from so great a distance -- U.S. interests are plainly better served by a Russian government that doesn't have to invent the rules as it goes along. The compromise reached by President Yeltsin and the Congress over the weekend, if it holds, could open the way to more orderly procedures by providing for a referendum on a new constitution next April.
Given the gravity of the economic crises and the limits to popular patience, many pitfalls lie ahead. And the crude demagoguery and paranoia exhibited by some of Russia's parliamentarians do not inspire much confidence about the result. But as recent political developments in Latin America suggest, democratic procedures can create democratic politicians.
Sustained U.S. engagement and aid could help democracy along -- for instance, by subsidizing a social safety net for Russian pensioners and the unemployed, and providing technical assistance and a Democracy Corps of American volunteers.
Such engagement would show that what America wisely cares most about is not a particular blueprint but Russia's democratization.

HEADLINE: A Valuable Economics Seminar

 BODY:
The two-day economics seminar in Little Rock led by Professor Bill Clinton broke no new ground and settled no important policy debates. Yet it was doubly impressive. Several speakers delivered concise treatises on what ails the economy. And Mr. Clinton displayed a remarkable grasp of big themes and small details.
Teacher, student, preacher: the President-elect played all the parts well. The two-day spectacle taught Americans a lot about the economy -- and about their new leader. 
 Robert Solow of M.I.T. and Alan Blinder of Princeton delivered incisive five-minute discourses on the two problems plaguing the economy. The first is recession: The economy is operating well below capacity and recovering slowly. The second is stagnation, caused by a two-decade drop in productivity growth that has dragged down wages. Family incomes used to double every 30 years; at current rates, they'll double in 200.
The answer to recession, as James Tobin of Yale carefully explained, is a two-year package of Federal spending hikes and tax cuts. Despite the recent uptick in sales, the economy still isn't growing fast enough to bring unemployment down.
The deficit will have to wait. To fight it before the economy recovers would be fiscal suicide.
The answer to long-term stagnation is higher investment, especially in training and education. Investing in people would boost overall living standards and close the yawning gap in earnings between high- and low-paid workers.
America became rich by tapping its natural resources and building large manufacturing plants that imposed rigid work rules. But in the new global economy, speakers said, companies must be flexible and dynamic -- relying on workers who think and react. America needs to train workers, especially those without college degrees.
Mr. Clinton hovered over the proceedings. He listened carefully, posed challenging questions and answered questions from others with encyclopedic detail. Why, he asked, should government train workers if, as research shows, employers report little trouble finding adequately skilled applicants? The answer, he was told, is that once the economy recovers, employers won't have it so easy. He rattled off percentages of the Federal budget for investment and health care as easily as a teen-ager citing batting averages.
As scores of participants chimed in, the conversation turned confusing, contradictory, self-serving and boring. Few asked to be taxed more or volunteered to give up their favorite Federal spending program. Yet the conference provided a valuable national conversation, complete with call-in questions, on Topic A. Mr. Clinton promised voters that he alone would make the important economic decisions. Judging from this week's performance, he's up to the task.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Executives' Early Reaction to Clinton: Not Bad, for a Democrat

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 15

 BODY:
The way many executives here see it, President-elect Bill Clinton was inviting them on a blind date.
The business leaders at Mr. Clinton's economic conference did not fall head over heels, but many came away feeling warmer toward him than they had expected. Still, many of the executives had voted for President Bush, and they remained unsure today whether Mr. Clinton was a man they could live with. 
 "I have never voted for a Democrat in my life, but I must say I've been impressed," said John D. Ong, chairman and chief executive of B.F. Goodrich Company. "He has an obvious command of the issues, but we don't know what his program will be."
The executives, who came from dozens of large companies, including Citicorp, Colgate-Palmolive, Exxon and Sara Lee, were heartened that Mr. Clinton not only listened to their problems, but appeared to understand them. Hour after hour under hot klieg lights, he listened as they described the problems causing corporate America's headaches: anemic economic growth, spiraling health-care costs, cuts in military spending, the reluctance of banks to lend.
 
Hearts and Bottom Lines
 Still, after 19 hours of talking, the business leaders remained anxious to know what Mr. Clinton plans to do on issues close to their hearts and bottom lines, like regulations.
"We have a lot of Republican-oriented manufacturers, and I'd say they were impressed by the way he conducted himself," said Robert Cizik, chairman of Cooper Industries in Houston. "But they remain cautious. Is he really a different type of Democrat or is he more in the mold of the traditional Democrat?"
Mr. Cizik, who is chairman of the 12,000-member National Association of Manufacturers, added that "certain options" that Mr. Clinton might choose would "only exacerbate problems: more regulations, more taxes, more spending, the things we already worry about."
Despite the general tone of caution, some executives seemed pleased to shed their reserve about the President-elect. John D. Correnti, president of the Nucor Corporation, a steelmaker based in Charlotte, N.C., said, "He's like a sponge in absorbing information." John Sculley, chief executive of Apple Computer, said he was amazed that Mr. Clinton could discuss dozens of subjects in detail without any notes.
Although Mr. Clinton talked endlessly about subjects like health-care costs during the Presidential campaign, it was not until this week's economic conference that many executives appeared to give him a fair hearing -- perhaps because they no longer had the luxury of hoping they might never have to deal with him in the White House.
In some ways, the conference became a tacit conspiracy between Mr. Clinton and the business community. Both sides gladly turned the conference into an effort to force-feed the American public and Congress tons of information about what ails the nation's economy.
Mr. Sculley of Apple said, "We all walked away with the feeling that we're making progress getting the leader of the nation and the American people to recognize that we have serious problems."
For business executives, an invitation to the conference was something like induction into Bill Clinton's Corporate Hall of Fame. Many of the large companies invited were part of an elite, evidence by their rapid growth or success at meeting foreign competition. The invitees included American Airlines, Apple, A.T.&T., Coca-Cola, Ford, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Xerox and Wal-Mart.
Noticeably absent were some of the troubled corporate behemoths that are laying off tens of thousands of workers, like General Motors and I.B.M.
Asked why so many superstars were invited, George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, said, "We're always trying to put a spotlight on the success stories." Of course, Mr. Clinton might have taken some heat if companies that have angered their workers by huge layoffs had been invited.
Harold A. Poling, Ford's chairman, and other executives said they were especially pleased that Mr. Clinton appeared to be singing the same tune as they were over the need to rein in health-care costs. Mr. Clinton nodded sympathetically when Mr. Poling told the more than 300 participants at the conference how his company's swollen health-care costs put it at a $500-a-car disadvantage as against Japanese auto makers.
Edwin L. Artzt, chairman of Procter & Gamble, said the conference was in ways a chance to do some high-profile lobbying on vital issues, like the need to improve the skills of the American work force. "After the inauguration and the business of the Administration begins, it will be much more difficult to have an impact," he said.
Mr. Cizik of Cooper Industries said he backed Mr. Clinton's pleas to provide more job training for American workers, but he was opposed to the plan to require employers to spend 1.5 percent of their payroll on training.
"I think we need to do more job training, but we oppose mandated solutions," he said.
 
Tackling the Deficit
 Many corporate leaders were keenly interested in cutting the budget deficit, but like the economists who spoke at the conference, they disagreed about how soon and how vigorously that should be done.
"We must address this deficit problem," said Mike Sturdivant, president of the MMI Hotel Group in Jackson, Miss. "If not, there will be economic chaos down the line."
Mr. Ong of Goodrich, who is the current head of the Business Roundtable, a group of top executives from the nation's largest companies, said he might support a program that created jobs by modestly pushing up the budget deficit. But he said that such a package should be dedicated to investments like highways, railroads or airports that make the nation more efficient.
But he said he feared that a stimulus program might be too focused on consumption, might be too large and might come when growth was picking up. This could push up long-term interest rates, and that could hurt home building and business investment, he said.
"A short-term stimulus program," Mr. Ong said, "could have some real negative things in it that would worsen the Federal budget deficit and overheat consumption just when the economy is recovering."

HEADLINE: Top Israel Court Halts Expulsion Of Palestinians

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Thursday, Dec. 17

 BODY:
In reprisal for a recent burst of killings, Israel ordered the immediate expulsion today of hundreds of Palestinians linked to militant Islamic groups, but the attempt was temporarily blocked while the Israeli Supreme Court heard an appeal.
About 400 Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip who had been rounded up by the Army in the last few days were reported to be on buses near the Lebanese border, ready to taken into a buffer zone that Israel has carved out of southern Lebanon, where they were to be left. 
 Government officials declined to say how many Palestinians were involved. But civil rights lawyers seeking a court order against the action put the number at 400 or more, and said it had no precedent, certainly not since the period immediately following Israel's occupation of the territories in the 1967 Middle East War.
 
Much Criticized in the Past
 In the past, Israel's deportations of far smaller numbers of Palestinians have been widely assailed overseas, including a resolution expressing strong condemnation that was passed by the United Nations Security Council early this year with United States support. That condemnation followed an order to expel 12 Palestinians, which Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin revoked soon after taking office last summer to improve the climate of the Mideast peace talks.
The United States has consistently condemned such deportations, saying they violate the Fourth Geneva Convention on 1949, which bans expulsions from occupied territory.
The Government's latest decision is likely to cast long shadows over the peace talks, the latest round of which ended this week in Washington with no real progress and expressions of disappointment by most of the parties.
Even before the new expulsions were announced, senior officials acknowledged that they were planning a crackdown on fundamentalist extremists that could bring foreign protests.
"From a legal point of view, some steps may be interpreted by some foreign observers as inappropriate," a senior defense official said, "but looking at the content of the steps, it will be seen as reasonable and serving a justifiable cause."
With emotions running high here after a spate of killings by Islamic militants, the Government decided it had to act aggressively to avoid appearing weak in the face of one of the strongest recent challenges to Israeli authority in the occupied territories, and the expulsions were approved by the Cabinet on Wednesday with near unanimity.
 
Target of the Deportation
 The deportation order is aimed most directly at Hamas, an acronym in Arabic for the Islamic Resistance Movement, which has taken responsibility for killing four soldiers and an Israeli border policeman in the last 10 days. A Government statement, which described the expulsions as a "temporary and immediate removal" for no more than two years, said strong measures against Hamas were essential.
"In light of the murderous acts of terrorism whose purpose is to attack residents of the state of Israel and sabotage the peace-making, steps must be taken against the murderous and terrorist Islamic fundamentalist organizations, the enemies of peace," the statement said.
Senior officials said their intention was to try to isolate Hamas from more mainstream Palestinian factions like the Fatah branch of the Palestine Liberation Organization; unlike Hamas, Fatah supports the peace talks. Tourism Minister Uzi Baram said Israel had to begin negotiating with the P.L.O., "the only force in the Arab world with which one can talk."
Thus far, however, Mr. Rabin has ruled out any formal Israeli approach to the Tunis-based organization, even though Palestinian delegates to the talks openly discuss strategy with Yassir Arafat and other P.L.O. leaders.
Mr. Rabin, who won election with a promise to push the peace negotiations forward but also to strike hard against Palestinian violence, implied that he, too, expected some foreigners to his anti-Hamas measures unpalatable.
"The world should not be surprised that Israel takes very serious steps to protect its security and insure the continuation of the peace talks," he told a conference Tuesday night.
Israel has rounded up many hundreds of suspected Hamas members and associates since Sunday, when attackers identifying themselves as members of a Hamas wing kidnapped a border policeman, Sgt. Maj. Nissim Toledano, and threatened to kill him unless Israel released the imprisoned founder of their movement.
On Tuesday, his stabbed and bound body was found along a West Bank highway. Autopsy results made public Wednesday said he was killed a few hours after the deadline set by the kidnappers for release of the Hamas leader.
 
1,600 Palestinians Arrested
 According to Israel television, about 400 Palestinians were arrested in Gaza and the West Bank on Wednesday, bringing the total being held to 1,600. In addition the Israelis, without offering a public explanation, are holding a Palestinian journalist, Taher Shriteh, who works for several foreign news organizations, including The New York Times and Reuters.
Since its formation five years ago this week, Hamas has become a potent political force, especially in Gaza, where unemployment and despair both run deep. Israeli officials fear that the recent attacks on soldiers, widely seen here as having shown skill and daring, will enhance its standing in the territories and weaken the hand of Palestinian leaders active in the peace talks.
The aim now, officials here say, is to clamp down on Hamas while depicting it as unalterably opposed to peace and therefore a threat not only to Israel but to mainstream Palestinians as well.
But there is a risk in this strategy, some Israeli commentators say, arguing that expulsions or other strong measures could invite more street violence. Such measures, they say, may also persuade Palestinian delegates to the talks that for their own political welfare, they have to withdraw.
 
Phased Pullout Discussed
 As it is, the negotiators have felt themselves on the defensive because many Palestinians believe that the talks are going nowhere after 14 months. Hamas, on the other hand, strikes many in the territories as having shown that it is tough enough to get some Government leaders talking publicly about the need for a phased withdrawal from Gaza. Mr. Rabin rejects this idea because, he says, it would look as though Israel was running scared.
More immediately, the Prime Minister must deal with an outraged Israeli public ready for sterner anti-Arab measures and with a right-wing opposition accusing him, as former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir did Wednesday, of "steadily appeasing terrorism" with concessions at the peace talks.
Recognizing the public anger, Israeli liberals, too, are calling for a tough anti-Hamas policy. "Warlike measures are necessary against terror at the same time as we continue the peace process," Trade Minister Micha Harish, a Labor Party leader, said.

HEADLINE: U.S. NAMES FIGURES IT WANTS CHARGED WITH WAR CRIMES

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The United States named President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and other Serbian and Croatian political and military figures today as possible war criminals who should be tried someday by a "second Nuremberg" tribunal.
"We know that crimes against humanity have occurred, and we know when and where they occurred," Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger told delegates at a conference on the fighting in the Balkans. "We know, moreover, which forces committed those crimes, and under whose command they operated. And we know, finally, who the political leaders are and to whom those military commanders were -- and still are -- responsible." 
 Although once known for his close ties to Serbian leaders, in recent months Mr. Eagleburger has become the Bush Administration's leading spokesman for war-crimes trials, calling for such a tribunal since August. Mr. Eagleburger is a former American Ambassador to Belgrade. This was the first time that the United States has made public a list of those who it argued should be tried for the crimes.
 
Danger to Peacekeepers
 The call for a war-crimes tribunal to resemble the trial of major Nazi figures in Nuremberg after World War II was endorsed by Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, the heads of a joint United Nations-European Community mediation effort. But the two mediators, who appealed for more time to negotiate a settlement to the war that has killed more than 17,000 and forced one million people from their homes, were clearly unenthusiastic about the American and French-backed campaign for a United Nations resolution enforcing a ban on Serbian flights over independent Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The mediators shared the British view that enforcement could endanger the lives of United Nations peacekeeping troops deployed on the ground and jeopardize the humanitarian effort. And they added their voices to the chorus of those who oppose lifting the United Nations arms embargo on all parties in the Balkan fighting.
 
More Forceful Responses
 The Bosnian Government has sought an exemption from the embargo on the ground that it favors the Bosnian Serbs, who have continued to be well supplied by the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army. Mr. Eagleburger had said he favored exempting the Bosnian Government.
"It must never be forgotten that peace will only come to the former Yugoslavia through negotiations," Lord Owen said in a speech to foreign ministers and other representatives at the 29-nation conference. In his speech, Mr. Vance noted that the absence of evidence that the Serbs have used their warplanes and helicopters in combat missions "should be taken into account" in any enforcement resolution.
The Bush Administration, mindful of its legacy after it leaves office next month, has in recent weeks sought to give the impression that it is pushing for more forceful responses to actions by Bosnian Serbian nationalists trying to carve up Bosnia and Herzegovinia. The United States expects the Security Council to approve enforcement of the flight ban, Mr. Eagleburger said, but he acknowledged that he found virtually no support for lifting the United Nations arms embargo.
As for the American move on war-crime trials, it was unclear whether it was an exercise in oratory or whether the United States genuinely would seek to bring any of the alleged culprits to trial. Most of those named by Mr. Eagleburger were Serbian or Bosnian Serbian leaders.
"In waiting for the people of Serbia, if not their leaders, to come to their senses," he said, "we must make them understnad that their country will remain alone, friendless and condemned to economic ruin and exclusion from the family of civilized nations for as long as they pursue the suicidal dream of a Greater Serbia. They need, especially, to understand that a second Nuremberg awaits the practitioners of ethnic cleansing, and that the judgment and opprobrium of history awaits the people in whose name their crimes were committed."
Mr. Eagleburger named some Croats as probably guilty of crimes, and also noted that in September, Bosnian Muslims in Kamenica had killed some 60 Serbian civilians and soldiers. Among those he named were Borislav Herak, a Bosnian Serb who has confessed to killing more than 230 civilians; two members of a Croatian paramilitary force known as "Adil" and "Arif" accused of attacking a bus convoy of 100 Serbian women and children in August, killing half of them, and Zeljko Raznjatovic, leader of the Tigers, a Serbian paramilitary force accused of the mass murder of up to 3,000 civilians near the Bosnian town of Brcko.
 
Milosevic Is on the List
 He also accused Vojislav Seselj, leader of the Chetniks, a Serbian paramilitary group accused of atrocities in Brcko and other Bosnian towns; Drago Prcac, commander of the Serb-run Omarska detention camp, where mass murders and torture allegedly occurred, and Adem Delic, commander of the Croat-run Celebici camp, where at least 15 Serbs were said to have been beaten to death in August.
"I want to make it clear that, in naming names, I am presenting the views of my Government alone," Mr. Eagleburger said. "The information I have cited has been provided to the U.N. War Crimes Commission, whose decision it will be to prosecute or not. Second, I am not prejudging any trial proceedings that may occur. They must be impartial and conducted in accordance with due process."
Mr. Eagleburger listed Mr. Milosevic among those leaders who have special responsibility.
"There is another category of fact which is beyond dispute," he said, "namely the fact of political and command responsibility for the crimes against humanity which I have described. Leaders such as Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, Radovan Karadzic, the president of the self-declared Serbian Bosnian republic, and Gen. Ratko Mladic, commander of Bosnian Serb military forces, must eventually explain whether and how they sought to insure, as they must under international law, that their forces complied with international law."
 
4 War-Crimes Reports
 He said that the United States had concluded that Serbian authorities had flouted previous international agreements. That, he said, had not only produced "an intolerable and deteriorating situation inside the former Yugoslavia, it is also beginning to threaten the framework of stability in the new Europe."
Mr. Karadzic, who was one of those named by Mr. Eagleburger, was seen by reporters wandering through the corridors outside the main conference hall.
Mr. Eagleburger later told reporters that although there was no plan to bring the accused to trial at the moment, "Over the long run they may be able to run but they can't hide, that we're going to pursue them." But when pressed, he made clear that he was not calling for the forcible seizure of the 10 men he named for either committing or supervising war crimes.
President Bush raised expectations that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq would be tried as a war criminal after the Iraqi leader's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, but the matter was quietly dropped after the American-led coalition won the Persian Gulf war without capturing Mr. Hussein. The Pentagon has never released a long report prepared by its lawyers that documents Mr. Hussein's war crimes for a possible trial in the future.
The United States has already submitted four war-crimes reports to the United Nations that detail specific episodes of Serbian brutality, and Mr. Eagleburger described nine incidents of Serbian "crimes against humanity," including murders of men, women and children, mass executions, torture and the forced expulsion of civilians from their villages.
Other governments and human-rights organizations have documented other atrocities, including systematic brutality against women and children, including gang rape, the incarceration of women and girls impregnated by rape, the forcing of women into brothels and murder of rape victims and of children in front of their parents. Some soldiers who have refused to carry out orders to rape or murder their victims have themselves been shot or beaten to death.
There is universal agreement in the talks on Yugoslavia this week, which began in Stockholm and Geneva and will continue at the NATO foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, that the Serbs have broken promises made at a similar international forum in London in August to lift the siege of Sarajevo and other Bosnian cities, dismantle detention camps and turn over heavy weapons to United Nations forces.
While delegates struggled to give the impression that they were doing something to respond to Serbian atrocities and aggression, at the same time there was also a universal disinclination to make decisions that could draw their own military forces into what is viewed as an intractable religious and ethnic war with no clear outcome.
Mr. Vance even sought to portray United Nations efforts to staunch the fighting as somewhat successful, saying in his speech, "The overall level of violence has been reduced, although not ended."
Asked about the remarks of a man who held his job during the Carter Administration, Mr. Eagleburger praised the United Nations effort but disagreed with Mr. Vance's basic premise, saying "The Bosnia Serbs have taken more territory, ethnic cleansing has proceeded, there are a lot of refugees who have been cleaned out of areas. There is by no means any end in view as I see it to the conflict itself."

HEADLINE: Big Companies Cloud Recovery By Cutting Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The economy may be expanding modestly, even adding some jobs at last, but big companies are continuing to cut -- a trend that promises to keep the pace of recovery slow.
A recent survey of more than 800 companies by the American Management Association found that one in four companies is planning work force reductions by the middle of 1993. That is the highest level since the research group began its survey six years ago. 
 On Tuesday, the International Busi ness Machines Corporation, for instance, announced plans to cut another 25,000 jobs next year. And the General Motors Corporation recently identified nine plants it will close over three years to eliminate 18,000 jobs.
 
 
No Increase in Efficiency
 While small and medium-sized companies are starting to hire, it is doubtful that they alone can bring job growth to the levels of previous recoveries. The 45,000 private-sector jobs added to the economy in November, excluding government workers and people employed in the fall political campaigns, were about one-sixth the monthly rate during the 1983-84 expansion.
Just as troubling to some analysts, large corporations are in many cases cutting jobs without using the remaining workers more efficiently -- one reason deep cuts have not always helped improve the companies' performance.
Analysts agree that embattled corporate giants must become leaner and less burdened by bureaucracy, and that trimming payrolls is an inevitable part of the formula. Yet slashing the work force, they warn, is too often a simple-minded answer to problems, a kind of desperate effort to show disgruntled shareholders and directors that management is taking action.
"The cuts began as a competitive drive, but they seem to have become a way of life for many companies," said Eric Greenberg, research director for the management association. The real issues that went unnoticed in the executive suites of companies like G.M., I.B.M. and Sears, Roebuck were shifts in customer demand, new technologies and new distribution methods that changed their markets -- changes to which the corporate giants were slow to respond.
"The traditional meat-cleaver approach of just cutting people is a strategy for decline," said Michael Hammer, a consultant based in Cambridge, Mass. "To succeed, companies have to change the way they work instead of just throwing people over the edge, and most companies are not making basic changes."
 Corporate America's penchant for layoffs raises doubts about whether there will be enough new jobs to strengthen economic growth. Consumer spending is rising, but mainly because people are dipping into their savings. "Consumers are spending money, but not earning it," said Ed McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "This expansion does not have the firm foundation of real job growth yet."
Few experts anticipate a robust job market anytime soon, even though the hiring outlook for the first quarter of next year is brighter, according to a survey of 15,000 companies by Manpower Inc. But with so many big companies not hiring or continuing to cut back, job growth will be meager.
"Business in general isn't about to rehire in large numbers yet," said Mitchell S. Fromstein, president of Manpower, the nation's largest supplier of temporary workers.
 The shrinkage of big companies has a variety of euphemistic labels -- "restructuring," "downsizing," "rationalizing" and "re-engineering" -- but whatever it is called, the trend causes concern even among some of its practitioners.
Lee A. Iacocca, who will soon retire as chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, put the auto maker through two rounds of wholesale cost-cutting and layoffs in the last decade. But in a valedictory interview on ABC's "Nightline" program last month, Mr. Iacocca said: "I worry, because as we all restructure, if we lay off enough people, there'll be nobody to buy the cars or the houses. So we've got to watch that this isn't a downhill spiral."
A management consultant who is credited with having coined the term "re-engineering," Mr. Hammer is nonetheless extremely critical of the way many companies try to streamline their operations. "Most companies are just shrinking, not changing how they do work," he said.
 
 
A Need to Reduce the Work
 Yet some companies are making genuine strides to improve efficiency. As one example, Mr. Hammer cites the Ford Motor Company's accounts payable department. In the mid-1980's, the North American operation for paying suppliers had 400 people, many of them unproductively chasing paper trails of invoices, order forms and the like. The task was simplified so that Ford arranged to pay suppliers when goods were received, eliminating much paperwork and three-fourths of the people in the department.
"If you remove people, it should be because you have found ways to do more work with fewer people, not because your business is dying and there is less work to do," Mr. Hammer explained.
But management experts are concerned that of the companies that cut back in an effort to become more nimble, competitive and profitable, few actually succeed in achieving their aims. The American Management Association survey found that fewer than half of the companies that made substantial work force reductions in the last six years were able to improve their operating profits.
A 1991 survey by the Wyatt Company, examining the results of cutbacks at more than 1,000 companies in the previous five years, found that two-thirds of the companies simply slashed their payrolls without trying to eliminate the amount of work. And more than 80 percent of the companies were later forced to replace 10 percent or more of the people they let go, because necessary work was going undone.
"The way that most companies handle downsizing has little effectiveness and little lasting value," said John Parkington, director of research at Wyatt, a consulting firm.
 
 
Domino Effect
 But the cutbacks have a domino effect, forcing changes on the suppliers to corporate America. Steelcase Inc., the nation's largest supplier of office furniture, notified 1,000 workers on Friday that they would probably be laid off in February because orders remained soft. The slashing of layers of white-collar workers at many big companies is a reason.
"We don't see this ending soon," said William Heyne, a vice president of sales, adding that Steelcase was increasingly focusing on smaller corporate accounts.
"The small and medium-sized companies are where all the growth has come from recently, and that will be even more so in the future," Mr. Heyne said.
A strongly rebounding economy and changed attitudes are two forces that could slow the erosion of the work force at big companies. The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company illustrates an approach that management experts say may become more common. As business declined in some of its 49 divisions over the last decade, 3M retrained and reassigned 3,500 people to other, faster-growing operations.
"It isn't altruism," explained Richard Lidstad, vice president of human resources. "These people are important assets in whom we've made substantial investment. They're well-trained employees of 3M, and we're not going to to just dump them."

HEADLINE: Council Set To Approve Trump Plan For Housing

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
The New York City Council is expected to approve Donald J. Trump's ambitious plan to build a huge apartment complex along the Hudson River today, but the vote does not mean construction will begin any time soon or that the financially troubled Mr. Trump will be able to build it, real-estate experts said.
Although a handful of Manhattan lawmakers have said that they will oppose the project because they believe it is too big, Council leaders expect the vast majority of 51 members, most from other boroughs, to vote for it. The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, supports the project. 
 Council leaders say they are supporting the $3 billion project, called Riverside South, largely because the real-estate and construction industries are moribund and no one wants to thwart a large development that could lead to thousands of new jobs.
"I think folks have a sense out there that New York City is stagnating and this is a sign there is confidence in what is otherwise a difficult economic environment," said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Queens.
 
'Will There Be a Market?'
 Paradoxically, the sagging economy that has encouraged support for Mr. Trump's scheme may make it difficult for the developer to build it, real estate experts said. The experts said that banks have been leery of making real-estate loans because the market for commercial and residential space has been dismal.
"I think a lender would have to get over the hurdle of 'Will there be a market?' " said Wilbur Ross, a bankruptcy and real estate specialist with Rothschild Inc. "I question whether near-term there is a market."
The 57-acre piece of land is heavily leveraged. Besides, Mr. Trump has promised the city to spend more than $359 million for roads, sewers and other infrastructure costs.
"Unless he's got a commitment for massive public subsidies I don't see how it is viable," said a prominent New York City real-estate executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.
For his part, Mr. Trump is sanguine that the real-estate market will improve and that he will be able to attract financing for the project from Wall Street. "When the market changes, this will be one of the great projects in the city's history," he boasted yesterday.
Stretching along the Hudson River from 59th Street to 72d Street on the site of the old Penn Rail Yards, the project would have 16 residential buildings, between 18 and 49 stories tall, with a total of 5,700 apartments, or 6.1 million square feet. There is also a 21.5 acre park.
The project would add about 10,000 people to the Upper West Side and generate about 2,700 construction jobs each year for a decade. Two office towers and a television studio that were in the original plan will not be considered today.
But some of Mr. Trump's critics in the Council have charged that he has no intention to build. They assert that Mr. Trump has lobbied for and won the zoning changes only to increase the value of the property, which he could in turn sell to help pay off his other debts, especially to bond-holders who financed the developer's three casinos in Atlantic City.
"We think the plan was approved too quickly in an effort to bail him out," said Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, who represents the neighborhood. "I think he has to get approval for zoning for this land to trigger his refinancing of other properties to save his properties in New Jersey."
Since buying the property in 1985, Mr. Trump has borrowed against it and now owes more than $213 million to Chase Manhattan Bank, according to public records. Without the zoning changes he is seeking, the property would be practically worthless to developers, real-estate experts said. It was valued at about $85 million by city appraisers earlier this year.
 
Trump's Role Expendable
 Mr. Trump's supporters in the Council argue that even if the developer cannot find financing for the project, his vision of 16 apartment towers and a shore-side park makes sense for the Upper West Side. Anyone who buys part of the site from Mr. Trump would be bound by the plan.

HEADLINE: Ideology Seems to Doom Cabinet Contender

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
A senior official of the Clinton transition associated with the far left wing of American politics appears to have fallen as the first victim of a battle to shape the ideological character of the incoming Administration.
A week ago the official, Dr. Johnnetta B. Cole, president of Spelman College, was regarded by some in the Clinton organization as a strong possibility for appointment as Secretary of Education. Now, after a run of bad publicity, her chances of being named to any job requiring Senate confirmation appear near nil. The furor began last Friday with the publication in The Forward, a weekly Jewish newspaper, of an article detailing her association with Marxist-oriented groups, 
 The dispute over Dr. Cole arises from a fundamental conflict within and around the transition between centrist Democrats and a group that is pushing for a more aggressively liberal Administration. That faction is centered on and draws power from Hillary Clinton, the President-elect's wife.
Dr. Cole has been the subject of several critical newspaper articles and columns, including one by A. M. Rosenthal on Tuesday on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times. She found herself under intensive questioning by reporters this week while attending President-elect Bill Clinton's economic conference in Little Rock, Ark. She responded with outrage against what she called "vile" accusations dredged up by "right-wing extremists."
 
Sources of Criticism
 She did not elaborate. The public and private criticism of Dr. Cole has come largely on two fronts: Jewish organizations critical of her reported affiliation with a pro-Palestinian group and Democrats fearful of any sign of leftward leaning within a political organization that has gone to great pains to break with the party's liberal legacy.
Dr. Cole, a longtime friend of Mrs. Clinton, was appointed in November to run a group charged with reporting to the President-elect on the issues and organizational concerns facing Federal agencies involved with education, labor, and the arts and humanities.
That group's more powerful counterpart, which is developing Mr. Clinton's policies in those areas, is headed by Alan From, a prominent figure in the party's centrist faction. Mr. From has avoided any public criticism of Dr. Cole and did not return telephone calls for this article.
The Clinton transition's public position is that Dr. Cole's political history is, as the press secretary Dee Dee Myers put it, "something we're just not concerned about."
"I don't know anything about that stuff," Vernon E. Jordan, Mr. Clinton's transition chairman who is a friend of Dr. Cole, said in a telephone interview. "Assuming that it's true, I also don't care. What I've heard about seems pretty silly to me."
But the report in The Forward led to private and public pressure on the Clinton transition team to deal her out.
Privately, transition officials are assuring questioners that Dr. Cole will have no say in setting Administration policy and will not be nominated to any top Administration position.
An anthropologist who has edited several books, Dr. Cole is in many ways a figure of the corporate establishment, a board member of Coca-Cola Enterprises and the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and a founding director of President Bush's Points of Light Foundation.
Dr. Cole, who once left herself open to the possibility of an Administration job, now says there "is no possibility I will go to Washington at all."
In an interview, Dr. Cole acknowledged that she had been for years a member of the national committee of the pro-Cuba Venceremos Brigades, known for sponsoring sugar cane-cutting expeditions to Cuba. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has maintained that the group was connected with Cuban intelligence forces.
Dr. Cole is also listed as a member of the executive board of the U.S. Peace Council in the program published by that group for its 1983 national conference in Chicago.
 
F.B.I. Finds Soviet Link
 The council, founded in 1979, was an affiliate of the World Peace Council. In testimony before the Senate Permanent Select Committee in 1982, Edward O'Malley, a top official of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, called the World Peace Council "the largest and most active Soviet international front organization."
Dr. Cole, in the interview, said she had written for the U.S. Peace Council, but had not been a member of the organization, which is pro-Palestinian.
Dr. Cole was a featured speaker in a tribute held in New York in 1984 for Herbert Aptheker, a theoretician of the Central Committee of the Communist Party U.S.A. On Sunday, Dr. Cole said she had spoken on behalf of Mr. Aptheker in recognition of his work as a historian, not as an ideologue.

HEADLINE: New Breed of Ecologist to Lead E.P.A.

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
When she was growing up, Carol M. Browner spent hours hiking in the Everglades and once stayed home from school to finish a watercolor of an anhinga, a graceful and increasingly rare water bird that alighted in the pond outside her family's home in South Miami.
Now, as President-elect Bill Clinton's choice to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Ms. Browner, who turned 37 today, is about to step into one of the Government's most important posts for setting environmental policy. It will give her not only an opportunity to admire the natural world her family says she loves but also a powerful position to help repair it. 
 In her first interview since being chosen by Mr. Clinton, Ms. Browner, Florida's Secretary of Environmental Regulation, listed these early goals in the new post:
*Quickening the pace of E.P.A. decisions regarding issues like incineration, water pollution, development of wetlands and use of pesticides.
*Studying ways to end the waste of money and to improve the Government's management of the Superfund program to clean up toxic wastes, an effort that now consumes a quarter of the environmental agency's $7 billion budget
*"Restoring credibility" to an agency that has been buffeted more than most in the last 12 years by political conflicts between what the nation's environmental laws required and what the White House wanted.
 
Planning a Clear Course
 "The problem we have had in the states with the E.P.A., and one that the President-elect is very familiar with, is the lack of certainty in any of the agency's decisions," Ms. Browner said in a telephone interview. "The E.P.A. too frequently just does not bring an issue to a close. And that contributes to the lack of credibility with the public, with business and with others affected by what the E.P.A. does.
"You can't have environmental protection without having people believe in what you are doing. The public wants answers in a timely manner, and business needs answers for their planning. I've found business leaders don't oppose strong environmental programs. What drives them crazy is a lack of certainty. We can change that."
 
Working With Industry
 Ms. Browner is prominent among a new type of environmentalist who views economic development and environmental protection as compatible goals. Her supporters and opponents agreed that Ms. Browner, as head of the Department of Environmental Regulation, had rejuvenated a demoralized staff of 1,500 and had made the agency one of the most active in the Florida government.
She lobbied for and won changes in regulations that would shrink the amount of time the department takes to review permits needed to develop wetlands or to expand manufacturing plants. Business groups had long sought the changes, but they angered some environmentalists.
"The whole concept of it is to make it quicker, easier and cheaper for developers to get approvals," said Linda Young, the publisher of The Pro Earth Times, a Florida environmental newspaper. "We don't like it, because it removes opportunities for the public to get involved."
 
An Everglades Compromise
 Ms. Browner also helped persuade Gov. Lawton Chiles to negotiate a settlement in a lawsuit against Florida by the Federal Government intended to repair damage to Everglades National Park. She then became the state's chief negotiator and helped hammer out a settlement intended to purify and restore the natural flow of water to the park at a cost of about $1 billion to the state, the Federal Government and farmers.
The largest ecological restoration project ever tried in the United States, the settlement pleased environmentalists even as it angered Florida's sugar farmers, who will be required to bear a sizable portion of the cost.
"Having been on the opposite side of the table from her on the Everglades issue, I can tell you she is a formidable opponent," said Andy Rackley, vice president and general manager of the Florida Sugar Cane League, the industry's principal state trade group.
Ms. Browner also negotiated an agreement with the Walt Disney Company that requires the company to spend $40 million over several years to buy and restore an 8,500-acre ranch near Orlando in return for state and Federal permits to fill in 400 acres of wetlands for Disney development projects.
"This approach is so much more rational," Ms. Browner said. "We're not trying to mitigate the problem by creating a new wetland, which has a high rate of failure and is very expensive. In this instance, we moved to a restoration of what previously had been wetlands. Disney will provide the funding to restore and manage the land."
Ms. Browner said she believed that the Disney ranch would become the center of a wildlife refuge spanning tens of thousands of acres in central Florida.
Todd W. Mansfield, senior vice president of the Disney Development Company, applauded Ms. Browner's role in negotiating the agreement. "She is a tremendous environmental leader," he said. "She had a vision of protecting an entire ecosystem. She is a very, very long-term thinker."
Ms. Browner was raised in a home where television was tightly regulated, books were abundant and she and two younger sisters were encouraged to pursue their interests. Her father, Michael Browner, is an English professor, and her mother, Isabella Harty-Hugues, is a social science professor at Miami Dade Community College.
Ms. Browner was educated at the University of Florida in Gainesville where she earned an undergraduate degree in English and a law degree. The middle sister, Michelle Browner, is a biochemist at the University of California at San Francisco. The youngest sister, Stephanie Browner, is completing a doctorate in American literature at Indiana University.
Carol Browner started her career as an aide in the Florida House of Representatives in 1980 and later joined Citizen Action, a grassroots organizing group in Washington, where she worked on environmental issues. She met her husband, Michael Podhorzer, a specialist in health-care issues, while working for the group.
In the late 1980's she was an aide to Mr. Chiles, who was then a Senator, and in 1989 she joined Senator Al Gore's staff as a senior legislative aide. When she was chosen last week Ms. Browner traveled to Little Rock, Ark., with her son, Zachary, who will be 5 years old on Friday. 
"I want my son to be able to grow up and enjoy the natural wonders of the United States in the same way that I have," she said at a news conference. "I believe that that will now be possible, that we will be able to make the investment in our economy that we so desperately need, yet preserve the air, land and water."

HEADLINE: Ford to Cut $7.7 Billion From Net

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that it would account for its future costs for retiree benefits by taking a noncash after-tax charge of $7.5 billion in one huge swoop. The fourth-quarter charge means the auto maker is likely to have a 1992 net loss of between $6 billion and $7 billion, an American corporate record.
Ford's accounting decision was included in a package of bookkeeping adjustments, including the one-time cost of eliminating 10,000 jobs next year from its European operations, which are struggling in the face of a worsening sales slump.
 
Had Warned of a Loss
 In all, the nation's No. 2 auto maker said the special charges would reduce its 1992 income by $7.7 billion, which will be spread over the four quarters of 1992. Ford said results for the first three quarters would be restated to reflect the charges. 
 The company did not officially forecast a 1992 net loss, but it has reported a $681.4 million profit for the first nine months of 1992 and warned investors in November that it would probably have a loss in the fourth quarter. Last year, the auto maker had a net loss of $2.26 billion on sales $88.27 billion.
The record loss for any American company is $4.45 billion posted by the General Motors Corporation last year. On Tuesday, however, I.B.M. indicated that it would have a $4.75 billion net loss this year.
Ford's write-off of $7.5 billion is under an accounting rule adopted a year ago by the Federal Accounting Standards Board, companies can choose one of two methods for recognizing their obligations for medical and other benefits they will provide to current and future retirees. They can, as Ford did today, decide to take a single charge before the first quarter of 1993. Or they can spread out the charges over 20 years.
 
'Clears the Decks'
 "Basically, this just clears the decks for a recovery." said Terry Bresnihan, a Ford spokesman. "By taking the hit all at once, we avoid a $375 million drag on profit for 20 years."
Ford's write-down of $7.5 billion to cover retiree benefits is the largest taken so far, but the American Telephone and Telegraph Company said last year that it would take its charge in the first quarter of 1993 and that it might be as high as $7.5 billion. And these charges are only about half as large as the write-down that General Motors will eventually face.
G.M. and the Chrysler Corporation each said they would decide in the first quarter of 1993 whether to absorb one-time charges, as Ford did, or accrue their retiree benefit expenses over 20 years. G.M. estimates that it must account for $16 billion to $24 billion of benefits; Chrysler must account for about $4 billion.
By taking the charge in one lump, Ford is demonstrating that it has confidence that a jittery Wall Street will not overreact by trouncing its stock or hurting its credit standing. Ford also puts some competitive pressure on G.M. and Chrysler to match its move so that their future earnings will remain comparable.
Ford's shares lost 75 cents today, closing at $40.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. Today's announcement came after the market closed.
All of the auto makers and other companies could recoup some of the expenses if health-care cost containment efforts are successful. G.M., for example, recently required salaried workers to contribute more for health care, which might reduce future expenses by $1 billion, according to an estimate by Ron Glantz, auto analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco.
The size of Ford's charge is further evidence of how expensive health-care and retiree costs have become for American employers. Though the auto maker will not be forced to lay out cash immediately, the charge will reduce the value of the equity owned by Ford shareholders by one-third, to about $15.4 billion.
Harold A. Poling, Ford's chairman, testified at President-elect Bill Clinton's economic conference this week that health-care expenses continued to be a large drag on growth. "We spend more on health care than on steel," he said. Ford spends an average $10,000 annually for health care on every worker and retiree.
In addition to the $7.5 billion, which covers all active Ford workers and retirees as of the beginning of 1992, Ford also absorbed an additional $440 million net charge against profits to cover future benefits necessitated by years of service accumulated by Ford workers in 1992.
A separate accounting change pertaining to the way Ford pays taxes will add $685 million to 1992 profits, the company said. But Ford said it would also charge $419 million against 1992 profit to cover the cost of cutting back the European work force.
Ford said it would trim its hourly work force in Europe nearly 10 percent, to 68,000 from 75,200, primarily at its plants in Britain and at its plant in Cologne, Germany. Ford said it would reduce its salaried administrative staff in Europe from 17,550, to 15,000.

HEADLINE: Bankers Split on Deregulation as Stimulus

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Amid the hours of presentations at the economic conference in Little Rock, Ark., Monday and Tuesday and among the various programs offered for rejuvenating the economy, one of the ideas that seemed to whet President-elect Bill Clinton's appetite was bank deregulation. This involved the notion that banks could be expected to unleash an outpouring of new capital into the economy if the Government simply relaxed regulations on lending -- an $86 billion free lunch, so to speak.
"You heard the $86 billion figure; I've just been sitting here all day thinking about this," Mr. Clinton said, noting that such an amount dwarfs the $30 billion economic stimulus package that had been under discussion by many other speakers at the conference.
 
 
Many Doubts
 Many bankers, of course, are delighted that Mr. Clinton -- a Democrat, no less -- is interested in deregulation. But to many, the idea that it can replace Government spending is unrealistic. Most say they are trying as hard as they can to make new loans, and that however welcome the relief, it will not spur much new lending right away. 
 The prospect of cost-free growth is alluring at a time when pressure to slash the budget deficit is strong, as is the possibility of spending more to create jobs and improve productivity. "In the current situation, the biggest effort should be made looking for the so-called freebies, measures that help growth without causing the Federal Government to spend money," said Allen Sinai, chief economist of The Boston Company Economic Advisors, a unit of Shearson Lehman Brothers.
Relaxing bank regulations, he suggested, is the most attractive of the freebies: "If the regulators ease up, and the economy gets better, banks put out more credit, the country grows faster -- with no cost to the budget deficit. And as the economy grows, it generates more tax revenues that can actually reduce the deficit."
Not all bankers agreed that lightening up on regulations would spur more lending, but among those who did, estimates varied widely. The $86 billion figure was a rough estimate offered in Little Rock by William H. Brandon, Jr., president of the American Bankers Association and chief executive of the First National Bank of Phillips County in Helena, Ark. His calculation was based on the prospect that banks would move 4 percent of their assets into making loans, rather than placing them in other investments, such as bonds.
"The logic is that there are loans out there that we are not making that we would normally make," he said in an interview yesterday. "If we could move the regulatory environment from the most conservative back toward normal, we could generate 4 percent more loans in six months' time."
John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp, said in Little Rock that the impact could be higher -- as much as $100 billion -- while Mr. Sinai, from The Boston Company, testified that the impact would be much lower, perhaps $4 billion to $10 billion. "The banking community may well overstate the impact, but my own off-the-head number was probably conservative," Mr. Sinai said yesterday.
Many other bankers, however, suggested that the immediate impact would be virtually nil. Much as they want less regulation, they cautioned that they aren't likely to boost their lending quickly when the rules are changed.
"We would lend more money if we didn't have all these regulations, but it wouldn't be an instant surge," John Medlin, chairman of the Wachovia Corporation in Winston-Salem, N.C., said. "I think it's a more gradual thing."
 
 
'Loan Window Is Open'
 Frank Lourenso, Chemical Bank executive vice president in charge of middle-market lending, was also skeptical. "The main reason for sluggish loan demand has been lack of demand by businesses, not that they find it tough to borrow or that the banks are too regulated," he said. "The loan window is open here, but I can't push my customers to borrow."
As a result, changing regulations would not increase borrowing, Mr. Lourenso said. "There are things that Clinton can do for banks to help their business in the long run," he added. "I don't think those things will help

HEADLINE: UNREST RAVAGING TOURISM IN EGYPT

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The tourist industry, a bulwark of the Egyptian economy, is in danger of collapse after a series of attacks by Islamic militants against foreign tourists, including one in November that killed a Briton.
The decline is being compared to that during the Persian Gulf war when Europeans and Americans virtually stopped traveling to the Middle East. 
 If tourism does not recover soon, the hold of President Hosni Mubarak's administration will be further eroded. Already it is struggling to cope with rising unemployment, a severe housing shortage and a huge public sector that has become a drain on the budget.
The tourist decline will push hundreds of thousands of people out of work, swelling the ranks of the dispossessed, and will accentuate the state's impotence in the face of the burgeoning militant movement.
 
Lasting Damage Feared
 Tourism is Egypt's largest source of foreign revenues and before the attacks began two months ago was predicted to bring in $4 billion this year.
The Ministry of Tourism contends that tourism has fallen by 40 percent since the attacks, but tour operators and hotel managers in Cairo and Luxor report a decline closer to 60 or 70 percent. They worry that the crisis may be prolonged enough to do lasting damage to their businesses.
"The gulf war had a beginning and an end," said Ramzi Gargour, managing director of Sunshine Tours. "We knew when the war was over things would return to normal. But here, even if they catch all the suspects, there may still be one fanatic 15-year-old boy who will be willing to machine-gun a boatload of tourists. The mood is gloomy."
The British, American and German embassies have all warned their citizens to exercise caution when traveling in Egypt and to avoid the southern cities of Asyut and Dairut, the area where gunmen twice attacked tourist buses in the last two months with automatic weapons, wounding five Germans and killing a Briton.
Islamic fundamentalists announced at the end of August that they would attack foreign visitors in southern, or Upper, Egypt until the Government ended a crackdown that included the stationing of thousands of troops and police officers in villages and towns where the fundamentalists are active.
 
Tourists Called Disrespectful
 The fundamentalists, who say they are fighting to create an Islamic state, criticize tourists for being disrespectful to Islam. They also denounce the Government for what they say is its policy of building luxury hotels for foreigners rather than public housing, schools and clinics for poor Egyptians.
President Mubarak, who met with foreign journalists today, said that while he could not guarantee there would be no further attacks against tourists, security forces had "crushed" the militant movement in recent roundups.
But the campaign against tourists could be stepped up after the deployment of 12,000 troops and police officers in the Cairo neighborhood of Imbaba last week. The house-to-house searches and nightly curfew, which for the first time has brought the campaign against the militants to Cairo, has so far resulted in the roundup of some 600 militants.
Egyptian officials say they are bracing for assaults against foreigners in Cairo and have provided additional security at sites frequented by tourists, like the pyramids at the edge of the city.
Cruise lines, in an ominous move, have begun to dry-dock boats. Dozens of charter and commercial flights have been canceled, hotels are laying off workers and tour companies are releasing guides.
In Luxor on Monday, a few dozen tourists milled around the entrances of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. On the road leading to the main gate only three buses were parked, instead of the 50 or 60 vehicles that normally ferry tourists to and from the site.
"We visited the tombs by ourselves," said Stephen J. Collins, from Alexandria, Va. "It was like our own private tour. It was great for us, but it's terrible for the county."
Along the the Nile in Luxor empty cruise boats were tied up at their berths. One cruise boat owner, who asked to remain unidentified, said he had mothballed all nine of his vessels.
In Cairo six of the major hotels, including the Marriott and the Hilton, have occupancy rates of around 50 percent. At this time last year they had nearly 100 percent occupancy. Hotels in Upper Egypt, including the Movenpick in Luxor, said their occupancy rates had fallen by 70 percent.
The Siti First Travel Agency, one of Egypt's largest tour agencies, is handling 3 Italian tour groups this month instead of the 10 that were scheduled. The agency's Spanish tour groups have dropped from 15 to 3. And the groups have had so many cancellations that they have only 2 to 6 people instead of 15 or so. Siti First has already shut down 4 of its 10 Nile cruise boats.
"On my cruise boat there were only 24 people on a boat that could accommodate 120," said Heinz Schattin, a Swiss tourist, as he sat in a coffee shop at the base of the pyramids.
The Egyptian authorities have placed a soldier with a Kalashnikov assault rifle on all tourist buses leaving Cairo, a service that many owners say does little to dispel the worries of passengers.
"You put a man with a machine gun on a bus full of tourists," Mr. Gargour said, "and it only makes people more nervous."

HEADLINE: Fischer Said to Plan a 2d Match in Yugoslavia

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Dec. 16

 BODY:
A day after he was indicted in Washington for violating international economic sanctions against Yugoslavia, Bobby Fischer, the former world chess champion, was reported by a Belgrade newspaper today to be planning another match in Yugoslavia in March.
A Belgrade daily, Vecernje Novosti, reported that Mr. Fischer's promoter, Jezdimir Vasiljevic, would sponsor a match in Belgrade and Spain between Mr. Fischer and Yugoslavia's top player, Ljubomir Ljubojevic.
 
Facing Heavy Penalties
 The United States Government announced Tuesday that Mr. Fischer had been charged with violating the law for playing a $5 million match with Boris Spassky of Russia in Yugoslavia this fall. 
 Mr. Fischer, 49, who is reportedly living in a Belgrade hotel, is liable to be arrested upon his return to the United States. If found guilty, he would face a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment, a $250,000 fine and confiscation of the $3.35 million he reportedly collected for defeating Mr. Spassky.
At a news conference in September on the eve of the Spassky match, Mr. Fischer spat on a letter from the Treasury Department warning him that he might face prosecution because the match amounted to "commerce" banned under United Nations economic sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia. Mr. Vasiljevic admitted that the match was intended to show Yugoslavia's defiance of the embargo.
Neither Mr. Fischer, who lives in tight seclusion, nor Mr. Vasiljevic, a banker who Western diplomats say makes huges profits financing such operations in defiance of sanctions, was available for comment.
The Security Council imposed sweeping sanctions on Yugoslavia in May because of its military support for the Serbian forces who have carved up Bosnia and Herzegovina and driven hundreds of thousands of Muslims from their homes.

HEADLINE: ROMANIAN LEADERS BATTLE AN IMAGE

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania

 BODY:
Nearly three years after the overthrow and execution of Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania's leadership continues to suffer from widespread mistrust, at home and abroad, of the sincerity of its efforts to convert the country to democracy and a free-market economy.
Typifying Western reticence, the United States in October renewed its denial of most-favored-nation trading status to Romania. The refusal is particularly resented by the Government of President Ion Iliescu because "the clause," as it is called here, was granted to the Ceausescu dictatorship and is enjoyed today by most other former Communist countries, as well as China. 
 Mr. Iliescu was re-elected in October with 61 percent of the vote in presidential and parliamentary elections that foreign observers said were generally fair. His first election, in 1990, gave rise to doubts.
 
President Rejects Accusations
 In an interview, Mr. Iliescu, a usually genial man, bristled and his voice took on an edge as he rejected the catalogue of accusations that cloud the reputation of post-Communist Romania.
"I see all of this as the result of ideological intoxication, which dominates all of us, here and abroad," the President said. Speaking of the violence of the 1989 revolution and the summary trial and execution of Mr. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, he said the dictatorship was the worst in the Communist world and "an explosion" was the only way to dislodge it.
"Compare the evolution now," he said. "After the 'velvet revolution,' Czechoslovakia is being dismembered. In Romania, progress was difficult and encountered problems, but I think Romania now is an area of greater calm, balance and stability."
Mr. Iliescu angrily rejected suggestions that his Government bears blame for rioting that took place in 1990, in which miners brought to the capital by Government transport attacked opponents to the Government and vandalized opposition offices.
 
Cites Other Ex-Communists
 He also reacted with bitterness against suspicions raised by his past as a top Communist official. "Why isn't Boris Yeltsin judged the same way?" he asked. He named Presidents Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and said, "Everybody forgets their past."
A senior Western diplomat agreed with some of Mr. Iliescu's criticisms but said they were overstated. He said the bitterness of the country's political life is the principal reason why Romania's, and Mr. Iliescu's, past remain issues despite what many diplomats here view as progress toward democracy and economic liberalism.
"Romania is a pariah largely because of the hostility of the opposition," he said. "It paints the situation in solid black and Iliescu as an unredeemed Communist."
The harshness dividing election winners and losers was evident in interviews with opposition leaders.
"Iliescu is a crypto-Communist who inspires no confidence," said Corneliu Coposu, a royalist who led the Democratic Convention electoral alliance and heads the National Peasants Christian Democratic Party. "He has a nostalgia for the Communist structures and a Marxist-Leninist orientation. He has no credibility."
In a parliament in which no party or formal coalition can muster a majority, the small parties led by close associates of Ceausescu share significantly in the balance of power. The new Cabinet of Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, an economist who is considered a technocrat without close political ties, was approved with the support of the two radical parties.
 
New Premier Supports Plan
 Mr. Vacaroiu is charged with carrying out Mr. Iliescu's policy of slow reform, which seeks to minimize the effects of closing nonproductive state factories and withdrawing Government subsidies from essential goods on the long-suffering public.
"The continuity of Romania's reform can be achieved only at a bearable social cost," the Prime Minister said in an interview. He stressed the word "bearable."
The opposition asserts that this slow approach is a facade behind which Mr. Iliescu and his followers hide their unwillingness to change the still largely state-controlled economic structure.
"They can't stop reform but want to slow it, to keep their old privileges for a few more years," said Nicolae Manolescu of the Civic Alliance Party.
While the political leaders and the many parties vituperate in Parliament and through many new newspapers that contain far more opinion than fact, the 23 million Romanians seek with varying success to survive.
Private stores have sprung up offering a much wider choice of goods than was available under the Communists, but most Romanians still buy necessities in state stores with subsidized prices. Food lines, a regular feature of Romanian life for many years, are shorter but still exist.
Continuing pervasive poverty makes many Romanians uneasy about freedom. Those who rise above the average in a nation that was largely equal in poverty and repression are met with suspicion. Ordinary Romanians state with conviction that the small new class of entrepreneurs who succeed under the new freedom are either members of the former secret police or Gypsies, who are widely disliked.
"It is easier to free people than to free their minds," said Dumitru Ciocoi-Pop, rector of the University of Sibiu.

HEADLINE: ELECTION TURNOUT HIGHEST SINCE '68

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Turnout in the Presidential election reached 55.23 percent of the voting age population, the highest share since 1968, Curtis Gans, head of the Committee to Study the American Electorate, said today.
In 1968, nearly 61 percent of the voting age population went to the polls. 
 Relying on reports from election boards and other state offices in 50 states and the District of Columbia, Mr. Gans said 104,402,691 citizens voted for President. That was a sharp increase from the 91,594,805 who voted in 1988, when 50.11 percent of the population 18 and over voted.
Mr. Gans said the increase could be attributed almost entirely to the independent candidacy of Ross Perot. Except for a few Southern states, he said, "the Perot total equaled or exceeded the individual state gains." He said he believed that the increase was temporary and not very likely to change the generally downward trend of voting participation in recent years.
According to the committee, a nonprofit organization whose goal is to increase voting, President-elect Bill Clinton received 44,908,232 votes, or 43.01 percent of those cast. But his total was only 23.76 percent of the eligible electorate -- the smallest percentage since the election of John Quincy Adams in 1824, Mr. Gans said.
President Bush got 39,102,282 votes, or 37.45 percent of those cast. Mr. Perot got 19,725,433 votes, or 18.89 percent. Andre Marrou, the Libertarian candidate, placed fourth, with 291,612 votes.
Following them in the committee's totals were these candidates:
James (Bo) Gritz, independent, 106,911

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Insurer Hit by a Voter Revolt

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The fallout from a voter revolt in Brevard County, Fla., reached Wall Street yesterday, pulling down the stock price of the nation's largest municipal-bond insurer. The reaction of stockholders may also be an early warning for investors in a popular version of local government borrowing that the voters in Florida are challenging.
The stock of the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation dropped more than $5 in early trading but rebounded a bit and ended $1.75 lower, at $61.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 The reason appeared to be the 4-to-1 vote on Tuesday by the Brevard County commissioners to have a referendum in March on a $23.9 million issue used to pay for the county's new government operations center in Viera. M.B.I.A. insured the securities, called certificates of participation.
 
A Major Political Battle
 Based on the preliminary wording of the referendum, the vote will be on whether to keep the county's operations in the new building. If the vote is no, then the county will stop making payments of interest and principal on the certificates of participation, and M.B.I.A. will pick them up.
The vote Tuesday also prompted the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the credit-rating concern, to put a $670,000 Brevard County bond issue used for a golf course on its credit watch until the referendum is held. The bonds are rated BBB+. S.& P.'s statement said the company was "concerned that future political or economic controversies might affect the county's willingness to repay its other financings."
The fight over the government building and over continuing to honor the certificates of participation has become a major political battle in the county. It goes back to 1989 when the then board of commissioners approved the financing and the new government building without a countywide vote. "That is the key," Truman G. Scarborough Jr., a county commissioner, said in an interview yesterday.
The threat of the county vote is also stirring a storm in the municipal bond market. Analysts have said a vote against honoring the certificates will hurt the county's creditworthiness. In addition, it could make investors wary of other such securities, which have become popular because they can be issued without approval by the voters at large.
The certificates of participation differ from general obligation bonds because they are not backed by the full faith and credit and the taxing authority of the local government from when they are issued until they mature. Instead, the payments of interest and principal come from appropriated income that the project built with the bonds can earn. In this case, it is the rent paid by the county for the office building.
 
Analysts See Obligation
 Because the interest and principal payments must be appropriated every year, the courts have ruled that unlike a general obligation bond, a certificate of participation is not long-term debt and does not have to be approved by the voters before it is sold.
Mr. Scarborough said he supported going to a referendum by the voters because it is the only way to resolve the issue. He said that financial analysts were arguing that the county had an obligation to make the annual payments. But if this is the case, then the certificates are in effect long-term debt and therefore the voters should vote on the whole issue.
A second question on the March 16 ballot will ask for approval of general obligation bonds to pay for the county office building if voters approve keeping the operations center there. This money, Mr. Scarborough said, would be used to pay off the certificates of participation. He said he was going to vote against keeping the county operations in the Viera building and for not honoring the certificates of participation. But he will vote for a general obligation bond issue in case the voters approve keeping the county offices where they are.
 
Treasury Market
 Treasury prices rose yesterday with yields falling. The 30-year 7.25 percent bond was up 6/32 to 102 11/32 to yield 7.43 percent, down from 7.44 percent Tuesday.
Barbara Kenworthy, portfolio manager of taxable fixed-income funds at the Dreyfus Corporation, said prices were pushed higher by buying from Europe and by local governments that are paying off existing high-interest-rate bonds.

HEADLINE: Losing the 'Home' in 'Nursing Home'

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOUNT KISCO, N.Y.

 BODY:
Some of the 26 elderly residents waiting in the nursing home's recreation room suspected that the mysterious meeting they had been asked to attend was really a surprise Christmas party. Then Jane Stewart, the home's administrator, announced that the Swiss Home would be closing at the end of January.
"I nearly had a heart attack," said Esther Liljegren, 89. "I couldn't sleep the whole night because it is a very big shock." 
 To Ms. Liljegren, the closing means that she must leave the clean, comfortable place where she moved five years ago and had expected to die.
But to some advocates for the elderly, the closing of the Swiss Home is part of a bigger picture, an unintended result of Federal and state policies -- intended to end gross abuses -- that have forced most small nursing homes out of business, and will soon make such places obsolete.
 
'Few Left, Only a Handful'
 "The freestanding nursing home is likely to become a thing of the past," said Carl Young, president of the New York Association of Homes and Services for the Aging. "There are very few left, only a handful in the state, and likely to become fewer."
Annemarie Gilman, president of the Swiss Benevolent Society of New York, which owns and operates the home, said the Swiss Home had been forced out of business by heavy financial losses. She said the problems stemmed from changes in Medicaid's reimbursement formula, new state and Federal regulations that necessitate costly renovations, and local opposition to a proposal to build a larger home on the same property.
State officials do not even consider licensing new nursing homes with fewer than 120 beds. Most nursing homes are now much larger, and many are adjacent to hospitals, so residents can move directly from assisted independent living to an intermediate care home to a full-service nursing home as their condition deteriorates.
"They want institutions" rather than homes, said Ms. Stewart, the Swiss Home's administrator.
 
Rules and More Rules
 The squeeze on smaller homes began in 1987, when the National Nursing Home Reform Act imposed new regulations and staff requirements, spurred by gross abuses in a handful of states that had little regulation, Mr. Young said. New York State soon came out with even more stringent rules, he said.
The Swiss Home fails to meet the new codes because it lacks the required physical therapy room, staircases accessible to the handicapped, and separate closets for clean and dirty linen on all floors. The home also lacks the staff to comply with new regulations that require team planning of patient care, which advocates for the elderly say is necessary in large institutions but an undue burden in small ones.
Also in 1987, Medicaid changed the way reimbursement is calculated. The change meant more money for places that cared for the very sick and a drastic drop in revenue for places like the Swiss Home, whose residents are healthy enough to get around on their own.
"With minimal care, you get minimal reimbursement," far short of actual costs, Ms. Stewart said.
 
Policies Called Inhumane
 Critics of the Medicaid reimbursement system say it has actually created an incentive to place patients in full-care nursing homes that are both more restrictive and expensive than their condition requires.
"These bureaucrats come out with policies that are inhumane and don't make any sense," said Anthony Monteleone of Mount Kisco, whose mother, Josephine, 84, lives at the Swiss Home. "So they'll put them in a debilitating situation with people in wheelchairs who call out all the time."
In 1923, the Swiss Home moved from West 67th Street in Manhattan to this porticoed 19th-century home atop Captain Merritt's Hill, the highest point in this town of 9,000. At that time it was a self-supporting farm, where older Swiss immigrants raised vegetables and chickens. Today only one of the 26 residents is Swiss, and half have spent most of their lives in Mount Kisco.
And for the last five years, the Swiss Benevolent Society, a charitable group in Manhattan, has kept the Swiss Home open at a loss of about $200,000 a year, Ms. Gilman said.
 
One Plan Goes Nowhere
 About 18 months ago, finances grew more dire when the state Health Department ended the designation of "health-related facilities" for places like the Swiss Home, where residents need some help but not full nursing care. Now, all such homes are held to the higher standards of full-fledged nursing homes, which the Swiss Home could not afford to meet, Ms. Gilman said.
As a way out, the Swiss Benevolent Society teamed up with a organization based in Brooklyn, Wartburg Lutheran Services, and planned to build a 200-bed residence on the same property as the old home, where they hoped that all the Swiss Home residents could be moved together, with a minimum of disruption.
But after waiting almost two years for Mount Kisco to approve the plan, the Swiss Home finally became convinced last fall that the town officials had no intention of rezoning the residential area to allow the construction.
Mount Kisco's Mayor, Richard Roth, who is one of the five town trustees, said opposition in the upscale residential neighborhood stemmed from concerns about a water shortage and potential traffic problems. "Naturally there was an uprising," he said. "We try to protect the quality of life in the neighborhood. It just didn't fit in with what the residents wanted."
 
'Sorry to See Them Close'
 Wartburg, which withdrew its original application about two months ago, is working on a revised plan that will be presented to the trustees in January, said Mr. Roth. But Ms. Gilman said the Swiss Benevolent Society could no longer afford to wait.
Mr. Roth said that town officials had not played any role in forcing the Swiss Home out of business. "I know we look like the bad boys," he said, "but it's the state that came in with their rules and regulations."
In October, members of the Swiss Benevolent Society traveled to Albany to ask state health officials what they could do to stay open, Ms. Gilman said. "But we were told, 'You have no business in business because you're too small,' " she said. "We had always thought that being small made us a better place because it was less institutional."
State officials also deny playing any role in the Swiss Home's closing.
"I'm pretty sure they didn't feel they wanted to adjust to the times," said Robert Beattie, assistant director of the State Health Department's Bureau of Long-Term Care Services. "They decided it was too expensive and are going out of business." He said only a few places as small as the Swiss Home were still in business, because simple economies of scale had long since forced them to close.
As the Swiss Home scrambles to find other places for residents to go, families and staff members who will soon be out of a job worry about how the closing will affect residents, whose average age is 84.
"The elderly need a stability and a consistency in their lives, and Christmas is a particularly vulnerable time for the institutionalized elderly," said Barbara Somerville, a social work consultant at the home.
Ms. Somerville said many of the residents had asked if they could at least be moved along with a friend from the Swiss Home and if they could stay at the home at least long enough to spend Christmas with their friends there.
The Swiss Benevolent Society has said it will, if necessary, keep the home open past Jan. 31, until all the residents have somewhere to go.
In the front parlor of the home, dimly lit by the last of the afternoon sun coming through a large picture window, a group of residents who had gathered to wait for a 5 P.M. game of shuffleboard on a recent day said they had become like family. And they spoke of their attempts to adjust to the idea of a new life in modern and unfamiliar settings elsewhere.
With its high ceilings, walnut wainscot and heavy wooden furniture like the enormous hand-carved, marble-topped buffet that Ms. Stewart says she is sure the home was built around, the white three-story home certainly evokes another time.
"It was just wonderful that there was such a place as the Swiss Home," said Adele Bolton, 85, already speaking in the past tense. Ms. Liljegren said, "Everything comes to an end."

Top Officer Set to Retire At American Electric Power

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Richard E. Disbrow, chairman and chief executive of the American Electric Power Company, one of the nation's largest utilities, intends to retire in April, after the company's 1993 annual meeting, it was announced yesterday.
E. Linn Draper Jr., American Electric's president, will succeed Mr. Disbrow. Mr. Draper, who is 50, joined the company last March after a 13-year career at Gulf States Utilities, the last five as chairman, chief executive and president. 
 Mr. Disbrow, who is 62, was named chairman earlier this year and president and chief executive in 1991. He has been with the utility, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, since 1954.
News of the changes came as no surprise to securities analysts, and in a prepared statement Mr. Disbrow emphasized he had agreed to take on the chairman's job only to help position the company for the next management transition.
"The company faces a number of new challenges and opportunities, and in my view it would be preferable to step aside now and let those who will manage through the 1990's and beyond have free rein in establishing the needed policies and programs," Mr. Disbrow said in the statement.
Mr. Disbrow elaborated on the challenges facing his successor in a telephone interview.
"We have many problems remaining in the environmental area," he said. "There will be some new initiatives from the Clinton Administration, but our position is that there has to be a balance between energy, the economy and the environment. I am concerned that we not desecrate the environment, but neither should we leap to Draconian solutions that would jeopardize the economy."
The profitability of American Electric, the parent company of seven electric utilities that provide service to seven million people in parts of seven states, has declined so far this year.
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, the company reported net income of $302 million on revenues of $3.75 billion. In the corresponding period a year ago, American Electric earned $382 million.
"This is a slow-growth company in a slow-growth part of the country," said Sanford M. Cohen, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company.
American Electric operates in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee.
A graduate of Rice University, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees, and from Cornell University, where he earned a doctorate in nuclear science and engineering, Mr. Draper was an associate professor and director of the nuclear engineering program at the University of Texas before joining Gulf States.
His expertise in nuclear energy did not make life much easier at Gulf States. The company has been in financial trouble since 1986, when it completed a nuclear plant at St. Francisville, La., in the midst of a regional recession.
Mr. Draper spearheaded efforts to raise rates to cover the costs of the plant. Those efforts met with stern resistance from regulators.

HEADLINE: Merge City and Suburban Schools, Lawsuit Urges

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST HARTFORD, Conn., Dec. 16

 BODY:
One of the most ambitious efforts to integrate the schools of a Northern metropolitan area went to trial today in a small suburban courtroom, in a lawsuit charging that the segregation that divides Hartford from its suburbs denies children in Connecticut's capital an equal opportunity for their education.
A victory could eventually lead to a wave of similar suits across the North, where the pattern of poor, heavily minority cities surrounded by overwhelmingly white suburbs has stood unchallenged since the height of suburban white flight and resistance to busing in the early 1970's. 
 Here in the nation's wealthiest state, lawyers for a coalition of civil-rights groups charged today that the Hartford region's economic and racial segregation amounts to a system of educational apartheid, creating "an enclave of disadvantage" for the city's children, more than 90 percent of whom are black or Hispanic, and nearly half of whom come from families on welfare.
"You have the poorest of the economic poor and the worst of the educational worst, in the highest of the high racially impacted districts," John C. Brittain, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told a State Superior Court judge, Harry Hammer. Mr. Brittain said Hartford was the state's poorest city, its schools were the most segregated and its students' performance was the lowest.
The suit follows dozens of school-financing cases across the country, including landmark decisions in Connecticut and New Jersey, in arguing that the conditions in urban schools violate a state constitution's guarantee of equal educational opportunity.
It goes beyond those suits, however, in arguing for the first time that the remedy is not simply more money for city schools but their merger with surrounding suburban districts. The coalition's strongest evidence is a series of reports by one of the defendants, the State Commissioner of Education, documenting how the academic performance of city students across Connecticut has lagged behind that of suburban students as city schools have grown increasingly segregated.
Because it is in a state court, the case cannot set a precedent outside of Connecticut. But if the civil-rights groups prevail, they will have broken the barrier between city and suburban school districts that Federal courts have refused to breach in desegregation cases unless the suburbs can be shown to be discriminating intentionally.
"The Connecticut Constitution prohibits segregation," Judge Hammer was told by Wesley W. Horton, a Hartford lawyer who won more state aid for poor communities with a school-finance suit he brought in the 1970's known as Horton v. Meskill. "That should be the end of that."
Assistant Attorney General John R. Whelan responded today that the state had not violated Connecticut's Constitution because it had no role in the segregation of its metropolitan areas.
"There will be no evidence that the state played any role in causing the demographic changes or the housing patterns in the Hartford area that have led to the predominantly minority school system in the city," he said. "Indeed, the evidence will show that the opposite is true: the state has made serious efforts to change those patterns and promote desegregation."
 
Issue of Poverty
 Mr. Whelan also argued that the state had not ignored Hartford's education problems and had provided financing that allows the city to spend more per pupil than all but two of its suburban neighbors.
There is no question that "there are real and serious problems that have led to educational underachievement by students in Hartford," he said, but "surely the state does not violate the Constitution by having failed to cure poverty and other socio-economic problems in our cities."
He also argued that no judge could come up with a solution to the complex social problems posed by the case. For proof, he said, he will offer testimony that the solutions ordered by judges who did find states guilty of active segregation have "been notably ineffective."
This morning the corridors of the small courthouse in West Hartford, an affluent neighbor of Hartford, were jammed with almost festive supporters of the suit and many of the plaintiffs named in it when it was filed in 1989.
Thirteen-year-old Milo Sheff, a Hartford eighth grader who lent his name to the suit -- the Governor then was William A. O'Neill, so the case is known as Sheff v. O'Neill -- was on hand with his mother, Elizabeth Sheff, a Hartford City Councilwoman.
As the crowd waited for Judge Hammer to send a jury in a medical-malpractice case out to deliberate, the Sheffs and several of the other children in the suit and their parents gave polished interviews to television and radio reporters. Outside, a group of supporters held hands in a circle and sang "We Shall Overcome" and other civil-rights songs.
The Sheff case holds the potential of redefining the central element in many Connecticut communities, the local school district, an element of great pride in wealthy suburbs and of frustration in poor cities and towns.
While the state has the power to redraw district lines, combining city and suburban schools, it could also set goals for local districts, provide financial incentives for new schools and new programs and then let cities and their neighbors work out cooperative integration efforts.
Connecticut has spent years studying the segregation of black and Hispanic students, who make up 25.7 percent of the public school enrollment. And Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and his Education Commissioner, Vincent Ferrandino, are already pressing districts to pursue voluntary measures like magnet schools that attract students across district lines.
Because busing and local control are volatile issues, Mr. Brittain and his fellow lawyers would like to avoid talk of specific measures until Judge Hammer rules on the constitutional issue. But they have said they expect any integration plan to set numerical goals and to require the transportation of both city and suburban students.
Behind the determination of the plaintiffs also lies a conviction that busing and local control are so volatile that the state will never act without a judge's order.
"The end to isolation will only come with a court order, and the Federal courts have blindly withdrawn from the scene," Mr. Horton told Judge Hammer today.
This afternoon the plaintiffs called their first two witnesses, David G. Carter, the president of Eastern Connecticut State University, and State Representative Edna Negron, principal of Ramon E. Betances School in Hartford. Mr. Carter was asked for his definition of "equal educational opportunity."
"It's when a student has an opportunity to achieve his or her potential to the maximum," said Mr. Carter, who was co-chairman of Governor O'Neill's Commission on Quality and Integrated Education in 1990.
How important, Judge Hammer asked, is the motivation that the children themselves bring to school?
"Sometimes, sir," Mr. Carter replied, "you have to have hope for people who are hopeless. Part of being motivated is feeling good about yourself."

HEADLINE: Elaine Whitelaw, 77, March of Dimes Backer, Dies

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
Elaine Whitelaw, for half a century the chief fund raiser and a major force for the March of Dimes, died on Tuesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 77.
She died of cancer, said her daughter, Patricia Snyderman of San Francisco. 
 In 1943, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt tapped her to join the national women's committee of the March of Dimes, which he founded to fight polio, Miss Whitelaw recognized the philanthropic potential of middle-income Americans. By creating a network of volunteers and programs for children and mothers, she made them the backbone of one of the country's most successful charities.
A dozen years after it began, the March of Dimes was helping to rid America of polio and has used the network Miss Whitelaw created to continue financing the fight against a variety of birth defects.
 
'She Was Irresistible'
 "She was the general of a volunteer army," said Beverly Sills, the national chairwoman of the March of Dimes and a longtime friend of Miss Whitelaw's.
As a fixture on the national charity-ball scene, Miss Whitelaw embodied can-do do-gooding. Both colleagues and those she tapped relentlessly for contributions said she practiced what she preached. They described her as demanding, innovative, boundlessly energetic and fiercely determined.
"When she approached me about becoming involved with the March of Dimes she said, 'Other charities want to put your name on their stationery. I want your time, your energy and your money,' " Ms. Sills recalled. "She was irresistible."
Roseamond Elaine Whitelaw was born on Nov. 21, 1914, the oldest child of Louis Whitelaw, a wealthy diamond merchant, and his wife, Dora. Along with two younger brothers, Seymour and Jordan, Miss Whitelaw grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She graduated from Smith College, where she studied American history and art. She returned and embarked on a lifelong mission of balancing society and its entitlements and the social obligations of Roosevelt's New Deal.
"There was no question that I was going to work," she said last year. "But of course I wasn't going to work at some perfume counter and take a job from someone who needed it." After a brief stint as a script reader, an early marriage that ended in divorce and the birth of her daughter, Patricia, she volunteered to raise money for the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War. She moved on to volunteer for the National War Fund.
She later married Otto Brodnitz, an economist and stockbroker, and the couple lived on the Upper East side of Manhattan until his death in the mid-1970's.
After joining the March of Dimes in 1943, Miss Whitelaw created a network of volunteers who sought donations in cinemas and door to door. She also used her prodigious organizational abilities to help orchestrate the field tests of the Salk polio vaccine. "Her influence was all pervasive,' said Dr. Jonas Salk, founder of the Salk Institute in San Diego, Calif.
 
Serving Hot Meals
 Later, along with Eleanor Lambert, she organized a fashion show to benefit the March of Dimes that Time magazine called "the event of the year." In 1976, she began "Gourmet Galas," dinners prepared in various cities by local celebrities and judged by culinary experts. Today, there are 40 different galas across the United States.
After retiring from the March of Dimes last year, Miss Whitelaw volunteered as a regional director of the Enterprise Foundation, a national organization involved in housing the poor. Increasingly concerned with homelessness, drug use and AIDS, she spent nights last winter riding a Planned Parenthood van and counseling women who lived or worked on the streets in the Bronx.
"The only way we're going to get them in for treatment is to feed them," she told a reporter at the time. "They don't know they might be sick. They know they're hungry, their children are hungry." Within days, she had cooking equipment and food donations, and, in her Adolfo suits and Ferragamo shoes, she helped serve hot meals from midnight to dawn.
One of the young women she fed, a runaway, took words from Miss Whitelaw's vocabulary to describe her. "She's a great dame," she said.
Miss Whitelaw is survived by her daughter; her brother, Seymour Whitelaw of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.

Average Yields Are Level On Money Market Funds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The average yields offered by tax-exempt and taxable money market funds showed little change in the latest week. But seasonal factors could temporarily push them higher in the weeks ahead.
According to the most recent survey by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, yields moved higher by either 1 or 2 basis points. "It was like watching grass grow," said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donoghue's. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 "However, in the next few weeks you will see yields spike as year-end factors come into play," Mr. Frank added. "The temporary phenomenon was somewhat muted last year as the Fed eased, but this year there will be no offset as the central bank holds to a hands-off policy."
Another factor that could add a few basis points to short-term yields is the recent downgrading of the commercial paper of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation and Sears, Roebuck & Company. Their commercial paper is popular among money market funds, and the lower ratings mean they are likely to raise interest rates to attract investors.
Tax-exempt yields moved up, as assets slipped by $447 million, to $100.7 billion, but analysts said the numbers were flat. The average number of days left to maturity of securities in tax-free fund portfolios was at 61, down from 62 in the previous week.
The seven-day average compounded yield was up a basis point, to 2.12 percent, and the seven-day simple yield rose a similar amount, to 2.09 percent. IBC/Donoghue's statisticians calculated that over 30 days, the compounded yield average is 2.16 percent and the simple yield average is 2.14 percent.
Ignoring the state taxes that investors face, the taxable equivalent of the seven-day compounded yield for someone in a 28 percent tax bracket was about 2.94 percent, compared with 3.07 percent for those in a 31 percent bracket.
 
Top Performer
 From its survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, distributed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management had the highest yield, 2.73 percent.
The average seven-day compounded and simple yields for taxable money market funds were each up a basis point, to 2.84 percent and 2.80 percent, respectively.
Assets of taxable money market funds declined by $5.5 billion, to $478.2 billion, with institutional and retail funds nearly splitting the decline.
IBC/Donoghue's analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable money market portfolios was down to 59 days, as portfolio managers position themselves to take advantage of rising yields at the end of the year.
The Dreyfus Basic Money Market was the top-yielding taxable fund with a return of 3.77 percent, while in government-only money market funds, the United Services Government Securities Savings Fund was on top at 3.83 percent.
It is unusual for a government fund to offer a better yield than a taxable fund, Mr. Frank said.
This week bank money market accounts, which compete directly with the funds, are yielding an average 2.76 percent.

HEADLINE: New Gains for Industry and Home Building

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The economy ground out gains in industrial and new-home output in November for the second straight month, complementing a buoyant performance by shoppers, Government figures showed today.
Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities climbed four-tenths of 1 percent last month and the October gain was stronger than initially reported, according to the Federal Reserve. These advances more than offset late-summer declines and carried the Industrial Production Index to 109.7, less than one point below its pre-recession peak in September 1990. 
 Separately, the Commerce Department reported that builders broke ground on new homes at an annual pace of 1,242,000, after seasonal adjustment. This rate was 1.5 percent above the October pace, which was also revised upward.
 
Analysts Still Cautious
 While neither indicator did any better than had been expected, analysts said they showed that the economy continued to plow ahead and remained on course to expand at a pace of 2.5 percent or better in the October-December quarter. This would be the seventh straight quarterly increase after three declines.
Still, the latest industrial and housing figures do not resemble a boom, and many analysts, citing earlier instances of two steps forward, one step back, remained cautious.
"It appears the manufacturing sector has strengthened a bit over the past two months, but that's happened a number of times in the past few years," said Alan C. Lerner, a senior official at Bankers Trust.
Industrial production for October was revised upward to five-tenths of a percent from three-tenths of a percent. Housing starts, which had been down 1.1 percent for October, were revised upward to two-tenths of a percent. On the other hand, the eight-tenths of 1 percent gain initially reported for September housing starts was revised to a decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent.
Industry accounts for only about one-third of national output, but it is the part that fluctuates most in business cycles. It is also one of four coincident indicators -- those moving at the same time as the economy at large -- used by the National Bureau of Economic Research to date recessions and expansions.
The broadly based November rise was paced by nondurable materials, up five-tenths of 1 percent, and information processing equipment, the Federal Reserve said. Durable factory goods rose four-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Capacity Use Is Up
 Over all, production at American factories rose five-tenths of 1 percent, while oil and gas drilling and other parts of the mining business rose six-tenths. Utility output, however, fell six-tenths of 1 percent.
Motor vehicle assembly edged up to an annual pace of 10 million, from 9.9 million in October, the report also showed.
At the same time, factories, mines and utilities operated at 78.9 percent of capacity last month, up two-tenths of a point. Factory utilization rose two-tenths of a point, to 77.9 percent.
The modest 1.5 percent gain in housing starts was entirely in the South, aided by hurricane rebuilding, and West as the Northeast and Midwest experienced declines. Ground- breaking increased for single-family homes but slumped badly for apartment buildings with four or more units.
David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, called the results "a mixed bag," but "at least mildly encouraging."
The trade group predicts a 10 percent rise in starts for 1993, to 1.32 million, with the bulk of the gain in single-family residences. Today Mr. Seiders cited the growing divergence between this sector and apartment buildings, an already depressed category that continued to sink last month.
Starts of buildings with five or more units skidded 8.4 percent, to an annual rate of just 109,000, the department found, the lowest since June.
Mr. Seiders said this was worse than he had expected, perhaps reflecting an early effect of a tax credit for low-income housing that has expired and not yet been formally extended.
Today's report also showed permits for home and apartment construction eased 1.5 percent in November, to a 1,122,000 annual pace. This has traditionally been regarded as a predictor of future construction levels. but Mr. Seiders said it had never been a good one. Today's figures showed the Northeast with a sizable advance, the South with an even larger decline and the Midwest and West about unchanged.
At a pace of 1,242,000, the November starts pace was 14 percent above the level of November 1991.
"Gradually things are getting better in single family, but multifamily continues to languish" 21 percent below levels of a year ago, said Kevin Logan of the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
The Commerce Department report also showed that shipment of mobile homes, which lag a month, rose 3 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted rate of 226,000, 32.2 percent above the pace a year earlier.

The Dollar Trades Lower Despite Gains by Economy

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar finished lower yesterday in quiet trading despite new signs that the economy is steadily gaining momentum.
Gold prices rose on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where bullion for current delivery settled at $337.90 an ounce, up $3.40 from Tuesday. A late quote from the Republic National Bank said spot gold rose $3.20, to close at $337.85 an ounce. 
 The dollar was unmoved by news that November industrial production rose four-tenths of 1 percent and housing starts were up about 1.5 percent to their highest level since March.
Traders said recent economic data had been generally supportive of the dollar, but not impressive enough to touch off a rally.
"There's a feeling that people may have been overly bullish on the dollar," John McCarthy, chief trader at ABN/Amro, said.
The French franc ended the day little changed despite persistent speculation of a devaluation. Several major French commercial banks raised their base lending rates to 10 percent from 9.45 percent in anticipation of a central bank rate rise to defend the currency, dealers said.
The dollar closed in New York at 1.5571 marks, down from Tuesday's close of 1.5675 marks. Earlier in London, it finished at 1.5540 marks.
The dollar also eased against the yen despite depressing Japanese economic data, which showed gross national product fell an annualized 1.6 percent in the third quarter.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 123.87 yen, up from 123.83 yen Tuesday. Later in London, the dollar slumped to 123.03 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 122.98 yen, compared with Tuesday's close of 123.95 yen.
In London, the British pound was at $1.5750 in late trading and was unchanged from that level at the close of New York trading. On Tuesday, sterling stood at $1.5680 at the New York close.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday rates, included: 1.3990 Swiss francs, down from 1.4100; 5.3220 French francs, down from 5.3575; 1,398 lire, barely changed from 1,397, and $1.2773 (Canadian), down from $1.2790(Canadian).

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
More Advisers, Less Council?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
JAWS dropped last week on word of the appointment of Laura D'Andrea Tyson to head Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. To win this most coveted job in the economics profession, Ms. Tyson had to beat out a half-dozen high-profile heavyweights, some of whom had been tirelessly lobbying the Clinton transition team. And until a few months ago, Ms. Tyson was known simply as a competent scholar who had thrown in her lot with the trendy minority of economists and political scientists intent on waging techno-warfare with Europe and Japan.
Her surprised colleagues concede the 45-year-old University of California professor made her own luck -- that in her encounters with Mr. Clinton she was exceptionally persuasive and well organized. On reflection, that should not have been surprising: Ms. Tyson is a very successful teacher, as well as a polemicist with a flair for winning arguments without making enemies. 
 But they still insist that the dark-horse appointment marks a radical departure, one suggesting that Bill Clinton already has well-formed views on economic policy. "This is proof that the President will be his own chief economic adviser," said Robert Z. Lawrence of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
Ms. Tyson is certainly a card-carrying member of the economics establishment. She earned a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, arguably America's most selective graduate school in economics. She wrote a doctoral thesis on Yugoslav-style socialism under Martin Weitzman, perhaps America's most distinguished theoretician of planned economies. She bagged a first job in Princeton's elite economics department. And when she left Princeton to move west with her family, she managed an appointment to the almost-as-prestigious Berkeley faculty.
Ms. Tyson's scholarship has not set the academy afire. But, then, much of it concerned Eastern European economies before the fall of Communism -- a subject that generated little interest in the West. And in any case, academic research is not necessarily the best proving ground for policy makers. Walter Heller, President John F. Kennedy's chief economist, was not a particularly distinguished scholar. But he certainly knew enough economics to pioneer the use of fiscal fine-tuning in an era when Keynesianism was often equated with Bolshevism.
What, then, is the beef with the Tyson appointment? One objection is that she aced out some of the most innovative and seasoned policy economists around -- most notably, Lawrence H. Summers, the chief economist for the World Bank.
Another is that she is closely identified with Silicon Valley, the high-technology producers who will be lobbying hard for subsidies and for government-negotiated shares of world markets. "You've never had a situation where the Council of Economics Advisers was captured by an interest group," said Gary Saxonhouse of the University of Michigan. And while others doubt that Ms. Tyson will be anybody's tool, many do worry that her lack of ideological commitment to free trade will open the gates to protectionists.
Traditionally, the Council of Economic Advisers has served as a counterweight to the Commerce Department and Congress, which generally represent domestic producers' interests at the expense of consumers'. But with Ms. Tyson in charge, "there's a risk a voice will be absent at the table," said William Cline of the Institute for International Economics.
A broader concern is that the role of the Council of Economic Advisers is being downgraded, and with it the role of economic analysis in White House policy making. No one -- perhaps not even Mr. Clinton -- knows how the Council of Economic Advisers and its staff will divide responsibilities with the National Economic Council, newly created by the President-elect. What is known, though, is that the new body will be headed by an investment banker, Robert E. Rubin, who has close ties to Mr. Clinton.
Most striking, perhaps, is that the President-elect has not chosen a single economist with broad knowledge of policy issues to join his inner circle. Alice M. Rivlin, the new deputy budget director who was recruited from the Brookings Institution, might be considered the exception.
But her days -- and probably her nights -- will be consumed with the technical aspects of managing a trillion-dollar-plus budget. And in any case, Ms. Rivlin is not known to have the sharp elbows needed to push her responsibilities beyond the formal job description.
A plausible explanation is that Mr. Clinton already has an economic policy and simply wants a staff to fiddle with the nuts and bolts. His remarkable performance at this week's economic teach-in in Little Rock certainly suggests that he has a better command of the subject than any previous President.
But the line between justified self-confidence and hubris is a thin one. With thorny issues ranging from fiscal policy to defense conversion to global warming facing the President-elect, he may yet regret his decision to pass by the wisest economic heads of his generation.

HEADLINE: Faster U.S. Recovery Seen

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The United States economy seems likely to recover more rapidly than previously anticipated, the O.E.C.D. said today.
The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, revising predictions in its half-yearly Economic Outlook published today, said it appeared a more relaxed monetary policy in recent years was proving beneficial. 
 "Recent indicators in the United States, which became available after the cutoff date for our projections, point to economic activity gathering pace more rapidly than is embodied in our projection," the group's chief economist, Kumihara Shigehara, said at a news conference in Paris.
"It looks as if the monetary easing over the last three years is finally bearing fruit," he said, adding that the growth rate in the United States might be raised by a half percentage point from the group's initial forecast.
The O.E.C.D. published outlook expected United States gross domestic product to expand by about 2.5 percent in 1993 and by 3 percent in 1994, compared with 1.75 percent in 1992.
But with recent United States Government data showing an improving economy, many private economists are adjusting their estimates for growth next year slightly higher. Many believe the economy will expand by about 3 percent in 1993.

London Makes a Revelation of 'Carousel'

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Even in the age of Andrew Lloyd Webber, the British remain in awe of the Broadway musical. Only the most obviously disreputable of American imports and revivals fail to earn critical raves here, and on occasion local versions of New York shows are proclaimed superior to the originals. During the 1980's, this was most famously the case with Richard Eyre's staging of "Guys and Dolls" and Cameron Mackintosh's upbeat revision of Stephen Sondheim's "Follies," though American visitors could see that both productions were far from fluent in Broadwayese. In "Guys and Dolls," Damon Runyon's mugs sometimes spoke with Southern accents and tapped like Bojangles.
So it was with skepticism that I approached the new production of the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein "Carousel," which opened last weekend to ecstatic reviews and turn-away crowds at the Royal National Theater, the site of the Eyre "Guys and Dolls." But for once the wild enthusiasm may be an understatement. This is without question the most revelatory, not to mention the most moving, revival I've seen of any Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. The National has recently found startling new ways of looking at the dramas of Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller under both Peter Hall's and Mr. Eyre's leadership, and now it proves just as imaginative in sweeping away decades of cliches from an American musical classic of the same period. 
 "Carousel" was Richard Rodgers's own favorite show among his collaborations with Oscar Hammerstein 2d, but it is infrequently revived, in part because its vocally demanding lead role, the carousel barker, Billy Bigelow, is hard to cast, in part because its dark book (adapted from Ferenc Molnar's "Liliom") asks audiences to stomach Billy's wife-beating and suicide. The last major New York production, a good one at Lincoln Center in which John Raitt recreated his original Billy, was nearly 30 years ago. Though almost everyone is familiar with "Carousel," what most audiences have actually seen is the distorted, candied Hollywood film adaptation of 1956.
The National Theater production is a collaboration by Nicholas Hytner, a director whose eclectic reach has extended from opera to "Miss Saigon" to Alan Bennett's "Madness of King George III," and Kenneth MacMillan, the principal choreographer of the Royal Ballet, who died while "Carousel" was still in rehearsal but not before he had finished what a program note says was 85 percent of the dancing. From the very first bars of "The Carousel Waltz," they and the brilliant designer, Bob Crowley, aspire to an adult emotional purity that is devastating in its cumulative effect.
Surely this is the first staging of the piece in which the curtain does not rise to reveal a carousel. Instead the sinister opening bars of Rodgers's waltz are set in the grim late-19th-century New England mill where the heroine, Julie Jordan, works absent-mindedly at her loom. The stage is at first dominated by a large Victorian clock that ticks off the minutes until the closing time of 6, at which point the clock flies away, the abruptly liberated mill laborers twirl out of the forbidding factory gates in mad abandon and a full moon sweeps one and all to the fairground. There the drab colors of industrial servitude briefly give way to bright lights and raucous carnival sideshows while the carousel is slowly erected by roustabouts before the audience's eyes. Familiar as the music may be, it has never sounded so urgent or so troubling as it does when illustrated by this bittersweet cinematic panorama of oppression and release.
Without making a British fetish of class conflict, the National's "Carousel" is always conscious of the lowly economic status of its major characters. When Julie (Joanna Riding) and Billy (Michael Hayden) get together in "If I Loved You," the song's indirect expression of feeling comes across not as coy musical-comedy flirtation but as inarticulate, self-protective wariness. These incipient young lovers, aged by drudgery and snubbed by respectable society, are old and achingly lonely before their time, a mere "couple of specks" in the scheme of things, as Billy sadly puts it. The duet's sexual crescendo, so titillatingly elongated and then consummated in the tidal music, becomes Billy and Julie's thrilling defiance of both their own sense of defeat and their community's Puritan propriety. As designed by Mr. Crowley, the scene is set on an Andrew Wyeth hill that is painted in the vivid folk-art colors of Grandma Moses but is suffused with the solitude of Edward Hopper.
In this "Carousel," the whalers' tavern is as dark as a saloon out of O'Neill, and the waterfront setting for Billy's attempt at armed robbery could be Steinbeck's Cannery Row. Yet the production is airy, fluid and poetic, not heavy or realistic. Mr. Crowley, whose work has been seen in New York in "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" and the Ian McKellen "Richard III," avoids the busy mechanics of contemporary English musicals, restricting himself to the drops and turntables of the Rodgers and Hammerstein era. His New England fishing village is in a cobalt blue box that doubles as heaven when Billy ascends there in the second act. The visual harmony is matched aurally: amplification in the National's proscenium house, the Lyttelton, is slight, and the original Don Walker orchestrations are sumptuously served by a large pit orchestra.
What is remarkable about Mr. Hytner's direction, aside from its unorthodox faith in the virtues of simplicity and stillness, is its ability to make a 1992 audience believe in Hammerstein's vision of redemption, which has it that a dead sinner can return to Earth to do godly good. Mr. Hytner's principal accomplice in this feat is Mr. Hayden, a previously unknown American actor not long out of Juilliard who brings to Billy a Warren Beatty-like mixture of masculine belligerence, bewilderment and tenderness and sings his marathon "Soliloquy" like an angel well before the character becomes one. Almost as important to the production is Patricia Routledge's Nettie, whose direct and understated delivery of "You'll Never Walk Alone" to the just-widowed Julie shakes the cobwebs from a song long synonymous with sentimental overkill.
The National "Carousel" is not without its sporadic, typically British lapses. Some of the singing is so-so (a flaw in Miss Riding's otherwise fine Julie) and some of the casting is stock (the black Mr. Snow, Clive Rowe, happily excepted). The MacMillan choreography of the Act I ensemble numbers "June Is Busting Out All Over" and "Blow High, Blow Low!," while intended to salute the Agnes de Mille originals, looks like the West End's perennially warmed-over idea of Michael Kidd. But in the affectingly performed Act II pas de deux, in which Billy's unhappy teen-age daughter (Bonnie Moore) searches for her dead father's love by taking up with a fairground boy (Stanislav Tchassov), MacMillan joins the hero in seeming to speak to a spellbound audience from beyond the grave.
 
'Assassins'
 It was Stephen Sondheim, Hammerstein's protege, who famously saluted the advances of this musical by noting that while its predecessor, "Oklahoma!," was about a picnic, "Carousel" was about life and death. Mr. Sondheim's own musicals are often about anger and death, especially so in the case of his last work, "Assassins," which has also received a highly acclaimed new production here.
As staged by Sam Mendes, London's hot young director of the moment, at the refurbished, 250-seat Donmar Warehouse Theater, "Assassins" is far more unified and lucid than it was in Jerry Zaks's fussy original production at Playwrights Horizons in New York last year. (It is not so well performed, though Henry Goodman's antic Charles Guiteau is a bright spot.) The show also benefits from a fuller band and from a haunting new song, "Something Just Broke," in which ordinary citizens describe a momentous historical event from their vantage point. In theme the number is reminiscent of "Someone in a Tree" from "Pacific Overtures," but this time the chilling event seen from afar is the Kennedy assassination.
The improvements do not alter my impression that, its score notwithstanding, "Assassins" is theatrically and intellectually static. But seeing this Sondheim musical in contrast with "Carousel" is as fascinating as bracketing the anti-colonial "Pacific Overtures" with "The King and I." Both "Assassins" and "Carousel" open in the outlaw world of the fairground. Mr. Sondheim's characterization of assassins like Leon Czolgosz and Giuseppe Zangara as have-nots driven to crime by a corrupt economic system recalls not just his own Sweeney Todd but also his mentor's conception of Billy Bigelow.
Yet the difference in sensibility between Hammerstein and his creative heir is as vast as that separating the innocent pre-Kennedy-assassination America from the cynical country that came after. In "Assassins," the killers are freaks, grotesque specimens to be catalogued and studied from a clinical distance. At "Carousel," at least in the National's magical rendition, the audience is transported back to a time when America believed that even its bad guys could be redeemed in a tearful and forgiving embrace.

The Knicks Are Ewing's Team Now

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
NO matter what the sport, the popular cliche word is "intensity." But that's simply a synonym for being in the game beyond the game, for being in the game emotionally, almost spiritually. And as the Knicks roar along in first place in the Atlantic Division, nobody is in the game more emotionally than Patrick Ewing.
It's as if the Knicks were his team now. His responsibility. 
 During their 108-94 deflation of the Nets on Tuesday night, Ewing didn't merely score 27 points in 29 minutes. When excitable John Starks was assessed a technical foul, Ewing growled, "We don't need that," then spanked him on the posterior. When a scuffle with the Nets developed, Ewing scolded Charles Smith, then cuffed Anthony Mason as a forgiving father might.
In another crisis, Ewing spoke sternly to Starks, who touched him on the right arm. Ewing responded with a tender tap to the head.
More than any of his teammates, Ewing could be seen clapping and cajoling. By raising his level of intensity, he raised theirs.
Small moments, to be sure, but moments of subtle significance. In other seasons, Patrick Ewing never acted quite like this. He has always been intense, but not this intense. Not this emotional. Not this responsible. Asked about it, he acknowledged the difference in him.
"I've been stepping up," he said softly, "and trying to be more outspoken."
Maybe it's because Ewing realized, at age 30 and in his eighth N.B.A. season, that he is now the Knicks' elder statesman. Maybe it's because Mark Jackson, Xavier McDaniel and Gerald Wilkins are no longer around to share that responsibility. Maybe it's because he couldn't expect any of the newcomers, even 31-year-old point guard Glenn (Doc) Rivers, to take over as the Knicks' leader.
Whatever the reason, he's Big Daddy now.
"All the little things that Patrick does, that's my biggest surprise coming here," said Rivers, acquired from the Los Angeles Clippers in the Mark Jackson trade. "Patrick is a superstar, but he's the first guy on the court at practice. He dives for loose balls in practice. He yells at us at practice. When you see the best player on the team practicing hard, everybody else has to practice hard."
Even on the team bus Ewing is now Big Daddy.
"We'll be going to a game," Rivers said, "and some guys will be talking about this or that but then you'll hear Patrick saying, 'Let's think about the game.' The only way you can lead is with your best player."
Around the N.B.A., the Chicago Bulls are Michael Jordan's team. Just as the Los Angeles Lakers were Magic Johnson's team and the Boston Celtics were Larry Bird's team. Now the Knicks are Patrick Ewing's team.
Asked why, Rivers smiled.
"Patrick sees it," he said.
Patrick sees the ring, the N.B.A. championship that a Knicks team hasn't won since 1973. Sometime late next season the 7-foot center will pass Walt Frazier as the Knicks' career scoring leader. But unless Ewing's team wins the N.B.A. title, Ewing will never attain the stature that Frazier, Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, Earl Monroe and Dick Barnett did in winning the 1970 and 1973 championships.
To win the N.B.A. playoffs, a team needs every edge, especially the home-court edge.
With a 14-7 record, the Knicks hold a three-game lead on the second-place Nets. But winning the Atlantic Division isn't enough. If the Knicks are to hold the home-court advantage in the Eastern Conference playoffs, their season won-lost record must be better than that of the Bulls. In the Eastern Conference finals last May, remember, the Knicks extended the Bulls to seven games, but lost that seventh game in Chicago Stadium.
If the Knicks are to produce the best won-lost record in their conference, they must improve their record on the road. Even with their Tuesday night triumph at Byrne Meadowlands Arena, they are only 3-6 on the road, in contrast to 11-1 at Madison Square Garden.
That's why tomorrow night's game with the Celtics in the Boston Garden is more important than the standings might show.
The Knicks have lost 23 consecutive regular-season games in the Boston Garden but the Celtics, in their first season without Larry Bird, have been struggling under the .500 mark. If the Knicks want that home-court advantage throughout the Eastern Conference playoffs, they need to win on the road. Just as they won Tuesday night on the road, even if the road was the New Jersey Turnpike.
All the good N.B.A. teams win at home. Winning on the road is how a good team turns onto the road to the championship.

HEADLINE: United Way: Leaner and Needier

 BODY:
All charities are squeezed this year by the recession. Past donors are now in food lines themselves. For annual United Way campaigns now under way, there's also the lingering taint of last winter's scandal at the United Way of America -- a threat because United Ways are collectively the nation's largest fund-raisers.
The scandal did some good. Financial abuses at the United Way of America have been halted. New management is in place. And some rusty old habits are being discarded. 
 United Ways raise some $3 billion a year. Two-thirds of the 2,100 locals are members of the United Way of America, a separate organization that provides fund-raising services. Pre-scandal, members' dues were one cent of each dollar raised. Now, locals pay only for services they use.
Elaine Chao, formerly director of the Peace Corps, has replaced the profligate president of the national agency who was ousted in February, and local units now have one-third of the seats on the board of directors; they had none before, even though they do all the fund-raising.
The scandal also spotlighted longstanding criticism of United Way exclusiveness -- a crucial issue because United Ways have a virtual lock on soliciting in offices and factories.
While the member locals help a huge spectrum of health and human services agencies, they leave out other popular causes, such as the environment. What's more, most United Ways don't finance some controversial human services like Planned Parenthood.
This is changing, for the better. More and more locals, including New York City's, let donors say how they want their money spent -- even for causes the United Way doesn't support.
The image of United Way as an arm of the Establishment is out of date. In New York City alone it supports more than 600 charities, large and small, for neighborhoods, minorities and the city at large. It helps everyone. It needs help.

HEADLINE: Choosing Wars of Conscience

 BODY:
President Bush, in a valedictory mood, told a Texas audience on Tuesday that despite its victory in the cold war against Communism, America must be prepared to wage lesser wars to secure global stability. Don't abandon countries like Somalia when disaster strikes, he pleaded, and be prepared to intervene when the stakes "warrant" and where limited force can be effective.
On the need to respond, Mr. Bush speaks for his country. Two of three Americans think Washington has a responsibility to provide military assistance in troubled regions. Moreover, according to a new New York Times/CBS News Poll, most people accept that Americans will have to remain in Somalia from three to six months or longer. 
 These findings speak well for American hearts, and heads. Yet what about other potential crises, where the humanitarian needs may be equally compelling but the military risks far greater? Mr. Bush's criteria need sharpening. He has never really explained how Somalia differs, for example, from Bosnia, where Serbian aggressors unleash armed gangs to prey on unarmed civilians.
Put simply, when and why do you call out the cavalry? Obviously, to defend frontiers or to assure domestic tranquillity. Obviously, also, to protect U.S. territory and people.
Vital national interests abroad may also require a military response -- real threats to sources of energy or other economic assets, or to the survival of a strategic ally threatened by attack.
Other cases are discretionary: threats to geographically or otherwise important countries whose security becomes a test of strategic resolve. Bosnia is a clear example, since its extinction as a sovereign state would resonate from the Balkans to the Baltic, or wherever ethnic strife rends new nations.
The trickiest questions involve countries where there is no vital U.S. interest. That includes much of South and Central Asia, and most of Africa. Here Mr. Bush's vague tests are of little help. Do the stakes "warrant" armed intervention, for example, in the Sudan and Liberia?
In all these cases there is a humanitarian duty if intervention is feasible and can save lives. But for the U.S. to follow repeatedly the Somalia precedent would tax its resources, undermine domestic support and smack of imperial vainglory. And as Mr. Bush himself suggested in Texas, it is simply untrue that the U.S. alone has the capacity to act.
Even so, Mr. Bush's preoccupation with America's duty places far too great a burden on Americans -- and far too little on multilateral agencies like the U.N. When the burden is humanitarian, the U.N. is the better approximation of humanity. In that case, shouldn't Washington as a normal matter meet its humanitarian duties through, rather than for, the U.N.?
Washington's leadership may be indispensable, and Americans might well command and provide the largest contribution to a humanitarian operation. But to assure the broadest participation, the commander ought to be under the direct authority of the Security Council -- where the U.S. veto offers the best means of safeguarding the interests of U.S. troops.
If those are the markers, here are the principles: U.S. forces should be deployed only as a last resort, and in support of a clearly articulated political objective. If the U.S. interest is "humanitarian," then by definition Americans should act in concert with others. And in all cases, the Constitution requires the assent of Congress, while the fullest public debate is simple prudence.
Sometimes Mr. Bush has been long on zeal, short on careful, disciplined justifications for the use of American forces. May President-elect Clinton do better.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Kozyrev's Wake-up Slap

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In his 1938 radio broadcast of "War of the Worlds," Orson Welles never sought to spread global panic. But the prewar world was skittish; millions treated the real-sounding broadcast as frightening news.
In the first part of his 1992 speech to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev's clear intent was to wake up his countrymen and the world to the threat now before us. But his dramatic warning in Stockholm is being shrugged off as a bad joke, a sophomoric hoax. 
 What Kozyrev did was to play the role of the next Russian foreign minister -- the one who might represent a government that has brushed aside Boris Yeltsin and the democratic reformers. Without copping out with "Here comes a fictional scenario," the 41-year old diplomat shook up the closed-door assemblage with a peek at Cold War II.
A new Iron Curtain? "Our traditions are . . . in Asia and this sets limits to our rapprochement with Europe." The ironic portion of his speech saw Western groups ominously "strengthening their military position in the Baltic States. . . ."
Cooperation turning to mischief-making in defusing the violence in the Balkans? "The present Government of Serbia can count on the support of great Russia," said the "next" Foreign Minister of Russia.
War with newly independent Ukraine? "We will firmly insist that former Soviet Republics immediately join a new federation or confederation."
That sat 'em up, all right. For the first time, today's diplomats -- drawn up in vast, cumbrous array -- were forced to stop taking incipient Russian democracy for granted. Could he be serious?
If so, the dreams of a peaceful world order would be shattered. Defense budgets would have to be increased; military aid would be needed to new nations being coerced. All the optimistic assumptions now being made in each nation's economic planning would have to be scrapped.
After an hour to let that grim prospect sink in (during which wire service editors wisely withheld the story to authenticate it), Kozyrev came back to the rostrum, explained "this was just a technique aimed to show the threat of a turn of events" and proceeded to make the forward-looking speech of a Yeltsinite Russian.
Of course, the real speech was the opposite of the fictional nightmare. He urged the C.S.C.E. to "fight for equal rights for ethnic minorities" without the use of force; to impose international sanctions on Serbia if it did not stop its war; to help the Baltic States and Russia build accommodations for Russian soldiers to be pulled out of the free countries still occupied.
It was a historic performance. What the young man did was to slap the world's diplomats in the face and say: Wake up! Stop being so damnably complacent. To avert a return to a divided world, help us now.
His plea was met with a wave of grumpiness by the diplomats and a fit of petulance by the press. How dare he shake us up that way; Kozyrev's attention-grabbing first act was an act of desperation.
But that's just it: Yeltsin and the democratic reformers are realistically desperate. The world does need a wake-up call.
The reactionaries in Moscow are determined to stop the march to private property and a free market. Under the guise of centrism, in the sweet song of go-slow pragmatism, the old apparatchiks are trying to snatch "their" country back.
One by one, the reformers are being tossed from the sled by the embattled Yeltsin, but the wolves of Civic Union are not satisfied. (A bloody Siberian metaphor is suitable here, though it is not intended as a slur on an endangered species.) The replacement Prime Minister, a bureaucrat-industrialist whose name is too close to Chernobyl, is already deriding "a nation of shopkeepers," a phrase used by a foolish Napoleon to derogate England's free economy.
Shopkeepers and private farmers are what Russia urgently needs, not heavy-industry commanders like Mr. Chernomyrdin. Yeltsin's compromises are steps backward aimed at buying time to go to the people in a referendum to rewrite the Constitution, thereby removing the dead hand of central control.
No stunting going on in Little Rock is more important to the job future of Americans than the reformers' success in Moscow. To Kozyrev's wake-up slap, the West's diplomats should reply: Thanks, we needed that.

HEADLINE: Prison Problem Still Starts on Poverty Street

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Inmate Riddle, and Its Moral" (editorial, Nov. 29), you note a "startling contradiction" uncovered by a study conducted by the National Research Council: The rate of imprisonment is way up; yet the violent crime rate has not dropped.
You conclude that locking up more and more offenders for longer periods is not the solution to the crime problem. The real answer is to stop crime before there's any need to send someone to prison, you declare. You recommend deploying more police officers; making drug treatment available to all addicts who need it, and controlling criminals in ways other than incarceration, for instance through education and work programs as conditions of probation. 
 But a genuinely preventive approach is absent from your anticrime platform. You do not even mention a consistent finding of criminological research: that the harsh social conditions on the mean streets of urban America actually provide incentives for the murders, drug dealing, robberies, carjackings, auto thefts and burglaries committed disproportionately by the poor young men who grow up there.
Really fighting crime means tackling the deep-seated problems of demoralizing poverty, deteriorating housing and abject homelessness; of dysfunctional families, woefully insufficient child care and woefully supervised recreation; of shamefully failing schools, hard core unemployment, dead-end low-wage jobs, and inadequate physical and mental-health care.
Yes, you dismiss the "binge" in prison construction and the years of "obsessive belief" in incarceration as a panacea. But your political thrust clearly shows that more than two decades of conservative lock-'em-up law-and-order rhetoric have also taken their toll on public discourse about crime. The pragmatic neoliberal prescriptions that you offer the incoming Clinton Administration fall far short of, and indeed glaringly omit, the traditional liberal vision of using government to eradicate the social roots of crime.

HEADLINE: We Have to Retool Workers, Not Machines

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Turning Off the War Machine" by Ann Markusen, director of the Rutgers University Project on Regional and Industrial Economics (Op-Ed, Nov. 22), gives bad advice on how to do the right thing.
In today's highly competitive global economy, defense contractors are not going to be successful very often if they attempt to convert their facilities to serve civilian applications. In recent years many of America's premier companies have suffered heavy losses in their attempts to enter new business areas, even though these areas appeared to be logical extensions of their businesses. 
 As a result, most companies now resort to strategic acquisitions when entering new business areas. This is an option for defense contractors, but does little to solve the problem of what to do about work force reductions as a result of decreased orders by the military.
Better advice is contained in "Innovative Programs in California Aid Those With Outdated Skills" (front page, Nov. 27) in your "Finding What Works" series on retraining programs. There you report on California's efforts to provide defense workers who lose their jobs with opportunities to develop new skills -- and generous relocation allowances if a move is required to get a new job.
Such an approach will make economically successful and less painful a transition vital to the future of the United States.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton Picks Aspin and Ex-Governor for Cabinet

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton has chosen Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, as Secretary of Defense and Richard W. Riley, a former Governor of South Carolina, as Secretary of Education, transition and Congressional officials said today.
Mr. Aspin flew to Little Rock, Ark., today to meet with Mr. Clinton. With the expected selections of Warren M. Christopher as Secretary of State and Anthony Lake as national security adviser, Mr. Clinton hopes to conclude his major Cabinet announcements before he leaves for vacation sometime after Christmas. 
 As expected, Mr. Clinton announced in Little Rock today that he had chosen Henry G. Cisneros, the former Mayor of San Antonio, as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Jesse Brown, the director of the Disabled Veterans of America, as Secretary of Veterans' Affairs.
Although Mr. Aspin favors deeper cuts in the military budget than the Bush Administration has suggested, he is well regarded by Republicans as well as by advocates of homosexual rights who have asked Mr. Clinton to lift the ban on gay men and lesbians in the military.
Mr. Aspin's star apparently rose after Representative Dave McCurdy, an Oklahoma Democrat who advised Mr. Clinton on military affairs, campaigned too aggressively for the Pentagon post. Mr. McCurdy is considered a leading contender to head the Central Intelligence Agency.
Mr. Riley, 59 years old, was a freshman Governor with Mr. Clinton and worked with him on education initiatives in the National Governors' Association. He currently heads the Clinton transition's personnel operation, with responsibility for choosing the hundreds of sub-Cabinet appointees to fill out the Clinton Administration.
As Governor of South Carolina from 1979 to 1987, Mr. Riley earned high marks for his attention to the state's education system. He pushed through a one-cent increase in state sales tax, raising an additional $240 million a year for the schools and increasing spending on public education by 56 percent. He has worked as a lawyer in South Carolina since leaving office.
Mr. Clinton said today that he was still trying to assemble a Cabinet that represented both sexes and all races, but some women's groups have begun complaining that Mr. Clinton has so far appointed only one woman to his Cabinet. Transition aides have said Mr. Clinton is leaning toward choosing a woman as Attorney General from a list of several lawyers and judges.
Mr. Clinton's announcements today could help blunt criticism on that front. Mr. Cisneros is Mr. Clinton's first Hispanic appointee, and Mr. Brown is the second black named to his Cabinet. His next few expected appointments, including Mr. Riley, Mr. Aspin and Mr. Christopher, are white men. Former Gov. Bruce Babbit of Arizona, who is white, is expected to be named Secretary of the Interior. Representative Mike Espy of Mississippi, Mr. Clinton's leading choice for Secretary of Agriculture, is black.
John H. Trattner, a former executive assistant to Mr. Christopher when he was deputy secretary of state under President Carter, is a leading candidate for the post of deputy Secretary of State, officials close to the Clinton transition staff said today. Mr. Trattner, who is a career officer in the United States Information Agency, was an assistant secretary of state for public affairs during the Carter Administration.
Mr. Clinton appears to have decided against appointing the man who had been his first choice for Secretary of Energy, Senator Timothy E. Wirth of Colorado. Transition aides confirmed that Mr. Clinton had grown worried about reports that Mr. Wirth had ties to the savings and loan industry in his home state that would be difficult to explain in confirmation hearings.
Mr. Clinton stressed today, however, that none of the people he considered his first choices for jobs in his Administration had been dropped because of irregularities discovered in background checks.
 
Clinton Choices Praised
 Veterans groups and urban officials praised Mr. Clinton's selections of Mr. Brown and Mr. Cisneros today.
Representative G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery of Mississippi, the chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said Mr. Brown "brings to the job essential perspective, understanding and sensitivity." Mr. Brown's right arm was partly paralyzed by a gunshot wound he received in 1965 while serving in the Marines near Da Nang.
Thomas Cochran, executive director of the United States Conference of Mayors, said the appointment of Mr. Cisneros was being read as "a signal we will have a voice within the inner sanctum of the White House that is different from what we have had over the last 12 years."
Mr. Clinton said today that Mr. Cisneros, Mr. Brown and Herschel Gober, whom he named deputy secretary for veterans affairs, "have lived the issues they will now address in the Government."
 
Federal Role in Cities
 In praising Mr. Cisneros today, Mr. Clinton also sounded remarkably like outgoing H.U.D. Secretary Jack F. Kemp, who frequently called for a revitalized Government role in urban affairs.
"He knew that the answer to his city's problems was not in Government spending along," Mr. Clinton said of Mr. Cisneros. "But also in aggressive economic-development efforts that brought businesses and communities together."
In appointing Mr. Brown, Mr. Clinton chose an advocate for veterans and charged him with rebuilding a health-care network and veterans-support system that the President-elect said "has acted callously towards those whom it is supposed to serve."
Mr. Cisneros sounded a somber note during his remarks today, making special note of the riots in Los Angeles that caused much destruction and death last spring.
"I sense that we have limited time for America," Mr. Cisneros said. "That we cannot talk about the economy and not talk about our cities and towns, about the poor of all races."
Mr. Cisneros continued: "It breaks my heart every time I'm in a meeting and hear people talk about writing off neighborhoods or entire cities or, worst of all, a generation of our youth."
Mr. Clinton said he was not concerned that any of the people he has named to his cabinet so far will run into opposition from unhappy and combative Republicans during confirmation hearings in the Senate.
He said that he expected the hearings to be "rigorous" and "within bounds" and that he hoped his nominees would be "treated fairly and appropriately."
"And I think if they go beyond the pale, the American people will have a judgement about that," he said.

HEADLINE: Neediest Cases Fund Aids A Woman Without a Job

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Patricia K.'s life began to crumble on a sunny day in the spring of 1990. She was sitting in her daughter's home on Long Island when the phone rang. On the other end of the line was her former husband, who had abandoned her and their children 42 years before and had not been heard from since.
She was stunned and overwhelmed, as if she had been contacted by a man who had been long dead and buried. Then her relationship with her children collapsed because she was angered that they wanted to meet him. Last spring, she fell into a deep depression that kept her from working as a nurse and led to an eviction notice from her apartment in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. 
 "One morning, I remember eating a half a box of chocolate doughnuts," said 65-year-old Patricia K. "I wouldn't go out. I just kept eating and eating and eating. Then when I started going out, I started getting panic attacks. It came to a head in March when I had a panic attack and I actually thought I would die."
Alienated from her children, she finally turned for help to Sister Mary Rose Galloy, a social worker at Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, one of seven charities aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Sister Mary Rose started calling and visiting Patricia regularly at her apartment to break through her isolation.
Sister Mary Rose discovered that Patricia had very little money for her expenses because she was living on a monthly Social Security check of $504 and paying $460 a month in rent. So Catholic Charities gave her a grant from the Neediest Cases fund for food, clothes, rent and medication for depression and a heart ailment.
Since the early years of this century, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has helped rescue people from often unbearable situations. This year's campaign, the 81st, comes amid a recession that has heaped added burdens on charities in New York City. Many are trying to aid growing numbers of the newly unemployed while also caring for people like Patricia
The Times pays for the fund's overhead, so all contributions are given directly to the seven charities, which must rely more and more on private donations because of strained budgets and reduced government assistance.
Patricia has slowly overcome her fear of leaving her apartment and her mood has brightened. She is no longer eating compulsively and has lost 45 pounds. Catholic Charities is helping her find special subsidized housing for the elderly.
"If you had seen me in March or April or May, you wouldn't know it was the same person you're talking to now," she said. "Sister Mary Rose has been my staying power. Her moral support has been incomparable. I don't know what I would have done without her."
Now that she feels more in control, she wants to return to work part-time and patch up her relationship with her children.
"It was like being in a dark, slippery pit coming out of this," she said. "Every time I took one step out, I slipped back two steps. I couldn't have done it without Sister Mary Rose. But now I know I can do this. I know I can get out of this hole."

HEADLINE: 'Santa' Letter Rouses Sympathy, Then Doubt

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 17

 BODY:
A letter to Santa, signed "Thad," in which a boy asks that he be taken to heaven to save his unemployed parents money, has led to an outpouring of support. But two handwriting analysts say the letter does not appear to have been written by a child.
The analysts, who were selected from a telephone book by The Associated Press, both said they were not flatly calling the letter a hoax, although they had serious doubts. 
 The writing includes a mixture of capital and lower-case letters of several styles, including some that look like a cursive script, the analysts said. It is not likely that a child would use a mix of letter styles. Both analysts said they are certified to testify in court about forgeries.
In the letter Thad asks for food for his mother and a job for his father. "Can you bring me too heven?," the letter asks. "Mom and dad would not have to by things for me no more. That would make them happy.
"We got candils. A city man took the lights a way. It looks like we don't live heer no more. We do."
Liz Zenovian, evidence officer for the Police Department in Port Angeles, a depressed timber town 63 miles northwest of Seattle, said today that the authorities still believe the letter is genuine.

HEADLINE: Council Approves Trump's Plan For Apartments on the West Side

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Donald J. Trump's huge residential project along the Hudson River on Manhattan's West Side won final approval last night from the City Council. But with a continuing recession and a deep real-estate slump in New York, there were doubts that anything would be built soon.
The $3 billion project is by far the most ambitious and expensive development approved by the Council since it assumed land-use power from the old Board of Estimate, which was abolished two years ago under a new City Charter. The vote was 42 to 8, with one member absent. 
 Council opponents said they doubted whether Mr. Trump would ever attract financing for the project, given the economy and his nearly $2 billion in debt from his Manhattan real-estate holdings and Atlantic City gambling casino investments.
"I waited and waited and then built in 1975 when the market was very weak, and I can do it again," Mr. Trump said outside the Council chamber last night. Under conditions of the Council vote, Mr. Trump has a six-and-a-half-year deadline to begin construction.
But Mr. Trump said he hoped to begin construction next year and build what he said would be a cornerstone apartment building at Riverside Drive and West 72d Street. He said the building would reflect the turn-of-the-century architecture of a number of famous West Side apartment buildings.
Even without beginning construction, the property, now valued at $85 million, increased in value with yesterday's Council approval.
Referring to that increase in value, Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, whose West Side district includes the development and who led the opposition last night, said the Council's approval would help bail out Chase Manhattan Bank, which she said has invested more than $213 million in Mr. Trump's plans for the site.
Ms. Eldridge said that Mr. Trump could now sell off choice pieces of the development so he could repay Chase Manhattan "and bail out Donald Trump."
Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Queens, who represented political support for the project elsewhere in the city, said it would provide construction and jobs at a time when when the prevailing attitude in the city "is that it's all downhill."
Extending along the Hudson from West 59th to 72d Street and east to West End Avenue, the project would replace the old Penn Rail Yards with 16 apartment buildings of from 18 to 49 floors housing a total of 10,000 residents. There also would be a 21.5-acre park. A 1.8-million-square-foot film and television studio was previously eliminated from the plan.

HEADLINE: Settling Question of Statehood Tops Agenda of New Puerto Rico Governor

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R.

 BODY:
Eager to resolve their political status and economic future, Puerto Ricans last month elected a governor who promised to be "a new leader for a new beginning." But when Pedro Rossello takes office in early January, he will have to grapple immediately with many of the same problems that have bedeviled his predecessors.
As has been the case for the last 50 years, Puerto Ricans are divided about which relationship they prefer with the rest of the United States: statehood, independence or a continuation of the island's commonwealth status. Mr. Rossello and the pro-statehood New Progressive Party have raised the stakes of that debate by pledging to hold a plebiscite on the issue in 1993. 
 And despite four decades of efforts by administrations both here and in Washington to improve the island's economy, the gap in living standards between Puerto Rico and the mainland remains wide. Mr. Rossello (pronounced roh-say-YO), a 48-year-old physician educated at Notre Dame and Yale, convinced voters he can deliver universal health-insurance and school-voucher programs more advanced than anything in the 50 states.
 
Restoring Official English
 Some of the changes Dr. Rossello has promised will be easier to implement. He has vowed to restore English as an official language of government, reversing the Spanish-only policy implemented last year by Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon of the Popular Democratic Party. The adoption of Spanish as the principal language was part of a larger effort to emphasize economic and cultural ties with Latin America and Spain. Dr. Rossello has promised to focus new attention on Puerto Rico's ties with the United States.
The new governor said he also planned to close the commonwealth's Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs in New York, a proposal that has generated controversy. Puerto Ricans in New York have traditionally looked to the agency as their link to the island, but Dr. Rossello considers the office a colonial vestige whose $6 million yearly budget would be better spent here.
The new governor's political future is likely to rest largely on his ability to guide the island toward statehood, and he will begin that quest armed with a sweeping victory over the Popular Democratic Party, which favors commonwealth status.
Voters gave his New Progressive Party strong majorities in both houses of the island's Legislature and control of most municipalities and of the commonwealth's nonvoting seat in Congress. The Puerto Rican Independence Party received only about three percent of the vote and is not regarded as having wide influence.
Dr. Rossello's opponents have criticized his plebiscite proposal as nothing but a beauty contest. Before voters here cast ballots, they argue, Congress should set out the terms and conditions under which the island would be admitted to the union, so that the choice is clear. Failing that, the opponents say they may not participate, and they may urge others not to take part.
The Bush Administration endorses statehood, but Congress has failed to reach a consensus on the issue. Under the island's commonwealth status, Puerto Ricans living here do not have the right to vote in Federal elections but also do not pay Federal taxes, and the island's government is able to offer companies investment and tax incentives not available on the mainland.
Statehood would give Puerto Rico full representation in Congress and the right to vote for President, but it would end the business incentives and would require residents to pay Federal taxes. Other issues, including the island's official language and its right to field an Olympics team, would probably also be affected by statehood.
In addition, the impact of the new North American Free Trade Agreement on Puerto Rico is likely to emerge as a sticking point in negotiations over statehood. Mexico's wages are only a quarter of Puerto Rico's, and there is fear here that companies attracted to the island for its business incentives will shift plants and employment south of the border for cheap labor unless Washington takes action to help Puerto Rico compete.
"I can't rule out the possibility of a boycott," Senator Victoria Munoz Mendoza, head of the pro-commonwealth party and Dr. Rossello's opponent in last month's election, said of the plebiscite. "It all depends on whether the rules of the game are fair and what the definitions are."
Dr. Rossello responded: "Every party will be able to campaign for its point of view. Our promise is that the people will be able to express their will, and that once they have done that, we will do everything necessary so that Congress responds to the voice of the people of Puerto Rico."
 
A Message to Washington
 Commonwealth supporters like Mr. Hernandez Colon acknowledge that "it's possible, but not probable, that statehood could get 52 percent in a plebiscite." But the outgoing Governor, like other party leaders, also says it is "totally impossible to obtain the kind of resounding vote needed to get Congress to take statehood seriously."
Dr. Rossello disagrees that a two-thirds or three-quarters majority is needed to persuade Washington. "If we go to Congress with one voice and one mandate, then Congress has to react in recognition that the world has changed, and that there is international pressure calling for an end to all colonial governments," he said.
 
Voters Sought Change
 Local issues aside, the mood of voters here, like that on the mainland, was marked by anti-incumbency sentiment. Many voters faulted Mr. Hernandez Colon for attending too many conferences abroad during eight years in office, while paying scant attention to economic and social problems.
"People wanted a change, and we didn't represent it," Ms. Munoz said. "They voted against the incumbents."
As a pediatric surgeon and father of three whose wife, Irma, has been trained as a social worker, Dr. Rossello benefited from that sentiment. During the campaign, he focused on his familiarity with health and education issues, arguing that the island's state-owned hospitals should be leased to private groups and that the best way to improve public schools was to force them to compete with private schools.
Dr. Rossello said his administration's goal would be "a new model of health care" that guaranteed universal access to "a single insurance system," with the government acting as broker. Opposition leaders say that plan will cost billions of dollars, rather than the $800 million Dr. Rossello has estimated, but the incoming Governor said "the money is there" and the only question is one of will.
Though it was Dr. Rossello's definition of the issues that captured attention, analysts said it was his message of youth and change that won their votes.
"I voted for Rossello above all because he is not a politician," said Fernando Tovar, a 37-year-old insurance salesman. "The professional politicians have given us nothing but bad government. I think a doctor like him has a stronger humanitarian sense and is more aware of what Puerto Ricans have suffered and need."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Last Junket to Russia Is Called Off

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The Commerce Department announced this evening that it had canceled a trip to Russia at Government expense, planned for shortly before the inauguration of President-elect Bill Clinton.
Douglas E. Lavin, the Acting Assistant Secretary of Commerce for export enforcement, said the plans were dropped after an article in The New York Times today described them and reported that the United States Embassy in Moscow had tried to discourage the trip as unnecessary. 
 The article made "a lot of people" in the Bush Administration decide that the trip should not be made, he said.
Joan M. McEntee, the Acting Under Secretary of Commerce for export administration, was to have headed the delegation, which had a vague agenda of talks on the conversion of Russian military factories to civilian production. Ms. McEntee is now in China with about two dozen other political appointees, and she met last month with Russian officials in Paris.
Mr. Lavin said today that a detailed agenda for the Moscow trip had not been worked out because the planning never got beyond the early stages.
He also emphasized the discomforts that people on the trip might have faced. He said that the officials would have flown to Russia and back in economy class on a commercial airliner, and that a planned train trip from Moscow to St. Petersburg would have cost $15 or less per person because of the low value of the ruble.
Two career officials of the Commerce Department officials would have accompanied political appointees, Mr. Lavin said.
Many career officials who worked on the department's recent report on Russian military conversion would not have gone on the trip, he said, but this was necessary to hold down the cost.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: Clinton Selects Ex-Mayor for H.U.D. and an Ex-Marine for Veterans Affairs;
Cisneros Achieves Career Comeback With Nomination

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
In the spring of 1989, as he prepared to leave the San Antonio mayor's office still bruised by disclosures of an extra-marital affair, Henry G. Cisneros looked to the future with subdued confidence, reminding a reporter that he would only be 53 years old at the turn of the century.
"History has a rhythm," he said at the time, reflecting on a career that had seemed headed for statewide or even national office before it was suddenly derailed. Not content to let history take its course, Mr. Cisneros set out with methodical zeal to resuscitate his personal and professional prospects. 
 In the last three and a half years Mr. Cisneros stepped back from the brink of divorce to reconcile with his wife, Mary Alice. He built a new career as an assets manager. He remained in the public eye with a relentless schedule of speeches and television appearances. And he extended his political capital by working hard for a few carefully selected candidates, including Bill Clinton.
 
Completing a Comeback
 Today, at 45 years of age, Mr. Cisneros completed his comeback when President-elect Clinton announced his nomination as Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Several friends who spoke to Mr. Cisneros shortly before today's announcement described his reaction at least in part as one of great relief. "He's the happiest man in America; it's like a great burden has been lifted from him," said George Shipley, an Austin, Tex., political consultant who is a longtime adviser to Mr. Cisneros.
Mr. Cisneros never left any doubt that he wanted to re-enter public life after he decided not to seek re-election to a fifth term, but friends and associates said he has never quite been certain when and how he would do it.
Then, in the last few weeks he was suddenly obliged to agonize over two possibilities. Even as his name was being mentioned for a Cabinet position, he became a likely candidate to run for the Senate seat Lloyd Bentsen is vacating to become Treasury Secretary. Despite the fact that many Texas Democrats were pressuring him to enter the race, last Sunday he called Gov. Ann W. Richards, who must name Senator Bentsen's replacement, to remove himself from the running.
 
Fascinated by Public Policy
 "I was very disappointed he chose not to run for the Senate because he had a good chance to emerge as a consensus candidate among the Democrats, but I wasn't surprised," said State Senator Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat. "Henry is very genuinely concerned about his family, but beyond that he saw an opportunity to help shape urban policy all over the country and decided it was in the world of policy, not politics, that he could best be of service."
Like Mr. Clinton, public policy fascinates Mr. Cisneros. Even while out of public office, he has been deeply involved with issues like teaching computer literacy in schools and improving the availability of credit to businesses in the inner cities.
A tall, athletic figure, Mr. Cisneros has proven abilities to translate his policy concerns into charismatic speeches. Having maintained his position as political leader of national repute despite his personal problems, he goes to Washington positioned to increase his standing a great deal.
"The cities and finding solutions to their problems are what really excite Henry," said Larry Macon, a lawyer in San Antonio, "and at this stage in his life he is ready and able to step forward as a high-profile spokesman on urban issues."
Henry Gabriel Cisneros was born in San Antonio on June 11, 1947. His father, George, was a civil servant. His mother, Elvira, was the daughter of a Mexican immigrant who owned a print shop in San Antonio.
Mr. Cisneros was raised in a tree-shaded neighborhood of clapboard homes. In 1968 he graduated from Texas A&M University as a member of the staunchly conservative, all male Corps of Cadets, having become the first Mexican-American commander of the Aggie band.
After earning masters degrees in urban affairs at Texas and at Harvard University he went on to get a doctorate in public administration at George Washington University in 1976.
Even before he had finished his doctoral work, Mr. Cisneros entered politics and won election to the San Antonio City Council in 1975 at a time when the city's growing Hispanic population was beginning to challenge the white business establishment that had long dominated City Hall.
Protests by Hispanic groups were regularly disrupting Council meetings when Mr. Cisneros was elected Mayor in 1981. A moderate, who maintained close ties to business leaders, Mr. Cisneros became a bridge between the city's increasingly assertive Mexican-Americans and its traditional power brokers.
During his eight years as mayor the city grew in stature, finally moving out of the shadows cast by Houston and Dallas to become a major business center in Texas. Mr. Cisneros aggressively courted corporations that were considering moves to San Antonio and oversaw a variety of large infrastructure projects.
Eventually gaining a reputation as brick and mortar mayor, he alienated some Hispanic groups who criticized him for focusing on big, splashy programs, like the Alamo Dome stadium now nearing completion, rather than efforts to improve life in poor and working-class neighborhoods.
After winning re-election in 1987 with 67 percent of the vote, Mr. Cisneros seemed like he could be Mayor for life or until he decided to run for higher office. But by the summer of 1988, San Antonio was swirling with rumors about the Mayor's private life.
On Sept. 12, 1988, Mr. Cisneros announced he would not seek re-election to the $5,000-a-year mayor's post the following year because he needed to tend to his family's financial concerns. His son, John Paul, required expensive medical treatments for congenital heart defects.
But, a month later after rumors of infidelity had made the local press, Mr. Cisneros was obliged to admit that he had been having an affair with Linda Medlar, who had worked on his political campaigns.
Seemingly undaunted by the public ordeal Mr. Cisneros set about building a new life. In June, 1989 he opened the Cisneros Assets Management Company, an investment firm based in Houston.
Even if he serves in a Clinton Administration for two terms, Mr. Cisneros will still be a relatively young man. People who have watched his career believe he is still planning for the long term.
"No one who knows Henry thinks that being H.U.D. Secretary is the last thing he is going to do," Mr. Macon said.

HEADLINE: British Air's World Is Growing

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
British Airways P.L.C. took another big step in its quest to become a global airline today by taking a 25 percent stake in Qantas, the Australian national carrier.
The Australian Government selected a $450 million bid from British Airways over a bid of undisclosed size from Singapore Airlines for the stake in Qantas, which the Government is selling in stages to private investors. 
 The selection came as regulators in the United States prepared to rule on whether the British carrier should be allowed to proceed with the centerpiece of its international strategy -- its proposed deal to acquire 44 percent of the USAir Group.
The deal with USAir, which must overcome strong objections from American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, would give British Airways the largest presence in the United States of any foreign airline. There has been growing speculation that the Bush Administration will reject the deal, though British Airways said today that it remained optimistic.
 
USAir Ruling Expected Soon
 Prime Minister John Major will meet with President Bush this weekend at Camp David, and British officials said he would push for approval of the USAir deal and for a related plan to allow carriers from the United States more flights to a greater number of cities in Britain. The United States Transportation Department has said it will rule on the deal, which could eventually cost British Airways up to $1.35 billion, before Christmas.
Even without the USAir link, British Airways has made a series of investments in the last year that gives it a presence in many of the world's largest airline markets and arguably give it greater reach and influence around the world than any of its competitors.
Air traffic worldwide has been depressed for several years by a combination of factors, including the Persian Gulf crisis and recession or economic slowdown in all of the big industrial countries. Moreover, it remains unclear how successful British Airways will be in taking advantage of its links to other carriers. Similar partnerships by other big airlines, notably between Northwest Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, have so far yielded few benefits.
Still, British Airways executives said global alliances should give the company a chance to profit from long-term increases in air traffic around the world. They said the deals would also provide opportunities to cooperate in feeding passengers from British Airways to its partner airlines and vice versa and to cut costs and generate additional business by meshing marketing, maintenance and other operations.
On Wednesday, French authorities gave the go-ahead for British Airways to buy a 49.9 percent stake in TAT European Airways, which serves 52 cities, primarily in France, for $108 million. British Airways also has an option to purchase the rest of the company in 1997, when European Community laws on foreign ownership of airlines will be liberalized.
Earlier this year, British Airways set up a regional airline in Germany, Deutsche BA, with three German banks, and took a 49 percent stake. With the deals in both France and Germany, British Airways is preparing for a gradual opening of the airline industry in Europe to greater competition under the European Community's single-market program and to gain an advantage over the national carriers in those nations, Air France and Lufthansa.
British Airways is also working with Aeroflot in Russia to create a new Moscow-based airline, Air Russia, that could be flying to Europe as early as next summer and to the United States and Asia within a few years.
 
Move to Privatize
 British Airways bid for the stake in Qantas as part of the Australian Government's plan to privatize the airline. The other 75 percent of Qantas is to be sold to the public by the Australian Government next year.
The link with Qantas gives British Airways a toehold in the rapidly growing South Pacific market, including routes between Australia and Hong Kong, Tokyo and the United States. British Airways executives said they would also be able to reduce costs for both airlines by merging some of their operations.
"It is an alliance that will create opportunity for competitive growth and expansion on a level previously unavailable to either airline," Sir Colin Marshall, British Airways' chief executive, said in a statement.
Under the terms of the deal, which still faces various regulatory approvals, British Airways would receive three seats on a reconstituted 12-member Qantas board. Qantas management would remain in place. But the companies would set up a committee to coordinate their activities and would develop a formal 10-year agreement to govern the cooperative ventures they develop.
Qantas, which is profitable, merged earlier this year with Australia's internal domestic carrier, Australian Airlines, which was losing money. As part of the deal with British Airways, and in preparation for the public sale of the rest of the carrier's shares, the Australian Government agreed to inject $925 million in additional capital into Qantas, more than doubling its net worth.

HEADLINE: Damage in New York State From Recent Storm Put at $234 Million

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
New York State officials yesterday increased the preliminary damage assessment from last week's storm to $234 million as emergency assistance workers for the White House to approve Federal disaster relief for New York and New Jersey. President Bush declared three counties in Connecticut eligible for Federal assistance yesterday.
A Presidential declaration of disaster is required before the Federal Emergency Management Agency opens telephone lines and centers to take applications for assistance. 
 No new flooding was reported following the half-inch of rain that fell on the metropolitan area yesterday, as communities continued to dry out.
Experts on insurance and taxes offered the following advice:
 
Insurance Claims
 A standard homeowner's policy covers damage to a structure and its contents from wind, fire and other occurrences but not rising flood water, and most policies pay "reasonable" costs of temporary shelter, food and clothing if a house is uninhabitable. If rain or water enters a structure as a result of wind damage -- a roof blown away, for example, or holes in walls caused by a fallen tree or flying debris -- the repairs will usually be covered. But ground and coastal flooding, which was extensive in this storm, is usually covered only by Federal flood insurance. But claims against a flood policy can usually be expedited by an adjuster representing the company that issued a homeowner's policy.
The Insurance Information Institute recommends that policy owners make temporary repairs to prevent additional damage before an adjuster can assess the damage. It suggests that policy holders videotape or photograph all damage and save receipts for temporary repairs and living arrangements. Most insurance companies will advance money for shelter, food and transportation.
The experts suggest that homeowners prepare lists of damage before an adjuster's visit. The insurance institute said most policies would cover payments for an engineer or electrician to inspect a damaged building.
Homeowners may hire professional adjusters not employed by insurance companies to help settle claims. However, such adjusters charge a commission that is a percentage of the settlement. Some unscrupulous ones inflate their estimates of what a homeowner will be able to recover, collect their fees in advance, then settle quickly with an insurer for less than promised. "If you do employ an 'adjuster for hire,' " the Florida Insurance Commission told victims of Hurricane Andrew in September, "do not pay them up front."
 
Flood Insurance
 Federal flood insurance policies contain a condition that subjects a property to local building code restrictions if there is a claim for more than 50 percent of the structure's value. In such cases, a flood-damaged house is treated like one being built; it is subject to the latest code requirements for elevation above flood lines or setbacks from high-water marks. The limitation on the claim relates to the value of a structure, not the land, and the land may represent most of the property's market value. A property worth $100,000, say, could include a house valued at $25,000 on a $75,000 parcel. In that situation, a flood claim of more than $12,500 could subject the homeowner to the 50 percent rule and require considerable expense to rebuild the house to elevate it above flood lines.
 
Fraud
 Disasters often attract unscrupulous contractors who overcharge or bilk people desperate to move back into their homes.
"We want to stress to consumers that even in their rush to make emergency repairs they should still take time to find reputable contractors and to make sure they've gotten several estimates and references," said Emma Byrne, director of the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs.
 
Taxes
 Internal Revenue Service regulations allow the deduction of casualty losses suffered in storms. A casualty loss on nonbusiness property is reduced by $100 plus 10 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. If that total is more than the loss, the taxpayer is allowed no deduction.
 
Cleaning Up
 Spoiled food and other property that represents a health threat should be disposed of and listed in insurance claims, experts say.
Officials said that occupants re-entering flooded houses or apartments should insure that electrical wiring, gas lines and appliances are safe and in good working order.
The owners of homes without power should make sure that fuses, circuit breakers and thermostats are off and appliances unplugged, officials said. After electricity is restored, fuses or circuit breakers should be turned on but homeowners should wait two hours before turning on thermostats and plugging in appliances. Power surges that can damage appliances may be common in the first hours after restoration.
 
Federal Assistance
 If the region is declared a disaster area by President Bush, Federal assistance will be made available.
If a disaster is declared, residents may apply for grants to repair their homes and for rental assistance for temporary housing. They may also get unemployment assistance and crisis counseling.
Within 24 hours of a disaster declaration by the President, officials will establish a toll-free telephone number to accept applications. Within four days, centers should be established for applications for housing, grants, loans and other relief. Claims must be verified by disaster relief personnel.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Carla A. Hills, the only economic official in President Bush's Cabinet to emerge with an enhanced reputation, has helped to forge more than four dozen free-trade agreements during nearly four years as the United States trade representative.
"You look at the economic achievements of the Bush Administration, and most of them lie on her doorstep," said Jeffrey J. Schott, a trade policy expert at the Institute for International Economics here. 
 Even her critics acknowledge that with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement today and an agreement with the European Community on farm subsidies last month, she has completed more of her agenda than her Cabinet colleagues. Their criticism is not so much of her, but of the Administration's agenda.
"She has been effective at the tasks that the Bush Administration expected her to carry out," said Robert A. Blecker, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research center with ties to Democrats and organized labor and that advocates a more confrontational trade policy. "In a number of areas, the Nafta and probably the GATT, she tends to assert wildly optimistic predictions of what they'll do," referring to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is overseeing broad global talks on easing trade barriers.
Mrs. Hills acknowledges that she has not met all of her goals. Even the farm-subsidy agreement seems not enough to have broken the stalemate in the broader global trade talks that have been her highest priority. With France reiterating its objections this week, the broader talks under the auspices of GATT are unlikely to be completed during her tenure.
On the Japanese front, a baker's dozen of agreements have been reached to open specific Japanese industries to American exports, but many trade problems remain. The American trade deficit with Japan has narrowed only slightly during her tenure, to an estimated $46 billion or $47 billion, from $51.79 billion in 1988.
That continued gap has prompted growing enthusiasm for Government aid to exporters and industries hurt by imports, and Mr. Clinton has named an advocate of such assistance, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, to head his Council of Economic Advisers.
 Mrs. Hills contends that cutting the trade deficit is not her job, because the deficit partly reflects broad economic forces, like a slowdown in Japan's growth rate.
Instead, Mrs. Hills said, her goal has been to seek equality of opportunity in every country for business people of every nationality. "The question is, can any entrepreneur go and sell its wares in Japan with the same ease as a Japanese entrepreneur can sell his or her wares into this market?" she said. "And the answer is not yet -- but in many sectors it is true that it is open."
In Congress, with the help of prominent Democrats, including Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the choice of President-elect Bill Clinton for Secretary of the Treasury, Mrs. Hills was able to fend off renewal of so-called Super 301 legislation, which would have forced the Adminstration into a more confrontational trade policy. Last year, she won renewal of the Administration's authority to negotiate trade pacts and submit them to Congress for quick votes, no amendments allowed.
Mrs. Hills's success on Capitol Hill has three roots, members of Congress said. She has been developing contacts there ever since she served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Ford Administration and spends an extraordinary amount of time on Capitol Hill. And she has been willing to hire the proteges of Democratic lawmakers.
Asked to evaluate the Hills tenure, Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, immediately pointed to the corner of his office, where a large photo shows him dining four years ago with President-elect Bush.
During the meal, Mr. Rostenkowski said, he recommended one of his aides, Rufus Yerxa, as deputy United States trade representative with responsibility for GATT negotiations. Mrs. Hills quickly hired Mr. Yerxa and sent him to Geneva; officials of the incoming Clinton Administration say there is talk of keeping him there.
 
 
A Lecturer, Some Say
 But her style does not always sit well with some members of Congress. "A lot of my colleagues found her a lecturer," Mr. Rostenkowski said. "Instead of discourse, there was a lecture."
Another facet of Mrs. Hills's power has been her close links to President Bush, a family friend since the 1960's. Mrs. Hills's husband, Roderick M. Hills, a lawyer and former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is an occasional horseshoe partner of Mr. Bush.
 Her power also stems from her encyclopedic knowledge of trade policy and trade law, Administration officials said. It is a knowledge acquired by plowing through thick briefing books.
Mrs. Hills said her secret was skimming "a few hundred pages" each day. "I read it early in the morning and late at night," she said.
 
 
Winner of Turf Battles
 She has drawn on that information to win a series of interagency turf wars, steadily expanding her control over international economic policy. She persuaded President Bush that she -- not Robert A. Mosbacher, who was then Commerce Secretary -- should negotiate a free-trade pact with the Soviet Union. And despite occasional grumbling at the State Department, she dominated the North American talks.
"It's very difficult to undercut someone who knows their brief so well," one Administration official said.
Mrs. Hills, who will turn 59 next month, earned a bachelor's degree at Stanford and a law degree at Yale. While she says she has not thought about what she will do after leaving office, she is likely to become a sought-after corporate director. She quit six boards when she took her current post.
For all her successes, Mrs. Hills remains remarkably sensitive to even a hint of criticism.
Asked last week whether her successor should be another technocrat and lawyer, Mrs. Hills complained indignantly that neither label should be applied to her.
"Why do you want to pigeon-hole?" asked Mrs. Hills, who has not run for elective office since she won a seat on her high school's student council. "Having served as a Cabinet officer before, why don't you think of me as a politician? Why don't you? Who happens to be knowledgeable about her portfolio? Why is it either you're a technocrat or you have political sense -- why is it disjunctive and not conjunctive?"

HEADLINE: Crown Hts. Gets Offering From Mayor

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins went to Brooklyn yesterday for the second day in a row to meet with more religious and community leaders from Crown Heights in search of long-term racial and ethnic harmony. This time, the Mayor brought with him an array of relatively small initiatives intended to demonstrate what City Hall can do for the neighborhood.
The two meetings strongly suggest that the Mayor and many religious and community leaders in Brooklyn are trying to shift the debate from the broad, often bitter, accusations that have dogged Mr. Dinkins since the racial violence in August 1991 to a more specific, measured discussion on pragmatic questions of delivery of city services. 
 The Mayor and other city officials said they hoped that refocusing the discussion might demonstrate their commitment to the people of Crown Heights and help bring diverse people together.
Mr. Dinkins and nearly a dozen senior aides met in a lengthy private meeting yesterday morning at the Brooklyn Borough Hall with a coalition of about 20 black and Jewish community leaders from Crown Heights. The city officials laid out initiatives from a stepped-up police presence in the neighborhood to the reopening of a city recreation center intended to meet demands for improved city services in Crown Heights.
 
Protection and Jobs Urged
 The initiatives represented the Dinkins administration's formal response to a report issued in August by the local group, called the Crown Heights Coalition. The report came on the anniversary of the four days of unrest in 1991 that followed the death of 7-year-old Gavin Cato, who was killed by a car driven by a Lubivitcher Jew. The organization was created by Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden after the disturbance 16 months ago.
The coalition, in a report prepared by 40 educators, civic leaders and clergymen, examined the underlying social and economic causes of the violence. It recommended a host of improvements in city services in Crown Heights, including extra police protection for students walking to local schools and the creation of a major new youth employment program.
Mr. Dinkins's meeting with the coalition, which was scheduled two weeks ago, was described by some of the participants as upbeat. It followed a much more emotional and strained meeting on Wednesday between Mr. Dinkins and rabbis and other representatives of Hasidic and orthodox Jewish groups, who have been the harshest critics of the Mayor's handling of the racial violence in Crown Heights last year and its aftermath.
Mr. Dinkins spoke to reporters in the hallway of Brooklyn Borough Hall early yesterday morning while the four-hour, closed-door meeting was under way. He said that he hoped that his first, tentative meeting with the Hasidic and other orthodox Jewish representatives in Crown Heights on Wednesday would lead to detailed discussions about city services and access to City Hall similar to his meeting yesterday with the Crown Heights Coalition.
The Mayor said he was hopeful that his talks with the Jewish religious leaders would "arrive over time where this meeting is." He said he hoped to be talking soon about police matters, social services and other pragmatic issues with the Lubavitcher rabbis and other Hasidic and orthodox representatives who, until Wednesday, had avoided sitting down face to face with him to discuss their grievances.
But Mr. Dinkins, apparently in response to the rabbis' clear effort to tone down the tenor of their criticism, also said twice yesterday that he would have to respond to their concerns not only by providing specific programs but also by more broad and symbolic gestures.
Mr. Dinkins said he believed that the initiatives city officials presented to the coalition yesterday would help soothe concerns in Crown Heights. "That does not mean," he added, "that I don't have to demonstrate personally to my friends in the Jewish community that I understand the depth of pain and anguish they feel for those three or four days of disruption, rioting in August of '91. I understand that."
Among the Mayor's initiatives for Crown Heights is increasing the number of police officers assigned to the 71st precinct, which covers much of the neighborhood. Norman Steisel, the First Deputy Mayor, said that under a broad expansion of the Police Department approved last year, precincts are to reach maximum staffing levels by 1996. But the city has decided to increase the 71st precinct to its maximum next month, Mr. Steisel said.
When the expansion began, the precinct had 181 officers, said Suzanne Trazoff, a Police Department spokeswoman. It now has 246 officers, Ms. Trazoff said, and, under the Mayor's new plan, it will have 274 officers next month.
The issue of increased police protection came up yesterday at a private meeting of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and about 80 representatives of Jewish groups who met in his office at the World Trade Center. After the meeting, the Governor said that the main message of the Jewish leaders was: "We need to feel safe on the streets." Declaring that "safety is a concern of many people in the New York area, in the larger Jewish community and beyond," Mr. Cuomo said the problem was "difficult but not intractable."
Rabbi Shmuel Butman, a Lubavitcher spokesman, said he was pleased that the number of police officers would increase. "We don't feel that, for example, a basketball game with black and Jewish youth, is the answer," Rabbi Butman said. "The answer is substantial issues in the community. There has to be a feeling in this community that there is accessibility to City Hall and that City Hall cares about every citizen of this community."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
A Notable New Jersey Bond Issue

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
New Jersey sold the second-largest municipal bond issue in history yesterday and included a new type of bond product that appeared highly popular with some portfolio managers. The $1.8 billion of general obligation bonds is second only to the $2 billion issued by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority in 1987, according to the lead underwriter, Lazard Freres & Company.
The new product is a "detachable call." In effect, New Jersey is selling the ability to call, or redeem, a small portion of the bonds before they mature if interest rates decline. 
 This is only the second time this has been done. The first such sale was made with much less visibility last month by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia.
A call is the right of the issuer of a bond to buy it back after a set period of time, like 10 years. The issuer wants this right in case interest rates drop. Almost 41 percent of the $233 billion in municipal bonds expected to be issued this year have been sold so existing higher interest rate bonds could be called.
Investors and portfolio managers, however, would prefer that bonds not be callable because if bonds paying high interest are called, they usually have to substitute bonds with lower yields. But if a portfolio manager could buy a call right alone, it could be turned into a form of protection -- or hedge -- in a portfolio.
In yesterday's sale, the calls on the $86 million of bonds due in 2013 were sold separately. That means one investor bought a bond priced to yield 6.15 percent that is callable after 10 years. Then, separately, New Jersey sold the right to make this call to other investors. What these investors paid -- the equivalent of 11 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point -- lowered the overall cost for the state by bringing the effective yield down to 6.04 percent.
New Jersey ends up with a noncallable bond. That would normally be risky. If interest rates declined enough, the state would lose. But because of Treasury regulations, the state cannot use the call in these particular bonds, according to Robert Lurie, director of the office of public finance. But the third parties who bought the calls can use them.
The idea of selling the call separately is a product of several factors. One is that with interest rates very low now, some issuers may feel there is little risk in not having the right to call. And the people in the business of financial innovation argue that selling this right will save more money for the issuer than just issuing a bond without a call in it.
The reason the call can be sold for more is that some money managers would like having such calls in their portfolios, in part because they are much cheaper than buying a bond. They can use them as a hedge, to offset the risk that bonds they do own may be called. If interest rates decline enough for their other bonds to be called, they would be able to buy the New Jersey bonds and collect the 6 percent coupon.
There were two signs yesterday that there was demand for these calls from portfolio managers. First, Lazard Freres was able to raise the cost of the detachable call to 11 basis points from 10 basis points. It also increased the calls available by the raising the total of bonds with a 2013 maturity to $86 million from $68 million.
The rest of the tax-exempt bonds were priced to yield from 4.30 percent in 1996 to 6.15 in 2013. In the top tax bracket this is equivalent to yield from 6.23 percent to 8.91 percent. About $900 million of the bonds is being used to pay existing higher interest rate bonds. The rest will be used to pay interest and principal on other current bonds, something the state has never done. This frees money in the state's general funds for some capital projects.
 
Treasury Market
 Prices and yields in the Treasury market jumped up and down all day yesterday with mixed results. The price of the 30-year bond was up 4/32 , to yield 7.42 percent, down from 7.43 percent on Wednesday. But the price of the five-year Treasury note dropped 2/32 , to yield 6.04, unchanged from the day before.
The market was buffeted by a series of economic reports in light pre-holiday trading. The 22,000 increase in initial jobless claims sent prices higher and the yield on the 30-year bond dipped briefly to 7.40 percent, its lowest level since the first week in October. But then the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that its December index of regional business conditions jumped to 31.5 from 16.6 in November and a lot of the price gains were lost.

HEADLINE: Sports Betting Is Way Behind In 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
A bill that would have made New Jersey the second state in the nation to offer sports wagering in casinos suffered a setback today that was probably fatal.
The measure, openly opposed by some of the senior Republican leadership, stalled in the Assembly Appropriations Committee, making it extremely unlikely that it will reach the full Assembly for a vote this session, which ends on Jan. 12. If the measure passes, it would allow New Jersey voters to decide on the November 1993 ballot whether to permit wagering on professional and college sports at Atlantic City's 12 casinos. 
 The president of the Casino Association of New Jersey, Thomas D. Carver, said the death of the bill would cost the state as much as $14 million a year in new tax revenue and would hurt the competitiveness of the Atlantic City's 14-year-old gambling industry.
"With new casinos opening all around us, sports wagering would be the only thing that New Jersey has that is unique," Mr. Carver said.
Opposition to the bill came from many fronts: from fiscally conservative Republicans concerned that its economic impact had been inadequately studied; from professional and collegiate sports organizations worried about possible criminal influence on the outcome of games, and from groups worried that the new form of betting would increase addiction to gambling.
 
Hearing Interrupted
 The Senate approved the sports wagering bill on Monday by a 21-to-16 margin. But the legislation stalled in the Assembly today after its Republican sponsors -- Assemblyman Robert W. Singer and Senator C. Louis Bassano -- interrupted an Appropriations Committee hearing and asked that members postpone a vote on the bill.
Even as his fellow Republicans were conducting today's hearing on the legislation, Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian was meeting with reporters and telling them the bill was headed for defeat.
"It's a matter of each Assemblyman's personally voting their conscience and their district," he said, explaining why the bill was in trouble in the Assembly where the Republicans have a normally solid voting bloc.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Loves New York, And He's Explaining Why

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
When he announced almost exactly a year ago that he would not be a candidate for President, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said his greatest regret was giving up a national forum to rebut the attacks on New York being leveled by Republican politicians.
The campaign may be over, but Mr. Cuomo is still rebutting. At New York University yesterday, he kicked off "The Real New York" lecture series, a six-month program of speeches by state officials aimed at debunking what Mr. Cuomo refers to as "the shibboleths" about the state and, more to the point, about his record in governing it. 
 Mr. Cuomo also is writing a book by the same name and with the same purpose. Two speechwriters for the state's Urban Development Corporation are helping with research and editing of the manuscript. Mr. Cuomo, who is negotiating with Crown Publishers, hopes to see the book in print by the end of the year, said Stephen Villano, a spokesman for the U.D.C.
Mr. Villano said any profits from the book would go to the state's general fund. He justified the use of state workers to help write the book by saying, "It's like an extension of the 'I Love New York' campaign."
 
Loving and Selling the State
 "It's a marketing tool," he added. "It's the rationale to why he loves New York as Governor and how he would like to sell the state to others."
The book and the lecture series also give Mr. Cuomo a chance to help shape a legacy. The Governor acknowledged in his speech yesterday, as he has frequently, that the budget-cutting burdens of the recession have taken a heavy toll on his popularity. He is considering running for a fourth four-year term in 1994.
Mr. Cuomo began his speech by referring obliquely to Vice President Dan Quayle's assertion during the campaign that New York City demonstrated the failure of the welfare state and to President Bush's use of his convention acceptance speech to ridicule the notion of Mr. Cuomo as a Supreme Court justice.
"The Presidential campaign intrigued me because one party spent so much time attacking New York," Mr. Cuomo said. "There was something about the idea of New York that could get you political points if you were a member of this party.
"They even tried by using more or less familiar names from New York in the early part of the campaign as a kind of signal of disdain."
Although he said the tactic backfired, Mr. Cuomo said the state was harmed badly during the Reagan and Bush Administrations by what he argued was a misperception of the state as high-spending, high-taxing and wasteful. That syndrome, he said, has contributed to a severe inequity in Federal spending in which New York sends far more in tax revenues to Washington than it receives in aid.
Mr. Cuomo defended the state by highlighting its appeal to foreign investors, its geographic and cultural diversity and the vibrance of its immigrant community. He cited the small surplus in this year's state budget and asserted that New York ranks 24th among states in per capita taxes -- though that figure does not account for heavy local taxes in many areas that have risen as the state and Federal Governments have cut aid.
 
'We Invented the Midwest'
 Almost self-mockingly, the Governor reviewed the state's past with more hyperbole than history.
"New York was here before America," he said. "We invented banking. We invented the Midwest. We really did. They all came here to New York City, spoke in a Babel. Then they worked their way up the Hudson River, found Albany. Paradise. Oh, Albany's wonderful. You should come. It really is. I think it will be open this weekend.
"They did Albany and they did the Erie Canal and they got to the Great Lakes. Voila, the Midwest. We made Michigan. We created all those places. You should understand that."

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Signed in 3 Capitals

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The leaders of Mexico, Canada and the United States signed a free-trade agreement today that would eliminate import taxes and other barriers to commerce across North America. But the pact faces an uncertain future under the Clinton Administration.
President-elect Bill Clinton said he supported the agreement as a way to create more American jobs and foster economic growth in Mexico and Canada. But he said again, as he did during the election campaign, that he would seek to negotiate three supplemental agreements and make unilateral changes in American law on labor and environmental issues before he would sign legislation putting the agreement's provisions into law. 
 Congress seems likely to pass the implementing legislation eventually, though many members are uneasy about the agreement in its present form. They fear it will encourage American companies to move factories to Mexico to take advantage of low wages and lax enforcement of environmental laws there.
 
 
Most Important View
 "The President's view will be the most important one, and we will listen to that," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is likely to become the chairman of the Finance Committee. The committee will help draft the legislation next year.
But he added that "as a matter of American foreign policy," he had lingering concerns about restrictions on individuals' liberties in Mexico.
Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee's panel on international trade, said that he, too, had reservations and thought that if President Bush had been re-elected, he would have had a hard time putting the legislation through Congress. "I think the President-elect will have a much easier chance, a much better chance," he said.
Mr. Bush, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada each signed copies of the agreement at separate ceremonies in their respective capitals.
In Ottawa, protesters interrupted the brief signing ceremony at the House of Commons, accusing Mr. Mulroney of lying to the Canadian people about trade. Many in Canada blame the 1989 Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Canada for that nation's high unemployment, now running at 11.8 percent.
Mr. Bush signed the pact in the main hall of the Organization of American States here, and was not interrupted.
By signing the agreement today, Mr. Bush guaranteed that Congress would have to consider the implementing legislation under the so-called fast-track rules, which bar any amendments and require a vote within 90 working days after a President has submitted the bill. To become law, both houses must pass the pact by a simple majority. Canada's Parliament and Mexico's Senate are expected to approve the pact very soon because of strong and disciplined ruling-party majorities in both legislative bodies.
The agreement is scheduled to go into effect at the end of next year, but that could be postponed if Mr. Clinton delays submitting the implementing legislation.
 
 
Campaign Pledge
 Mr. Clinton has given no indication of when he will submit the bill to Congress and could in theory wait for many months. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader from Missouri, said last month that he did not expect Mr. Clinton to send the bill to Congress until all of the conditions in his campaign pledge had been met.
In a speech on Oct. 4 in Raleigh, N.C., Mr. Clinton called for supplemental agreements to strengthen labor and environmental protections and to prevent unexpected import surges. The current agreement already has some safeguards, and labor and environmental agreements have been negotiated separately by the Bush Administration, but Clinton aides dismissed these efforts as inadequate during the campaign.
In the same speech, Mr. Clinton also called for the United States to adopt legislation unilaterally that would set up worker retraining programs, clean up the environment, hold imported food to strict health standards, provide greater public participation in bilateral disputes and limit the temporary entry of Mexican workers.
The free-trade agreement's most easily understood feature is the elimination of all tariffs on trade between the three countries. Some would disappear immediately when the agreement comes into force; many would be phased out over 5 or 10 years. A small number would be phased out over 15 years because they protect high-cost industries that are very vulnerable to imports, such as West Virginia glass producers and Mexican corn farmers.
But the pact goes much further, covering everything from Mexican truck drivers who enter the United States to special legal remedies for American businesses that run into trouble in the Mexican bureaucracy and courts.
In a speech at the signing, Mr. Bush portrayed the free-trade pact as a historic step toward free trade that one day would extend from Alaska to Argentina. He invoked the name of Simon Bolivar, who helped lead six Latin American nations to independence from Spain in the early 19th century and sought to create a single nation covering most of Latin America.
"More than 150 years ago, Simon Bolivar, 'The Liberator,' whose statue stands outside this hall, spoke about an America united in heart, subject to one law and guided by the torch of liberty," Mr. Bush said. "My friends, here in this hemisphere, we are on the way to realizing Simon Bolivar's dream."
 
 
Still a Hero
 Bolivar remains a hero in many Latin American countries, although his name was often invoked by military regimes. He believed that presidents should serve for life, and apparently ordered the execution of prisoners and other drastic measures during a civil war in Venezuela that coincided with the American War of 1812.
Mr. Bush said in Detroit earlier today that Eastern European and Asian nations might someday join the North American free-trade area, but made no mention of this prospect after the signing. "It strikes me that there is an inconsistency between what he said there and what he said here," said Fred Bergsten, who heads the Institute for International Economics here and was a guest at today's signing ceremony.
Kathleen Lydon -- the chief spokeswoman for Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative who oversaw the negotiations that produced the free-trade pact -- said that the Bush Administration had planned to expand its regional free-trade area first within the Western Hemisphere. "It's not inconsistent with Detroit," she said.

HEADLINE: Keep Strict Bank Rules, Officials Urge

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Federal banking authorities said today that it cost banks $17.5 billion each year to comply with increasingly stringent and complex regulations, but they cautioned against relaxing the rules as a way of stimulating the flow of credit to encourage economic growth.
The conclusions were made in the annual report to Congress by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, a committee of banking regulatory agencies. 
 The discussion came while the Clinton Administration has been considering whether to stimulate the economy by relaxing bank regulations that might limit riskier forms of lending, like lending to small business, while encouraging financial institutions to hold relatively safe Treasury securities instead.
 
Lobbying by Banking Groups
 Major banking organizations like the American Bankers Association have been lobbying for a rollback of some of the regulations. Bankers most recently made their case at the economic meeting this week in Little Rock, Ark., at which President-elect Bill Clinton listened to their pleas with apparent sympathy.
But the bankers association welcomed the report that was issued today, calling it a "first-class job."
Any step back from the regulations of the last few years would have to overcome considerable Congressional opposition, and the bankers' pleas themselves are already inviting a counterattack. Consumers Union, Public Citizen and Acorn, a grass-roots organization, urged the Clinton Administration today not to undo recent regulations on banks.
"The new Administration should immediately indicate that it will not be duped by the banking industry's slogan of 'regulatory burden' and its accompanying public relations campaign into relaxing any of the critical laws related to safety and soundness or consumer protection," the consumer groups said. "This kind of deregulation won't stimulate the economy."
In its report, the council of regulators said that regulatory costs were growing as new regulations took hold in the wake of the crisis afflicting federally insured institutions. The group urged that new regulations be carefully considered to make sure their costs were justified by benefits to the public.
Some of the new rules have won broad approval among bankers and regulators alike -- including one that takes effect this weekend calling on regulators to intervene promptly when a troubled bank's capital dips below set thresholds. But others have been frequently criticized. An example is a rule requiring advance notice when a bank closes a branch, even if it is nothing more than an automated teller machine.
 
Effect on Lending Disputed
 But John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor and chairman of the examination council, said he did not believe assertions by some bankers that the regulations were hampering lending activity.
"There is plenty of capacity in the banking system to lend," he said. "As the economy picks up, the banking industry will stand ready to finance whatever demand arises."
And each of the five members of the council agreed that it would be a mistake to alter the capital standards set by the Basel Accord, an international agreement that increased the amount of capital banks must hold as a defense against failure.
Federal Reserve officials have repeatedly warned against weakening the capital rules, an idea that has been kicked around by some of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers and even mentioned in passing by Mr. Clinton himself as an option to be examined.
On the other hand, some Federal Reserve officials have acknowledged that there may be ways to change regulations to stimulate commercial lending, especially to small companies.
At a conference on banking at the Brookings Institution in Washington on Wednesday, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, David Mullins, said there might be ways to encourage banks to lend to small companies without sacrificing the security provided by some new regulations.
"The banking industry may be systematically retreating from small business lending in favor of mortgage and consumer lending," he said. To some extent, he suggested, that may be because it is much easier to manage the paperwork behind consumer lending than to meet the more rigorous standards for risky commercial and industrial loans.
Even though the banking industry is enjoying a year of record profits, Mr. Mullins said, "the rising tide of regulatory burdens does constitute a threat to the viability of the industry."
And today the new report by the Federal regulators said banking rules were especially burdensome on smaller banks. While the cost of regulations averages out to about 14 percent of the industry's operating expenses, not counting interest costs, the figure for smaller banks can be much higher.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Europe Discord on Trade Talks

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Vehement exchanges between European and American officials, the most vitriolic since a trans-Atlantic trade war was averted by an accord on Nov. 20, suggested today that a world trade agreement might not be achievable in the next few months.
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France described the November agreement between the European Community and the United States on European oilseed production and agricultural exports as "null and void" -- the most strongly worded French rejection yet of an accord that had been widely seen as opening the way for a successful conclusion of broad six-year trade negotiations intended to reduce barriers to world trade. 
 Those talks, under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are widely viewed as vital to reviving the stagnant world economy.
In response to Mr. Dumas, a senior United States official, who insisted on anonymity, said the Foreign Minister's remarks "put in question whether the European Community can seriously negotiate on behalf of its members."
The official, who was attending GATT talks in Geneva, added, "It is increasingly difficult to imagine how we can possibly wrap up a conensus on the text of the Uruguay Round agreement in the near future." The trade talks are known as the Uruguay Round because they began in that country in 1986.
One reason a quick agreement is important is that March is the expiration date of American legislation that has allowed Presidents to negotiate trade agreements and submit them for consideration by Congress with no amendments permitted. If this "fast track" legislation is no longer in place, Congressional approval could be a lengthy process and might add amendments that would require renegotiation with the 104 other members of GATT.
Although European Community negotiators in Washington in November were supposed to be representing the agreed position of member countries, France, the largest European agricultural producer and exporter, immediately reacted angrily to the accord, under which subsidized grain exports from the community would be reduced by 21 percent and oilseed production cut back sharply.
The French have argued that the compromise is unfair to Europe's farmers. Farmers in France have enormous political power, and general elections are scheduled for March.
But for all the harsh words, it is possible that the French are posturing, hoping to gain concessions in other areas under negotiation, like financial services and telecommunications.
Tran Van Thinh of France, the European Community's Ambassador to GATT, said today that negotiations must continue in Geneva and that a final decision by the community, including France, would be made only when a complete GATT package was in place. France has threatened to veto an accord at that stage if its farmers do not secure a better deal.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise, With I.B.M. Recovering a Bit

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks rose yesterday as a recovery in the shares of the International Business Machines Corporation ended the market's five-day losing streak.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.05 points to close at 3,269.23. In the broad market, advancing issues led declines, 1,139 to 664, on the New York Stock Exchange, on trading volume of 251.6 million shares. 
 I.B.M. rose 1 1/8, to 53, as eight million shares were traded after two days of large losses. It had slumped to an 11-year low on Wednesday after its announcement of drastic job cuts and a probable dividend cut.
"When a dividend is cut, it is perceived as a negative, but in the long run it's a major plus because there is less of a burden in restructuring," said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments.
David Bostian, chief economist at Herzog, Heine, Geduld, said the market was likely to resume its traditional year-end rally now that I.B.M. had stabilized.
Analysts said encouraging economic data on weekly jobless claims and the October trade deficit also helped lift to stocks out of their five-session slide.
Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose by 22,000, to a seasonally adjusted 347,000, in the week that ended Dec. 5, but analysts had expected claims to rise even higher.
The merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $7.03 billion in October from $8.58 billion in September, the Government reported.
Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business outlook survey showed the pace of growth in manufacturing was accelerating, nearly doubling to 31.5 percent in December from 16.6 percent in November.
"Today's positive economic statistics are just part of a whole mosaic of improving economic data suggesting the economy is out of recession," Mr. Bostian said.
A first-day stock issue, Student Loan, closed at 18 3/4 after Citibank priced the initial offering of 3.6 million shares at 16 3/4 a share.
Intel climbed 3, to 86 1/2, after Gruntal Investment Research raised its rating to buy from hold and increased its fourth-quarter earnings estimates for the company by 20 cents a share, to $1.50.
Ford Motor shares fell 7/8, to 39 3/4, in reaction to its decision to take a charge of nearly $8 billion in 1992, including a $419 million fourth-quarter charge to restructure European operations.
Procter & Gamble gained 5/8, to 52 3/4, on news that it would raise $1.2 billion through a series of commercial pulp plant and timberland sales. The consumer products giant also plans to sell its Memphis cotton linters pulp plant.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks gained 3.91 points, to 435.43. The American Stock Exchange index rose 1.12 points, to 390.42.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks rose 1.86, to 239.12. The average share gained 27 cents. The Nasdaq index gained 8.83, to 658.46.

HEADLINE: Selig Altschul, an Aviation Expert And Investment Adviser, 78, Dies

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Selig Altschul, long a premier financial expert and counselor to the aviation industry and those investing in it, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 78 and until recently also kept a home in Pawling, N.Y.
He died of cancer, his family said.
Mr. Altschul's company, Aviation Advisory Service Inc. in Manhattan, served leading airlines and aircraft companies in this country and abroad. He established his consulting practice in 1947 and headed it as president until he suffered a stroke in 1990. 
 He also wrote for financial newspapers and magazines on the economics of transportation industries. He and his wife, Marylin Bender, were the co-authors of "The Chosen Instrument," a biography of Juan Trippe, the founder of Pan American World Airways (Simon & Schuster, 1982).
 
Began as a Securities Analyst
 A native of Chicago, Mr. Altschul graduated from Northwestern University in 1934, when he started his career as a railroad securities analyst for Chicago brokerage houses. At the same time, he began to write financial articles on the budding airline industry, whose swagger was about to be reined in by the regulators under the 1938 Civil Aeronautics Act.
His writings gained him an invitation to join the new Federal Civil Aeronautics Board as a senior analyst from 1941 to 1943. Then, while serving in the United States Army Air Force, he took part in the Strategic Bombing Survey of Germany. He returned to the C.A.B. as chief analyst in 1946 but left for Wall Street the following year to start his company.
Mr. Altschul advised airlines and investment banks on regulatory matters and on how to finance the growth of the airline industry. He often appeared as an expert witness before government agencies and United States Tax Courts. He took on various government assignments, working as a consultant to the Congressional Aviation Policy Board, the Senate Commerce Committee and, in 1955, as head of a Hoover Commission task force that examined the capabilities and performance of the Military Air Transportation Service.
President John F. Kennedy named him to his Task Force on National Aviation Goals, known as Project Horizon.
In the early 1960's Mr. Altschul also played a pivotal role in the merger of debt-ridden Capital Airlines, then the country's fifth largest, into United Air Lines.
In 1977, the United States Railway Association asked him to to serve as chairman and chief executive of the Delaware & Hudson Railway to save it from bankruptcy. He did so for a year and remained a director until 1983, when the company was acquired by Guilford Transportation Industries.
Over the years, he also held directorships in several corporations, including Western Union Corporation and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Trust Company.
In addition to his wife, a former reporter and editor of The New York Times, Mr. Altschul is survived by two sons, Michael F. of Arlington, Va., and James S. of Manhattan; and two brothers, Herman and Sidney, both of Chicago.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows to $7 Billion

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
In a surprising tally that conveyed mixed messages about the economy, the Commerce Department reported today that the nation's trade deficit narrowed sharply in October, to $7 billion, as exports jumped to a new record. Imports fell moderately.
The $1.6 billion monthly improvement, to the smallest merchandise trade gap since June, was hailed by the Bush Administration but greeted skeptically by most private analysts. 
 Indeed, there was widespread belief that fresh trade deterioration was almost certain in coming months and that friction would intensify with Japan. At $5 billion in October, up from $4.4 billion in September, the American deficit with Japan was the biggest in nearly four years.
 
 
'Good Reason to Cheer'
 From Beijing, where she is leading a large Government entourage on a mission to get the Chinese to buy American goods, Commerce Secretary Barbara H. Franklin issued a statement citing the latest figures as providing "good reason to cheer this holiday season as U.S. companies continue to benefit from President Bush's efforts to open markets and promote exports."
Private commentators, however, generally regarded the October trade results as an aberration.
"I think this is temporary," Harald B. Malmgren, a Washington trade consultant, said. "Exports can't continue to surge when the rest of the world economy is really sluggish."
Mr. Malmgren also said he expected that the dollar would rise in coming months, reflecting greater relative appeal of American interest rates. That would further erode the trade position by making this country's products more expensive to foreigners while making imports cheaper.
 
 
Double Trouble
 "We've got the double-whammy," he added. A stronger domestic economy "will continue to suck in imports without any place to export." Both Germany and Japan, major trading partners, are generally considered as having now slipped into recession.
Barry Rogstad, president of the American Business Conference, a group of rapidly growing midsized companies, also played down the record October exports, which climbed $1.3 billion, or 3.4 percent, to a total of $39.2 billion.
He noted, as did others, that nearly 75 percent of the increase came from civilian aircraft, a sector in which big-ticket items are delivered at irregular intervals, and from shipments of nonmonetary gold.
The October totals "cannot disguise a world economy that is dead in the water," Mr. Rogstad said.
Nor is expected American legislation likely to help, said John E. Silvia, economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. He said that one-third or more of American factory equipment was imported and that adoption of an investment tax credit proposed by President-elect Bill Clinton to increase business investment in equipment would raise demand for foreign goods and exacerbate the trade imbalance.
 
 
International Agreements
 Advisers to Mr. Clinton have ruminated about denying credit for imports, but this, various specialists said, could probably not be done without violating international agreements.
Imports during October eased to $46.2 billion, or five-tenths of 1 percent below the record September level, today's report showed.
Geographically, the American deficit with developing countries shrank by about $500 million, to $2.6 billion, according to figures that are not seasonally adjusted. The deficit with China eased by $300 million but, at $2 billion, remained at a level that Secretary Franklin said "cannot be sustained."
Besides the $600 million erosion with Japan, the American deficit worsened by about $250 million with Canada and what had been surpluses of $500 million with Mexico and $250 million with Western Europe virtually disappeared.
The main shifts in exports were increases in industrial supplies and materials and in capital goods, the report showed, while imports were dominated by declines for consumer and automotive goods.
The nation's bill for imported oil climbed to $3.8 billion from $3.5 billion in October as volume rose by 17 million barrels at an average price, $18.15, that was 29 cents above that of September.
On a three-month moving average, the deficit edged down to $8.2 billion from $8.3 billion, the department also calculated.
For trade in advanced technology products, in which the United States has traditionally shined, the surplus jumped to $2.7 billion from $2 billion on an unadjusted basis.
Over all, commented Richard S. Peterson, chief economist at Continental Bank, Chicago, the latest figures "still show we're competitive." But he added, "I think the deficit is going to continue to rise on balance" in coming months and total nearly $100 billion in 1993, about 20 percent ahead of this year's level.

HEADLINE: Initial Claims By Jobless Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose in early December for the first time in four weeks, but the Government said today that the increase was an aberration because of the Thanksgiving Day holiday.
The Labor Department reported that first-time applications for unemployment insurance rose to 347,000 during the week ended Dec. 5 from 325,000 the previous week. 
 But, it added, "The rise was mainly the result of the return to a normal workweek after a shorter reporting period the prior week due to the Thanksgiving Day holiday."
"The basic thing is that we've been in a downtrend in claims since late summer," Robert G. Dederick, an economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said.
Analysts noted that the four-week moving average, which smooths out the erratic weekly changes and is considered a more reliable indicator of the labor situation, fell to a low for the last two and a half years.
The average was 352,000 during the period ended Dec. 5, down from 361,750 a week earlier and the lowest since it reached 350,250 on June 9, 1990.
The number of new claims has remained under 400,000 for 11 weeks, which some analysts contend means an improving employment situation.
The number of initial jobless claims excludes claimants using a special emergency unemployment program in early December.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends the Day Mixed Despite Positive U.S. Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against major currencies yesterday in light trading even though the Government released positive economic statistics.
Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $338.40 a troy ounce, up 50 cents from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank said gold added 70 cents an ounce for a late bid price of $338.20. 
 Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer with Bank Leumi, said the dearth of activity in the dollar market stemmed from the approach of the holidays.
 
Dollar Still Seen 'as a Buy'
 Also, while the economic statistics were positive, they were insufficient to cause a rally. Strengthening came with traders realizing that with the European monetary system "still somewhat shaky, the dollar is still regarded as a buy," he said.
In New York, the dollar closed at 122.74 yen, down from 122.95 on Wednesday. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 123.12 yen, down 0.75 from Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 123.15 yen.
In New York, it cost $1.58 to buy one British pound, more than Wednesday's $1.5745. The British pound was quoted in London at $1.573, down from $1.5775 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: marks, unchanged, at 1.5575; 1.3995 Swiss francs, up from 1.399; 5.3245 French francs, up from 5.3235; 1,404.5 Italian lire, up from 1,399, and 1.273445 Canadian dollars, down from 1.27675.
Gold closed in London late yesterday at $338.30 an ounce, up from $337.35 bid for an ounce late Wednesday. In Zurich, the bid price was $338.25, up from $337.20 late Wednesday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $2.22 to close at a bid $337.55.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Supercomputer Tensions Rise

BYLINE: By John Markoff

 BODY:
THE United States and Japan are nearing a confrontation over supercomputers.
Japanese Government and corporate officials are growing increasingly irritated by the United States' refusal to consider Japanese complaints that the American Government market is closed to Japanese supercomputers. At the same time, their American counterparts say the Japanese have failed to comply with a 1990 bilateral trade accord under which Japan agreed to open its Government market to American makers of the fastest computers. 
 "We're at a watershed," said John A. Rollwagen, the chairman of Cray Research Inc., a leading supercomputer maker. "The supercomputer could become a symbol of renewed trade tensions. If it breaks down into trade barriers, then both the Japanese and the Americans will be losers."
A collision could come as early as March, when the American Government and Cray Research may decide to challenge NEC over its installation of an SX-3 supercomputer at Japan's National Institute for Fusion Sciences. Cray Research lost that contract and a subsequent appeal, but the Americans believe NEC won by bidding a "paper" machine -- one that exists in blueprints but not in reality, and will ultimately fail to meet performance specifications. The two Governments are now skirmishing over whether the Japanese will permit what the Americans consider a fair test of the machine once it is installed next year.
The Japanese are said to be considering a variety of responses to what they see as America's refusal to open the Government market, including withdrawing from the 1990 agreement. Last week, a Japanese Government negotiator met with the deputy United States trade representative, Ira Wolfe, over a variety of trade issues including supercomputers. The meeting "opened up a wide field for disagreement," an American Government official said.
The chill between Japan and the United States deepened shortly before the Presidential election when an interagency team of American negotiators met with the Japanese in Tokyo. At the meeting on Oct. 28-29, the Japanese presented the American team a two-page document listing questions and issues related to concerns of the Japanese about their inability to sell supercomputers to the American Government.
The Japanese argue that United States Government officials have systematically prevented Government laboratories from purchasing Japanese supercomputers. "The United States has had doubts about the openness of our markets," said Mr. Koro Bessho, an economic official at the Japanese Consulate in Washington. "We wanted to see how the United States does these things. We have found some things that were contrary to what we expected."
Cray Research and United States Government officials respond that the American market is, in fact, open, but that Japanese machines introduced recently, like the NEC SX-3, still do not measure up. Cray executives point out that setting aside both Japanese and American markets, their company is the dominant supplier in Europe, which is considered a more neutral market.
That is not entirely convincing, independent industry experts say. "I have trouble buying that argument totally," said Gary Smaby, president of Smaby Group, a supercomputer industry consulting firm. "The Japanese don't have the robust software environment of Cray, but there are a number of applications where the Japanese machines do quite well. If the market was totally open, then my guess is that somebody would have tried to buy the machine."
A crucial issue is the strength of Japanese supercomputing software. American officials are eager to test the NEC SX-3 to determine if it is capable of automatically parallelizing applications -- effectively tying together several separate processors. This is a key area where Cray Research has retained a significant lead, at least until now.
Both countries contend that while the Japanese now have the fastest single processors, American makers like Cray offer faster overall machines because of their parallelizing software.
An American Government official who has participated in supercomputer trade negotiations said that parallelizing software was a significant reason the Americans were anxious to keep Japanese supercomputers out of United States Government laboratories. Directly connecting a Japanese supercomputer to the United States' high-performance computer network would permit the Japanese to make rapid strides in software, he said.
Although supercomputers represent a tiny market in terms of international trade, they are considered pivotal because of their strategic significance and as symbols of national prestige. American negotiators say the outcome of the supercomputer dispute may directly influence other trade battles, including those involving satellites, other types of computers and construction contracts.

HEADLINE: Dining Out In New York On $50 a Day

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER

 BODY:
"LUNCH and dinner in New York City for $50 a day?" sniggered a seasoned veteran of Manhattan restaurants. "Is that sitting down?"
A wisecrack like that would have been justified five or six years ago, before a recession, evolving dining habits and changing demographics opened a trap door in dining rooms through which customers disappeared at alarming rates. 
 But in the last year, restaurateurs have fought back with aggressive discounting, special promotions -- most notably the $19.92 lunch specials that began in the summer -- and a heightened emphasis on customer relations. As a result, New York City restaurants today offer more bargains than Macy's in January.
In addition, the city has seen an explosion of inexpensive quality restaurants where full meals are served for $25 or less.
Considering all of this, yes, it is possible to dine out at lunch and dinner in New York City, even in Manhattan, without spending more than $50 a person for both meals.
To reach this target, you must set out with certain information in your quiver. For one, pay attention to the widespread and ever-changing prix fixe meals offered. Although pre-theater specials were largely confined to the greater Broadway district just a few years ago, they now are advertised all over the city, even if there isn't a theater anywhere nearby. Savings can be 30 percent of a la carte prices or even more. And if you are willing to eat at off-peak hours -- before 6 P.M. and after 9:30 or 10 P.M. -- more remarkable bargains can be found.
Another tip: if you are on a tight budget, lay off the expensive mineral water.
For this roundup on pages C30 and C31, Eric Asimov and I have proposed a theoretical weekend that includes Friday dinner, Saturday lunch, Saturday dinner and Sunday lunch or brunch. Lunch tabs are less than $20, dinner tabs less than $30. The meals are planned around typical weekend activities: art museums and galleries, Broadway theater, cinema, classical and pop music, shopping and dance programs.
Prices include an appetizer, a main course and a dessert, which can be tallied precisely. Beverages are not included because habits vary so widely. A glass or two of wine could push the tab slightly over the $50 threshold. Tax and tip are extra, as is any popcorn at the movies.

Gunfighter Nation
The Myth of the Frontier in 20th-Century America
By Richard Slotkin
850 pages. Atheneum. $40
Since 1893, when Frederick Jackson Turner delivered his epoch-making address on the crisis America faced in the closing of its geographic frontier, historians have been busy debating the winning and losing of the West. The latest study to tackle this widely written-about subject is the scholar Richard Slotkin's stirring new book, "Gunfighter Nation: The Myth of the Frontier in 20th-Century America," the concluding volume in an ambitious trilogy tracing the evolution of the myth of the American frontier.
"Gunfighter Nation" builds on ideas laid out in the trilogy's first two volumes, "Regeneration Through Violence" (1973) and "The Fatal Environment" (1985). It often echoes the work of other scholars as well, most notably, Henry Nash Smith's influential "Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth" (1950) and "The West of the Imagination" (1989) by William H. and William N. Goetzmann. At the same time, the book breaks new ground in its careful explication of the continuing dynamic between politics and myth, myth and popular culture. 
 Writing in clear, sure-footed prose, Mr. Slotkin methodically illustrates the ways in which the myth of the frontier has both informed American foreign policy -- from Presidents Theodore Roosevelt through Ronald Reagan -- and shaped popular thinking through books and movies. If his book's relentless determination to look at American history through this single, narrow lens results in some oversimplifications -- the country's idealism and taste for isolationalism are both consistently underplayed -- it nonetheless succeeds in making the reader re-examine the underpinnings of American political and cultural ideology and reassess a century of remarkable change.
According to the myth of the frontier, says Mr. Slotkin, "the conquest of the wilderness and the subjugation or displacement of the Native Americans who originally inhabited it have been the means to our achievement of a national identity, a democratic polity, an ever-expanding economy and a phenomenally dynamic and 'progressive' civilization." Central to this myth was the belief that "violence is an essential and necessary part of the process through which American society was established and through which its democratic values are defended and enforced."
Whereas the early settlers achieved progress (and, Mr. Slotkin implies, a sense of spiritual regeneration) through the continual annexation of new lands, Americans were forced to look for new sorts of conquests when the Western frontier closed in the 1890's. With the Spanish-American War and American involvement in the Philippines, Theodore Roosevelt extrapolated the frontier myth to the world of foreign affairs. For Americans to renew their virility, Roosevelt suggested, they must take up the challenge of empire and bring civilization "to the red wastes where the barbarian peoples of the world hold sway."
Later administrations, says Mr. Slotkin, would invoke the frontier myth to justify the use of counterinsurgency measures in the cold war and to rationalize America's growing involvement in Vietnam. In each case, Mr. Slotkin argues, the enemy was portrayed in terms similar to those once used to depict Indians, as ruthless, savage adversaries, whom the "side of progress and civilization" must fight "without quarter and even without scruple."
At the same time, adds Mr. Slotkin, American movies were reinforcing -- and in some instances, subverting -- these premises through the vehicle of the western, a genre used by film makers "to allegorize a wide range of difficult or taboo subjects." While westerns like "High Noon" and "Shane" asserted "the entitlement of representatives of the 'better' or 'decent' classes to a privileged form of violence" (much the way, Mr. Slotkin implies, that American Governments justified the abuse of official procedure in the name of national security), other films would begin to question just how far the gunfighter could go "without becoming morally indistinguishable from the enemy."
The film "Vera Cruz" (1954), which tells the story of a group of American gunfighters who go to Mexico to help suppress a radical revolution, suggested a willingness, in Mr. Slotkin's words, "to measure means by their effectiveness rather than by their conformity to 'longstanding concepts of fair play.' " And "The Searchers" (1956), which features John Wayne as an ex-Confederate soldier obsessed with exacting revenge on the Indians who massacred his family, re-examines the whole concept of racialist war and its moral consequences for both the victor and the vanquished.
As America's involvement in Vietnam escalated, Mr. Slotkin says, the western -- particularly the Mexico western focusing on the experiences of Americans south of the border -- became a convenient vehicle for metaphorically dealing with the problems of the war. By the mid-1960's, these films had already grown increasingly violent and cynical; by 1970 -- after Tet and the shocking revelations of the My Lai massacre -- some of these movies had begun to invert the traditional myth of the frontier. In "The Wild Bunch" (1969), for example, the adventures of a group of Americans in Mexico lead not to a heroic last stand, but to a bloody shootout that destroys an entire town.
With the return of the last American combat forces from Vietnam, the popularity of westerns precipitously declined, from a high of 29 in 1971 to only 7 in 1974, a development indicative, Mr. Slotkin contends, of the decline of the frontier as a viable national myth. Vietnam, the failure of the war on poverty, Watergate, the hostage crisis and the sobering realities of a worsening economy and a fragile environment all combined, in Mr. Slotkin's view, to diminish the validity of the frontier myth with its old promises of manifest destiny and infinite progress.
Although President Reagan tried to invoke the old symbolism of the myth -- with promises of economic bonanzas, warnings about the "Evil Empire" and even references to his former movie roles -- Mr. Slotkin argues that "his repair of public myth was partial and incomplete" for he could not erase "either the material consequences of our historical experience or its registration in memory."
Yet a century after Turner pointed to the closing of the geographic frontier, a nostalgia for the myth -- or at least the vocabulary -- of the frontier remains. With United States forces in Somalia, both Government officials and reporters have already begun to invoke some familiar imagery. As Ted Koppel recently said on "Nightline," "We like, as Americans, that sort of western image of the big, swaggering, broad-shouldered American coming into the town that is in trouble and clearing everything up."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Toys or Torture

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
At the end, President Bush had one fine political opportunity left. He could walk into history cleanly, with dignity.
Poor Mr. Bush. No American can take pleasure watching a departing President soil the leave-taking by a last-minute cynical maneuver that can mortgage the successor Administration -- and the lives of those who suffer under tyranny. 
 As he leaves, Mr. Bush allows Secretary of Commerce Barbara Franklin and a large entourage of bureaucrats to pull off one last piece of sleaze. They are on a $450,000 expedition to China to sign a few more deals to placate its Communist rulers.
Given Bushbaker's record of appeasing Beijing, it is difficult to know why the killers of Tiananmen Square, the captors of millions of slave laborers, must be placated further.
Still, appeasement is addictive. Beijing, which knows a kowtow when it sees one, is promoting the trip as a great victory.
Back home, meanwhile, Bushbaker is considering the sale of advanced jet engine components to Communist China. The Defense Department objects: the components could throw cruise-missile payloads much farther than the Chinese can now. Picky old Defense Department.
In case anybody had any doubts that the mission was aimed at pre-empting a Clintonian China policy, Ira Wolf straightened us out in Beijing. Mr. Wolf, an assistant U.S. trade representative, says he would rather have a Secretary of Commerce in Beijing now than have to wait until August 1993. Presumably Mr. Wolf thinks that is when Mr. Clinton might decide to send one -- or call off the placating game altogether.
Running for President, Mr. Clinton made a strong stand against appeasement. He supported legislation that was backed by a Congressional majority but was veto-meat for Bushbaker. Congress consistently tried to make Beijing pay for low-tariff privileges -- by showing some human rights decency or controlling its lust for selling missiles and nuclear technology to other dictatorships.
In Little Rock the other day, Mr. Clinton said he did not "want" to withdraw China's tariff privileges. That made some Congressional human rights supporters nervous. But they say he is simply guarding his words and inviting Beijing to make a decent human rights offer while it has the chance.
Mr. Clinton also said that the value of being tough with Beijing was shown by Bushbaker itself when China said it would no longer ship slave labor goods to the U.S. Somebody is peddling Mr. Clinton a rubber sausage. The "agreement" on shipping slave products to the U.S. has no investigative or enforcement teeth. It will not free one slave for one hour.
In Little Rock a toy manufacturer pleaded with him not to prevent a Communist Santa Claus from delivering all those low-cost goodies.
But Mommy, how do you know this nice teddy bear made in China doesn't come from a slave-labor camp?
Oh, shut up and play, you little brat.
So, as a new American China evolves under Mr. Clinton, let's review some basics.
Basic one is that China is ruled by a bunch of tough old killers. They intend to pass on Communist power to other tough killers, not quite so old.
Basic two: They rule by terror, torture and slave labor. Americans who do not know do not want to know.
Basic three: China is making economic progress, as have dictatorships before. Beijing makes good use of capitalist tariffs and loans.
American buyers of Chinese goods and propaganda tell us that Communist economic progress leads inevitably to political freedom. As where?
I heard that line when I was a correspondent in Poland during the coldest days of Stalinist Communism, and ever since. The people of the evil empire achieved liberty not when it grew richer but when it collapsed under rebellion, corruption -- and Western pressure. So it will be in the last great bastion of the empire.
Americans have a choice -- Mr. Clinton on down. We can use economic pressure to help at least some prisoners and slaves of Chinese Communists. That might cost some American jobs -- but maybe Americans will wind up making those toys.
Or we can go on playing with our cheap teddy bears.
But it is not an economic choice. It is a choice between prisoner and torturer. That is the fourth basic.

HEADLINE: Immigration Stimulates the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Immigration Reform Holds Key to Economy" (letter, Nov. 27) Prof. Vernon M. Briggs Jr. of Cornell University's New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations uses a Nov. 10 news analysis, "How to Lift the Poor," as a springboard from which to promote his own anti-immigrant agenda.
In the process, he confuses the issues and misleads readers by asserting, without offering any evidence, that our immigration policy fosters poverty and urban blight. 
 The contrary is true. A 1989 Department of Labor study found that "neither United States workers in complementary jobs, nor most minority workers, appear to be adversely affected by immigration."
This finding is supported by many other studies, including those by the Rand Corporation, the University of Maryland, the United States Council of Economic Advisers and the National Research Council, all of which indicate that immigrants in the United States, both legal and undocumented, do not have a negative effect on the earnings and employment opportunities of native-born Americans.
You concluded on this topic two years ago in "So Much for Assumptions About Immigrants and Jobs" (The Week in Review, April 14, 1990) that "the conventional economic wisdom pitting American poor against the immigrant poor is crumbling." In a recent poll of 38 of the country's top economists, 68 percent favored increased immigration, while none favored less.
These studies also show that immigrants pay more than $90 billion in taxes annually, that they are not a drain on the economy and they contribute far more than what they receive. As the studies show, immigrants create jobs for both citizens and other immigrants and, contrary to Mr. Briggs's assertion, are revitalizing many cities by starting businesses and generating jobs in the communities in which they settle.
Indeed, the policies Mr. Briggs advocates will have the effect of worsening urban problems by creating a class of people especially vulnerable to exploitation, by depressing wages and by causing widespread discrimination and intolerance that will affect all. For example, a 1990 study by Congress's General Accounting Office found that the 1986 law penalizing employers who hire undocumented aliens has led to widespread discrimination against citizens and authorized workers.
Urban reform is a difficult and complicated issue that cannot be intelligently addressed by advancing simplistic and xenophobic ideas such as those expounded by Mr. Briggs. A sound policy attacks poverty; it does not groundlessly make scapegoats of immigrants.

HEADLINE: Company to Pay $111 Million In Health-Claims Fraud Suit

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18

 BODY:
National Health Laboratories Inc., one of the nation's largest providers of clinical diagnostic testing, pleaded guilty today in Federal court to two criminal charges of submitting false claims to Government health insurance programs. The company agreed to pay $111 million to settle the case, Government officials said.
The settlement, the largest ever reached between the Government and a health-care provider, is a result of a two-year Federal investigation into the company's marketing and billing practices. 
 The inquiry was initiated in response to accusations by a whistle-blower who could be entitled to more than $15 million of the settlement.
 
Unneccessary Tests
 Federal officials contended that National Health Labs, of La Jolla, Calif., manipulated doctors into ordering unnecessary tests for cholesterol and serum ferritin -- iron in the blood -- as part of a basic series of blood tests.
The extraneous tests for cholesterol and ferritin were billed to Medicare, Medicaid and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services at prices much higher than the doctors expected. The tests resulted in millions of dollars in excess charges to the insurance carriers, whose costs have risen much faster than the overall economy has grown.
"Marketing schemes like the one exposed today are a primary reason for these escalating costs," said William Braniff, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of California, who handled the case. "This is not a case where National Health billed for tests that were not performed or tests performed in a fraudulent manner. Instead, National Health sought to subvert the medical judgment of doctors who were ordering the tests."
The medical testing concern's president and chief executive, Robert E. Draper, pleaded guilty to two counts of submitting false claims and resigned. Mr. Draper will forfeit $500,000 to the Government and could face up to five years in prison on each count.
Under the terms of the settlement, National Health Labs will pay a $1 million fine for pleading guilty to the charge of presenting false claims to the Civilian Health program. The company will pay $100 million in recoupment costs to Medicare and $10.4 million to state Medicaid programs to settle civil actions.
According to the Justice Department, the company will pay $35 million by the end of this year, another $30 million by March 31 and the rest by the third quarter of 1995.
National Health Laboratories is a former unit of Revlon Inc., the cosmetics company, and its chairman and largest shareholder is Ronald O. Perelman, the chairman of Revlon.
Mr. Braniff said the practices to which National Health had pleaded guilty were not limited to that company.
He said National Health Labs had conducted a marketing campaign that suggested the lab was performing the cholesterol and ferritin tests as part of a basic blood series test, called sequential multiple analysis computer, or SMAC, which is the single most common laboratory test ordered by physicians.
But National Health was actually charging the Government insurers $18 for each of the three tests, Mr. Braniff said. Private insurers were charged only 65 cents for the same tests.
 
Agencies Billed Directly
 The Federal officials said that the Government agencies were billed directly by the labs, while the charges for tests of patients with private insurance were sent to the doctors who ordered the tests. Many doctors would have challenged such high charges for blood tests, prosecutors said.
"The impression they created was that you got all three tests for the one basic price, but that was simply misleading," Mr. Braniff said. "They also took away the doctor's ability to order only one of the tests, because they were not listed separately on the company's order form."
As an example of the huge financial impact that National Health Labs' practices have had on the public health insurance system, Federal officials who directed the criminal investigation said that in 1988, before the company added ferritin to its basic blood tests, the Medicare program paid less than $500,000 a year to National Health for ferritin tests. In 1990, a year after the tests were added, the company received more than $31 million from Medicare for the tests.
The company's rapid growth in such testing caught the attention of C. Jack Dowden, a sales manager for a competing lab company, who ultimately became the whistle-blower in this case. Mr. Dowden's lawyer, John R. Phillips, said his client was puzzled that National Health Labs was gaining so many accounts and determined with the assistance of a doctor that it was billing the Government for tests that it said were included in the basic blood screening.
Under the Federal False Claims Act, a person who alerts prosecutors to fraud against the Federal Government can collect 15 to 25 percent of any money collected by the Government.
Federal officials said that they were continuing to investigate marketing and billing practices of other blood-testing companies and that they thought many of these companies had engaged in practices similar to those of National Health Laboratories.
 
Big Surge in Testing
 Diagnostic testing has grown substantially in the last decade, encouraged by advances in medicine and technology, as well as by economic and legal pressures on the doctors who order the tests. Such testing is estimated to cost about $30 billion a year, or more than 6 percent of the nation's total health-care spending.
Officials of National Health Labs said that the company would take a charge of $85 million against its earnings in the fourth quarter as a result of the settlement.
An assistant Attorney General, Stuart M. Gerson, chief of the Justice Department's civil division, said in a statement today: "The Department of Justice has made health-care fraud a priority investigative area, and this case indicates the department's commitment to investigate and prosecute aggressively abuses of the Federal health-care system."
Federal officials said they did not know of any suits filed against National Health Labs by private insurance companies, probably because the testing lab charged doctors only about 65 cents for the cholesterol and ferritin tests that were performed for private insurance patients. In some instances, the company waived the 65-cent fee if doctors or patients complained, the officials said.
In a statement, National Health Labs said it had included the cholesterol and serum ferritin tests in its standard testing profile because it believed they were necessary for a full diagnostic evaluation, were medically sound and were supported by a growing consensus in the medical and scientific communities.
"At no time did the company believe that its practices were interfering with a physician's discretion," the statement said. "Rather, the company understood that it was following the common industry practice of marketing a combination of tests together as one basic profile."
 
Much Government Business
 James Richmond, a National Health Labs spokesman, said that the company had projected earnings of 31 to 32 cents a share for the fourth quarter but that the settlement was likely to result in a charge against earnings of 87 cents a share.
Mr. Richmond said that the company's fundamental business was still strong and that it would continue to participate in Federal and state health programs, which account for 40 percent of its revenues.
In the first nine months of 1992, National Health Labs reported net income of $92.2 million, or 96 cents a share, compared with $77.1 million, or 78 cents a share, in the period of 1991. Revenues were $541.1 million in the period, up from $449.6 in the corresponding period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: EX-DISSIDENT WINS ELECTION IN KOREA

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Saturday, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Kim Young Sam, who spent years under house arrest for his opposition to South Korea's authoritarian rulers and then joined forces with the ruling party two years ago, was elected President on Friday, the first in three decades to be drawn from outside the ranks of the military.
In a surprisingly strong showing after a hard-fought campaign, Mr. Kim received about 42 percent of the vote in what many here called the most peaceful and fair election in South Korea's tumultuous postwar history. 
 With about 92 percent of the vote counted this morning, the country's most famous dissident, Kim Dae Jung, received about 34 percent, according to tallies this morning by the Korean Broadcasting System. The billionaire founder of the giant Hyundai industrial group, Chung Ju Yung, drew about 16 percent.
 
Takes Office in February
 Kim Young Sam, who turns 65 on Sunday, will take office in February, succeeding Roh Tae Woo. Mr. Roh, a former general who narrowly defeated both Kims in the country's first open election five years ago, is constitutionally prohibited from serving another term.
In a campaign dominated by fears that the country's competitive edge is eroding after years of remarkable growth, the vote for Kim Young Sam seemed driven by a national desire for stability.
While he promised moderate change, Mr. Kim merged his own party with President Roh's in 1990, abandoning a lifetime served in the opposition. Since then he has closely associated himself with the Roh Administration's policies on everything from keeping American troops based here to a growing dialogue with the Communist Government in North Korea.
 
Vote Shows 'Desire for Change'
 Speaking at a news conference this morning to declare victory, Mr. Kim said the vote "shows the people's desire for change and reform amid stability."
Perhaps more importantly, he also won the grudging respect, though not the affection, of South Korea's military elite. In 1987, there were rumors of military intervention if anyone but Mr. Roh was elected. This year there was none of that, and Western diplomats here say they expect the military to stay out of politics in coming years.
"They can live with him," a senior United States official said not long ago.
Mr. Kim will inherit management of what may be the most critical transition Seoul has faced since the Korean War 40 years ago: Negotiating a permanent peace, and later a possible reunification, with the North, at a time that the Communist Government is still believed to be attempting to build nuclear weapons.
Seoul's fear is that the North Korean economy could collapse, costing the nation hundreds of billions of dollars that otherwise would be spent competing with Japan and the United States and moving South Korea to a more advanced phase of its development.
Though he has long been a fixture in South Korean politics Mr. Kim, the only son of a weathly shipping and fishing magnate, remains something of a mystery to many Koreans. At the age of 26, before the Korean War, he was secretary to the then prime minister, and was elected to Parliament nine times. At moments in his career he has taken large risks, once even staging a 23-day hunger strike to demand that the Government permit far greater liberty in South Korea.
 
Reputation for Honesty
 In a country marked by political corruption, Mr. Kim enjoys a strong reputation for honesty. Yet he speaks in vague terms and sometimes seems to have a loose grasp on complex national issues. His critics have described him as an opportunist whose lifetme ambition to become President has compromised his judgment.
In 1990, Mr. Kim calculated that he stood a better chance of getting elected by joining Mr. Roh's party than by staying in the opposition. So he announced a merger with the ruling Democratic Liberal Party in return for what many suspsect was an informal guarantee that he would be the party's candidate for president this year. Though many of his supporters were angry and alienated, Friday's results showed that many more came back to the fold.
In the days leading up to Friday's election, Mr. Kim's candidacy seemed threatened by a scandal in his hometown area of Pusan, where the mayor and a variety of intelligence and police officials were secretly recorded plotting a way to assure his election. But there was no evidence that their activities were santioned by Mr. Kim, and in the end it seemed to have cost him relatively little support.
The surprise in the campaign was the relatively weak performance of Mr. Chung, whose enormous wealth -- he is reportedly worth $4 billion to $6 billion -- and his powerful reputation as a leader of Korea's best-known industrial group made him a daunting candidate. Kim Young Sam's supporters feared he would split the country's conservative vote, handing the election to Kim Dae Jung. But in the end, the 77-year old Mr. Chung's popularity waned.
 
A Final Setback
 The results were perhaps the final setback for the 67-year-old Kim Dae Jung, who was making his third try for the presidency. Known in the West as the man who survived death sentences, imprisonment and exile in the cause of bringing democracy to South Korea, he was unable to persuade the country's voters that he would not quash the nation's economic miracle.
While he performed strongly in his southern stronghold of Cholla, where he had upwards of 90 percent of the vote, he barely won in the critical precincts of Seoul. He needed a big win in the capital, his supporters said, to make up for his unpopularity throughout much of the rest of the country.
Today, Kim Dae Jung conceded that he had feen fairly defeated and announced his retirement from politics.
 
Milestone for Democracy
 For Korea, Friday's election marked a major milestone in the country's democratization. Unlike the 1987 election in which Mr. Roh took office with 36 percent of the vote, today there were no major accusations of disappearing ballots, intimidation at the polls or computer fraud in the counting.
"In 1987 there was a lot of vote buying," said Chung Won Bok, a 45-year-old worker at Korea Telecom, as he stood on the steps of a polling place in a working-class neighborhood on the western fringes of Seoul on Friay. "I even received a little present from a candidate then," he said.
But this year, he added, "I've seen very little of that."
All day long Korean families could be seen lining up, many with young children in tow, outside schools and neighborhood offices, clutching their national identity cards and the small stamps used in many Asian nations to seal important documents. Each was given a numbered paper ballot, stuffed into giant green metal bins at more than 15,000 locations across the country. At times the atmosphere seemed festive, with friends moving from the polling places to coffee houses and department stores after voting.

HEADLINE: '92 Office Party: Bah to Mistletoe and Liquor

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
After several years of recession-prompted Scrooge-ism, businesses are giving holiday office parties again this year. Caterers, florists and rent-a-Santa services across the nation report a resurgence of the traditional fete. They also say there has been a widespread transformation of the custom.
In an attempt to banish the litigious potential of holiday office parties past, where liquor and libidos ran freely, corporate hosts are holding "interactive parties," events where everything from bumper cars to competitive snowflake-cutting keeps guests busy -- and away from the dark corners and the bar. 
 In New York City, companies from Chase Manhattan Bank to MTV are giving parties that are decidedly more Barnum & Bailey than they are Charles Dickens. Their caterers are transforming anything from Dezerland, a complex of catering halls and game rooms on the West Side, to the New York Public Library into amusement parks for a night. And they hire corps of performers to pour on live entertainment as heavily as companies used to pour champagne.
In fact, when Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, held its holiday party at the New York Public Library last week, magicians, Santa Claus and Wendy Brackman, proprietor of Wendy's Wacky Hats, who fashions party hats out of paper plates for guests, roamed the stately rooms. The sideshows all but supplanted the punch bowl. "Guests were so bombarded with entertainment they couldn't think about anything else," said Ms. Brackman, whose company is based in Brooklyn.
There were even more entertainers at Chase Manhattan's holiday party at Metro Tech in Brooklyn last week. "It was like a total eclipse of party acts," Ms. Brackman said. "Everybody from Gooen's Baloowins to Mr. Face Paint was there."
Linda Kaye, president of Birthdaybakers Partymakers, a Manhattan business that specializes in interactive parties, said: "We used to call these stunts icebreakers. Now the icebreakers fill the evening."
Paul Hencke, an editor of Research Recommendations, a weekly publication of the National Institute of Business Management, said more companies would give more parties this year. But he said businesses increasingly take potential liability into consideration in planning their parties and include "protective devices."
"Employers are very sensitive to anything that has a legal aroma," Mr. Hencke said. "The incidence of sexual harassment claims soars after holiday parties, and there is a growing concern about liability in cases of excess alcohol consumption, as well. Most companies have eliminated an open bar in favor of one that is controlled by a professional bartender, and they provide employees with transportation home."
Dozens of national corporations have sought the advice of his company, an Alexandria, Va., concern that watches business trends, in designing holiday festivities for employees. Among the recommendations he makes are that a weeknight should be chosen for the event and that the invitation should specify when the party will end.
These concerns, compounded by strained budgets, have wrought other changes in the office party. The buffet has replaced the sit-down dinner, there have been scattered reports of cash bars and employers have begun to give luncheons instead of evening get-togethers. Restaurateurs in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles say that rather than huge company-wide parties, employers are giving small lunches or dinners for departments within their organizations.
"Employees appreciated the intimacy," said Sharon Destephano, a spokeswoman for Jacoby & Meyers, the legal firm, which last year held small dinners instead of a large party for all the employees. Last week, the firm held a company-wide party to celebrate its 20th anniversary as well as the holidays, but Ms. Destephano said the firm planned to go back to smaller parties next year. She added that circumventing possible litigation was not the reason for the company's smaller party format.
 
'Urge for a Lavish Party'
 But Andrew Sherwood, president of Goodrich & Sherwood, the Manhattan-based human resource consulting firm, said "these concerns are all pervasive." In the grim economic climate in recent years, he said, there have been fewer situations that provided a social setting for possible sexual harassment or over-imbibing. But now the mood is upbeat, he added, and "businesses are faced with the urge for a lavish party and the potential litigious pitfalls."
"I can't tell you how many harassment complaints we get after office parties," he said. "Careers are destroyed every year."
The spot beneath the mistletoe has become a war zone. Indeed, florists said mistletoe sales had plummeted. "Kissing's got dangerous," said Dagny Duval, president of Plant Specialists, a company that supplies floral services to offices in the New York area. "Maybe they should change the tradition from kissing to hugging."
But even a ho-ho-ho kind of hug is starting to seem like a throwback. "I'm noticing a lot less gals wanting to sit on the lap," said Eugene Karpin, a freelance Santa Claus who lives in Manhattan and has been appearing in his red velvet suit in midtown stores for 24 seasons. "Even Santa isn't safe."
And the bar is still dangerous territory. Last week, a guest on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" said she had ruined her life by drinking too much at an office Christmas party. Caterers said most employers offer only beer, wine and soda. But even beer and wine can stimulate unwanted winks and unsought soliloquies about office policies.
"The key is diversion," Mr. Hencke said. "You have to keep people away from the bar and involved in group activities."
The solution appears to be the interactive party.
The entertainment industry is already producing high-technology interactive parties. For its company party on Thursday, MTV turned a Manhattan club into a series of human-scale computer games in which guests became players.
"The theme was 'virtual reality,' " said the party's planner, Tinker Bow, president of Mood Food caterers in Manhattan. "The idea was to get people out of the corners, out of little cliques and couplings, and get everybody from people in the mail room to the C.E.O. to play. Movement is essential."
To keep employees circulating, some record companies have rented a floor at Dezerland, which has game rooms, batting cages and bumper cars, and have given each guest a bumper car for the evening.
"We're not the Waldorf-Astoria," said Dezerland's manager, Jeffrey Zelin. "But I have bumper cars full of the black-tie crowd, sometimes two or three parties a night. I had to turn parties away this holiday season."
So far, there have been no reports of Pin-the-Beard-on-the-Santa, but the corporate party fashion has taken a turn toward the toddler birthday party. In fact, Ms. Brackman of Wendy's Wacky Hats has noticed "a big increase in office parties for the whole family, with everything from finger painting to fortunetelling."
Mr. Sherwood of Goodrich & Sherwood said, "People tend to be on their best behavior when their spouses and children are around." Both he and Mr. Hencke of the National Institute of Business Management encourage family parties.
So do party professionals. But most say that children are merely a foil for the child inside the workaday professional. "You should see their eyes light up when I make them a great funny hat," Ms. Brackman said of the adults.
Certainly, the interactive office party poses a new set of social challenges. Just how is one supposed to nibble a canape while steering a bumper car in one's best taffeta?

Companies
National Health Laboratories will pay $111 million to settle complaints that it fraudulently billed Medicaid and Medicare programs for medical tests it performed. The company and its president, Robert Draper, pleaded guilty to the charges in Federal court in Los Angeles, and Mr. Draper resigned. [Page 1.]
Peter Lynch, the famous stock picker, is returning to Fidelity Investments, but only as a coach of the firm's younger analysts and only for two days a week. Mr. Lynch managed the spectacularly successful Magellan fund before retiring two years ago. [37.] 
 Infinity Broadcasting plans to appeal the F.C.C.'s decision to fine it $600,000. The radio company said Howard Stern's broadcasts were "not actionably indecent." [37.]
Sears, Roebuck dismissed John T. Lundegard as chairman and chief executive of its Western Auto Supply division but would not discuss the reasons. [39.]
Robert Farrell is stepping down as the chief stock market analyst at Merrill Lynch although he will remain as a senior investment officer. Richard McCabe, a first vice president, will succeed Mr. Farrell on Jan. 1. [39.]
A California company, 3DO, plans a high-end video game system that is attracting attention because it is backed by Japanese consumer electronics companies and Hollywood. [39.]
Peter R. Kann reportedly angered Dow Jones employees this week by saying it was unnecessary for the company to adopt a written policy banning discrimination against employees based on their sexual orientation. [39.]
Time Warner is planning to shrink its 21-member board by reducing the number of both inside and outside directors, several executives close to the board said. An executive close to the board said the plan was to have 14 or 15 board members. [39.]
 
 Markets
Stocks surged sharply higher, driven by the heaviest trading in three years. Trading was fueled by the "triple witching hour," when options and futures contracts expire. Big Board volume was 389.3 million shares, and the Dow rose 44.04, to 3,313.27. [37.]
Treasury bond prices were unchanged to lower in lackluster pre-holiday trading. The yield of the Treasury's 30-year bond was unchanged at 7.42 percent. [46.]
Crude oil futures rallied again as traders scrambled to close out positions on the spot January contract. [45.]
The dollar moved higher. Gold prices were lower. [45.]
 
 The Economy
New standards for banks take effect today and require tougher and swifter regulatory action against the weakest banks. But fears that there would be an avalanche of bank failures now appear to be unfounded. [37.]
Paul Mozer has reportedly agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts in connection with last year's Government bond scandal involving Salomon. Mr. Mozer is accused of filing false bids in Treasury auctions. [39.]
Businesses are giving more holiday office parties than they have in recent years. But companies that provide services for such parties say the custom had been transformed into "interactive parties," where less liquor is consumed. [1.]
 
 Your Money
Prenuptial agreements have come into vogue as a result of changes in divorce law. But they are increasingly complex financial documents and they are expensive to draw up. [35.]
G.M. did well when it sold 55 million new shares last spring, but the offering has not been a good deal for the investors who bought them at the offering and have held them since. [35.]
Picking an insurance company is an important decision in light of the recent failures of a number of major life insurers. [36.]

HEADLINE: An Unbroken Tradition of Giving to Neediest

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
The year was 1922. Warren G. Harding was in the White House and Rudolph Valentino was the reigning matinee idol. Six-year-old Virginia Goldman was living in an apartment on 181st Street in the Inwood section of Manhattan, near the site where workers would later build the George Washington Bridge.
Almost a decade earlier, Virginia's parents had started contributing to a new charity sponsored by The New York Times. That year, Virginia joined them for the first time. She carefully stuck a dime -- her entire life savings -- to a piece of paper using paste that she made from flour and water. She signed the letter and her mother mailed it. 
 Thus began a tradition that continues to this day.
Last week, Virginia Miles (nee Goldman), a 76-year-old marketing consultant in Englewood, N.J., wrote a check for $100 to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, marking 70 straight years that she has given.
Through wars and natural disasters, recessions and expansions, marriages and divorces, moves across town and across the country, some people pride themselves on donating to the Neediest Cases year after year. For them, mailing a check to the fund is a hallowed ritual of the holidays.
"It wouldn't be Christmastime if I didn't do it," Mrs. Miles said. "It's become my own personal tradition to watch for the first article in The Times on the fund and then send the money. I don't want to break the streak."
In 1948, Fred H. Hill had just left the Army and was opening his own real-estate firm in Manhattan. Soon after he bought his first brownstone -- a purchase that he would repeat thousands of times over the years -- he mailed a check for $50 to the fund. Last week, Mr. Hill, now 77, gave $500, his 45th donation in a row.
Since the early years of this century, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has used donations from people like Mr. Hill to help thousands of New Yorkers who lack food, clothing, shelter, health care and other services. The New York Times pays for the fund's overhead, so all gifts are given directly to seven charities. This year's appeal ends on Feb. 28.
Hortense H. Hirsch first donated to the Neediest Cases shortly after her 3-year-old son, John, died of diabetes in 1917. She contributed every year in his memory until she died in 1990 at the age of 103. Since then, her 72-year-old daughter, Carol H. Kridel of Manhattan, has taken up the tradition. She sent $100.
"I am so thrilled that I am in a position that I can do this," Mrs. Kridel said. "I believe in what the fund does and I believe that it is a way to honor my mother and my brother. It brings tears to my eyes when I even talk about it."
Dave Schoenfeld first gave to the Neediest Cases in 1933 to honor the birth of his daughter, Florence. Every year after that, he mailed a check to the fund in the amount of her age. When she became an adult, she inherited the tradition. Last week, Florence Glazer, now a 59-year-old receptionist who lives in Yonkers, sent $59 to the fund.
"This is continuity," she said. "It's keeping up something that he started for me. It's another way of keeping his memory alive."

HEADLINE: Clinton Wants Wife at Cabinet Table

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 18

 BODY:
Hillary Clinton has sat at corporate board tables, campaign strategy tables and lawyers' round tables. Now, President-elect Bill Clinton and his aides say she will be welcome to sit at his Cabinet table as well.
Because of a law enacted after President John F. Kennedy named his brother Robert as Attorney General, Mr. Clinton cannot legally place his wife in the Cabinet. But she has been a political and policy adviser to him in the campaign and the transition, and he has made it clear that she will continue to play that role in his Administration. 
 Mr. Clinton said in an interview in The Wall Street Journal today that he hoped his wife would attend Cabinet meetings. "She knows more about a lot of this stuff than most of us do," he said.
At a news conference called this week to announce Cabinet appointments, the President-elect did not hesitate to tell reporters that Mrs. Clinton had helped him pick his advisers. "She advised me on these decisions, as she has on every other decision I've made in the last 20 years," he said.
 
'Free to Attend' Meetings
 George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, continued in the same vein at a news briefing today, when he was asked if he expected Mrs. Clinton to participate frequently in decision-making sessions at the White House.
"I don't know how many she'll attend, but certainly she'll be free to attend when she feels she can make an addition, and that's probably a lot," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "She obviously can contribute on a number of issues having to do with children, family, but I wouldn't want to limit it in any way or expand on it in any way right now."
Aides have said that she has helped Mr. Clinton select Cabinet members in much the same way that she helped plot campaign strategy.
"Clearly, as First Lady and as one of his closest advisers, she will have a role in his Administration," said Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary. "Beyond that, I think the Governor's statement speaks for itself."
The role of the President's wife has always been a subject for debate, particularly during the years of such close Presidential confidantes as Abigail Adams, Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosalynn Carter and Nancy Reagan. But Mrs. Clinton's much more publicly acknowledged influence has raised new questions.
Many people who are uncomfortable with the notion that she might act as an unelected co-President have been quick to revive the phrase Mrs. Clinton used early in the campaign: "If you vote for him, you get me."
But the evidence of Mrs. Clinton's influence has been encouraging to some women's groups, whose members have expressed frustration with Mr. Clinton's naming only one woman to his Cabinet so far, Donna E. Shalala, the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin who was chosen to be Secretary of Health and Human Services. Other appointments of women have been to sub-Cabinet-level positions.
In a letter sent to Little Rock today, Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, asked Mr. Clinton to slow his appointments process so that more women can be considered for top posts.
"If the trend you have established in your Cabinet appointments continues, it is probable that you will appoint fewer women to the Cabinet than Presidents Carter, Reagan or Bush," she wrote.
Perhaps in part in response to some of those complaints Mr. Clinton has apparently expanded his search for Secretary of Energy. Clinton transition aides said tonight that he had interviewed Hazel R. O'Leary, a Minnesota utility executive, for the post, but they would not say whether she had replaced Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado, who is retiring, as the leading contender for the job.
Ms. O'Leary, 55 years old, is executive vice president of the Northern States Power Company. She would be the third black person named to the Clinton Cabinet if she got the appointment.
Ms. Smeal added: "You have the opportunity to shatter the glass ceiling in our generation, and -- at the very least -- improve upon your predecessors' records. It seems incredible that you would consider doing less."
Lynne Cutler, a Clinton transition aide who has helped draw up lists of women for possible Administration appointments, defended Mr. Clinton against the criticism. When all the appointments are completed, she said, women will be represented fairly.
"It's fair to say a lot of people have raised the issue, and it certainly is a concern," Ms. Cutler said. "This isn't a we-they situation. All of us inside feel the same way."
Women have been mentioned for some unfilled Cabinet posts like Secretary of Agriculture and Attorney General, but Mr. Clinton is close to offering senior positions to several more men, including Warren M. Christopher, the transition director, for Secretary of State and Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Armed Service Committee, for Secretary of Defense.
Mr. Clinton met with Mr. Aspin at the Governor's Mansion here today, but Mr. Stephanopoulos said no Cabinet selections would be made until Monday.

HEADLINE: Make-or-Break Time for Stores

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Across the country, cash registers have been ringing since Thanksgiving, pealing a tune many of the nation's retailers have not heard with such strength in four years. But the countdown to Christmas really begins today.
Traditionally, the Saturday before Christmas is the second-busiest selling day of the season, surpassed only by the day after Thanksgiving. And over the last few years consumers have telescoped more and more of their shopping into the week ending on Christmas Eve. 
 Because the next few days are so important, most retailers refuse to provide specifics about how they have done so far. Fresh statistics should start to trickle out on Monday and Tuesday.
 
8% Rise Is Reported
 But a telephone survey conducted on Tuesday and released yesterday by Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, showed that retailers nationwide have experienced an 8 percent increase in comparable-store sales since Thanksgiving and expect the season to finish an average 9 percent ahead of last Christmas. The survey covered 40 of the accounting firm's retailing clients.
Department stores like Kmart say toys like voice-activated trucks are moving well. So are Rollerblades and Barbie dolls. F.A.O. Schwarz in San Francisco is selling caravans of Barney, the popular purple dinosaur.
Store owners and analysts were expecting a pickup in Christmas sales, if only because the last three years have been filled with disappointment. Those expectations were buoyed in recent weeks by positive signs on the economy and Bill Clinton's election as President, developments that bolstered consumer confidence.
"People seem to feel better than they did a year ago, and it is starting to have an effect, " Michael Stemen, president of R. H. Macy & Company's flagship store in Manhattan, said yesterday.
He said sales of men's dress shirts and ties were "very big," and that watches and fine and costume jewelry were moving out of the women's accessories department.
But shoppers are not spending much on the more frivolous items.
"Practicality is the name of the game," this year, said Cynthia Cohen Turk, president of Marketplace 2000, a Coral Gables, Fla., marketing and strategy consulting firm whose clients are mostly retailing and consumer products companies. "We are not going back to sterling silver Perrier bottle holders."
But the gains so far are not being enjoyed equally across the country. Retailers in the Northeast are reporting better sales and traffic in their stores, but last weekend's violent storms hit many hard. Business is extremely strong in Florida, especially in hurricane-ravaged South Florida. But Texas is said to be spotty: stores in Houston are doing very well, not as well in Dallas.
And in recession-torn California, Ms. Turk said, retailing success varies from one neighborhood to the next, especially in the Los Angeles area.
Gloria Salvador, owner of a gift and ice cream shop in San Simeon, Calif., south of San Francisco, said sales were great until May, "and then it went on a real down slide."
As Ms. Salvador browsed recently through the accessories department at Macy's in San Francisco, she said she planned to spend about $1,500 on gifts, about the same as last year. But she said she would be spending the same amount to buy more items.
Caution is also the watchword in Detroit, but for different reasons.
At Saks Fifth Avenue's store in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., Diane Merz, 46, said she was worried about President-elect Clinton, who did not get her vote.
In fact, uncertainty about the policies of the incoming Administration spurred Mrs. Merz and her husband to do some heavy spending on themselves recently: they bought a Lexus SE400.
At the Lakeside Mall in Sterling Heights, Mich., recently, Timothy Wranosky, a 24-year-old engineer at G.M., said the troubled company's health insurance changes will leave him with less money to spend after Jan. 1. As a result, the Wranosky family is cutting 10 people from its shopping list.
In Atlanta, retailers seem to agree this year's season has been better than 1991.
"Customers started shopping at Thanksgiving, and they've continued straight through," said Donald Hess, president of Parisian Inc., a Birmingham, Ala., clothing chain that opened two stores in Atlanta just in time for the Christmas shopping season.
There are no single hot areas, he said. "I can't point to any particular area except very specialized items like our videotape on 100 years of Alabama football," he said.
 
Pickup in Florida
 Armed with insurance checks to cover damages suffered during Hurricane Andrew, consumers are turning out in droves in the Miami area. But again, much of the spending seems to be for items that do not carry a big price tag.
"A lot of people in South Florida are replenishing their music libraries," said Ann Liss, president of Spec's Music Stores, a company that has 64 outlets, 62 of them in Florida. "With all of the problems we have had down here, from Eastern Airlines to the banks to the hurricane, it is nice to see people spending some money."

HEADLINE: After a Night of Unity at the Apollo, Optimism Wavers

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Something happened at the Apollo Theater in Harlem on Thursday night. A documentary film about black G.I.'s liberating Jewish concentration camp prisoners during World War II brought an audience of 1,200 blacks and Jews to tears. They spoke of common ground, embraced and passionately agreed that together, they had experienced a rare, powerful moment -- a catharsis in the increasingly hostile relations between blacks and Jews in New York City.
But in the colder light of day, many wondered whether theirs was a lasting epiphany on race relations or a moment as fleeting as it was strongly felt. And yesterday, unlike the night before, not everyone could agree. Some considered the evening at the Apollo a turning point, while others feared the truce would be about as permanent as those jaunty waves across the trenches between British and German soldiers in the early days of World War I. 
 Some dismissed the event as a public relations stunt. Calling it "just cosmetic," Rabbi Shmuel Butman, a leading figure in the Lubavitcher community in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, declined to attend. But Mayor David N. Dinkins, who faces a re-election campaign that may well turn on racial fears and tensions and who has spent the last few weeks trying to repair his damaged relationship with Orthodox Jews, sought comfort from the evening.
 
'Tremendously Helpful'
 "He is very optimistic about the future after this showing last night," said a spokeswoman, Ruby Ryles. "He thought it was tremendously helpful in bringing attention to what Jews and blacks have in common."
The film, "Liberators: Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II," was also shown Thursday night on WNET, the public television station that broadcast the documentary for the first time ever last month. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the financier Felix G. Rohatyn, and others who had viewed it on Nov. 9 at a Lincoln Center screening urged the Mayor to press for the documentary to be broadcast more widely to highlight moments of harmony between blacks and Jews. Mr. Jackson called Percy E. Sutton, the owner of the Apollo Theater, and Mr. Dinkins asked Howard J. Rubenstein, a public relations consultant who has helped the Mayor build bridges to the Jewish population in the past, to coordinate the evening -- as well as the kosher/soul food party for 1,500 that followed.
If the stage was occupied by the heroes and the victims of World War II, the audience was filled with some of the most prominent figures in the city, ranging from the Rev. Al Sharpton and Betty Shabazz, the widow of Malcolm X, to Peggy Tishman of the Jewish Community Relations Council, Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem and Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney.
But it was the documentary film that brought people together. It also prompted different reactions in different viewers.
Richard Green, executive director of the Crown Heights Youth Collective, had brought 45 young people, blacks and a few Hasidim, by bus from Brooklyn to see the film. Afterward, his charges stood in line outside the theater to get autographs from the stars of the documentary, the aged black veterans who as young men had liberated German concentration camps, and who at the Apollo were reunited with some of the Jews they had rescued.
 
'A Sense of Heroes'
 "It gave the kids a sense of heroes -- something besides Michael Jordan," Mr. Green said. He added that the sight of needy Jews depending on blacks for salvation was novel for the youngsters. He found it salutary. "Usually, blacks are seen benefiting from Jewish giving and altruism," he said, referring to such cases as Jewish civil rights organizers descending on the segregated South, Jewish philanthropists and Jewish labor organizers helping blacks join unions. "This showed it is also reciprocal."
But Rabbi Avi Weiss of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale seemed less comfortable with that role reversal. He praised the film, calling it "very, very important," but quickly added that schoolchildren should simultaneously be taught "that Jews were also liberators." He said that "too often, Jews are seen by certain elements of the white and black population as either victims or victimizers."
"It's important that the flip-side also be shown," Rabbi Weiss said.
 
'A Real Spiritual Moment'
 The rabbi, an outspoken critic of Mr. Dinkins's handling of the Crown Heights disturbances, said that while the evening was mostly "symbolism," he noticed that the participants in the Thursday night event "shared a real spiritual moment."
It wore off rather quickly.
Wilbert A. Tatum, the publisher of The Amsterdam News, was one of 20 or so prominent blacks and Jews who were invited after the film to a round table discussion on Channel 13 moderated by Charlie Rose. Mr. Tatum said he almost did not go on after learning that Rabbi Weiss was also invited. "I did not want to make something as serious as this a circus," he said. Coaxed by Mr. Rose and others, he eventually changed his mind. Mr. Tatum, usually a passionate debater, kept his temper in check all evening -- even after Mr. Weiss repeatedly denounced WLIB, a black-owned radio station. During one attack, Mr. Tatum turned on him and, picking up a faintly Yiddish accent, said, "enough already."
Rabbi Weiss was also subdued during the discussions, though later he called the event an "extravaganza" and "a media bite." He returned to his past laments, demanding justice for the killing of Yankel Rosenbaum and complaining that the Mayor "never calls me 'Rabbi' -- he calls me 'Avi Weiss,' or 'Weiss and his ilk.' "
 
Resentment Surfaces
 Resentment over seemingly small slights were felt on both sides, and at times it seemed to poke through the giddy good feeling of the evening. The Rev. Herbert Daughtry, the pastor of the House of the Lord Church in Brooklyn, said he was annoyed that Channel 13 had identified him on the screen only as as a "community activist," saying, "even though they managed to get all of Avi Weiss's titles in." But he said he shrugged it off "because in the midst of euphoria, who wants to be a wet blanket?"
But he noted that for all its emotional power, the Apollo gathering and the discussion that followed failed to address "what separates us." Mr. Daughtry said he believed that everyone's lack of candor had reduced the evening to a temporary "good and lovey-dovey" feeling.
 
'What the People Are Saying'
 Citing differences between blacks and Jews on such issues as the Palestinians, Professor Leonard Jeffries and Louis Farrakhan, Mr. Daughtry said, "This is what the people are saying. It may not all be based on fact, but you need to hear it."
He said the evening reminded him of the momentous night in New Hampshire during the 1984 Presidential campaign, when Jesse Jackson apologized for calling New York City "Hymietown."
"He got a standing ovation in a synagogue. People cried. We thought we had put it all behind us. The next day all we heard was that Jesse was not sincere."'
Even those who were enthusiastic about the evening's power warned that it by itself could not permanently alter racial conflicts in the city. If there was one area of agreement, it was that the Apollo event was only a first step. Voices as disparate as Rabbi Weiss and Mr. Sharpton argued that such meetings should be organized in schools, churches, synagogues and community centers throughout the city. "I think for a moment it did unite the communities," Mr. Tatum said. "But a catharsis only has a lasting effect if it is repeated over and over again."
 
'It Has to Make a Difference'
 Mr. Rohatyn, who as a child fled occupied France to escape the Nazis, called the film "incredibly moving" and said it should be shown in every school in the city. But the financier, who has long predicted economic ruin for New York City, has grown just as gloomy about the state of its race relations. Of the evening at the Apollo, he said bleakly, "I think it has to make a difference -- if this doesn't, I don't know what will."
Dennis deLeon, Commissioner of Human Rights for New York City, took a more optimistic view, suggesting that while prominent city figures may have had an epiphany at the Apollo, the healing was already taking place in the city's neighborhoods -- undetected, at times, by the city's power elite. He said many people had already begun reaching out between communities because "they can't live with this tension."
"Ordinary people are not waiting for the media players to resolve it," he said. "They just do it."

HEADLINE: Bank 'Doomsday' May Not Be So Bad

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
To the pessimists, this weekend was supposed to be the bankers' doomsday. The scenario predicted by the House Banking Committee chairman, Henry B. Gonzalez; Ross Perot, and other influential figures was of a December surprise. They warned about an avalanche of bank failures, concealed by regulators and set off by new rules that take effect on Dec. 19 and require tougher and swifter action against the weakest banks.
But the deluge is turning out to be more of a trickle. 
 "The sky is not falling," said Andrew C. Hove Jr., chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But while many bankers are celebrating the fact there will be relatively few casualties, regulators and some lawmakers are still keeping their champagne bottles corked. They acknowledge it will be hard to repeat this year's record profits and point to California and the Northeast as signs that significant parts of the industry are still in for rough times.
On the whole, though, 1992 has been a remarkable year for most banks.
Reaping an unanticipated windfall from the lowest interest rates in decades, many of the nation's banks, large and small, have been strengthening their balance sheets. Such steps have been taken not only to avoid the wrath of the regulators, but also to take advantage of special new benefits for being strong, like lower deposit insurance premiums.
At the same time, the regulators have managed to avoid a raft of December and January failures by already taking over some of the sicker and larger institutions, including the Meritor Savings Bank of Philadelphia; the Heritage Bank for Savings in Holyoke, Mass.; the Howard Savings Bank of Newark, and the First City Bancorporation of Texas.
As a result, at latest count by both Washington officials and outside analysts, only about two dozen bank companies holding about $2.5 billion fall below the new guidelines requiring that they have shareholder capital of more than 2 percent of assets. These banks are ripe to be seized in the next few days unless they are somehow able to raise more money or persuade regulators to give them more time.
An additional 136 banks with assets of $36 billion are in the second-worst category and will require closer regulatory attention and possible seizure farther down the road, but not immediately. This is from an industry of more than 11,000 institutions holding assets of more than $3 trillion.
And regulators are revising their estimates of bank failures for 1993 and 1994. The new projections are expected to show marked improvements over earlier forecasts.
Some industry problems still lurk on the horizon, however.
Slumping real estate markets in California have shown few signs of bottoming out. The Northeast continues to suffer from economic problems like high office vacancy rates that are still taking a toll on the banks.
The number of banks, particularly large ones, on the closely watched "problem list" has been declining very slowly and still constitutes about 15 percent of the industry. Completing the savings and loan bailout will still require at least an additional $45 billion to $50 billion in new spending to shut down institutions and provide seed money for the Savings Association Insurance Fund, which protects depositors of failed institutions.
And any jump in interest rates could cause a new round of serious problems for even more profitable banks, many of which have been booking profits by buying Treasury securities whose values would plummet if rates rise.
 
Interest Rate Trap
 The concern is that the banks, by locking themselves into long-term fixed investments, could be devastated if inflation accelerates and forces them to borrow money at higher rates than their investments. That is precisely what happened to the savings and loan industry in the 1980's.
"It's impressive that the banks have the highest capital ratios since 1966, but there are still dichotomies within the industry," said Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who was recently selected ranking minority member of the House Banking Committee. "Strong banking is in inverse proportion to proximity to the coast, and to some degree, by size of institution."
He and other lawmakers expressed particular concern about any increase in the Federal deficit, which could provoke interest rates to rise and begin to take bank profits, and even some banks, down.
Mr. Hove of the F.D.I.C. said that while the regulators were closely watching the exposure of banks to swings in interest rates, he believed the industry was in no immediate danger. He said that about 1,200 banks, holding 10 percent of the industry's assets, have 20 percent or more of their investments in fixed-rate instruments of five years or longer.
"That shows those banks have a 20 percent exposure, but it also means that they do not have an exposure for the other 80 percent of their investments," he said.
He also said that because the industry would have its best year since records were compiled in the Great Depression, the $5.5 billion deficit of the bank insurance fund, which protects depositors, would doubtless improve by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: New Leader for University of Chicago

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The University of Chicago today named Hugo F. Sonnenschein, an economist and self-professed optimist who is the provost at Princeton University, as its next president.
When he takes over next July, Mr. Sonnenschein, a 52-year-old microeconomics theorist, will lead a university that in the last three years has produced three winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science. During that time the university has struggled through the same painful belt-tightening that has forced most major research universities to re-examine what they do. 
 "It's an enormous privilege and an enormous responsibility, and one that we look forward to," Mr. Sonnenschein said at a news conference in Ida Noyes Hall, accompanied by his wife, Elizabeth.
He will replace Hanna H. Gray, who after 15 years as president will retire at the end of June to return to teaching at Chicago. Mrs. Gray is one of the few women to lead a major university.
 
Discussions With Yale
 Last week, Nannerl O. Keohane, president of Wellesley College in Massachusetts, was named the next president of Duke University.
With the appointments of Ms. Keohane last week and Mr. Sonnenschein today, two of the four major university presidencies that were open this academic year have been filled. Columbia University and Yale University have not yet acted.
In the unusually competitive atmosphere created by the four simultaneous vacancies, search committees have felt added pressure, knowing that their top candidates were probably also being wooed by the other universities. Yale is believed to have had substantive discussions with both Mr. Sonnenschein and Ms. Keohane.
Mr. Sonnenschein refused to talk today about any contact he may have had with other universities. Howard G. Krane, chairman of the university's board, said Mr. Sonnenschein's name was the first to have been nominated after Mrs. Gray announced last April that she would resign.
"There was never a short list," Mr. Krane said. "This was our choice."
Mr. Sonnenschein's specialty in economics is equilibrium and game theory, the mathematical study of strategic behavior in social situations. He said he may teach at Chicago, adding that he looked forward to working with the university's Nobel-winning economists: Gary S. Becker, who won the Prize in 1992; Ronald H. Coase, in 1991, and Merton H. Miller, 1990. Mr. Sonnenschein said he may even join the economics department if the department approves.
He said today that despite the financial difficulties facing Chicago and other universities -- Chicago is in the second year of a faculty hiring freeze -- he believed higher education in America was heading into a promising, though difficult, future.
"This is not all bad," said Mr. Sonnenschein, who was born in Brooklyn and graduated from the University of Rochester, then received his master's and doctoral degrees from Purdue University. "The opportunity to help a great university make the choices it has to make is a challenge."
He added: "I'm optimistic for this place. I'm optimistic that institutions as fine and wonderful as the best institutions in this country really will be more appreciated in the future."
Mr. Sonnenschein taught economics at Princeton and various universities until 1988, when he became dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. He returned to Princeton in 1991 as provost.
As provost, Mr. Sonnenschein was the second in command at Princeton. He also headed a strategic planning committee responsible for preparing Princeton for the 21st century.
His easygoing manner contrasts with the formal style of his predecessor at Chicago, Mrs. Gray, as much as the gentle country setting of Princeton differs from the tough streets of Chicago.
The University of Chicago is also a much larger institution with about 11,000 students, nearly twice as many as Princeton; six professional schools and a teaching hospital. Only 3,300 of Chicago's students are undergraduates, and the university is often viewed as an academic pressure cooker where extracurricular life ranks a distant second to studies.
Lori King, a fourth-year philosophy major from New York City and the editor of the student newspaper, said she took Mr. Sonnenschein's Princeton background as a hopeful sign that he will be attuned to the needs of undergraduate students.
Mr. Sonnenschein said that he was "obsessively interested in undergraduate education" and that there may be room for improvement in that area at Chicago.
When he was an 18-year-old undergraduate in danger of flunking out of the University of Rochester, he said, he spent a summer at the University of Chicago studying poetry and mathematics. He said the experience helped him get back on track.
Members of the search committee said that after 15 years under one president, they had sought someone from outside the university who might bring a fresh perspective. J. Paul Hunter, a professor of English who was chairman of a faculty advisory committee to the trustees, said Mr. Sonnenschein was "not only a unanimous choice but an enthusiastic choice."
"He explains us very well," Mr. Hunter said. "He has a knack for seeing what people are doing in fields besides his own and making others understand what's good and important about that work."
Mr. Sonnenschein will be the 11th president in the university's 101-year history.

HEADLINE: Peotone Journal;
747's May Drown Out the Sound of Corn Growing

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEOTONE, Ill., Dec. 18

 BODY:
This neighborly village 44 miles south of Chicago seems an unlikely stage for bitter charges, billion-dollar schemes and political intrigue.
But in the last few days the town has been abuzz with talk of nasty letters mailed instead of Christmas cards, protest signs and late night telephone threats to the village president. People here cannot recall tempers ever being shorter. 
 The trouble started last month when Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican, said the rich farmland near Peotone would be a great place for the Chicago area's third major airport.
Most of the town opposes the idea. But losing farmland is not the major issue. Losing a way of life is what frightens residents. As one woman put it, Peotone is part of a fading America.
The local newspaper prints bowling scores. A big lunch costs $5, including the tip. Children play safely outside well after dark. Neighbors still help raise barns. At night, people can see the stars. In the morning, they can hear the birds sing. The place has 3,000 people and not one traffic light.
But building a third airport has long been a dream of Illinois politicians, frightened by the sluggish economy and desperate for jobs, patronage and glory. Most recently, Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago pushed, shoved and banged his fist in an unsuccessful campaign to get the third airport built within his city.
Thwarted by Republicans in the State Legislature, Mr. Daley, a Democrat, angrily abandoned the plan. Then the Governor suggested Peotone (pronounced PEE-ah-tone and meaning "a good place to come" in the language of the Pottawatomi Indians), even though it is about an hour drive from downtown Chicago.
Pilots know Peotone as the name and location of a popular radio beacon used in navigation, but most passengers lack that familiarity. A Chicago Tribune writer took a taxi to Peotone and reported that the ride cost $60 one way.
"We love the fact that no one knows where we are located, and we wish it would stay that way," said Carol Henrichs, an opponent of the airport. "We don't want to become a suburb. We want to remain a rural community. Their plans will ruin our culture."
Over the years, Peotone has become a popular place where people from the big city settle to escape the urban frenzy and to enjoy the fresh air, the inexpensive food at "R" Place diner and the sound of silence. "It's so quiet here, you can hear the corn grow," said a farmer with good ears.
But lately anger has been growing faster than anything else.
The tension has got so thick that the village president, Richard Anderson, recently resigned in the middle of a town board meeting. He said he had been receiving threatening telephone calls and letters. Many residents complained that Mr. Anderson had not been aggressive enough in opposing the airport.
What happens next is uncertain. Mr. Daley does not support the Peotone site, largely because it is not in Chicago, and in a few days he may have more than enough influence to stop it: his younger brother, Bill, a Chicago banker, is regarded as a leading contender for the post of Secretary of Transportation in the Clinton Administration. That possibility has brought a smile to many a windswept face here.
But not everyone is against the airport, and many people believe it will eventually be built after the politicians retreat into a back room and play a few rounds of "Let's Make a Deal."
There is room for negotiation. Governor Edgar wants the airport or some other big project to generate jobs and votes. The Governor's spokesman said Mr. Edgar was willing to discuss other sites.
Mr. Daley also wants, as he says, "jobs, jobs, jobs." He is eager to have a $2 billion casino development built in Chicago, which has been struggling with budget problems, crumbling schools and rising crime. So far, the Governor has opposed the casino, but politicians rarely say never, and even less often do they mean never.
"They'll make a deal or something," a Peotone woman said as she sipped coffee at "R" Place. "We're like poker chips. What the people want and need doesn't really matter."
Most people here say that building an airport would destroy this town by pulling it into the noisy, stress-packed 1990's.
"The only thing that bugs you here is the mosquitoes," said Faye Bowers, a nurse who treats gunshot victims and crack-addicted babies in a rough Chicago suburb. "I moved to Peotone to get away from the craziness. This is like your childhood was. And I don't want to grow up."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Aides Seek Bigger Cut In Deficit Early

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton's economic advisers are recommending that he trim the deficit more than he had proposed in the election campaign so as to fulfill his pledge of halving the deficit within four years.
Seeing that estimates of the deficit for the 1996 fiscal year have soared since last spring, Mr. Clinton's economic advisers said they had called for the deficit to be reduced by about $145 billion for that year as against the $90 billion that he originally proposed. 
 Relying on the latest estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, Mr. Clinton's advisers forecast that the deficit would be about $290 billion in 1996, far higher than the estimate of $190 billion that the budget office made last March. The advisers said today that the estimate had risen for many reasons. One is that spending on health care has increased faster than anticipated.
Mr. Clinton's economic advisers made their proposals as part of a menu of options being presented to the President-elect this weekend in Little Rock, Ark. Four of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the options would include voluminous plans on the budget, trade, telecommunications, banking and manufacturing technology, converting some military factories to civilian use and building roads, bridges and other infrastructure.
 
Seeking Legislative Package
 Several Clinton advisers said his economic team is tentatively scheduled to meet with him next week to begin choosing options for a legislative package.
Noting that they and the President-elect want to signal their seriousness about cutting the deficit over the long term, the economic advisers said one option is to have certain spending cuts take effect either 18 months after Inauguration Day or when the unemployment rate falls to a certain level, perhaps 6.5 percent. Such cuts would occur over time so as not to undermine the fragile economic recovery.
The advisers would not tip their hand on details of the deficit-cutting proposals. But they said that when Mr. Clinton asked them to draft policy options, he did not ask for tax increase proposals beyond those he suggested in the campaign, notably higher income taxes on people earning more than $200,000 a year. Many economists say it will be almost impossible to cut the deficit in half without more tax increases.
Mr. Clinton's advisers are said to be leaning in favor of a small, temporary increase in deficit spending to speed economic growth and create jobs. But Mr. Clinton said after this week's economic conference in Little Rock that he had not made up his mind on such stimulus.
Any such plan would probably include increased public works spending and tax credits for investment in business equipment, his advisers said. They said Mr. Clinton might ask that a plan to spur the economy be prepared in order to have it available in case employment growth faltered.
 
Deficit Spending Considered
 One option being proposed is to carry out the four-year $220 billion Government investment program that Mr. Clinton called for in his campaign but to delay tax increases and spending cuts that had been planned to finance such spending. Economists say the resulting deficit spending would give the economy a boost.
Several Clinton advisers acknowledged that he had been too optimistic in saying he would raise $45 billion over four years by collecting more taxes from foreign corporations, suggesting he might not even be able to collect half that amount. The options present additional deficit cuts to offset that shortfall, they said.
One option presented to Mr. Clinton, aides said, was increasing the minimum wage and the earned income tax credit to make sure that full-time workers do not live below the poverty line. Another option is to adopt a new budgeting system that would use an operating budget and a separate capital or investment budget.

HEADLINE: The Day the Ocean Came And Swept All Before It

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, L.I., Dec. 17

 BODY:
Danny Vooris saved the family cat, his Led Zeppelin record collection and most of his lizards from the water that rushed into his basement apartment here the morning of Dec. 11. But in the week since then, that, like the linoleum floor he has slept on, has been pretty cold comfort.
Almost all his possessions were destroyed. His wife had a nervous breakdown and was hospitalized. His 3-year-old son still follows him around, afraid that his father might be swept away. And, while vacuuming up the water that drained from his walls all week, he wondered again and again how, with Christmas looming, he would keep ahead of his many creditors and whether a Federal disaster declaration would rescue him. 
 "We got killed," said Mr. Vooris, a 29-year-old sanitation worker in Long Beach, as he recalled the driving rain and 90-mile-an-hour gusts that without warning caused the Atlantic Ocean, for the first time in his life, to swallow vast portions of the slender island where he grew up.
The only help from any relief agency the family has received so far, he said, was a box of canned chili beans and some baby food.
On the other side of Long Island, several rungs further up the economic ladder, Richard and Joanna Nabet spent the week drying out the two-story house they built 11 years ago in Bayville. They had had the foundation sealed, but that was no defense against the water that squeezed through the windowsills and filled the basement to a depth of four feet. "That gurgling," recalled Mrs. Nabet with a shudder, "the sound water makes as it comes through the walls."
In the week since the wind, the rain and the moon conspired to put their homes below sea level, families throughout the region have struggled to evict the ocean, salvage what they can and start again. How many people are badly hurting is still unknown. Though the Red Cross estimates that almost 20,000 homes were damaged during the storm, the extent of the ruin for individual families remains unclear.
 
A Painful Process
 But the experiences of the Vooris and Nabet families are no doubt being shared by thousands of others, and they show that for people who were hit hard, cleaning up has been a painstaking and painful process, one that will not end with President Bush's expected announcement of disaster relief for New York. Long after their plight slips out of the public eye, these families will still be wrestling to reorder lives that the nameless storm -- just a nasty December rain to many of their friends and neighbors -- so carelessly swept up and tossed about.
The Nabets got rid of all the water by Monday and began hosing down the walls to remove the muck and the smell of sewage from their backed-up septic system. In their newly remodeled basement, the walls, furniture and appliances in their children's rooms, the laundry room and the den were wrecked, as were the tools Mr. Nabet, a retired policeman, uses in his floor-refinishing business. They had no flood insurance to cover the damage, which they estimate at $75,000 to $100,000. Today, a pile of sodden mattresses, warped cabinets and a sofa sat by the curb.
"I kind of lost it a couple of times," said Mr. Nabet, 47, as he described a week spent mostly without electricity and entirely without gas or neighbors, all of whom fled for shelter elsewhere. "It's a hopeless feeling."
Part of the problem, Mr. Nabet said, was that many people did not seem to realize how much he and his neighbors have suffered since Long Island Sound and Oyster Bay rushed each other down his narrow street.
"You know, they say, 'You had no electricity or gas?' " he said. "We almost had no house."
 
'Like a War Zone'
 Mr. Nabet says the sudden gap between him and other residents of Bayville strikes him forcefully when he drives up a hill in the small, tidy town and sees nothing more unusual than Christmas lights. "Then I come back here and it's like a war zone," he said. The Red Cross set up a service center in town on Thursday, and Mrs. Nabet plans to visit in hopes of getting clothes and certificates for food at a local grocery store. Once a Federal disaster is declared, the Nabets plan to apply for low-interest loans to rebuild their home and business.
The week did have a positive side. There was the restraint displayed by the family dog, J.D., who waited 30 hours before Mr. Nabet could get him into a rowboat and push him to dry ground. "He was so happy to get to that little patch of dry land," Mr. Nabet said.
And there was the determination displayed by Richard Nabet, 21, who walked two and a half miles across flooded land, at times wading through freezing water chest deep, to reach his parents.
"You have to look at what you didn't lose," said Mrs. Nabet, 44. "We didn't lose life. We lost a lot, but we still have a lot."
 
Mention Brings Tears
 The only life the Vooris family lost was Mr. Vooris's favorite lizard. But they do not have much else left. Veronica Vooris, 24, returned from the hospital Wednesday. She still breaks into tears at the mention of the flood. "It's a nightmare," she said, beginning to tremble. "I've got nothing."
"Please, baby," Mr. Vooris pleaded. "You've got to be calm."
For Mrs. Vooris, the worst moment came when Danny Jr., having been carried out of the apartment to safety, raced back down the steps to find his parents, still inside, and fell into the swirling water. "I couldn't get the door open," his mother said. "He almost drowned."
The family's new plastic Christmas tree was destroyed, along with the children's toys, the television set and video-cassette recorder, Mr. Vooris's guitars and everyone's clothes. Because Mr. Vooris heard that children get 85 percent of their education at home, the couple recently bought a set of educational books and tapes for $1,565 through the school their 6-year-old daughter, Vanessa, attends. The tapes are destroyed, the dozens of volumes of the "New Book of Knowledge" still waterlogged. They have paid only one installment and the company recently called to demand the next.
Before the flood, Mr. Vooris borrowed $500 from his credit union to make repairs on his 1975 Cutlass, which, like scores of other cars in Long Beach, was swamped and probably destroyed by the flood. He cannot borrow more for at least six months, he said, and his credit is not good enough to get him a bank loan.
The Voorises said they had heard that if a disaster is declared they might qualify for an emergency grant. But they had no idea how to get such help. "When are they going to announce it?" Mrs. Vooris asked. "Where will I go to apply?"
The family rents their small apartment from Mrs. Vooris's parents, who charge them $700 a month for rent and utilities, and they say they cannot afford to move elsewhere. Mrs. Vooris's parents have given them new socks, sweatclothes and underwear, and other friends have pitched in.
This afternoon, a burly man in a blue sanitation uniform knocked on the door and Mr. Vooris stepped outside to talk. He returned with a big grin and a plastic bag full of toys.
"The guys on the job went out and got them this," he said. "I said, 'Wrap them up for Christmas?' He said, 'No, they need them now.' "
 
Sharing the Slingshot
 Danny Jr. seized the slingshot with a passion that portended much trouble to come, while Vanessa sat on the floor, stacking up the Barbie doll and toy microphone. "We're going to have to share this," she told her brother solemnly.
Christmas weighs heavily on Mr. and Mrs. Vooris. "We won't have that little pretty Christmas setting, with the little tree with the toys under it," Mrs. Vooris said, the tears beginning again. Her husband disagreed.
"My kids are going to have Christmas," he said grimly. "That's the bottom line."
The Nabets are planning to spend Christmas with relatives who have a dry home. Although the evergreen they chopped down in the woods was floating in salt water last weekend, by today it appeared to have recovered.
"We'll have a nice Christmas," Mr. Nabet said. "One we'll never forget, that's for sure."
"I'm putting that tree up," Mrs. Nabet said. "Come hell or high water."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Quiet Session; Gold Shows Some Losses

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved higher yesterday in what traders described as a quiet holiday-season session, with many market participants closing their trading accounts for the year.
Gold prices were lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.50, to $336.90 an ounce. The late bid at the Republic National Bank in New York priced gold at $337.00, off $1.20. 
 There were no new economic reports or significant international developments to inspire a sharp move in the currency markets, several traders said. One dealer described a very quiet session, with some participants leaving the trading desk for midafternoon Christmas shopping.
"There are very few players in the market at year-end," said Curtis Perkins, a currency dealer with Chemical Bank. "Most people are protecting what they made in the turbulent September period, and they do not want to give anything back."
Mr. Perkins referred to the wildly volatile currency dealings in the fall, which occurred as Germany refused to cut interest rates and leading currencies, like the British pound, came under tremendous selling pressure.
Among the currencies that lost strength to the dollar yesterday was the French franc, which had been under speculative pressure in recent days.
Andrew Hodge, vice president of Bank Brussels Lambert, said the franc had been getting support from intervention in the market from German monetary officials.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 5.3435 French francs, up from 5.3245 late Thursday. That was after the franc dropped in Europe, with the dollar quoted at 5.3445 French francs, up from 5.3390 late Thursday.
Elsewhere, the dollar closed at 123.05 yen in Tokyo, down 0.07 yen from Thursday's close. But it rose later in London to 123.25 yen. At the closing in New York, the dollar was quoted at 123.18 yen, up from 122.74 yen late Thursday.
The British pound fell to $1.5650 in London, from $1.5730 late Thursday. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.5665, down from $1.5780.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5645 German marks, up from 1.5575; 1.4090 Swiss francs, up from 1.3995; 1,406 Italian lire, up from 1,404.50, and 1.27525 Canadian dollars, up from 1.27345.
In Europe, the dollar's closing rates, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.5660 German marks, up from 1.5625; 1.4115 Swiss francs, up from 1.4025; 1.7600 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7565; 1,407.75 Italian lire, up from 1,403.00, and 1.2750 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2739.
Gold traded late in London at $337.05 an ounce, down from $338.30 late Thursday. In Zurich, the bid was $336.80, down from $338.25.

HEADLINE: Leaders Urge Trade Accord

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
President Bush, Prime Minister John Major of Britain and Jacques Delors, the president of the European Community's executive commission, called today for a global free trade agreement by mid-January.
But negotiators in the 108-nation talks remain far apart on a wide range of issues, and some American officials doubted today that a deal could be struck before the inauguration of Bill Clinton on Jan. 20. 
 "Some negotiators are privately gloomy, but you have to keep trying," said an American official who insisted on anonymity.
The comments by the three leaders nonetheless represented an unusually strong declaration of support for negotiations after years of more vague comments by heads of state. "We agreed that a sound Uruguay Round agreement is essential to boost worldwide economic growth, and we all agreed to conclude the GATT agreement in Geneva by mid-January," Mr. Bush said at the White House today after talking to Mr. Major and Mr. Delors.
Mr. Major flew here this morning after meeting with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada in Ottawa on Thursday, and he is scheduled to fly back to Britain on Sunday evening after spending the weekend with President Bush at his retreat at Camp David, Md. Conspicuously absent from his schedule of meetings was President-elect Clinton, although the two men spoke today by telephone.
Mr. Major supported Mr. Bush during the election campaign. But the British official insisted this evening that the two men did not meet on this trip only because Mr. Clinton had not yet finished developing his foreign policy positions.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Good for G.M., but Bad For Buyers of Its Offer

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla

 BODY:
MANAGERS at General Motors may not be rocket scientists when it comes to running a car company, but investors could pick up a few tips from them on the arcane subject of stock market timing.
G.M. was a seller of 55 million new common shares on May 19 -- a marketing coup that brought $2.1 billion in new funds to the company. A master of timing, G.M. pulled in $39 for each of the 55 million new shares. And the stock had traded as low as $26.88 only five months before. 
 By yesterday's close, though, G.M. had declined 15 percent from the offering price, ending the day at $33.125. For investors who bought during the post-offering euphoria and brokerage-firm recommendations that took shares up to $44, yesterday's close represented a 25 percent loss.
Publicly held companies are entirely justified, of course, in orchestrating their stock sales to take place at times when investors are particularly willing to buy. The stock market had been hitting a string of new highs when G.M. said in April that it would float a record $2.15 billion of new shares -- far greater than the previous record $1.46 billion stock offering of Conrail in 1987. It made sense for the troubled auto maker to put more securities into the market at a time when investors' appetites were healthy.
But did it make sense for investors? Not really. "The hype around G.M. was that the economy was coming around, and people weren't looking at the firm very closely and got pulled in," said John Markese, director of research at the American Association of Individual Investors. "And a secondary offering means more shares out there driving prices down eventually."
Yet in the headiness of grand promises of a new improved General Motors investors bought in anyway. As it turns out, history's largest-ever offering of stock makes for some good lessons in avoiding potential dogs.
To understand part of the reason why G.M. shares rallied, then fizzled, after the May offering, it helps to know how Wall Street peddles stock of wobbly companies. And stocks of healthy companies, for that matter.
In G.M.'s case, the auto maker had racked up a record $4.5 billion loss in 1991. The company's recurring promises of a new, improved, lean-and-mean G.M. sounded increasingly hollow. G.M. stock was trading at a fraction of its high of $56.875, reached in 1965.
Yet the nation's brokerage houses managed to peddle more than $2 billion of new G.M. shares last spring. The magic was in part a function of a quid pro quo of stock offerings that institutional investors say was at work in G.M.'s case: The customer agrees to buy into so-so offerings, and the issuer makes sure to include them next time there's a hot deal.
Other quirks of the financial world helped sell the offering, too. Institutional investors and other potential buyers of G.M. stock frequently owe a chit to brokerage firms that are part of the syndicate selling the stock. So institutions sometimes buy into new issues in order to let the brokerage house get the commission built into the offering price, settling a debt in the process.
Investors don't get lots of critical analysis about new issues like G.M.'s because analysts can't pontificate on the merits of a stock when the firm that employs them is part of the selling group of a new offering. The Securities and Exchange Commission tells brokerage houses that analysts are basically gagged from discussing a stock if the firm is going to profit from selling new shares. The idea: to minimize hyping of stocks that might inflate the price. The reality: investors who think analysts have something to contribute to their investment decisions don't get analyst feedback when they need it most.
Not that investors were necessarily deprived of sage advice. With gag orders off after the secondary issue was successfully completed, Dean Witter's auto analyst upgraded G.M. to a "buy" on June 3, when the stock was at $41.75. (The firm had downgraded G.M. on March 20, when the stock was at $39.13). Paine Webber added G.M. to its key "focus List" June 11 when the stock was at $43 -- within one point of its 52-week high. By Sept. 28, when G.M. closed at $32, Dean Witter downgraded G.M. -- a tad late for those who bought on Witter's advice at $41.75.
And Morgan Stanley, the biggest winner of fees on the G.M. deal as "lead" in the syndicate, bit the bullet on Sept. 23 and slashed G.M.'s earnings estimates for 1993 to $3.35 a share from $4.25. Morgan's $4.25 estimate far exceeded the average brokerage firm estimate at the time, which was $2.46 a share, according to Institutional Brokers Estimate System, which tracks earnings estimates.
Morgan is still among six stalwart firms with a "buy" rating on G.M., according to Zachs Investment Research, which also keeps tabs on analyst ratings and earnings estimates. The Wall Street count on G.M. today: Nine firms say to "hold" the stock -- a euphemism for running for the hills. Seven call it a "buy-hold," which is a lukewarm recommendation at best. And six say "buy."
Logic would have dictated that the selling of more than $2 billion of new G.M. shares would have been impossible given the company's black eyes last spring. Yet the impossible happened, and a number of investors are a little poorer as a result.
Instinct kept members of the National Association of Investment Clubs away from G.M. this year, said Tom O'Hara, director of the group. G.M. is only the 63d most popular stock owned by the club members, who "really look at the numbers," and apparently weren't impressed.
But other investors, perhaps caught up in the hopes that a one-time American institution might finally turn around, couldn't resist.
"The old cliche is true," said Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates, a research firm. "Stocks are sold, not bought."

HEADLINE: Dairy Wars: A Pitch to Local Pride;
Ad Agency Fires a Protectionist Broadside on Behalf of L.I.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST NORTHPORT, L.I., Dec. 18

 BODY:
In the latest twist in the border wars between New York and New Jersey, a small Long Island dairy has begun an advertising campaign that features a cow grazing contentedly on the asphalt in front of a petrochemical plant.
"Ever wonder why milk from New Jersey doesn't taste as fresh as ours?" the ad asks in bold black type. 
 The tongue-in-cheek campaign, which began this week in a weekly newspaper on the East End, touts the supposed advantages of milk that does not have to travel the extra hours on the bumpy highways from New Jersey to the Island.
But one basic fact is left out: none of the Long Island dairy's milk comes from Long Island cows.
 
No More Cows
 Oak Tree Farm Dairy, a family-run business here, has pasteurized, homogenized and distributed milk around Long Island for 50 years. Cows once grazed on its 37-acre property, but in the 1950's, the Cosman family, the dairy's owner, moved them upstate. Now, it trucks 18,000 gallons of milk daily from farms near Syracuse to the company's Long Island plant, where it is processed.
The absence of Long Island cows, however, has not stopped Oak Tree from firing a protectionist broadside intended to appeal to Long Island milk drinkers' local pride.
"There's a very strong sense of loyalty to 'buying Long Island,' and we want to capitalize on it," said Charlene Cosman, the dairy's chief financial officer. "People like the idea of keeping other Long Islanders working."
Miss Cosman also insisted that her company's milk was fresher and thus tasted better than her competitors' milk. Other dairies disagreed, and dairy experts were skeptical.
The campaign arrives amid heightened tension between New Jersey and New York. A few weeks ago, Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey announced a plan to lure away New York businesses. More recently, New York announced efforts to crack down on shoppers who cross the Hudson River to try to avoid New York's higher sales tax.
Dweck & Campbell, the Manhattan advertising agency that created the campaign, said it began work on it months before the border war began, but that it was pleased with the timing.
The ad is running in Dan's Paper, a free weekly that says it reaches 83,000 readers on the East End and in New York City. The agency plans to expand to other newspapers and is considering radio and television.
It is unclear whether the ad has had any impact or whether Long Islanders care where their milk comes from.
 
'From New Jersey?'
 At a Pathmark supermarket in Commack this afternoon, a few miles from the dairy, six customers picked up store-label milk and cream, under a hand-lettered sign saying they were from Tuscan Farms in Union, N.J. None were aware of the products' origins, but when asked whether they had a preference between New Jersey milk and Long Island milk, it was like asking Marines whether they loved the flag.
"This is from New Jersey?" asked Joe O'Connor, a retired construction worker from Smithtown. "Where can I get Long Island milk? I want to keep my money here."
Joan Ciliotta, a nurse from Fort Salonga, said she thought that Long Island milk might be fresher, but she said that would not affect what she bought. "I buy milk where it's convenient," she said.
Miss Cosman is banking on the idea that Long Islanders, hit hard by the current recession, will feel strongly about standing by one of their own.
Her father established the dairy in 1941, when there was, she said, a "dairy every 250 feet." Today, all three Cosman children work there.
The number of dairies on the Island has dwindled from more than 12 in the 1960's to 2 a few years ago. Oak Tree became the last when the other was bought by a group that wanted to convert the land into a polo field.
Miss Cosman said Oak Tree milk is sold in 500 convenience stores, groceries and delicatessens on Long Island. She declined to provide sales figures or information about profits.
Until five years ago, ads like Oak Tree's would have been unneeded, because New York law barred milk from out of state. Now, most of the milk sold on Long Island is processed elsewhere, much of it by two New Jersey companies: Tuscan Farms and Farmland Dairies in Wallington.
Miss Cosman said the ads simply highlight better quality. From the time the milk is homogenized and pasteurized, Oak Tree gets it into the stores faster, particularly on the East End, she said.
The ad states: "New Jersey milk must travel more miles than our milk to get to you. Plus it has to spend time near the New Jersey Turnpike, an activity that has never improved anything."
Not surprisingly, dairy executives in New Jersey are miffed.
"Since when is the Jersey Turnpike any worse than the Long Island Expressway?" said Colin Kagel, vice president of administration for Tuscan Farms. He added: "I was born in New York and raised in Long Island. I have nothing against Long Island. But we're all getting our milk from the same cows."
Asked to respond to the ad, David Bandler, a food science professor specializing in the dairy industry at Cornell University, said he was "hesitant" to become embroiled in the dispute. "This is not science," he said. "It is merchandising or whatever you want to call it."
"The milk from New Jersey, the milk from Pennsylvania, the milk from New York all meets the same requirements of the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance of the United States Public Health Service," he said.
Michael Dweck, president of Dweck & Campbell, said his agency's strategy was to run eye-catching ads that would provoke an outraged response. Asked if he was concerned about misleading consumers, Mr. Dweck said it was "intentional exaggeration" and was "not meant to be taken seriously."
The controversy is to some degree calculated. This is Oak Tree's first campaign, Mr. Dweck said, and its $500,000 advertising budget is not enough to establish a strong brand identity with straight product advertising.
The agency has scheduled a second ad for Dec. 31 that makes the first one look mild. It shows a cow with three eyes in front of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. the ad starts, "What is it about milk from Pennsylvania that gives us a bad feeling?"
Mr. Dweck said that he had been brainstorming for weeks on an ad impugning Connecticut. "The problem," he said with a sigh, "is that it's hard to find something bad to say about Connecticut."
"With New Jersey," he said, "it took about three and a half seconds."

HEADLINE: Wedding Bells, Dotted Lines

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
Marc Wein owned a prospering video production studio, a co-op in Manhattan and a vacation home on Shelter Island by the time he was planning to be remarried. And he was anxious to avoid a bitter fight over the rights to those assets if his second marriage also ended in divorce.
So several months before the wedding he told his bride-to-be about his concerns. That forced her to think about her own situation. "It made me realize I had money of my own I wanted to protect," Melina Wein said. 
 With the help of lawyers they drew up a prenuptial agreement assuring them that if either felt it had all been a mistake they could "back out without any heavy legal bills or hard feelings," as Mr. Wein put it.
 
Pitfalls to Avoid
 But does it really work as smoothly as all that? Not necessarily. Prenuptial agreements, which are normally drawn up and negotiated by lawyers specializing in family law, have been available since around 1980. They came into vogue as a result of changes in divorce law -- termed equitable distribution in some states and community property in others -- that made it far less clear who would end up with what if a couple separated.
At the time, lawyers recall, these contracts were often only five pages long and many cost less than $1,000. In line with feminist concerns rising at the time, the agreements addressed life style issues like the division of household duties as well as finances. And they were considered above challenge.
Not so today. As a result of successful legal challenges, prenuptial agreements are almost exclusively financial documents. They have grown longer and more complex -- some are more than 40 pages in length -- and they now include comprehensive financial statements and stipulations on the disposition of joint assets.
As a result, they are becoming increasingly expensive. "Some are costing as much as $25,000," said Barbara Ellen Handschu, past chairman of the family law section of the New York State Bar Association. However, the average is more likely to be closer to $2,000.
Moreover, because so many have been thrown out or modified by the courts -- after accusations by one of the parties of coercion -- many lawyers are questioning whether they are worth the time and expense.
"We can no longer say with certainty that any one of them will be impervious to attack," said Arthur E. Balbirer, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. Instead, he calls them "smoldering bombs" that become just another contentious issue to be haggled over when a rift occurs, as Donald J. Trump found when his marriage to Ivana Trump was breaking up. "I haven't found that they make breaking up any smoother," Mr. Balbirer said.
Mr. Balbirer argues that an about-to-be-married couple never really allows its lawyers the kind of probing and bargaining needed to draw up a truly "arm's length" agreement -- one that is also based upon full financial disclosure. This is a serious problem, he said, that eventually weakens the validity of many contracts.
For this reason some lawyers may now refuse to draw up a prenuptial agreement and they certainly will refuse if a couple arrive on the doorstep only a few days before the wedding ceremony. "We would tell them it's too late," warned Stephen Gassman, chairman of the family law section of the New York State Bar Association. Under the circumstances, he noted, the document could too easily be tainted with charges of duress.
Yet just as case law is turning these documents into Swiss cheese, pressure to draw them up is on the rise. Anyone in a business partnership, with an interest in a family business or who has children by a previous marriage, may be under great pressure to get one.
Discussions should start before a wedding date is set. If third-party pressure is involved, so much the easier. "If you can say it's because of someone else," said Dr. Donald Bloch, a Manhattan psychiatrist who specializes in the emotional impact of economic issues facing families, "it looks less like you don't trust each other." But, he warned, the agreement should never be forced on the other party because eventually it will embitter the relationship.
 
What They Should Cover
 A good prenuptial agreement should cover estate rights, support rights and the ownership and disposition of existing and future property, said Amy Reiss, a lawyer specializing in marital law with Morrison Cohen Singer & Weinstein in New York City. And the couple must be prepared to bare their financial souls and hire their own lawyers independently.
Since prenuptials are based primarily on hypothetical situations, percentages should be used rather than dollar figures. Mechanisms and time frames for the liquidation of assets are also necessary if the contract is to work, lawyers say.
There is also a growing interest in "sunset" clauses or rights to renegotiation because the way a couple feels about dividing assets may differ after a marriage results in children or has lasted several years.
The Weins, for example, arranged for their contract to cease after three years or the birth of a child. Their son, Everest, is now 4 months old, and they are more confident of each other.
"But I'm still glad we had it at the beginning," Mr. Wein said. "I think we both felt less threatened."

DIGITAL EQUIPMENT IS CLOSING PLANT IN BOSTON

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The Digital Equipment Corporation said yesterday that it would close its cable manufacturing plant in the Roxbury section of Boston and put 190 people out of work. The company, which has been trimming manufacturing capacity as part of a plan to eliminate redundancies and divest itself of non-core businesses, said it would phase out the Roxbury operations over three or four months. The plant is expected to be closed by April, the computer company said. In a statement, Edward B. McDonough, Digital's vice president, manufacturing and logistics, said the company had decided to buy cable equipment from outside vendors.

HEADLINE: The World's Poor Need Bill Clinton

 BODY:
Thirty-four nations, including the United States, agreed this week to continue the current pace of multilateral aid to the world's poorest nations through the International Development Association. Their three-year pledge of $18 billion was an encouraging sign of unflagging commitment by the nations that are better off, despite widespread recession and budget deficits.
In real terms, the new pledge is roughly equal to the last one, in 1989, but in effect it works out to a little less. Expanding populations and environmental protection stretch aid funds thinner; also, more governments, including the former Soviet republics, are likely to be seeking I.D.A. aid. 
 The agency's loans are interest-free, and borrowers have 35 to 40 years to repay, with a 10-year grace period to start. To qualify for a loan in recent years a country's per capita income had to be less than $765 a year, or barely $2 a day. Sad to say, more than 60 currently qualify. But it is a mark of progress that two countries that once received aid are now among the 34 donors.
The United States is still the largest donor, but barely; in the new agreement, its share shrinks to 20.85 percent while Japan's rises to 20 percent. Actually, Washington will be putting up a half-billion dollars more than last time -- $3.75 billion over the coming three years -- but that works out to a smaller share because the dollar's value is down. Switzerland, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Korea, Mexico and Ireland helped the most to make up the difference.
The U.S. pledge itself needs affirmation by Congress, which is usually tight with foreign aid funds and may be tighter next year when the focus is on curing domestic ills. Honoring this commitment to the world's desperately poor will be an early test of Mr. Clinton's leadership.

HEADLINE: BILL'S LIST;
Crime Control, City by City

SERIES: Bill's List

BYLINE: By Stephen Goldsmith and Kurt L. Schmoke; Stephen Goldsmith, a Republican, is Mayor of Indianapolis. Kurt L. Schmoke, a Democrat, is Mayor of Baltimore.

 BODY:
When Bill Clinton took his celebrated walk along Washington's violence- and drug-plagued Georgia Avenue, he had his eye on the long term.
What such neighborhoods need, he said, is economic development. Look to his Administration, he promised, to revitalize the Small Business Administration. An unidentified spectator had a more immediate perspective on the impact of his appearance. "It sure got the drug dealers and winos off the corner," he said. 
 There was insight in both comments -- insight that the new President and new Congress should heed. With the flames of Los Angeles still in memory, with a tidal wave of drugs and violence washing over our cities -- with gunshots literally within earshot of the Capitol -- the nation cannot escape seeing how tired, rote and unproductive the Federal debate about crime has become.
As former prosecutors and current mayors, we know crime and its effect on our cities. We know how disturbed we and many fellow mayors were when this year's Federal crime bill fell victim to partisan conflicts over issues like the death penalty, gun control and death-row appeals.
We know how deeply our cities -- all cities -- hope for Federal help in preventing crime. And we believe America needs a new Federal perspective and role if that hope is to be realized. For decades, the debate about controlling crime and improving conditions in crime-ridden cities has been dominated by two apparently incompatible positions. The "law and order" view holds that crime and the fear of it result from too many criminals and insufficient criminal justice. The advocates of the get-tough approach call for more police, stricter punishment and more prisons. By contrast, the "root causes" thesis argues that crime and fear result from systematic disadvantage, prejudice and neglect. This theory's champions urge economic development, training, education and public investment in poor communities.
The first position argues that crime must be controlled before community life can improve; the second, that community life must improve before crime can be controlled. The polarization of these views has brought paralysis to public policy and near-despair to our cities. Neither idea has won the public's heart and mind. And neither holds immediate promise for ruined neighborhoods.
Few people truly believe that either alone offers salvation. We believe that both views are true and that neither can proceed far without the other. As former prosecutors, we know the power of the police, courts and prisons to combat crime, fight fear and support the community. As mayors, we know the power of the schools, public health system, social services, public investment and policy to help create better lives.
We believe that only when both approaches are pursued together will there be hope.
In cities nationwide, largely unheralded local initiatives are providing reason for hope. Baltimore's Sandtown section, one of the city's worst areas, is a promising example. The city government and Sandtown residents sat down and designed a plan to reclaim the neighborhood. Residents' relations with the police improved, and their work together helped suppress the drug trade. New housing, built with Federal support, improved the quality of life: city-brokered agreements with the housing contractors insured that Sandtown residents got construction jobs and on-the-job training. City services such as roadwork and family counseling were adjusted in accordance with the community's sense of its own needs. The struggle continues, but Sandtown's crime rate has leveled off, and where the city has been most active the streets are safer.
Experiences similar to Sandtown's in other cities seem to share four elements.
First, rather than using one-size-fits-all solutions, participants have custom-designed solutions to local problems. In Sandtown, a turning point in addressing street disorder turned out to be shutting down a troublesome liquor store.
Second, the communities themselves, so often left out, were given power over their own fates; residents, not just the police and governments, helped define problems and develop and carry out solutions. In Tampa, Fla., the public made it clear that it was less concerned about drugs than about the disorder caused by blatant street sales of them. The police, working with the residents, largely put an end to the sales.
Third, the efforts were partnerships, with the police, other parts of government and the public pooling expertise and resources. In Houston, residents around Link Valley, a neighborhood blighted by cocaine dealing, developed an arrangement under which the police provided security and the residents organized a huge cleanup; the residents then worked with landlords and officials to make vacant buildings secure and found developers to invest in the newly attractive area.
Fourth, crime control was pursued not only through law enforcement but through various measures aimed at preventing crime and fighting fear. In Los Angeles's gang- and drug-plagued Wilshire neighborhood, the police, residents and the city hauled away abandoned cars, painted out graffiti, fixed street lights and then built effective partnerships to fight gang crime.
There are two very important ways in which the Clinton Administration and Congress, soon to be under one-party control, can help mayors develop local solutions.
Washington administers and finances thousands of programs in law enforcement, housing, health, education, job training, social services, drug prevention and treatment, and youth and family services. Looked at together, this wealth of resources needs to be yoked to a strategic plan.
Thus, Washington should make it easy to organize Federal resources in conjunction with local plans, perhaps by offering waivers from program rules and setting up a liaison office to coordinate the Federal side of such plans. It could also, at a modest cost, provide seed money for Sandtown-like experiments, study the results and furnish advice and technical support to other communities.
Second, the failed crime bill included many noncontroversial items of immediate importance, particularly financing for new prison space, aid to local enforcement and tougher sentences for repeat violent offenders.
Congress and Mr. Clinton should make prompt passage of those portions of the bill a top priority.

HEADLINE: New Work Corps Could Change People's Lives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Having interviewed veterans of the 1930's Civilian Conservation Corps in the last decade, I believe they would greet Stephen E. Ambrose's proposal in "Revive Roosevelt's C.C.C." (Op-Ed, Nov. 28) with mixed skepticism and enthusiasm. 
 Moralists among them believe that it would shape up and give a new positive toughness to young "druggie" "street people." Others feel that the ready availability of alcohol, drugs and automobiles would make it impossible to maintain the tight discipline necessary. Some think today's projects and workers would require prohibitively expensive chain saws, safety equipment, liability insurance, skidders and other power equipment, where axes, saws and shovels sufficed in the 30's.
Negatives notwithstanding, those who served six decades ago are virtually unanimous in wishing that the C.C.C. could be successfully revived, so that some of this generation of young adults would be able to tell their progeny: "That was the turning point of my life," "It just put a whole new outlook on life," "You learned how to get along with people."
One infantry-trained camp commanding officer would insist the program be run by the military, for "if they give it to a civilian organization, God help us."

HEADLINE: Patent System Protects Inventor Better

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Prof. Michael Davis's description of me as a "patent terrorist" in "Why a Single Court for Patents Isn't Enough" (letter, Nov. 28), and his attack on the patent court system, obscures my contributions to technological innovation, while it ignores the real issues in the debate, which include protecting the rights of the inventor and patent owner. 
 In a career spanning more than 30 years, I have received in excess of 500 patents and have licensed many of my patents to large and small corporations throughout the world. In the process of licensing such inventions as the automatic warehousing system and the industrial robot, I have witnessed the lack of respect that most corporation managers have for the independent inventor.
Although many corporations have profited handsomely from the limited monopolies that are granted them by the patent system, they are all too often willing to use patents owned by inventors without paying for them. Many of these same corporations have licensed their patents to whole industries without being called patent terrorists. Certain of these same corporations have refused to honor my patent rights or even to negotiate with me.
The United States patent system was conceived by our Founding Fathers as an incentive for all our citizens to devote their time, energy and money to inventing products and processes. In Jefferson's time, the independent inventor was the source of most technological innovation. In the modern era, however, independent inventors with significant contributions to technological innovation and to our economy have found it increasingly difficult to protect their intellectual property rights.
Before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was established by Congress in 1982, the inventor and small-business man found it almost impossible to protect their patent rights. The patent game functioned to the advantage of large corporations with significant financial resources. The independent inventor, by comparison, had at best a one-in-six chance of upholding his patent rights in court.
What Professor Davis perceives as a pro-patent policy by the Circuit Court of Appeals is but the court's interpretation of our patent laws in a uniform, even-handed manner. Donald Banner, former Commissioner of Patents, referred to the previous inconsistent treatment of patents before the establishment of the court as a "cruel hoax" against the inventor.
I believe that going back to the previous system, as Professor Davis suggests, would constitute a policy of bad innovation, reduce the incentive of many Americans to invent and perpetuate a gross injustice against the independent inventor and small-business man.

HEADLINE: New Work Corps Could Change People's Lives;
Include Human Services

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The infrastructures and environment of our country can be helped by such a corps as Stephen E. Ambrose suggests in "Revive Roosevelt's C.C.C." (Op-Ed, Nov. 28). In addition, the new Administration should not overlook human services as an area for such workers. 
 The City Volunteer Corps in New York City has in eight years revitalized the most precious resource of an urban area, its youth. A recent study of several hundred young people who participated in the program shows gains in self-esteem, continuing education and employment productivity. Participants have had the satisfaction of knowing they do make a difference in the lives of others. Compassion, understanding, tolerance and charity are the human values they learn, far exceeding any lesson that can be taught in a classroom.
A national service program could include after-school tutorial classes, recreational and leisure participation for the young and assisting the elderly.

HEADLINE: New Work Corps Could Change People's Lives;
California-Style

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Stephen Ambrose's suggestion to create a 1990's version of the Civilian Conservation Corps (Op-Ed, Nov. 28) certainly caught our attention. The California Conservation Corps, modeled after the Depression-era, program has been going strong for more than 16 years, and there are other corps programs in this state and many other states. 
 Youth corps are not about make-work. Our modern-day C.C.C. has tackled more than 35 million hours of natural resource work in California. But there is something beyond building parks, planting trees and fighting fires. Many of our youth are in crisis, and as Mr. Ambrose points out, missing the rewards that discipline and hard work can provide. In a youth corps, young people boost their skills and their self-esteem. For many, the sense of empowerment they develop changes their entire lives.
We believe the C.C.C. ideals are more than a concept. From our experience, there is no reason such programs could not make a significant impact in other metropolitan areas, as well as rural regions throughout the country.

HEADLINE: Trapped In the Baltics

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The plight of the 25 million Russians outside of Russia has become a foreign policy concern of President Boris Yeltsin's Government. In this issue are the seeds of another crisis more dangerous than the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Estonia has passed and Latvia has proposed discriminatory citizenship laws requiring Russians, as well as other ethnic minorities, to go through a difficult naturalization process during which they cannot vote, own property or hold certain jobs. 
These policies may be understandable for historical reasons, given Baltic fears of being overwhelmed by the Russians. Nevertheless, discrimination is discrimination; many Russians have become victims, and the Russian Government is understandably upset.
At the United Nations in September, Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's pro-Western Foreign Minister, criticized Estonia for violating the human rights of Russians. And in October, the Yeltsin Government halted troop withdrawals from the Baltics to put pressure on local governments to respect Russians' rights. In Moldova, Georgia and Tajikistan, Russians have killed and been killed in ethnic violence. Increasingly, they are arming themselves in self-defense.
The instincts that served us well during the cold war may be inappropriate now. It is natural for Americans and Europeans to side with the Baltics and other captive nations that suffered under the yoke of Russian and Soviet imperialism. But the human rights principles underlying U.S. foreign policy do not extend to support for efforts to create ethnically or racially homogeneous nations.
More important, as a purely practical matter, Latvia and Estonia are tiny communities on the border of the world's largest country. It's unrealistic for them to expect protection from the U.S. or the European Community; they will have to find a way to live with Russia in the long run. It is hard to see how Latvia and Estonia can expect to disfranchise half their populations and remain viable, stable and democratic countries.
To be sure, Moscow's motives in championing the rights of Russians abroad are in many cases highly suspect. Some officials, such as Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoi, are not entirely reconciled to the loss of empire and would like to use local Russian populations as a means of winning back the country's hegemony.
But many other Russians are sincere democrats who supported Baltic independence two years ago and feel betrayed by the Baltics' reneging on promises to treat their minorities fairly. It is senseless to hand would-be fascists in Russia an easy issue with which they can attack Mr. Yeltsin and discredit his close relationship with the West.
Under these circumstances, the U.S. must take an unprejudiced and evenhanded position, supporting the rights of all ethnic minorities in the region, including Russians. This might mean applying pressure on Baltic and other post-Soviet governments to liberalize their citizenship and permanent residency laws, even as we continue to press Russia to withdraw its forces from the former Soviet republics.
Aid and trade to these states should be conditioned not just on economic reform but also on human rights. George Kennan's suggestion that aid be used to build housing for Russian servicemen being brought home from the Baltics and elsewhere is a good one for the incoming Clinton Administration.
With the appointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin, a lifelong Soviet bureaucrat, as Prime Minister, the Russian Government is more likely to provoke a crisis with the Baltics over the rights of ethnic Russians. But the big explosion is in the future, if Ukraine moves away from its liberal policies on rights and citizenship toward nationalist conformity.
Unlike the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, the one in the ex-Soviet states will present the Clinton Administration with not just a moral but a major geopolitical problem. Russia could intervene against the Baltics or, worse, confront Ukraine over the rights of Russians in Crimea. Let us hope that our tragic reluctance to become involved in Yugoslavia will not be repeated in the case of the former Soviet Union.

 THREE times in this century the map of the world has been redrawn both metaphorically and literally. The Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I created new countries and boundaries out of the ruins of the Austrian, German, Ottoman and Russian empires. In the aftermath of World War II came more changes in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, as well as in the multitude of postcolonial nations reshaping maps of Africa and Asia. Now, with the reunification of Germany, the collapse of the Soviet Union and its system of satellite nations, and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, events have once again sent cartographers back to their drafting tables and publishers back to press.
The results are thoroughly revised editions of the major world atlases. That they are being issued now can be interpreted as a vote of confidence by publishers in the prospects for a period of geographical stability. It may simply be a calculated risk taken in response to marketing imperatives. Who would keep buying maps showing a divided Germany or a city named Leningrad, except perhaps someone banking on their future antiquarian value alongside those curiosities marking the existence of New Amsterdam or the Holy Roman Empire?
In either case, the past few years have been "a map maker's nightmare," in the words of John F. Shupe, chief cartographer of the National Geographic Society. But upon awakening, map makers have succeeded admirably in catching up with events. The publishers have also seized this opportunity to call attention to the considerable improvements being made in the art and science of cartography.
It was a similar convergence of geographical turmoil and advances in cartography that led to world atlases as a publishing innovation some 400 years ago. Europe's map makers, shaken out of their formerly cloistered ways, were struggling to keep up with the deeds of explorers. By the second half of the 16th century, the discoveries had whetted appetites for knowledge of newfound exotic places, and better engraving and printing techniques made it possible to satisfy the demand. This led to an emerging commercial trade in maps, notably in the Low Countries.
The first modern geographical atlas was issued in 1570 by Abraham Ortelius, an editor and publisher of maps in Antwerp. A merchant named Hooftman, a map collector, had found the job of rolling up and unrolling his many large maps an increasing nuisance. So he commissioned Ortelius to gather maps and bind them in a single volume. Ortelius decided to do the same for a general audience, incorporating 70 maps into a volume he called "Theatrum Orbis Terrarum" ("Theater of the World"). It was an immediate success.
Gerardus Mercator, the century's foremost cartographer, then published a three-volume collection of maps in book form, the final one appearing a year after his death in 1594. Mercator's title for the collection represents the first use of the word "atlas" in connection with a geographical work, for reasons that are not entirely clear. The full title reads: "Atlas, or Cosmographical Meditations Upon the Creation of the Universe, and the Universe as Created."
Each of the world atlases under review here is both a handsome work in the tradition of Ortelius and Mercator and a worthy response to the challenge cartographers are always facing: to be comprehensive and up to date while also conveying prodigious amounts of information in crisp graphic form. The heft of several of these books would test the strength of mighty Atlas. So much more is known than ever before of the world, all the lands and even the sea floors having now been charted. But how does one assess the relative merits of these new atlases?
One way to start is by considering prices, which for many atlases are not trivial. Rand McNally says that at $29.95 ($24.95 until Jan. 1), its "Today's World" is the lowest-priced large-format world atlas in bookstores. What's more, the jacket displays a bright yellow sticker with an unusual offer. The sticker can be mailed in for a free updated world wall map should the maps in the atlas become outdated because of political changes before Dec. 31, 1993.
The other atlases each cost more than twice as much, but they offer more -- the world and continents and regions shown at various scales and from many different perspectives, and also comprehensive indexes giving the names of thousands of cities and towns and their locations in the world and on the maps in these volumes. The National Geographic Atlas of the World, for example, has 150,000 such entries, including 20 new countries and 14,000 other name changes since its 1990 edition. In newly independent Ukraine, more than 95 percent of all place names had to be revised because of reversions to pre-Communist nomenclature.
The Hammond Atlas of the World boasts that its revisions go well beyond name changes. The publisher says this is the first atlas to be computer generated from digitized geographic data, facilitating the presentation of countries at different scales and perspectives. Another advantage will be the speeding up of future revisions.
The National Geographic Atlas, the Oxford Atlas of the World and, to a lesser degree, the New York Times Atlas of the World are more than map collections; they are veritable encyclopedias of geographic and demographic information, profusely illustrated with multicolored maps and graphs. Those old staples of geography textbooks -- fossil fuel reserves, steel production, literacy standings -- never looked more inviting of further study. In addition, the National Geographic book has a "Nations of the World" section, with brief profiles of the 193 nations, which it says is the greatest number in world history.
These three atlases also cast a glance beyond the earth, providing graphic summaries of the latest knowledge about the universe and a tour of the solar system. The Times atlas even has a concise history of space flight.
As its title announces, the sixth new atlas, the Economist Atlas of the New Europe, takes in much less territory and is not the place to look for general maps of the continent or individual countries. This is mainly a book of illustrated statistics, with accompanying texts, about Europe's banking, industry, trade, people and culture.
I hope no one will be shocked when I confess that my examination of these atlases fell short of checking out the curve of each coastline, the elevations of all mountain peaks or the spellings of places in Tajikistan. One must trust experts in some matters. For an evaluation of these works, my initial approach was both personal and random, and I suspect others will be inclined to follow suit.
First, I thumbed the pages to find maps of the familiar, ones showing Paris, Tenn., and Paducah, Ky. There they were, just where I left them in childhood. In the Oxford atlas, I noted with satisfaction, the index gave as much space to the Paris in Tennessee as to the French capital.
Next, in checking how the atlases handled some remote places about which I have some knowledge, I discovered a lingering gap in post-Soviet geography. Just where in Kazakhstan is the Russian space launching base? In the days of cold war secrecy, the Russians were misleading by identifying the base with a place named Baikonur, although Western analysis of flight paths put the actual site a couple of hundred miles to the southwest, closer to the Aral Sea. The atlases are silent on this issue, merely listing without further comment a place called variously Baykonur, Baykonyr or Bajkonyr -- except for the National Geographic volume, which elaborates the name to Bayqongyr on the map, leaving it Baykonur in the index. But near the Aral, just north of the city of Leninsk (formerly Tyuratam), a label on the map indicates the location of the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Does this certify the solution to an old cold war mystery?
Czechoslovakia presents a more immediate problem for the atlas makers. Only Hammond is unequivocal in showing two separate nations, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The other atlases map the split but, at least typographically, remain dominated by the ghost of the old country.
After one rambles through the maps for a time -- ah, the preferred spelling for Timbuktu now seems to be Tombouctou -- some overall impressions began to emerge. Some of the most visually pleasing maps are in the Hammond and Times volumes. But the Oxford and National Geographic atlases are more satisfying, with their greater variety of maps and the inclusion of so much noncartographic information.
Map makers, it also is clear, are having more success presenting information in forms ever more pleasing to the eye. Centuries ago, cartographers created imaginative and colorful works of art to compensate for the paucity of their information. For well over a century, until recent decades, maps had been more utilitarian and prosaic. As these atlases demonstrate, maps can be both practical and appealing.
So many of the maps in these atlases are delightfully new. By more skillful shading, mountain ranges seem to rise from the pages in lofty splendor. The Oxford and Hammond atlases make especially effective use of such techniques. In nearly all the volumes, colors are used with more variety and to better effect than ever before. The icy blues and frosty whites of Antarctica and Greenland send a shiver down the spine, and the sandy hues of the Gobi and the Sahara bring on a gritty thirst. For populated areas, the colors illustrative of elevations are sufficiently subdued so that names and boundaries stand out clearly.
Some improvements are less apparent. Using computers, the cartographers have devised new mathematical schemes to reduce the inevitable distortions associated with the translation of a spherical earth onto the flatness of paper. The problem is to show as accurately as possible the true shape and size of lands, whether they are near the Equator or where the lines of longitude converge toward the poles. The National Geographic has adopted a new system for dealing with the problem; and Mitchell J. Feigenbaum, an authority on chaos theory at Rockefeller University, advised Hammond on developing computer software for reducing such distortions by as much as 60 percent.
A test of how well they did is to look at Greenland and South America. On many older maps, particularly those following Mercator's practices, Greenland looked every bit as big as the whole of South America, even though the latter is nine times as large. These world atlases pass the test, cutting Greenland down closer to actual size and shape.
Let us hope the world settles down for a bit, giving us time to catch up with all that has changed and permitting these new atlases a long shelf life.
Now, where was I? Looking for the mountains in New Mexico where this boy spent a summer long ago imagining he was a cowboy. And off in the pages showing Central Asia, trying to learn the enchanting names of the oasis towns harking back to the legendary Silk Road. As Ortelius might have foreseen, good atlases are like that. Open them for one purpose, say to write a review, and soon the mind is traveling wide latitudes in space and time.

HEADLINE: Dear Museumgoer: What Do You Think?

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
In a Malibu, Calif., conference room, eight people are giving their impressions of the J. Paul Getty Museum, a place they have never visited.
"I've been told there's heavy, very classic type of art, somewhat stuffy and stand-offish," says a middle-aged man in a brown suit. "It's the kind of place you wouldn't want to take your kids and let them run around." 
 An older woman concurs: "I get the impression it's a little stuffy and has old art."
A young man in a blue blazer chimes in: "I was driving up past Malibu and I saw the sign. I'd never heard of it before. I thought it was a place where they were going to show you how to refine oil or something."
This group of people -- a randomly selected, geographic and demographic cross section of Californians -- is surprisingly uninhibited, considering that the participants know they are being videotaped by museum officials through one-way mirrors.
The Getty is not alone in doing such studies. These days, more and more museums are turning to market research -- once the sole province of toothpaste makers and detergent manufacturers -- to overhaul their images and to help make decisions about what hours to be open, how to write a wall label, how much admission to charge and, perhaps one day, even what kind of art to show.
In New York, visitors leaving the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Magritte retrospective, the Guggenheim's Russian Constructivist exhibition and the Museum of Modern Art's Matisse show are being hit with questionaires, part of a coordinated survey conducted by the three institutions. And last year, 11 museums across the country participated in a separate research project financed by the Getty Center for Education in the Arts and the J. Paul Getty Museum. "These days, it takes more than just salesmanship to get people in the door," says Edmund Pillsbury, the director of the Kimbell Museum in Fort Worth, which uses market research to determine how to advertise its special shows.
With government financing down over the last five years and private donations in the doldrums, museums are more eager than ever to get paying customers through the doors. At the same time, they find themselves competing for the public's leisure time. Thus the lure of market research.
While some art-world observers believe that catering to the Joneses is a savvy business move, others fear that public opinion could supplant curatorial wisdom. If the Joneses say they would rather see a Norman Rockwell retrospective than a Vermeer exhibition, what then? Should museums appeal to the masses or are they basically purveyors of high culture? Is it a museum's job to instruct or to entertain -- or can it do both simultaneously? These are questions museums may have to address in the future, and they suggest the depth of the issues raised by combining market research and fine art.
Most museum executives are guarded about discussing the implications of market research, other than to say it's helpful in redesigning traffic flow patterns around the galleries or in rethinking brochures and hours. One exception is Sandra Horrocks, manager of public relations at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Describing the conditions that make market research almost inevitable for museums, she said: "We're all struggling. Our membership and attendance is stagnate. Corporate funding has dried up. We no longer have the blockbusters that bring great numbers of people into the museum; therefore, we have to figure out something else to do. We need information, and that's something surveys and focus groups provide."
But some curators wonder just how accurate these studies are, and what market research portends for the future. "If a museum's main concern is stuffing the largest number of paying bodies into a building, then they've lost their birthright," says William Rubin, director emeritus of the department of paintings and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art. "Museums aren't just meant to produce shows that have broad popular appeal, they're also supposed to do unpopular shows. It's the balance that's crucial."
 
Research
A Portrait In Numbers
 For many museums, there is safety in numbers -- that is, the large number of major institutions now doing market research and the impressive new statistics museum director can use to back up requests for financing. The Getty's research project last year involved no less than 11 important museums: the Getty itself, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Brooklyn Museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Denver Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Seattle Art Museum and the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio.
Each museum held focus groups with people who may or may not have visited the institution. In some cases, officials found that their museums were perceived as being intimidating and needed to become more user-friendly. Many of those interviewed changed their minds, however, after actually entering the museums.
Ultimately, such research is aimed at increasing the museums' bottom lines. One important reason for the survey being conducted at the Metropolitan, the Modern and the Guggenheim, for example, is to track the economic impact of these institutions on New York City. High numbers would provide the museums with ammunition to fight government budget cutbacks. By showing just how much money is spent by visitors who come to New York to attend art exhibitions, the museums also hope to entice corporations into sponsoring shows.
"Corporations these days need to see where their money is going and the impact it will have," says Suzette Sherman, manager of visitor services at the Guggenheim. "These studies give them a means of comparison."
The Metropolitan, a pioneer in museum market research, conducted its first visitor survey in 1971. Recently, it has stepped up its efforts. Jeffrey K. Smith, a professor of educational psychology at Rutgers University who works part time at the Metropolitan, estimates that each month his team interviews roughly 700 visitors.
During the three-and-a-half-month Seurat exhibition in 1991, for instance, research indicated that museum visitors brought an estimated $313 million into the city, and that out-of-town visitors spent $9.7 million in the museum shops. Of those attending the show, 26 percent came from New York City, the rest from out of town. After seeing the Seurat exhibition, 61 percent of the out-of-towners dined in a restaurant, 57 percent went shopping, 33 percent caught a Broadway show, 10 percent visited the Statue of Liberty and 1 percent went to the Big Apple Circus.
 
The Results

Turning Numbers Into Actions
 Gathering information is the easy part. The hard part is deciding what to do with it. When a study at the Getty revealed that only 7 percent of its visitors brought children (compared to 15 percent to 20 percent at other museums), the Getty felt a need to make changes. "What we realized is that the Getty wasn't doing anything to encourage families," says Margaret Menninger, who helps the museum organize its market research. In response, the Getty introduced family programs on weekends and provided toys for children to play with while visiting. One, titled "Puzzling Pots," is a compact game about Greek vases and mythology; it's available for children to use in the gallery at no charge.
Other museums have similarly made changes based on market research.
* After surveying 2,500 tour operators, the Guggenheim began offering group tours of the Russian Constructivist show in six languages, packaged with tea or lunch at the Russian Tea Room.
* After some 200 interviews, the Kimbell Art Museum decided to sell advance tickets to "Egypt's Dazzling Sun: Amenhotep III and His World," which opened in October. (On the other hand, the Metropolitan Museum prefers not to sell advance tickets; poll-takers found that its visitors, two to one, prefer standing in line over buying tickets ahead of time.)
* A man-in-the-street survey of 341 people in SoHo convinced the local branch of the Guggenheim to stay open until 10 o'clock three nights a week to attract the young working people in the neighborhood.
* Survey information led the Philadelphia Museum to begin advertising its new late hours on a local rock-and-roll radio station.
* The Philadelphia survey also suggested using television to reach audiences, so the museum participated in a joint promotion with the CBS affiliate WCAU to push a recent Picasso show. The station's call letters were put on exhibition materials, an anchor provided the voice for the audio tour, and the show got, in return, almost $300,000 of free air time.
"My only fear is that the public will see all they want on television and not bother coming to the show," Ms. Horrocks says of such efforts. The Philadelphia Museum does have its limits when it comes to commercial stunts. A car company interested in sponsoring the Picasso show wanted to put one of its vehicles in the museum's great hall. "That was a bit much," Ms. Horrocks says.
Are museums nevertheless sinking to the level of the lowest common denominator? Research has shown that some visitors are naive or ill informed about art, and museums have had to take steps to accommodate that audience. A man who was about to visit the Philaldelphia Museum for the first time told his focus-group colleagues that he had never heard of any important artwork being there. During the same session, a woman said she expected the museum to be filled with "pictures I would not understand. . . . I've seen art where it looks like kids splashed paint."
In response, the museum reinstated an image of van Gogh's "Sunflowers" on the cover of its brochures, along with other easily recognizable works. "For a while we took them off because we wanted a change," Ms. Horrocks says, "but I guess that was a mistake."
The Cleveland Museum found that at least one visitor could not even find the van Goghs. "I guess I expected banners or something," a focus-group member said. "We walked by them three times before we noticed them. After a while, everything looks alike."
In response, the museum redesigned its map, making it easier for visitors to spot its masterpieces. Visitor surveys also helped the Cleveland Museum set limits on verbiage in wall labels: 75 words, maximum. "When curators feel frustrated," says Evan H. Turner, director of the museum, "I tell them the Lord's Prayer is only 52 or 53."
 
The Danger
A Tyranny Of Statistics?
 For all the practical good that has come out of these studies, the use of market research raises important issues. A few officials say that it's about time their institutions listened to what the people have to say, while others are apprehensive about what the surveys could lead to. "Clearly museums are competing for people's time and funds, but at the same time museums shouldn't turn into MTV," says Martin Friedman, former director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. "It's important not to lose sight of an institution's artistic mission."
Others question the accuracy of such research. "Surveys are as accurate as the skill of the people developing them," says Stephen Bitgood, a psychology professor at Jacksonville State University in Alabama who has worked with museums for 18 years. "We're living in a time when it's a social trend to have a public reaction to everything. The only problem is that it's all too easy to generalize the results. This whole process is still in its infancy."
According to Mr. Rubin, of the Museum of Modern Art, "One problem with surveys is that the slighest inflection, the way the questions are posed, can change the answer. It's different than using polls to determine the outcome of a Presidential election, this is far less cut and dried, far more complex."
Still, curators and museum directors seem to have embraced market research as another step in the corporatization of the museum world. "We don't like to think of our visitors as customers or our art as assets," says William H. Luers, president of the Metropolitan. "On the other hand, we're so big and the money involved is so large."
Most curators insist that market research does not affect what shows are being mounted. Museum experts are quick to point out that questions of taste -- for instance, the popularity of one artist versus another -- are not included in questionaires or asked in focus groups.
"We were fearful in the beginning," says Keith Christiansen, a curator in the department of European paintings at the Metropolitan. "If the purpose of the survey is to accommodate what the man-on-the-street wants, then it's cause for alarm."
But, the curator says, this is not what the Metropolitan seems to be using them for. Instead, says Philippe de Montebello, the Metropolitan's director, visitor surveys "confirm things we already knew," like the need to stay open later and to cut back on the information in labels.
In at least one case, however, an audience survey and a museum's curators came to the same conclusion. In studies done during the Seurat exhibition, researchers discovered a surprisingly enthusiastic response to the artist's drawings. While the Metropolitan points out that its coming exhibitions were planned well ahead of the results of the Seurat survey, the museum's spring schedule now includes four drawing shows: "Arthur B. Davies and the Metropolitan Museum," "Daumier Drawings," "Abstract Expressionism: Work on Paper, Selections From the Metropolitan Museum" and "Drawings From the J. Paul Getty Museum."
"Any information about one's audience is good," says John Elderfield, the curator of the Modern's Matisse exhibition, "but after that, it's up to the curators to know how to use it. It's not bad knowing what the audience thinks."
In fact, suggests one former museum director, it's highly desirable. "It's time visitors start calling the shots," says Thomas Hoving, director of the Metropolitan from 1967 to 1977. "The more popular you can go the better. I think what's wrong with museums these days is that they have lost touch with the public, and it shows."
What will happen then to the small, obscure show that was never meant to draw crowds but simply to educate? Mr. Rubin says a successful show can help finance a less popular one. And even obscure artists can be made more palatable, advocates of polling say, if museums can find ways to educate the public about the shows and make them more enticing.
And so, apparently, the camel's nose of market research is already inside the museum tent. Ms. Horrocks says that, since exhibitions at the Philadelphia Museum are planned several years ahead, it's too early for such research to affect curatorial decisions . . . yet. "We haven't come to the point where it's an issue," she says. "But we're starting an exhibitions committee and we will be considering audiences."
 
 
 
A VIEW FROM HOI POLLOI
 When museums conduct surveys and lead focus groups, they sometimes get scathing criticism from participants. Here is a sampling of comments about five institutions gathered during a survey of 11 museums last year by the Getty Center for Education in the Arts.
 
National Gallery of Art, Washington
* "If you didn't get the handouts, you didn't know who the
artists were."
* "People did not linger in the 20th-century galleries. They went through fast."
* "When I asked the guards a question, I was referred to the
information desk."
 
Philadelphia Museum of Art
* About the 20th-century galleries: "The art looked like something I could have done myself."
* "There wasn't anything pointing to where you were to go."
* "I walked away with a feeling of frustration. I would have liked more explanation."
* "I'd rather go see the dinosaurs."
 
J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu, Calif.
* "The signs were all very uniform. They were almost like an eye test they were so small."
* "There's a lack of sitting areas in many of the rooms."
 
Art Institute of Chicago
* "It made me real nervous not to know where I was going. Those maps are really confusing."
* About the brochures: "I don't like them. I found them
confusing."
 
Cleveland Museum of Art
* "I felt like I was in a rat maze. You don't know what you've seen and what you missed."
* "How many times do you want to look at Buddha? Boring."
* "It was so large it turned me off. Toward the end it got
monotonous."

But Wait, There's Some Life Yet in the 'Cheers' Gang

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
What a blow, and right before Christmas! NBC announced this month that "Cheers" will call it quits at the end of this season, after 11 years, 26 Emmys and God knows how many beers on the eternally unpaid tab of the unemployed accountant Norm Peterson.
So America will no longer be able to follow the saga of Sam Malone, former baseball star and recovering alcoholic turned bar owner, and the memorable assortment of Bostonians who were his employees, customers and lovers. 
 But at NBC and Paramount, which produces "Cheers," there is already talk of spinning off some of the characters into a new series. It could be great. It could be "AfterM*A*S*H" (CBS, 1983) or, more to the point, "The Tortellis," a show that spun off Carla's first husband (NBC, 1987). Meanwhile, in the spirit of the season and of the current state of prime-time series television, here are some hypothetical possibilities for the stars, offered with the fervent hope that no one takes them too seriously.
 
Ted Danson (who plays Sam Malone)
In "A Votre Sante," Sam, unable to accept either aging or his deep-seated loneliness, marries a 26-year-old fitness instructor and moves to Montreal, where he becomes a sports broadcaster. Hilarity ensues as Sam tries to socialize with his wife's young friends and tries to speak French in a bilingual city. Premiere: Sam thinks he sees Diane (Shelley Long) in a mall.
 
Kirstie Alley (Rebecca Howe)
Rebecca tries to start a new life in Southern California. Each week, in "The Big One," she has a really big opportunity for success or happiness but, at the last minute, loses it. This week: No one believes that Rebecca almost married the billionaire Robin Colcord. Guest star: Marla Maples.
 
Rhea Perlman (Carla Tortelli LeBec)
Carla, devastated by the closing of the Cheers bar and haunted by her unrequited love for Sam, gives up men and decides to devote herself to full-time motherhood in "Eight Is More Than Enough." Tonight: Gino Tortelli has a crush on his teacher and his parole officer.
 
George Wendt (Norm Peterson)
In "America's Favorite Neighborhood Bars," a reality series from the producers of "America's Favorite Videotaped Assaults," Norm makes behind-the-scenes tours of bars across the United States. Tonight: the Whiskey, at the Paramount Hotel in New York.
 
John Ratzenberger as Cliff Clavin
After retiring from the United States Postal Service with a generous pension, Cliff buys and manages an eight-unit bed-and-breakfast on Cape Cod. In "Ma and Me," Cliff's mother lives with him in a rambling Victorian house out back. Or does she? Guest star: Janet Leigh.
 
Woody Harrelson and Jackie Swanson as Woody and Kelly Boyd
Ten years have passed since their wedding, and Woody and Kelly are beautiful, rich, bored and hopelessly estranged, despite the love they share for their two handsome blond sons. In "Unhappily Ever After," the couple decide to stay married but lead separate lives in adjoining wings of their Beacon Hill town house. This week: Who owns the copyright to "The Kelly Song"?
 
Kelsey Grammer (Dr. Frasier Crane)
After his divorce from Lilith, Frasier moves to Chicago and establishes a private psychiatric practice, specializing in group therapy. This week on "Frasier": Fear of Flying. Co-starring Suzanne Pleshette.
 
Bebe Neuwirth (Dr. Lilith Sternin)
After her year in the Ecopod, Lilith Sternin-Crane drops her hyphenation and takes a teaching job at Harvard. In "Cambridge 02138," she finds a circle of brilliant but emotionally troubled friends, all of whom have gray hair, advanced degrees and verbally gifted children. Premiere: Little Frederick takes an I.Q. test.

HEADLINE: TIME WARNER;
What Explains Shock Appeal?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
What we really need to know is not what led Time Warner to produce material that is inflammatory and controversial -- we all know that it was profit -- but rather, why is it that at this moment in our history the most shocking and controversial art forms are the most profitable? 
 Why are significant segments of the American audience receptive to, or actually eager for, such products as Ice-T's "Cop Killer" and Madonna's "Sex"? Why did much of the American public believe Oliver Stone's "J. F. K.," despite the condemnations of the historical experts?
Richard Clurman's analysis cannot answer these questions because, like too much media criticism, his article posits an ex post facto argument of historical explanation: company X produces art form Y, the media determine that it is flawed or controversial, then a critic tries to reconstruct the process by which the company created the controversial form.
The film "New Jack City," for example, is faulted by Mr. Clurman because it "was greeted by fights and shootings outside movie theaters." Does Mr. Clurman really believe that Time Warner deliberately chose to make a movie that would lead to mayhem in American theaters? The story that Mr. Clurman tells of Time Warner's decision-making shows that in most cases the company's management was caught by surprise at the reactions, especially the negative and violent ones.
Moreover, media critics and protest groups play an important role in the process of controversy-making and contribute to the profitability of these ventures. A case in point is the "Body Count" album by Ice-T, which was selling rather modestly until the hue and cry was raised over the song "Cop Killer." Then thousands more bought the album. The story of how controversial art forms get produced and labeled "controversial" is more complex than that which Mr. Clurman tells us.
But why is today's American audience embracing such oppositional cultural forms? To understand why such forms are so popular, we must recognize that generally they are not consumed by one single, undifferentiated audience: those who buy a copy of "Sex" are not necessarily the same people who go to see "Malcolm X." We are witnessing in American popular culture the emergence of a highly differentiated set of audiences, whose wants and perspectives Time Warner has tapped into.
Mr. Clurman lumps all of the forms produced by Time Warner into a category labeled "controversial" without stopping to consider the social forces that make these messages acceptable to an audience. Can one really understand the popularity of "Cop Killer" without addressing the issue of brutal police treatment of young black men who see in the Rodney King beating a call to arms? Can one understand Madonna without addressing her appeal to gay men and heterosexual young women as someone who is in control of her own life and image?
Can the appeal of "Malcolm X" be understood apart from the need by black and white Americans for a story of personal redemption in the face of the family breakdown, moral degradation and group hatred that emerge from American ghettos? I think not.
The tension between the rights of capitalism and the social community has been around since John Winthrop delivered his speech "A Modell of Christian Charity" on the deck of the Arbella. But that social community is now more diverse and economically powerful than ever before. And that diversified public will continue to use its purchasing power to select its preferred entertainment, despite what elitist moral custodians think.

HEADLINE: Architects Sheltering In Government Projects

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
FACED with a sharply reduced market for private construction brought about by the downturn in the New York metropolitan region's economy, more and more architectural firms, including some of the biggest and most prestigious, are turning increasingly to government for work.
Firms that in the mid-80's would have been busy planning 50-story office buildings, gigantic shopping malls or high-rise city-center hotels are instead trying to underbid one another for courthouses and public schools or engaging in expensive, winner-take-all competitions for ferry terminals and Federal office buildings. A decade ago many of these firms would have counted on government contracts for as little as 10 percent of their business; now, they say, the figure often reaches 50 percent or more. 
 "The public sector is where it's at right now," said Peter Samton of Gruzen Samton Steinglass, a major New York City firm that has long done government work. "There's slim pickings for all architects in the private sector in the New York area. Anytime there's the possibility of a project in the public sector you'll find most architects going after it."
Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the giant firm whose Lever House at Park Avenue and 53d Street is a landmark of private construction and whose Sears Tower and John Hancock Center in Chicago are also known worldwide, has designed a Federal Courthouse in White Plains. Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates, the unorthodox Philadelphia concern, has designed its first New York building, the controversial new terminal for the Staten Island Ferry.
Kohn Pedersen Fox, which spent the 80's putting up office buildings all over the world, is responsible for a new Federal Court House in Foley Square and Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum has designed a 974,000-square-foot office building as part of that project. James Stewart Polshek and Partners is designing a new public library in Queens and Rafael Vinoly Architects was chosen for the new Housing Court in the Bronx.
Many of these firms of course have always been involved in government work; Skidmore, for instance, has a long tradition of work in the public sector, and Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum has frequently designed public projects. What has greatly increased is the percentage of time all these firms spend as government consultants.
"WHAT is happening is that more of the quality architectural firms that were basically doing private work are now coming into public architecture," said Rudolph J. Rinaldi, Commissioner of Buildings and director of the Office of Construction for New York City. "You're getting a lot more of the artsier firms, the better architects."
The influx of architects has created a far more competitive market, a competition that, officials say, has driven prices down, led to better design -- and caused concern among architects that government is getting the better of them.
"The city has been the beneficiary," said Kenneth J. Knuckles, Commissioner of New York City's Department of General Services, the municipal landlord and purchasing agent. "We're getting a better price and a better product."
Andrew Gerardi, director of design and construction for the Northeast region of the Federal General Services Administration, agreed.
"We've been getting a lot more architects applying for the work," Mr. Gerardi said. "It's unfortunate the economy is that way, but it's also fortuitous, because we can explore with better firms better public architecture. The public, the government and the nation at large benefit. It's more work for us, but in a sense it's pleasant work: It's like choosing between chocolate, vanilla and strawberry."
Statistics from the New York City Department of General Services show that the number of names on its lists of qualified consultants -- which include not only architects but also engineering and construction management firms -- has tripled since 1986, from 250 to 800. Most of the increase occurred in the last three years, and many of the new names belong to concerns that had never before been interested in public work.
In 1986, officials said, the department began an outreach program and sent information about city work to 60 of the highest-profile firms; half responded. Requests to be included on the qualified lists have almost doubled, from 137 in 1987 to 269 in 1991. The department uses the lists to select, generally at random, 8 to 12 candidates for a job; those chosen submit proposals, from which the consultant is eventually named.
When the department announced plans for a new Flushing branch of the library system in Queens, Commissioner Knuckles said, 11 firms responded to a request for a proposal; 7 were interviewed, and the project went to James Stewart Polshek and Partners.
At times, though, projects are awarded by competition, and when the department announced a competition for the design of a $230 million, 475,000-square-foot Police Academy in the Bronx, 30 design teams made formal submissions. The winner, announced in November, was Ellerbe Becket with Michael Fieldman and Partners, which was chosen from seven high-profile finalists.
AMONG the department's many other projects are a $23 million, 92,000-square-foot Housing Court in the Bronx designed by Rafael Vinoly Architects; a $35 million annex for the Criminal Court Building in Kew Gardens, Queens, for which Ehrenkrantz and Eckstut is the architect, and a million-square-foot courthouse complex in the Bronx on which consultant selection for the first phase -- $122 million and 293,000 square feet -- will begin early next year. They are all part of a $2.8 billion master plan for the city's courts that is to involve 32 projects, either new buildings or major renovations.
The interest in public work even extends to the subways. John Tarantino, assistant vice president for station design at the Transit Authority, said that many new firms and some that had not done subway work for at least 15 years "had come knocking on the door again" inquiring about the authority's station rehabiliation program. Mr. Tarantino said the firms include Skidmore and Kohn Pedersen Fox, which have been added to the lists of qualified consultants.
James A. Schmidt, executive vice president for planning, design and construction at New York City's Economic Development Corporation, said that because "some of the most exciting commissions have always been public commissions" many of the biggest firms, eager for the public and media recognition that such projects bring, have frequently been involved in public work.
"The real point," Mr. Schmidt said, "is that since things are so quiet in the private development community, the public sector becomes more important, it represents a larger percentage of the work."
The development corporation recently held a competition for perhaps the most exciting commission in recent years, the Whitehall Street terminal for the Staten Island Ferry. "We got an excellent response," Mr. Schmidt said.
For architects, the $112 million terminal and especially the big clock, 120 feet in diameter, that is its design centerpiece, have become symbols of the changing times. Six of the most important architectural firms in the country were finalists in the design competition; the winner, Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates (with Anderson/Schwartz Architects), is a world-renowned firm that has rarely been involved in public work.
Most of Venturi, Scott Brown's designs have been institutional, for universities and museums. Recent ones include the Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery in London and the new Seattle Art Museum. But Mr. Venturi said that "about 40 percent of our architectural work is now public, while in the mid-80's it would have been about 10 percent." Among the other public projects Venturi, Scott Brown is working on these days is a resort for the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications in Japan. It also made a losing bid for the Police Academy.
Mr. Samton of Gruzen Samton Steinglass said his firm now did 90 percent of its work in the public sector. Among the projects are the recently opened new Stuyvesant High School on the Hudson River north of the World Financial Center in Manhattan, on which it was co-architect with Cooper, Robertson & Partners, and six prototype public schools, including the new P.S. 5 by the Harlem River in Washington Heights, for the New York City School Construction Authority.
"IN the best of times," he said, "it would have been 50 to 60 percent private and 40 to 50 percent public." Much of the private work that now exists, he said, is institutional and nonprofit.
Marilyn Taylor, a partner in Skidmore's New York office, said that although her office had long done public-sector work, in the 1980's it amounted to about 10 percent, "while these days it's closer to 40 percent."
"We're doing the bridge that crosses West Street at Chambers Street to the new Stuyvesant High School," Ms. Taylor said. "We took a shot at the Staten Island Ferry and didn't make it. We have been involved in the courthouse in Charleston, W. Va., which is in the design stages now. We're also doing a field office for the F.B.I. in downtown Washington."
The firm's Transitional Housing for the Homeless project in New York City, seven units for families and four for singles, has won three awards, most recently the Bard Award of the City Club of New York.
There's also the $33 million, seven-story, 155,000-square-foot Federal Courthouse in White Plains, on which construction is scheduled to begin in January; the Northeast Corridor improvement project, involving 13 train stations from Washington to Boston. And, Ms. Taylor said, "one of the biggest projects we've had in the last eight years in this office, the expansion of Dulles Airport in Washington; it's for an airport authority, not government, but I consider it the public sector."
Shelley Fox of Kohn Pedersen Fox said that in the 1980's his firm did about 95 percent of its work in the private sector; today, because of the downturn, it's 20 percent public sector and 50 percent foreign.
The firm has designed Lincoln Square, the large private commercial and residential building at Broadway and 67th Street near Lincoln Center, one of the biggest private projects now being put up in Manhattan. But it is also the architect (with Simmons Architects) of the $241 million, 27-story Federal Court House in Foley Square -- at 921,000 square feet the largest in the country -- and a courthouse in Portland, Ore.
"We're also going after work at the Buffalo airport," Mr. Fox said. "We're talking with the Battery Park City Authority about the renovation of a building and we're going after a number of projects in Washington, including the Internal Revenue Service headquarters."
Jerry A. Davis, managing principal of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, said that his firm had always done public work but that its public and institutional work had increased from 40 percent in the mid-80's to 90 percent now, including the $276 million, 34-story Federal office building at Foley Square. Its tenants are to include the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Attorney's office.
Other government work, he said, includes an ambulatory care teaching facility at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, a medical-research facility at SUNY Buffalo and a replacement hospital for Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn for the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation.
While the architects are eager to talk about how much more they are serving the public interest, many also do not hesitate to bring up the downside: excessive competition, lower fees, needless bureaucracy and the necessity to spend up front what are often large amounts of money to get a project, money that is lost if they do not succeed.
MS. TAYLOR of Skidmore said it was not unusual for firms "to spend $40,000 or $50,000 in advance to go after the larger projects, some of them in the hundreds of millions of dollars."
"Firms show up with site analyses and models," she said, "for all of which in the past we'd say, 'You'll have to pay us to do these things.' Frankly, architects are so desperate now they're willing to do this. And with government fees not so high, it's a fairly significant up-front risk. If they get the projects, it pays off. But if it doesn't they've lost the money."
Being an architect today, said Mr. Samton of Gruzen Samton Steinglass, "is like being a runner making a living trying to win a marathon. Each request for proposals often gets 60 to 100 responses. So if you think about it, 60 to 100 people are in the race and only one gets the job."
Fees are also a concern. Mr. Samton said that sometimes firms "quote such low prices that should the economy recover they will find themselves with a burden."
"Two or three years from now," he said, "if things get better, they will find themselves still working on projects that no longer seem attractive compared to whatever is new that will be out there."
While prices have generally gone down, Mr. Samton said, the percentage of time that each firm spends on marketing and seeking new business has significantly increased.
"It used to be between 10 and 25 percent," he said. "But it's probably more than half now. Architects have become more and more like salesmen going out there looking for where the business is, putting the proposals together and going to interviews. They're out there trying to get a job instead of doing it. Some people may not acknowledge this because they're embarrassed by it, but that's the case."
One way that architects are coping with the competition, Ms. Taylor said, is by teaming up. "If you can get someone on your team who might have been a competitor," she said, "it increases your chances. Also, the government carefully reviews the number of people you have who are capable of doing the job, and the more you have the better your chances."
Working for the government, said Mr. Davis of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, can often be "more difficult and time consuming" than working in the private sector.
"When you work with a commercial developer, there is usually one decisionmaker," he said. "In government, you can often have hundreds, with many conflicting desires. It requires a different sort of mind set. People who are very good and quick and agile working with private developers tend to get very frustrated working with government."
Architects are working with New York City to cut the bureaucratic red tape -- particularly to simplify the procurement process, so that getting and doing work has fewer hassles. That process, many of them say, has become increasingly complicated in recent years because of changes brought about by the new City Charter and the establishment of a Policy Procurement Board. The changes were initiated partly in reaction to the corruption that has tainted city construction in recent decades.
But the new rules have created "a whole raft of problems with the city," said Lenore M. Lucey, executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, "everything from demeaning pay scales to length of time to get anything approved and processed to lack of control of construction process."
"ONE of the largest problems," she said, "is the way city agencies go about selecting an architect or an engineer or a landscape architect. The procedure has a tendency to be abused and create a situation where in the best scenario, consultants are kept on the hook waiting for eight, nine or 10 months, and in the worst scenario, the consultants have to prespend a large chunk of their fee preparing the materials required by the procurement process."
Recently, she said, for a small project in Queens, a city agency requested proposals from 29 firms on its list of qualified candidates, "and required an inch-and-a-quarter-thick document from each firm in color and in triplicate; that's no mean amount of money."
And then, too often, she said, the selection of the winning firm is based more on price than on quality.
A meeting was held in November with Mr. Rinaldi of the Office of Construction, she said, and a committee has been formed to recommend changes, which Mr. Rinaldi agreed are necessary.
"We need to streamline the process to make it quicker and less costly," he said. "We need to make it a little less onerous in terms of the kinds of resources that go into making a proposal. For the most part, we try to select the best consultant, not necessarily the least expensive, and we want to continue to do so. We should pay a reasonable fee, not necessarily the cheapest."
Commissioner Knuckles of the Department of General Services added that he was for "any simplification of the rules that does not bring about any compromise in the integrity of the process."
Architects and public officials agreed that it was important to keep the best architects interested in continuing to work in the public sector, even if the private sector heats up and that interest is no longer fueled by necessity.
"It represents a wonderful opportunity for New York," said Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society. "New York is the capital of world architecture. We have more world-class architects than anyplace else, and more young people who are hoping to become world-class architects. What the City of New York needs to do is to put these architects to work planning the city that we need."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Industrial Occupancy;
A Blue-Collar Home Feels Recession's Grip

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
TIMES are turbulent in industrial real estate again, says Mathew R. Sassano, who is well placed to judge such matters. He is the general manager of Atlas Terminals, a 25-acre industrial center in Glenwood, Queens, where 52 tenants operate in 38 buildings with a total of one million square feet of space.
Occupancy had reached 100 percent in the 80's after the dispiriting 70's, he said, but the vacancy rate climbed back to 25 percent over the last two and a half years. About half the net loss was a result of bankruptcies of smaller mom-and-pop businesses, many of them newly formed in the 80's; the rest came when businesses left New York City for areas of lower operating costs. 
 But Atlas Terminals has kept reinvesting in the property and there have been some new arrivals and expansions. One of the arrivals is an office user paying about double the rent of an industrial tenant.
All in all, the property provides a snapshot illustration of the problems in industrial property that recession has compounded. Historically successful under the long-term ownership of the Hemmerdinger family, Atlas Terminals shows the effects of the city's shrinking blue-collar-jobs base, the continuing pressure of high taxes and labor costs on small business and the effort of a property owner to adapt industrial space to the market. As the recession continues, it provides another clue to what the city can expect in the way of declining property tax revenue.
Citywide, assessments on commercial property have dropped 15 percent in the last two years -- from $51.1 billion to $43.3 billion. Factory and industrial buildings, a subcategory of commercial properties, fell 20 percent, to $785 million from $987 million. Commercial property as a whole provides about half the $7.9 billion in property taxes billed by New York City.
The trend foreshadows a shrinkage of the tax base, which will be magnified over time by laws that make it difficult in New York City to convert industrial buildings to more productive commercial uses.
But so far, property taxes have risen rather than fallen. The reason is the steady increase in the tax rate and the fact that assessment changes are phased in over five years, causing a lag between actual assessments and billable assessments. At Atlas Terminals, taxes have risen 30 percent in the last two years, to the point that they now amount to about 25 percent of total rents.
Atco Properties & Management, a subsidiary of the Hemmerdinger Corporation, operates Atlas Terminals. The family-run company has broader real-estate interests, but it continues to make capital improvements at the industrial center, which was started by the late Henry H. Hemmerdinger in 1922. The company's president now is H. Dale Hemmerdinger, the founder's grandson.
Last year Atco put over $1 million into upgrading a building with two floors of 30,000 square feet each on a long stretch of Cooper Avenue, the property's main street frontage, at 80th Street.
"We are long-term players so we put money back into the property," said Mr. Hemmerdinger, "although there is usually not enough in rent to justify the investment because the industrial base is shrinking. We took a chance that by investing that amount of money we would get a better quality tenant that would help the whole terminal."
The tenant was forthcoming. Community School District 24, the board with which Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez is embroiled in a dispute over his "rainbow" curriculum requirements, took the second floor on a 10-year lease in September. The board and its staff of 75 work there.
AS an office tenant, the school district is paying about $10 a square foot a year, double the rent of $5 to $5.25 a square foot a year that industrial tenants pay. The opportunity to turn part of the occupancy to office use, especially in the renovated and attractively refaced buildings along Cooper Avenue, was created by the neighborhood -- pleasant, residential and close to city bus service.
On the ground floor of the upgraded building is a Manhattan-based manufacturing tenant, N.C.C. Sportswear Corporation, a maker of women's sportswear and knit tops.
The company took 30,000 square feet for its cutting and shipping operations; the knitting is done by small jobbers at various Queens locations. N.C.C. Sportswear started out three years ago in 15,000 square feet in the Ozone Park section.
"New York is coming back a little bit because of the South American help we're getting," said Oliviero Capacchione, the production manager, although clothing manufacturing that requires heavily automated equipment has long since left for lower-cost locales. "As long as there are people who work on sewing machines, you have an industry."
There are only 25 employees in the space, part of a work force of 1,000 at Atlas Terminals. But only a quarter of them work in manufacturing now, said Mr. Sassano, the general manager. Most of the rest are in warehousing and distribution. Fifteen years ago there were 1,500 jobs at Atlas Terminals and three-quarters of them were manufacturing.
The activities are diverse. There is a sign maker, a fine-furniture maker, a mattress distributor, a medicine manufacturer, a food importer, a book distributor, a trucker, a maker of scented clothing hangers.
In one business, Glendale Products, Enzo Alcamo is carrying on a custom furnituremaking trade established in 1944. He joined the company in 1959 as a cabinetmaker from Italy and is now the owner with 30 employees in 18,000 square feet.
"Most companies like ours in New York have gone out of business," said Mr. Alcamo, whose products include high-quality furniture for executive suites.The major problems have been high taxes and union wage rates, he said. But it also has been necessary to "teach new employees at our own expense."
Nevertheless, he expects to renew his lease when it expires next year.
"This location is ideal -- very residential, and you can find restaurants and banks," he said. "If we were to go out of town we'd never find the skilled labor we need."
NEARBY, Leonard Horowitz, general manager of Mason Medical Products, a division of M.R.C. Industries, says New York City's occupancy tax is the main reason much business has left. The commercial tenant pays the city a tax of 4.2 percent of its gross rent outside central Manhattan and 6 percent in Manhattan south of 96th Street.
Mason Medical produces cushions and bed products for hospitals and nursing homes. It has about 120 employees and has renegotiated its lease on 100,000 square feet to the year 2000.
"The cost of doing business is sky high here," he said, "but it would not be advantageous to move and lose our labor force."
In 1993 Atlas Terminals plans to upgrade another building, an 18,000-square-foot warehouse and distribution structure that will get thermal windows and waterproofing and be "made to look good for the future," said Mr. Sassano. A construction man who has run Atlas Terminals for 25 years, he said that in the last three weeks two tenants had agreed to renew their leases and expand. Mason Medical took an additional 18,000 square feet and National Van Equipment Company added 16,000 square feet to its 30,000 square feet.
"These are the first deals we've made in a year," he said. "We hope this is a sign of a turnaround, but it's really too soon to say that."

HEADLINE: In Hartford, the Latest Desert Boot Comes in Pairs of Four

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN

 BODY:
FOR nearly 200 years, the Smith-Worthington Saddlery Company of Hartford has filled some unusual orders. When explorer Richard E. Byrd went to Antarctica, his sled dogs were equipped with harnesses made by Smith-Worthington. When the bobbies of England, who traditionally did not carry firearms, were issued revolvers during World War II, the Hartford company made the holsters. In more recent years, it did some leather work on the prototype of a space suit and even produced a harness to hold a pacemaker on a pig for an experiment at Yale-New Haven Hospital.
And now, perhaps, it's racing shoes for camels. 
 A year ago, the American embassy in Abu Dhabi, the largest state of the United Arab Emirates on the Persian Gulf, inquired in a memo to certain Government agencies: Did anyone know of an American company that could supply custom-made leather shoes for racing camels?
In the Middle East, camel races are major events. In Abu Dhabi, the memo explained, there are about 10,000 racing camels; one can sell for as much as $1.5 million in United States dollars. But the expensive camels get sore feet so much while training that they are often unable to enter the races. Although it is forbidden to wear shoes during a race, training shoes would at least protect their feet so they could get to the starting line.
John Cabitor of the Hartford office of the United States Department of Commerce read the memo and immediately thought of Smith-Worthington, third oldest company in Connecticut, oldest saddlery company in the nation and the fulfiller of many strange requests over the years. He called Curtis C. Hanks, Smith-Worthington's president.
In the last few months, Mr. Hanks has been communicating with officials in Abu Dhabi, with some success and a lot of frustration. Initially, he had sent a letter to the American embassy in Abu Dhabi expressing interest in making shoes for camels but mentioning that he would have to see a sample shoe. "Frankly," he wrote, "we do not have many camels in Hartford and we would be hard put to properly design-manufacture one without a sample."
 
Doing Research on Goshen Farm
 In return, he has received letters from two companies in Abu Dhabi expressing interest in establishing a connection with Smith-Worthington, but no sample shoe has arrived as yet. So Mr. Hanks is planning on doing some preliminary research at a farm in Goshen where there are a few camels.
He knows that getting close to a camel is an experience not coveted by most businessmen. Camels are renowned for their foul dispositions and are apt to kick and spit when displeased, which is often. Camels do not even like other camels.
Still, Mr. Hanks is willing to chance a camel's fretting in the effort to find a new market for Smith-Worthington, which has survived for nearly two centuries by adjusting to the times and finding niches in the market.
Through the 19th century and into the 20th it supplied saddles, bridles and whips for the cavalry and harnesses for draft horses on the farms and for those that pulled the wagons of the Barnum & Bailey circus from city to city.
When the horse was king, Smith-Worthington was a giant. During World War I, its five-story plant on the Park River employed about 1,000 persons working on a variety of contracts, including making pack saddles to carry big guns and ammunition for the Russian army.
 
Then Came the Automobile
 The automobile spelled the end of Smith-Worthington as a big company and eventually its plant was razed to make way for the portion of Interstate 84 that cuts through Hartford. It became a small company at a new location on Homestead Avenue but with a big reputation for making custom English saddles, bridles and other equestrian supplies for a worldwide market.
It makes about 1,000 saddles annually but only about 100 are produced in Hartford, by two saddle makers seated at leather-working machines that date to the turn of the century. The rest of the saddles are designed in Hartford but made in England. The reason is one of simple economics, Mr. Hanks explained: "I can get an experienced saddle maker there for the salary of a person putting them in boxes here."
Many of Smith-Worthington's customers, Mr. Hanks said, are professional trainers and others who do a lot of riding. Many disabled people often need special saddles. "A few weeks ago, we made one for a lady who is only in her 30's but she has a progressive disabling disease and knows she will be in a wheelchair in five years but wants to enjoy riding until then," he said. Very large people can require very large saddles. "One man had a thigh like this," said Mr. Hanks, stretching out one arm as far as it would go. "Two people could fit in the saddle we made for him."
And then, said Mr. Hanks, there are the people -- he calls them the "Rolls-Royce crowd" -- who want custom saddles because they are that, custom made. One day in 1958, a man who identified himself as the Shah of Iran showed up with some retainers to buy saddles for his royal horses. The people at Smith-Worthington called the Iranian embassy in Washington to make sure it was the Shah. It was.
 
Passed Through Three Families
 Curtis Smith paused by a saddle under construction. "If Mr. Smith were to return today," he said, "he'd say we were doing it the right way." The "tree" of the saddle, he said, is of metal and wood. The webbing is of linen. The leather has been stretched three times to make sure it will retain its form. No plastic or artificial materials go into Smith-Worthington saddles.
The Mr. Smith he referred to was Normand Smith, who founded the company in 1794. The business was situated north of the Old State House, which still graces Hartford's Main Street, at "the sign of the Mounted Dragoon."
Perhaps the most impressive statistic about Smith-Worthington is that only three families have owned it during its 198 years: the Smith family, the Roberts family and the Hanks family. The Worthington name was added for George Worthington, a Smith family in-law, when he joined the company.
The Smith family held on until this century when the company was purchased by an employee, John Allen Roberts. Then, after World War II, it was purchased from Mr. Roberts by another employee, Clinton C. Hanks, who had gone to work there in 1936 as an office boy and bookkeeper. The elder Hanks, now 77, is chairman of Smith-Worthington but comes in to work three days a week. His son, as president, carries on day-to-day operations.
And business, said the younger Hanks, is just fine today, despite the recession. "We did more business by the end of August this year than we did in all of 1991," he said.
He admits, though, that he would like the camel shoe business. It does have an exotic flavor to it.

HEADLINE: Overcoming the Holocaust With Success

BYLINE: By RICHARD F. SHEPARD

 BODY:
THE other night William B. Helmreich finished a talk in Great Neck, fielded a few questions from the audience and then listened with pleasure as one man stood up and said, "I just want to express my deep appreciation for what you did. You gave us respect and dignity."
The man was not speaking for a special-interest group or a class of people who need to wrap themselves in images. He was a survivor, a word in certain circles that takes on a particular and somber uniqueness: a survivor who lived through the specific and dreadful ministrations visited upon unfortunates in the grasp of the Nazi regime. 
 The man was expressing gratitude for Mr. Helmreich's latest book, "Against All Odds: Holocaust Survivors and the Successful Lives They Made in America" (Simon & Schuster, $23). The author, a 47-year-old professor of sociology and Judaic studies at City College and the City University Graduate Center, was gratified by the stranger's comment, because, well, he was a stranger, and the thanks derived purely from the book itself.
 
Interviewed 300 People
 "He was not one of the 380 people I interviewed for the book," Mr. Helmreich said, adding that he had not even met him in Great Neck, where the author lives.
There have been many books about the survivors of the concentration camps, but this one, the author said, struck off into a new direction.
"No book talks about the survivors in regard to anything but their pathologies," Mr. Helmreich said. "There are no social histories. Until now, most sources drew from limited samples. Yet only 18 percent of the survivors ever saw a psychologist. The survivors had lives before and after the war.
"Why did I write this book? I felt it would be a travesty if survivors were only remembered as the skeletons they looked like when they emerged from the camps. Hitler made them look that way. Why give Hitler a victory by leaving this impression?"
There were 140,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors who made it to the United States, and those were the people that seized Mr. Helmreich's interest. His parents had escaped from Belgium to France and Switzerland, where the author was born 10 months before the family emigrated to New York in 1946. His Polish-born father and his mother had lost family members to the Holocaust.
For all his personal interest in the subject, Mr. Helmreich saw in this study of adjustment a universal meaning applicable to many people. "Everyone goes through a personal crisis at some time," he said. "How did these people learn to live, to love, to trust, to bring children into the world? Generally, they coped well."
The project took six years to finish, which Mr. Helmreich did last year in Israel, as Iraqi scud missiles were flying in the gulf war. He was a visiting professor at Hebrew University and remembers that as a New Yorker, he was not especially daunted by a refractory scud-menaced atmosphere and that he had told himself, "No third-rate dictator is going to chase me out of a place."
Perhaps it was an attitude absorbed from the survivors Mr. Helmreich had interviewed, as varied slices of life as one could expect to find in any group of people indiscriminately plucked from their homes and their lives and subjected to horrors that defy explanation or excuse.
"I traveled to Tuscaloosa, to Atlanta, to Racine, to Kenosha, the length and breadth of the land," Mr. Helmreich said, explaining that survivors had clustered in New York, but spread to every corner of the country.
"While they are united by the unique experiences they went through, I found tremendous individuality. In some places I found two people who lived within a block of each other but wouldn't speak, not because of hostility, but because they had altogether different interests. I chose people who were representative of a range of varieties, from Hasidim to farmers."
The diversity of survivors who speak about their arrivals in America, the effects of their Holocaust years and their adjustments is astonishing. Art dealers, business people, wage earners, a survivor who became an American general, another who became a California Congressman and another who headed the Anti-Defamation League all addressed the issue put to them by the author, and their reactions were as unpredictably varied as the people are as a group.
The publication of the book gives little promise that Mr. Helmreich will have time to loll about Great Neck with his wife, Helaine, a speech pathologist who has just finished a first novel; his three sons, 9 to 19 years old, and his 6-year-old daughter.
"Against All Odds" is Mr. Helmreich's eighth book, and he shows no signs of calling it quits with his word processor. In addition he is active in more than the classroom at City College.
As a matter of fact, it is difficult to pin down the interests of the youthful-looking blue-eyed savant, who as a student at Washington University in Missouri in the 1960's, found himself as the lone white person in a group affiliated with the Black Panthers and a protester against police harassment.
Put that together with Mr. Helmreich's service as a volunteer in Israel in the 1967 war and his work with Bowery derelicts, and an impressive, if confused, portrait emerges. He is also an enthusiastic New Yorker. Upon returning from Israel this year he walked every block on Broadway, apparently mostly to energize himself.
The books that Mr. Helmreich has written also do not wrap him up easily. "The World of the Yeshiva" was a fascinating volume about education in the traditional Jewish world in which he grew up. "The Things They Say Behind Your Back" examines the stereotypes that various ethnic groups are saddled with, including chapters on Jews, Italians, Blacks, Japanese, Chinese, Irish, Poles, Hispanics and WASP's.
"Growing Up Jewish in New York" was a Book-of-the-Month Club alternate. Then there was a study of the relationship of black people to Africa, a textbook of sociology and "How to Interview for a Job."
"I'm in my 20th year at City College, and I feel my students need me," Mr. Helmreich said. "They are just like the students who went to City in the 1930's and 1940's. They have the same needs and aspirations. This is their Harvard."
 
An Undiminished Interest
 Years back Mr. Helmreich immersed himself in black studies at Yale, an interest that has not diminished, as evidenced by his leadership in campus projects like the Center of Urban Legal Studies at City College and the City College Center for Conflict Resolution.
"I've just finished doing interviews on black anti-Semitism," he said. "The results are interesting. Younger blacks are not rigid and don't know a lot about Jews. They feel optimistic. They don't see this in racial and religious terms, but in economic terms."
Perhaps Mr. Helmreich's optimism has rubbed off on the students. That is because he is an optimist, if only because he says it is the only way that one can work toward any future that is not written in despair.
For a man whose laundry list of human problems seems inexhaustible, Mr. Helmreich presents a profile that is anything but harried. Enthusiastic, yes, but worried, no. "I find it's best not to take life seriously, at least in my own affairs," he said.

HEADLINE: On a Cold Night, Room for the Homeless

BYLINE: By ALBERT J. PARISI

DATELINE: RIVER EDGE

 BODY:
A COLD, bitter December wind lashed at their clothing as the five men and two women stepped from a van and entered the First Congregational Church here. Somewhere in the building, radiators clanged and whistled a shrill song.
It was 7:30 P.M., and they had nowhere else to sleep. There had been no room for them at the county center for the homeless in Hackensack, and a county van had brought them to the church. 
Inside the auditorium-gymnasium, where Christmas ornaments hung delicately from the ceiling, volunteers waited to show the seven their cots for the night, the men and women separated by a wooden divider. With blankets and bedsheets supplied them by the county, they made up cots upon which they placed their few belongings.
Anna Rodriguez, 37, a thin, fragile-looking woman from Jersey City, sat on her cot, clothing neatly folded beside her, her back to the other visitors. Confusion and joy chased each other across her face.
On this night, the church here, which is affiliated with the United Church of Christ, was one of two in Bergen County that were taking the overflow from a county-run shelter for the homeless in Hackensack. It is part of a program in which 42 churches and synagogues are participating through the Inter-Religious Fellowship for the Homeless of Bergen County, a nonprofit agency.
In this county, ranked for years as one of the nation's top 10 wealthiest areas, the homeless population rose from 2,530 in 1989 to 4,302 in 1991, and it is still rising, according to a county report issued in August. And those figures reflect only the people who seek assistance. Advocates for the homeless say there are at least seven times as many in need who do not seek help and remain uncounted.
To receive help through the nonprofit group's program, applicants must be actively seeking employment and come from the county's 72 communities, but even those who do not meet the requirements are sometimes accepted.
"When the temperature outside is below freezing," said Kathleen J. Stanton, the program's executive director, "it's kind of tough to say no to anyone."
In the hour before the visitors arrived, volunteers in the kitchen were unwrapping dishes of food they had brought from home. "It's very hard to get good gravy out of meat loaf," said Bertha Myhren, 64, of Oradell as Sally Zick, 65, of River Edge nodded agreement. They placed the heaping aluminum trays in an oven and turned their attention to bowls of mashed potatoes and sunset bright carrots.
Soon the food was ready, and the "guests," as the volunteers called them, began filling their plates. At nearby tables they sat and ate as the volunteers joined their ranks.
Miss Rodriguez sat to one side, and the Rev. John H. Danner, the congregation's pastor and his wife, Linda, joined her and exchanged smiles. Nearby, a black and white television set came to life with "Wheel of Fortune," but the volume was low and it received little attention.
For Laura Silver, 32, formerly of New Milford, and Gordon DeFreese, 36, formerly of Mahwah, this was their first night in a shelter after losing a makeshift apartment in an illegal rooming house in Hackensack.
 
A Landlord's Complaint
 "We've been staying with friends, but they could only take us in for so long before the landlord started complaining," Miss Silver said. Both are receiving limited government assistance and are looking for work, she said, but their prospects are few.
"I was working in a cemetery, was there about 11 months, and the shop supervisor took a dislike to me," Mr. DeFreese said. "I got fired." Being late for work "a couple of days in a row sure didn't help," he added.
Miss Silver, a baker's helper by profession, said that more and more local bakeries were laying off staff members rather than hiring.
They look upon the shelter program as a safety net of sorts. Mr. DeFreese, who has been jailed three times for failure to pay support for his four children, said that most of what he has earned recently has gone to pay that support. "There just wasn't that much left for me after that," he said.
 
Three Children Taken Away
 Miss Silver said her three children had been taken away from her and placed in permanent foster homes. "It's tough, especially with Christmas coming on, what with us not having enough to give to the kids," Mr. DeFreese said.
"If I could do it," he added, "if we both could do it, we'd like nothing more than to have a place of our own and all the kids together under one roof. But I'd be dreaming, and that wouldn't make this here nightmare go away."
By 8:30, the mealtime dishes had been cleared and another pot of coffee was brewing. When the guests were asked about their lives, some talked eagerly; others spoke hardly at all.
Larry Rogers said that his family was in Poland and that he hoped to join the family members someday. He said he is terminally ill and unable to work.
Robert Jones, a Vietnam War veteran, told volunteers that he was a machinist for 18 years until he recently lost his job. He has entered a county retraining program.
Miss Rodriguez, a native of Puerto Rico, does not remember the last time she worked or what job she held, she said. Her deep brown eyes are both suspicious and warm, as quick to change as the images on the nearby television screen.
 
First Night in Bergen Program
 This was her first night in the Bergen County program. She recalled a stay in a Newark shelter as a fearful experience. For a while, she said, she had stayed with a male friend until his demands for sex led her to leave.
"People out there, they try to hurt you, and I've seen too many friends die in the streets," she said. "Maybe here it is different, people are different. I don't want to be raped again."
Tyrone C., who insisted that his full name not be used, is 26 and eager for work. He passed around color photographs of his wife and 3-year-old daughter, who live with family members in Middletown, N.Y.
"I never truly understood what it meant to be homeless until I became one myself," he said.
"I was working two jobs, had my own place and was saving enough to bring my family here when it happened," he said. Within the course of a week, the part-time job he had at a Hackensack diner ended when it was closed for renovations; he arrived one day at his other job, in an auto body shop, and "found the place padlocked."
Tyrone C. said that he could have been staying with his brother nearby, but that "he has enough to worry about with his own family." He added: "With God's help, I'll come through this O.K., and living here like this, well, it's kind of a means to an end."
 
Guests Getting Ready for Bed
 By 9:45 the conversation had subsided. Overhead lights were dimmed, and some guests began to drift toward their beds. Miss Rodriguez lay on her cot wrapped in a gray blanket as though she were in a cocoon.
By 10:30, the lights in the auditorium were turned off. An illuminated exit sign cast an orange glow over the cots and the guests in their blankets, some of them already asleep. The overnight volunteers moved off to the separate kitchen area.
Art Caughlan, 45, of River Edge, a volunteer at the shelter, owns a local insurance agency. He feels he has been lucky in life, he said, and "I believe in giving back to the community in whatever way I can." In the past, he has helped raise funds for the overflow shelter program -- but now, he said, "funds are hard to come by, especially from corporations."
To be an overnight volunteer at the shelter, he added, was "kind of like having guests overnight in your house; with your heart, you watch over them."
The other overnight volunteer, Wayne Placek, 45, of Oradell, the church's shelter coordinator and a sales manager for a glass replacement company, remembered an unemployed construction worker who had stayed overnight at the church shelter last summer. "He asked us to pray for him," Mr. Placek said, "that he had a job interview and was confident about it."
 
A Job Is Found
 The following week, the construction worker returned, Mr. Placek said, "shook hands all around -- he'd gotten the job -- and thanked us for our prayers and support."
By 1:30 A.M., the wind was so strong that it was shaking the windowpanes. A mandatory bed check showed that all the guests were accounted for. "All is quiet," Mr. Caughlan noted in a log sheet that would be given to officials at the county center.
During the night, Mr. Placek and Mr. Caughlan took turns catching naps on a couch upstairs in the church. Shortly after 5 o'clock, they set about brewing a fresh pot of coffee and preparing a breakfast of doughnuts, cold cereal and orange juice for their guests.
Soon the guests themselves were up and stirring, folding their sheets and blankets and putting personal belongings back into their bags. There was a general move to the breakfast table, though Miss Rodriguez joined in only after Mr. Placek invited her.
Tyrone C. knelt quietly against a far wall in silent prayer.
By 6:30, carrying bagged lunches prepared by Mrs. Danner, the guests were ready to take the van back to Hackensack, where county aides would help in their job search.
"Maybe today we'll be lucky," Miss Silver said as Mr. DeFreese nodded somewhat groggily in agreement. "I've just got this feeling, a special feeling," she said.

HEADLINE: Japan's Nuclear Fiasco

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TSURUGA, Japan

 BODY:
IT STARTED as the ultimate Japanese dream: a technology that promised a virtually inexhaustible supply of electricity to power Japan's factories and houses, and a quick, neat way for Japan to convert its growing piles of nuclear waste into an energy source that could keep the country running through wars in the Persian Gulf, natural disasters or political upheavals. Japan's bureaucrats, awash with success in autos and electronics, expected it to become another triumph for Japanese industrial policy.
Now, week by week, Japan's most ambitious nuclear project is falling apart, variously described as an environmental disaster waiting to happen, an invitation to terrorists looking for fuel for nuclear weapons, and a financial fiasco for the Japanese taxpayers and utility shareholders. For the many admirers of Japanese industrial planning -- some of whom met in Little Rock, Ark., with President-elect Bill Clinton last week -- the experience is a cautionary tale. Even the masters of merging the talents of Government and industry can blow it, especially if they ignore fundamental changes in a market or a changing political atmosphere. 
 Nearly three decades ago, Japan decided it would develop a new generation of breeder reactors that would produce new fuel as quickly as they burned the old. There was one hitch: Rather than utilize uranium, the ordinary fuel, these reactors would be powered by plutonium. While both are radioactive and must be treated with great care, plutonium is much more toxic than uranium -- a mere speck can cause cancer. It can also be converted much more easily for use in atomic bombs -- the diversion of a few pounds could put an enormous weapon in the hands of terrorists or countries that are aspiring nuclear powers.
But to the Japanese, the risk seemed worth it. Perhaps no nation feels as perpetually insecure about its dependence on foreign countries as Japan, which imports 80 percent of its energy. True, the breeder reactor project would require Japan to find a safe way to harness one of the deadliest substances on earth -- and persuade the rest of the world that it was safe. But Japan's industrial planners convinced the country's electric utilities that together they could do in nuclear technology what they have done in other industries.
 
A $5 Billion Breeder
 With initial encouragement from Washington, they formed companies, made technological alliances overseas and carefully crafted a public relations campaign that skimmed over some of the unpleasant details. Meanwhile, hundreds of engineers and Government officials descended on this remote fishing village on the Sea of Japan 250 miles west of Tokyo. Since 1986, Japan has spent $5 billion here on a prototype breeder reactor named Monju, for the Buddhist divinity of wisdom.
Japanese officials still defend their plans vociferously. They say the United States -- which dropped its own breeder reactor program 15 years ago largely to stop the proliferation of bomb-grade materials -- will come to regret not taking a longer-range vision for nuclear energy.
But now, with the first of 30 planned shipments of plutonium scheduled to arrive here by sea in a few weeks, criticism is mounting not only of the way the plutonium is being transported but of the environmental, economic and political prudence of the entire project.
And behind the scenes, a Government that prides itself on lifting its industrial policy above the plane of political debate has suddenly found itself divided and bickering, and looking for a way out.
"It is almost inconceivable that such a good idea could have turned this bad," said a senior Japanese official who asked not to be identified. "We spent the last 20 years building this project, and we'll probably spend the next 20 killing it."
So while America has a lot to learn from the way Japan manages the business of high technology, the plutonium uproar holds some important lessons for those who would import Japanese industrial planning techniques wholesale. Among them is that economic realities cannot be ignored once the policy is set.
When the breeder project began amid the energy crises of the 1970's, experts said uranium in the 1990's would be scarce and expensive. That made the far more expensive process of recovering plutonium from the spent fuel of ordinary uranium-burning reactors and burning it for electricity seem less daunting.
Instead, uranium prices have plunged, and, depending on whom you ask, electricity derived from plutonium will be 5 to 15 times more expensive. In a country that already has the most expensive electricity in the world, that statistic has all but doomed the Government's chances of getting utility companies to go along with its plans -- a point underscored recently when the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation, which is building Monju, said the $5 billion breeder reactor may operate for only seven years.
 
A Blind Spot?
 Japan's experience also points up the dangers of building such a huge business around a policy that reversing course would cost jobs and political embarrassment. And some of those involved say the plutonium effort demonstrates anew the recurrent blind spot in Japanese industrial policy: Too little regard, until it is too late, for the international ramifications. That was also the lesson of the 1980's, when the Government, discovering that its growing trade surpluses were provoking anger worldwide, scrambled to repair the damage from flooding overseas markets with its cars and computer chips.
A confluence of unanticipated events has made life miserable at the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the lesser-known Science and Technology Agency. The end of the cold war created an unexpected glut of plutonium, much of it from disassembled nuclear weapons. That has heightened fears that there is a vast world oversupply of plutonium -- ripe for diversion to countries like Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and North Korea -- just as Japan sets about producing far more.
In fact, rising international concern about nuclear proliferation has made plutonium breeders a far bigger political problem than anyone anticipated. The Japanese themselves, for example, are in the embarrassing position of insisting that North Korea abandon its plants to recover plutonium from nuclear waste -- the core of a suspected weapons project -- while Japanese engineers are breaking ground for the same kind of facility 700 miles across the Sea of Japan.
Meanwhile, Japanese diplomats have been fanning across Asia trying to quiet countries howling about the potential dangers of the plutonium shipment now under way -- a shipboard fire that could breach the containers holding a ton of plutonium, a terrorist attack, an accident that would force the ship to stop in a crowded port city. South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, the Philippines and a host of small South Pacific nations have told Japan to keep its lightly armed convoy -- bearing the largest sealift of the material ever attempted -- out of their territorial waters.
More horrifying for the Japanese, neighbors with memories of Japan as a colonizing power are questioning the country's true motives. "No one in Korea really believes Japan plans to use this plutonium for peaceful purposes," said Lee Chul, a leading South Korean politician. There is no evidence that Japan is violating its own ban on possessing or building nuclear weapons, but a few weeks ago the Government felt compelled to say that for 30 years "Japan has earned the trust of the international community for its peaceful uses of nuclear energy. There is absolutely no reason to question Japan on this matter."
 
A Start in the 50's
 Japan's nuclear-energy policy originated in the 1950's. Fresh from the end of the American occupation and still preoccupied with rebuilding the country, the Government saw nuclear power as the most reliable way to realize its industrial ambitions. In 1966, it formally declared that it would start a huge effort in self-sufficient breeder reactors.
The next year, it laid the first bricks of the infrastructure, forming the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation to coordinate the use of plutonium as a fuel and forging an alliance among private utility companies, MITI and other Government agencies, as well as Japan's research laboratories and universities. It was, in short, classic industrial policy, Japan-style -- this time with the encouragement of the United States.
"You have to remember that the U.S. started with these ideas first, and Japan just followed their plans," said Kenji Yamaji, a research fellow at the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industries.
From the start, Japan's giant utility companies were reluctant: The expense was huge and plutonium is extremely hard to handle. But none dared question official policy, which was to convert all spent fuel from ordinary nuclear reactors into plutonium for the new breeder reactors.
Starting in the early 1980's, Government researchers realized it would be impossible to recycle all the nation's spent nuclear fuel, but Mr. Yamaji and others say they did not want to sound the alarm "until after the Government agreed to modify its policies." Similar self-censorship, the experts say, is one reason Japan was slow to see the pitfalls in its policy. It had already entered into still-secret agreements with Britain and France to help them build reprocessing plants -- Japan's contribution is said to be more than $3 billion -- and to ship nuclear waste there for conversion to plutonium. So for a decade, Japan has exported its spent fuels, and with them its storage problems.
"Japan had to bow deep to get them to build the plants," said one official involved in the deal. "That is one reason no one can back out of these contracts now." (Japan's own $7 billion reprocessing center, delayed for years, will not open until at least the end of the decade.)
In the mid-1980's, just as Japan began to break ground for the Monju plant, parts of the grand plan began to unravel. Chernobyl happened, and in a nation with an intense nuclear allergy, reinforced by regular images of the victims at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, public opinion began to turn against all nuclear plants.
Though 11 plants are now under construction, no new site has been approved in years; a series of malfunctions of existing plants, leading to some sudden shutdowns, has worsened the public image here. As a result, Japan's early hopes of doubling the number of its nuclear power plants in the next 20 years -- there are 42 operating now -- have been all but officially abandoned.
For the breeder program, the problems were even worse. The Europeans, following the United States' lead, began to rethink the wisdom of the program. France's Superphenix breeder reactor, a model for Monju's design, was forced to shut down in 1988 because of technical problems. It may never restart. The Germans abandoned their prototype, and Britain says it will close its breeder reactor in 1994. The Japanese are the last breeder-reactor customers for the European reprocessing centers.
Officially, the Japanese say they are unfazed. "Were Japan to be the only nation working in this area," the Foreign Ministry said last month, the country would "view its responsibility as even greater and redouble its efforts to contribute to the international community through technological development."
 
A Possible Switch
 Behind the scenes, many in the Government and industry have their doubts. As evidence has mounted that the world -- and Japan -- will be awash in plutonium, the Science and Technology Agency has rushed to come up with ways to burn it rather than produce more. Its idea involves mixing plutonium with uranium to fuel ordinary nuclear power plants, which run on uranium alone.
In other words, the Government has told the utilities to replace a relatively inexpensive fuel with a far more expensive one. The giant utility companies were horrified; the implications for their shareholders, rate-payers and profits were obvious. "In public we will tell you that this is taking the long-term perspective," a senior official of Tokyo Electric Power said recently. "But what everyone knows, and won't say in public, is that this will cost consumers a fortune."
Meanwhile, here at the Monju plant, engineers like Ken Yamamoto have raced to make sure that Japan's breeder reactor is not plagued by the problems that killed France's. The technology is difficult: Breeder reactors must use sodium, rather than water, to carry away intense heat -- a more complex system. Moreover, the piping is much thinner, so as to transfer heat more quickly. That can make the system more prone to cracking. It was the piping that tripped up the French.
"Japanese are very good at checking and quality control, and we think we have overcome the problems," Mr. Yamamoto said the other day at the plant, soon to "go critical" with its first bit of plutonium fuel. "We believe it is safer because it is a Japanese design."
Then there are the political problems -- particularly how Japan would get its European-processed plutonium back to its own shores.
In fact, most experts agree that the risk of shipping the plutonium by sea is fairly low, but still, Japan kept the details of the voyage highly secret. (The convoy swept south from France, around South Africa, and is now believed heading north in the Pacific near Indonesia.)
The shipment is expected to arrive in Japan shortly after the new year. But that will not end the controversy. The fuel will be in reprocessing and storage for at least three years, Japanese officials conceded recently, before Monju is ready to start burning it. To some, that seems to contradict Japan's pledge never to stockpile plutonium, making it a potential target for terrorists. (The Japanese refer to the plutonium as a "running stock" -- to assure steady supply.)
In theory, at least, there will be 30 to 40 more shipments over the next 18 years. In recent weeks, some Japanese officials have started saying the plan is being reviewed, but others argue the country should go full steam ahead, because energy sources and prices are unpredictable -- and Japan cannot afford to be caught without. They reject suggestions that Japan should build a strategic reserve of uranium at the current low market prices. "At this stage there is no reason to change our policy," said Noboru Hatakeyama, Vice Minister for International Trade and Industry.
In the end, Japan will probably scale back the plans drastically. But if experience is any guide, it will not let breeder reactor technology -- or any other strategically vital industry -- die completely. It will just wait for another change of economic fortunes or political realities. Until then, the question is how high a price Japan is willing to pay -- financially and politically -- for an idea that has never quite gone as planned.
 
 
THE HARSH MEMORIES OF MINAMATA
 AILEEN MIOKO SMITH got her start confronting the Japanese Government in one of the country's saddest cities -- Minamata, the site of mercury poisoning that became a symbol of what happens when government and industry turn a blind eye to industrial pollution.
With her late husband, the photographer W. Eugene Smith, she put together a book of painful images of the deformities and illnesses afflicting victims of the poisonings, who had eaten fish contaminated by polluted effluents. The book helped force Tokyo to recognize and compensate the victims.
Two decades later, Ms. Smith is back -- organizing a grass-roots campaign against imports of plutonium to fuel breeder reactors. From her home in Kyoto, she has spent years in the antinuclear movement, a movement that until recently was small enough that the Government and utility companies largely ignored it.
No longer. The daughter of a Japanese mother and an American father, Ms. Smith started an organization called Stop the Monju, a reference to the prototype breeder reactor, that persuaded Japanese homemakers to write to foreign governments, asking them to bar Japan's plutonium convoy from their waters. (Applying foreign pressure on the Japanese Government is usually the fastest way to effect change in Japan.)
"People say that there are no real grass-roots movements in Japan," Ms. Smith said recently. "But in fact a lot is happening."

Europe's Loss Is America's Gain

BYLINE: By Roger Cohen

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
WITH the American recovery more conspicuous than any glimmer of European growth and most analysts expecting a substantial appreciation of the dollar against European currencies in the coming year, investing in Europe in 1993 does not look particularly attractive at present.
One estimate, from S. G. Warburg, is that the dollar will be at 1.85 marks by the end of 1993, up 19 percent from 1.56 marks today. While some analysts are less bullish, there is a general feeling that stronger growth in the United States, the arrival in the White House of Bill Clinton and continuing instability in European currency markets will bolster the dollar. Clearly, this tendency must be factored into any European investment. 
 "The European economy is going to be weak, at least through the first half of 1993," said Didier Philippe, an analyst at the Bernard Barnier brokerage in Paris. "So we favor companies with a strong presence in the United States."
This reasoning leads many analysts to favor Swiss, Dutch and British equities, which are generally most sensitive to the United States economy, and the dollar. Richard Davidson, the European equity strategist at Morgan Stanley in London, likes Royal Dutch/Shell and the Dutch publishing group Elsevier, both of which are expected to show solid earnings growth next year.
Swiss companies are among the most international in Europe and best represented in the United States. The giant food group Nestle, with a price-earnings ratio of 13.5 to 1, still looks cheap to many analysts. Among the big pharmaceuticals groups, Roche and Sandoz are widely favored.
Moreover, the Swiss banking sector could benefit both from an appreciation of the dollar -- the currency in which the banks pay commissions -- and from an expected fall in European interest rates, which would afford the banks wider margins. Melissa Carrington, an analyst at Hoare Gavett in London, likes CS Holdings and the Union Bank of Switzerland.
In Britain, where Andrew Garthwaite of S. G. Warburg estimated that 25 percent of earnings for major companies on the stock market come from the United States, analysts believe lower interest rates could benefit larger retail groups, including Dixons and Marks & Spencer. Other companies that are favored because of their strong international profile include the pharmaceuticals firm Wellcome and the media group Reuters.
However, all European equities are considered vulnerable to the deep uncertainties afflicting the Continent. A business upturn had been expected by the middle of this year, but never materialized. High German interest rates, instability in the European Monetary System and a lack of consumer confidence are all undermining the economy. The auto sector, for example, is deeply depressed and is expected to remain so through 1993.
In a report issued this month, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted 1993 European growth of just 1.2 percent, half that of the United States. Many believe this forecast, slashed from an earlier 1993 European forecast of 2.7 percent, is still optimistic.
The crucial factor remains German interest rates, which have remained high because of the Bundesbank's determination to stem inflationary pressure resulting from the cost of reunification. Europe's long-expected economic upturn has been held back because Germany's high rates have forced other European countries to follow suit, to sustain their currencies against the mark.
The consensus is that German rates will finally fall in 1993. But when? The latest estimate is that they could start easing in April, when a wage pact should be in place that would help keep inflation down.
With lower rates, financial groups throughout the Continent should eventually benefit. Among stocks that could do well are Banco Santander in Spain, Societe Generale in France and the Dresdner Bank in Germany.
But it remains unclear whether other countries, particularly France, will be able to wait for German rates to ease. Britain and Italy have already left the monetary system.
The French economy is healthier than the German, and, if not for the European monetary system, French authorities would probably lower interest rates, by as much as three percentage points, to stimulate growth.
Mr. Davidson of Morgan Stanley argues that it is inevitable that the franc will be allowed to float until Germany gets its house in order, despite strong statements from French authorities that the franc-mark parity will not budge. On this basis, he is bullish on French stocks, which would benefit heavily from sharply lower interest rates. Among the stronger French companies are the tire group Michelin, the telecommunications group Alcatel Alsthom and the financial group Credit National.
A franc float, however, is far from certain, as are all predictions in an abruptly unstable Europe. In this environment, many analysts favor bonds over equities, particularly longer-term bonds, given the expected fall in short-term interest rates. "My European portfolio for 1993 would be 60 percent bonds, 30 percent equities and 10 percent cash," Mr. Garthwaite of S. G. Warburg said.
Risk-takers might try Eurotunnel. Conflicts with the contractors building the tunnel under the channel between Britain and France continue to plague the company. But if they are resolved, the stock looks cheap to many analysts, and the projected opening of the tunnel late in 1993 should be one bright spot in Europe's somber outlook.

HEADLINE: Castle Rock Raises the Stakes

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD

 BODY:
The sleek offices of Castle Rock Entertainment were humming on Monday morning. "We have our '92 Cadillac," said Alan F. Horn, managing partner of the five-year-old film and production company, as he examined the big weekend box-office receipts of Castle Rock's newest film, "A Few Good Men."
Of course, it is up to moviegoers to determine whether the slick, expensive courtroom drama turns out to be a Cadillac or something more modest. But Mr. Horn and his four partners, including Rob Reiner, the film's director, seem assured that their $40 million gamble, starring Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson and Demi Moore, will hardly be an Edsel. 
 In fact, although Castle Rock has produced only 10 films, it has already gained a reputation in Hollywood as one of the more innovative and successful independent companies in town. In a business where independents like Carolco, Vestron, Orion, the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and Cannon have fallen prey to economic turmoil in recent years, Castle Rock has been notably stable.
Whether Castle Rock will succeed in the long term -- in contrast to most other independents -- is another matter. The company, with just 60 employees, faces considerable risks as it makes more expensive movies.
For now, "the outlook for Castle Rock can only be characterized as rosy," said Christopher P. Dixon, an entertainment industry analyst at Paine Webber. He cited Castle Rock's deal with Columbia Pictures, which distributes the company's movies but keeps its hands off production.
"Castle Rock now has the best of all possible worlds," Mr. Dixon said. "It has a strong distribution arrangement with a major studio, yet it is able to maintain creative control. And now with its track record, as Castle Rock attracts talent like Nicholson and Cruise, projects will continue to gravitate to them."
(Actually, the projects have been gravitating to Mr. Reiner, who makes his films there, but Castle Rock executives insist that the company is building its own name.)
"A Few Good Men," which may cost as much as $55 million after advertising and promotion, grossed $15.5 million at the box office in its first weekend. As Castle Rock's most expensive film so far, "A Few Good Men" is expected to perform strongly in the United States and abroad. But its hefty cost will certainly diminish profits.
In the past, the company shied away from big-budget star vehicles and focused largely on films costing $15 million to $25 million (excluding promotion and marketing). But it is plainly moving in new directions now. Its 1993 films include "In the Line of Fire," a $38 million adventure about the Secret Service starring Clint Eastwood. And in April, Mr. Reiner starts directing "North," a $35 million film about a young boy who wants to find new parents.
In a relatively short time, Castle Rock has produced some critical and financial successes, including "City Slickers," starring Billy Crystal, which grossed $123 million in the United States alone; "When Harry Met Sally," grossing $93 million, and "Misery," grossing $68 million.
On the television side -- which started out as Castle Rock's major business but is now secondary to movies -- the company's successes have included "Seinfeld" on NBC. It has also produced "Sessions," the critically acclaimed series created by Mr. Crystal, for Home Box Office.
Of course, Castle Rock has had its share of failures, including "Year of the Comet," which grossed less than $5 million, and "Late for Dinner," which grossed only $10 million.
BUT by far the most painful flop was the Crystal film "Mr. Saturday Night," which cost $43 million including advertising and marketing and grossed only about $16 million. (In typical Hollywood fashion, the company's partners blame everything from the film's marketing to the refusal of audiences to see Mr. Crystal in a somber role as an unpleasant borscht-belt comedian. Critics, however, noted that the film was seriously flawed.)
Castle Rock also produced "Sibling Rivalry," which grossed $20 million, and "Lord of the Flies," which grossed $15 million. And its "Honeymoon in Vegas," which cost $35 million and grossed roughly that amount in the United States, is expected to eke out some profits from videocassette and cable-television sales and foreign distribution.
But what makes Castle Rock unusual in Hollywood is not so much its box score but its management style. In a town of sharks, Castle Rock's partners swim in calm waters. Not that the five partners aren't tough. But the company is run like a 40-something boys club.
Mr. Horn, 49 years old, graduated from the Harvard Business School in 1971 and worked as a branch manager for Procter & Gamble's Ivory Soap before he was hired in the late 1970's to run business and marketing for Norman Lear's Tandem Productions, later Embassy Communications. Mr. Horn eventually became chief executive of Embassy, where he met most of the future Castle Rock partners.
The other partners are Glenn Padnick, 45, who had served as president of Embassy Television and is Castle Rock's chief television executive; Andrew Scheinman, 44, who is executive producer of "Seinfeld" and works closely on all of Mr. Reiner's projects; Martin Shafer, 38, who oversees movie projects, and Mr. Reiner, 45, who played the "Meat head" in Mr. Lear's television show "All in the Family."
Mr. Scheinman, who first met Mr. Reiner on a Hollywood tennis court, said: "We're in and out of each other's offices 50 times a day. There's no knocking on doors. We all know what's going on. We all seem to have a similar sensibility."
Mr. Horn agreed, noting: "We have a voting arrangement in terms of scripts, but I don't think we've ever voted. It's all highly informal."
And Mr. Padnick said: "We have lunch four or five times a week. We play poker every couple of weeks. Nothing goes on that each of us aren't personally aware of. We actually have a good time." He laughed. "That makes us the envy of a lot of people."
IF Castle Rock's easy style is the envy of many in Hollywood, so is the company's financial set-up. The company is privately held, so it does not disclose precise figures about its finances and salaries. Mr. Horn did acknowledge that the five partners received "comfortable" six-figure salaries. In addition, Mr. Reiner receives a director's fee for each of his films, which probably hovers at $3 million to $5 million.
Mr. Horn helped create Castle Rock after quarrels with Barry Diller, chairman of Fox Inc., led him to step down as president of the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation in 1986.
Castle Rock did not follow the path of some other independent film companies that sold stock to the public. Instead, the Castle Rock partners chose to bring in Columbia Pictures as both an equity partner and as distributor. Columbia made an initial investment of $30 million.
Columbia's parent, the Sony Corporation, now owns about 44 percent of Castle Rock, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation owns 14 percent and the partners own the remainder.
UNDER its arrangement with Columbia, Castle Rock is in charge of every level of production. "We are a dependent independent," Mr. Horn said. "We are in the business of making motion picture and television product and retaining all creative controls ourselves."
What this freedom means is that if Mr. Reiner wants to cast an unknown actor or actress, like Kathy Bates in the starring role in "Misery," he can do so. And if he wants to give Jack Nicholson $500,000 a day for two weeks work in "A Few Good Men," that's fine, too.
The downside for the company is that it does not finance films on its own and carefully hedges its investment. It may not lose a great deal of money on flops, but the company is unable to make large sums of money on hits like "City Slickers."
"If our movies had all been marginal," Mr. Horn said, "that formula would have been adjudged brilliant. But it turns out our movies did better than we thought. So these deals did not allow us to participate on the upside as much as we would like."
Because of their cost, "A Few Good Men" and the new Clint Eastwood film are being financed entirely by Columbia Pictures. Under an old agreement, New Line Cinema has financed as much as 75 percent of Castle Rock's film production costs for several other movies in exchange for foreign and video rights. That deal is ending after four more pictures.
For now, Sony's executives seem quite pleased with Columbia's involvement in Castle Rock.
"Castle Rock's growth and well-being is our well-being," said Peter Guber, chairman of Sony Entertainment. "It's a win-win philosophy. We own a bit of the company. They own creative control. We're sitting in their boat."
 
 
 
STAR-STRUCK HIGH FINANCE
 Is Jack Nicholson really worth $500,000 a day?
Well, of course, Castle Rock Entertainment's executives insist.
The high salaries of the stars of Castle Rock's latest and most expensive film, "A Few Good Men," point up how the movie industry's pronouncements about cutting costs do not quite match its deal-making. Take the case of "A Few Good Men." Including marketing and promotion, the movie probably cost a minimum of $55 million. As a result, it will have to gross at least $100 million at the box office in the United Statesto break even.
Why so expensive? Mr. Nicholson was paid $500,000 a day for two weeks work, or a total of about $5 million. The other big star, Tom Cruise, received $12.5 million, plus a percentage of the profits. Demi Moore earned $2.5 million. Rob Reiner, the director, received $3 million to $5 million. And lesser players like Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland were paid six-figure salaries.
Castle Rock executives insist that to succeed, the film needed top stars who could lure the crowds. But do stars deliver?
Mr. Cruise's last film, "Far and Away," was a financial disappointment. And Mr. Nicholson's recent movie, "Man Trouble," was a disaster. On the other hand, Kevin Costner's current film, "Bodyguard," has strong box-office appeal even though it was critically panned. The apparent reason: Audiences are promised a sexy love story between Mr. Costner and co-star Whitney Houston.
Still, some producers insist that stars are not the main selling point of a film. Richard Zanuck, one of the producers of "Driving Miss Daisy," which had no big stars, is fond of quoting his father, Darryl F. Zanuck, the longtime ruler of 20th Century Fox. The elder Zanuck said three things make a film successful: "story, story, story."

Improving Safety When Removing Lead-Based Paint

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
OFFICIALS charged with maintaining aging steel structures, like bridges and overpasses, are facing difficult choices. At some point, the layers of deteriorating, lead-based paint become so thick that workers cannot just slap on another coat of paint to retard corrosion. Instead, they must strip off the old paint and apply modern, multilayer protective coatings.
That presents the problem of how to get rid of the lead, for its buildup in the urban environment -- by no means all of it from paint -- is a major national health concern. 
 Young children, particularly, are susceptible to mental and nervous disorders from relatively low levels of lead contamination. Sand blasting operations on the Williamsburg Bridge in New York were halted earlier this year because of fears that particles of lead-based paint were blowing onto windowsills, sidewalks and playgrounds.
And even when the blasting operation is properly contained, the process produces tons of lead-contaminated sand, which has to be disposed of as toxic waste. Executives at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation's Science and Technology Center report that blast cleaning a single medium-sized highway bridge can produce 800 tons of contaminated grit and that disposing of it in a landfill will cost $400,000.
As an alternative to that disposal, the company, which has been moving into environmental businesses as it gets out of its disastrous involvement with financial services, has developed a process to remove almost all the lead from sand after it has been used in blasting.
The mobile system, which is mounted on a 24-foot-long flatbed trailer, can decontaminate two to four tons of sand an hour, company executives say. The treatment reduces the lead content, which is typically at 12,000 parts per million, to less than 200 p.p.m.
The cleaned sand cannot be reused in blasting because the blasting process rounds off the sharp edges needed for paint removal, Edward J. Lahoda, a Westinghouse engineer, said. But it can be used in other applications, like making concrete.
The contaminated sand is fed by a conveyor onto a screen that filters out stones, twigs and large particles of paint. Anything passing through the screen is fed into a scrubber where it is treated by a water-based chemical that leaches the lead from the sand.
The lead paint particles and very fine sand go into suspension in the fluid, and the now-scrubbed larger sand particles are separated out and dumped onto a clean sand pile. Westinghouse executives report sand recovery rates of 80 to 90 percent in early tests.
The liquid goes into a mixing tank where a coagulant is added and then to another tank, where a flocculant further thickens it. This produces a material that Mr. Lahoda said resembles cottage cheese and contains the lead and fine sand particles. Most of the liquid is separated out and prepared for recycling. The lead-rich material can either be disposed of in a landfill or sent to a smelter for recovery of the metal.
Westinghouse executives say they can treat the contaminated sand for about one-third the cost of burying it -- $500 a ton -- or smelting without pretreatment. And they say the system can also be used for other problems, such as treatment of used foundry sand, which is usually contaminated with the residues of the chemicals used to bind the sand particles together in molds.
"It's basically the same process," Mr. Lahoda said. "You just change the leachate."
An alternative approach, developed by Pentek Inc., of the Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis, Pa., eliminates most sand blasting. Instead, it uses a pneumatically powered needle gun, in conjunction with a powerful vacuum system, to beat old paint from a metal surface and swiftly pull it into a sealed collection system.
THE gun uses 64 tungsten carbide needles, each 2 millimeters in diameter, to peen the steel, dislodging the paint. The needles are enclosed by a plastic shroud, which is attached to the exhaust vacuum system. Pentek executives say that because the shroud is in direct contact with the surface of the painted steel, no dust or paint chips escape into the atmosphere, a matter of particular concern in populated areas. In one instance in Pittsburgh, the Allegheny County Department of Health curtailed blasting operations and condemned residents' homes near the blast site.
With the Pentek gun, unlike blasting, no containment system has to be built. And because the paint chips are deposited directly into drums by the vacuum system, only minimal material is collected for disposal.
One problem, however, is that lead-based paint is heavy. A standard 55-gallon drum filled with paint chips weighs more than 500 pounds. So some contractors use 21-gallon drums, which weigh about 200 pounds when filled and, thus, can be handled by a work crew.
 ONE of the drawbacks of the needle gun system is that it requires considerably more direct labor than blasting. Each gun, which the company calls a Corner Cutter, can clear about 20 square feet of surface an hour. But a blaster can clear 120 square feet in the same time. Thus it would take a six-person crew on needle guns to match one blaster. In addition, many paint specifications require a sand-blasting step to prepare the metal surface after mechanical paint removal.
But company executives say that in addition to direct labor, costs must be considered for the labor involved in setting up containment systems and in collecting, shipping and disposing of contaminated sand. The costs of shipping and disposing of 55-gallon drums of contaminated sand exceed $100 each, they say, and thus their system becomes more economical when total costs are compared.
And they say relying on sand blasting to remove lead-based paint has resulted in outdated requirements, given the resultant pollution.
"Perhaps it is time to re-evaluate the use of surface-tolerant coating to reduce the degree of surface cleanliness and profile the industry demands prior to re-coating," Pentek's president, Sheldon Lefkowitz, argued in a paper delivered at a conference entitled Lead Tech '92 in Bethesda, Md., in October.
The problem of dealing with lead-based paints on older structures has become a major headache in recent years, said Bernard Appleman, executive director of the Steel Structures Painting Council, an industry group, for lead was widely used as a corrosion blocker on structural steel for decades.
"Over the last four or five years we have put more effort on lead paint removal than anything else," he said. "Unfortunately, it has increased the cost two- to three-fold."

THE ECONOMY

 
The End of I.B.M.'s Overshadowing Role 

Last week John F. Akers, chairman of the International Business Machines Corporation, said that I.B.M. would take a $6 billion charge and eliminate 25,000 more jobs in 1993. What the Justice Department tried and failed to do for 13 years, Big Blue managed to do on its own. Next year its work force will shrink to 275,000 from 407,000 in 1986. And while I.B.M. stock was worth $175.875 a share in 1987, it collapsed to $51 1/2 at the close last week. While today's computer industry is dominated by smallish companies that spread the risk and the research producing components for each other, I.B.M. is still a massively centralized bureaucracy. But I.B.M.'s problems are due to its failure to realize that its core business, mainframe computers, had been supplanted by cheap, networked PC's and faster networked workstations. "I.B.M. as the I.B.M. that defined computing is over; it's gone," said Nathan Myrthvold, Microsoft's vice president for advanced technology.

Live From Little Rock
 
It didn't exactly bump "Roseanne" out of its ratings lead on Tuesday night, but last week's economic marathon in Little Rock had America's policy wonks glued to C-Span. Though some said the meeting broke no new ground, most participants were pleased. "It opened up Washington to America," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. "You could see the lights going on," said Charles W. McMillion, another participant, who is president of MBG-Washington, an economic consulting firm. Particularly impressive to the economists were presentations about tapping into new sources of investment capital. John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp, showed how nearly "$100 billion in investment capital could be freed up by changes in regulations," Mr. McMillion said. But equally impressive was the President-elect, "who was able to concentrate for incredible periods of time," said Mr. McMillion. "He was brilliant."

Hammers Are Ringing Again
 
For months, the only sounds at the construction site were those of birds singing. But according to the Commerce Department, hammers could be heard once more in November as housing starts grew by 1.5 percent to their highest levels in eight months. "The report says the economic slowdown has stopped," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, head of a New York economic consulting firm that bears her name.But birds could still be heard on a few building lots since the gains were concentrated mostly in the South and West with declines in the Northeast and Midwest.
 
November's Upbeat Production
 
While the wonks debated policy, the Federal Reserve's number crunchers were busy tallying up the figures on industrial production. November was an upbeat month, they said, with production growing 0.4 percent following a revised 0.5 percent rise in October. The rise in October "has more than offset the declines of late summer," the Fed said.

Too Much of a Good Thing
 
The rule of thumb among economists is that when the nation's factories produce at more than 80 percent of capacity, bottlenecks ensue. Capitalism's satanic mills just can't keep up with deman and that brings on inflation. For now, with overall capacity utilization at 77.9 percent for November, up from 77.7 percent in October, according to the Federal Reserve, prices should hold firm. But there is one red light flashing: capacity utilization at the nation's mines rose to 86.7 percent in November, up from 86.2 percent a month earlier.

The F.C.C. Tunes Out Indecency
 
Howard Stern, radio's bad boy, has filled up the nation's airwaves with a mixture of toilet talk, self-deprecation and racial and ethnic slurs. The country loves it. Mr. Stern, whose morning program is syndicated, has more listeners in more cities than anyone else. But while America tunes in to Mr. Stern, the Federal Communications Commission would like to switch him off. Last week the F.C.C. decided to impose a $600,000 fine on Mr. Stern's employer, the Infinity Broadcasting Company of New York, for indecency. But it declined to block Infinity from acquiring three more radio stations for $100 million. ) Seven weeks ago, the F.C.C. fined the Los Angeles station carrying Mr. Stern's show $105,000. Why does the F.C.C. want to zipper Mr. Stern's foul mouth? "The F.C.C. wants timid broadcasters, and that's bad," said Andrew Jay Schwartzmann, executive director of the Media Access Project.
 
The Bell Atlantic Company filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va., charging that its free speech rights were violated by the F.C.C.'s ruling that phone companies could carry video signals but not produce shows.

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
For Now, a Tame Trade Deficit
 
At first glance it looked like more good news on the trade front. According to the Commerce Department, the nation's trade deficit shrank to $7 billion in October, a $1.6 billion improvement from the month before, largely the result of increased exports. Half of those export gains were accounted for by a surge in sales of civilian aircraft and telecommunications. But economists warn the trade gap may soon begin to swell. "We've got the double-whammy," said Harold B. Malmgreen, a Washington trade consultant. With Europe and Japan stuck in semi-somnolent economic states while the United States begins to grow, America "will continue to suck in imports without any place to export."

Japan's Revolving Insults
 
Japan is a nation that prides itself on the gracefulness of its manners. Tell that to its politicians. They seem to delight in lecturing overworked America on its poor work habits and other supposed limitations. Last week Masakuni Murakami, Japan's Labor Minister, told a group of reporters in Tokyo that "foreigners do not work. That is why they are economically being left far behind Japan and Germany." Those words followed statements by Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Prime Minister -- America lacked a work ethic, he said -- and by former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone who said blacks and other minorities lowered America's level of intelligence. Upon realizing that his words created quite a stir, Mr. Murakami told reporters that "I wanted to say that economic development by resource-poor Japan was due to diligence."

Slight Growth for the World
 
If you liked slow-growth 1992, you'll love 1993. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Development, the world's economic engine will run at far less-than-full throttle. Growth in the United States will be a mere 2.3 percent, , while Europe will trudge through 1993 growing at about 1 percent. Japan will eke out a 2.6 percent rate of growth the blue-helmeted economists say. At the same time, the U.N.'s forecast sees the Latin American economies losing ground.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
Ford's Bitter Medicine
 
Getting corporate America to swallow the future costs of its retiree benefits hasn't been easy. It adds lots of red ink to a company's bottom line. But last week the Ford Motor Company unpursed its lips and took a swig with a one-time non-cash charge of $7.5 billion. That bitter medicine is likely to give the No. 2 auto maker a loss of $6 billion to $7 billion this year, analysts say, when added to charges resulting from eliminating 10,000 jobs in Europe. That would be the largest loss in corporate history. Ford is taking the hit to comply with a Federal Accounting Standards Board rule that went into effect last year. The rule allows companies to space out retiree health costs and other benefits over 20 years or take them in a single charge before the first quarter of 1993. Why suffer the pain now? "By taking the hit all at once we avoid a $375 million drag on profit for 20 years," said Terry Bresnihan, a Ford spokesman.

Moving In on Cable Territory
 
When it first muscled its way into the nation's living rooms, cable television's only competition was broadcast TV. Now, phone companies are trying to push their way in. Last week the Bell Atlantic Corporation said it would team up with the Future Vision of America Corporation to provide 38,000 homes in Dover Township, N.J., with 60 channels of customized TV from a menu of 124 channels. The Federal Communications Commission adopted rules earlier this year allowing phone companies to carry "video dial tones," but not to produce shows. Bell Atlantic will install fiber optics and coaxial cables to carry phone and video services into the homes. "We're trying to put much more control into the household," said Bob Schema, president of Future Video. "We think people ought to be given the opportunity to watch what they want."
 
Boeing's Engineers Stand Firm
 
Talks between the Boeing Company and the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association, which represents 28,000 technicians and engineers, broke down last week when 70 percent of the union -- Boeing's second largest -- rejected the company's offer and authorized a strike. Boeing's proposal contained no wage increases for engineers but did provide for merit raises for technical personnel. That wasn't good enough for the union, which wants a lump-sum payment of 12 percent of wages plus 3.5 percent in wage increases in each of the next two years. With the prospects for jobs in the industry slim and the union without a strike fund, Boeing said it would stand firm. "This is the hardest hardball I've ever seen the Boeing Company play," said Dan Mahoney, a spokesman for the union.
 
Boeing's engineers may be disgruntled, but not its sales people. Last week they reeled in a $4.1 billion order for 82 passenger jets from the International Lease Finance Corporation.

Mr. Perelman's Cigar
 
With the fragrant aroma of cigars about to fill the White House -- President-elect Bill Clinton smokes them a la Jack Kennedy -- Ronald O. Perelman, the billionaire investor, has chosen a good time to bet that the cigar habit will spread. Mr. Perelman, a cigar smoker himself, agreed to buy the Consolidated Cigar Corporation from Vestar Capital Partners Inc. for $180 million. Consolidated, whose brands run from the mass-market Dutch Masters to up-market H. Upmann, also manufactures Mr. Perelman's favorite smoke -- the Perelman special, rolled for him in the Dominican Republic.

Litton's Vessel of War or Rescue
 
The cold war may be over, but the Navy still needs to replace its old ships. That's good for Litton Industries, the big military contractor based in Beverly Hills, Calif. It received a $760 million order last week to build its sixth Wasp ship, the latest in amphibious assault vessels. Wasp class ships carry 2,000 troops, weigh 40,500 tons and are 844 feet long. They can be outfitted for war or as floating hospitals and rescue vessels for disaster relief. According to analysts, shipbuilding accounted for about 28 percent of Litton's profits.

Here's a Switch -- Keep the Job

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
HERE'S a dog-bites-man workplace story: Employers usually hold the trump hand in dealings with employees. Here's the man-bites-dog, holiday-appropriate version: Employer cedes right to fire employees Scrooge-style and gives them a contract that guarantees they will only be dismissed for a good business reason, or "just cause." Meet Tom Zito, the man who bites dogs.
Yes, Mr. Zito, head of Digital Pictures Inc., a year-and-a-half-old Silicon Valley software company, is often asked if he has gone mental, giving away what most people wouldn't think to ask for. And yes, he knows he is breaking ranks with generations of American employers who have long had the power to juggle their employees' destinies "at will," as the employment-law term of art goes. 
 "It flies in the face of how I ought to do business," he said matter-of-factly. Almost any employer, even the benevolent ones, would agree. The principle of at-will employment, in which employees serve at the pleasure of their bosses, is the heart and soul of American employment law. Most states, including California, have laws to protect workers from ruling-class capriciousness, but only one, according to employment law specialists, can reasonably be called a "just cause" state. That state is Montana, the laws of which affect roughly as many people as Digital Pictures has employees (17).
Mr. Zito, 44, has many reasons for violating common business sense. He is a product of the 1960's, with a generation-rampant approach-avoidance attitude toward capitalism. He has memories of less-than-benevolent employers.
But ultimately he grants job security because, like any employer, he wants to attract and keep talent. "People can assume that when they come here, unless they really screw up, they have a place as long as they work here," he said.
Mr. Zito also engages in such odd, unemployer-like behavior as paying people more than they ask for and including current employees on hiring decisions.
He does not, as most software makers do, require new hires to sign noncompete contracts. Such practices inspire loyalty and solidarity. And they keep out clutter. Being willing not to cash in on an applicant's low salary bid, for example, maintains similar wages among similarly situated workers and forestalls resentments.
IT is not clear if Mr. Zito, who was once the rock critic for The Washington Post, founded Digital to develop interactive video programming or to create a workers' paradise at the company's Menlo Park headquarters. He is certainly no stranger to transcendant experience. He once went to an unannounced Rolling Stones concert in Washington, just him and 599 others, sitting at the prancing feet of Mick Jagger. Mr. Zito would not be the first big-chill boomer who tried to translate the ineffable, in-the-now geist of rock and roll into a guide for living.
But he would also not be the first boomer to squeeze value from virtue, and his policies obviously have a practical point. Digital's interactive videos marry movies to software. The enterprise requires software engineers and filmmakers to work shoulder to shoulder. It is not an obvious symbiosis. Software people tend to fly solo; films are made collaboratively. "Getting the two worlds to come together is kind of a collision course with Armageddon," Mr. Zito said. Digital's work environment is designed to help break down cultural barriers between groups. Besides, he says, taking on employees who can't be jettisoned easily "makes you much smarter about the people you hire."
A cynic would be correct in pointing out that most of the unusual arrangements at Digital essentially cost nothing. Mr. Zito believes, for example, that noncompete contracts are unenforceable, so why bother? The just-cause clause needs no budget appropriation -- but reaps good will.
Which is precisely the point. One lesson other companies might take away from Digital is a human resources principle for the 90's: Don't sweat the small stuff.
Can Digital continue on its utopian course as it grows? Mr. Zito says the company has done several million dollars in sales since it began shipping interactive games for Sega's CD-ROM systems earlier this fall. He intends to have discussions with the staff, once life settles down after the busy Christmas season, about what the pace of growth should be. In the interest of preserving its spirit, Digital might decide to rein itself in.
 
 
 
IN NEW YORK, A LITTLE LEGAL HELP
 IF you work for an employer more typical than Tom Zito, you're living in the turbulent world of downsizing and layoffs. The New York branch of the National Employment Lawyers Association has started a referral service, called Nelars, to match worried employees with lawyers who might help them. "The playing field between employers and employees is far from level," said Lisa Lipman, Nelars's executive director.
The service is devoted exclusively to job problems and draws on the expertise of attorneys who specialize in employment law cases. Since the service began in early September, Ms. Lipman has fielded hundreds of phone calls. Two of the top areas: "The whole range of discrimination cases and exit or severance packages," she said.
Callers are referred to one of the lawyers, who charges $25 for a half-hour consultation. For consultations likely to go longer, lawyer and caller agree on a fee ahead of time. Expertise is available on a range of subjects, from sex discrimination to pensions to contract claims to the concerns of public-sector employees.
Ms. Lipman suggests not waiting until disaster strikes before calling a lawyer. There is a perception that engaging a lawyer can escalate a nonconflict into a crisis -- a perception that works against employees who, say, get laid off. "Usually the employee is caught off guard," she said, while the company has counsel. "It helps employees to have the benefit of advice." For severance packages and the like, most employment lawyers take an advisory role and let the employee do the negotiating.
Callers to the service number, 212-603-6491, are asked to leave a message on a voice mail system. Someone will return the call within one or two business days. Referrals for outside the New York area are available from the NELA national office, 415-397-6335.

Greenspan's Gift To the Nation: No Bank Crisis

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
The first job of the Federal Reserve System is to preserve the banking system. And as a new administration takes over in Washington, applause is in order for Alan Greenspan and his colleagues.
This coming week was billed earlier in the year as the time for the "December surprise," when new Federal rules that took effect yesterday would lead to the shutdown of dozens of banks. The bank crisis in 1992, people kept muttering, was just like the savings and loan crisis in 1988 -- almost ignored during the campaign but sure to be a dominant problem for whoever won the election. 
 It now looks as if it won't happen. The number of banks teetering on the edge appears to be quite small. Overall, bank profits are now at their highest level ever, and bank stock prices have leaped.
All this has occurred at a time when there are, by most measures, too many banks in the country. Any business school student will tell you that excess competition brings low profit margins and ruinous competition. Yet bank profit margins are high, even as the industry shrinks.
The reason is that short-term interest rates plunged, while long-term rates did not. That enabled banks to make hefty profits with minimal risk, simply by buying two-year to five-year government securities. "This improvement in bank profitability came at a fairly critical juncture," Mr. Greenspan said last month, in an understatement. In the fall of 1990, bank stocks were so low that it appeared the stock market was worried whether the financial system would survive. Then the interest rates fell, and banks found a way to make nice money without making loans.
There is room to debate whether the Fed under Mr. Greenspan pushed short interest rates down, or whether it simply followed the market. The belief here is that the Fed had a greater role than some admit. In any case, it certainly did not resist the trend.
It is possible that the economy might have begun to grow a bit sooner, in fact, if short-term rates had not fallen so far. In that case, the banks might have been forced to take more risks by making more loans while buying fewer safe government securities. But the profits from those securities have also allowed most banks to recover from the losses incurred through the excessive lending of the last decade.
In last week's economic summit in Little Rock, bankers rightly pushed for changing some paperwork rules that may discourage lending. But another idea, of easing capital rules, should be touched only with caution. As David Mullins, the Fed's vice chairman, noted, "We've been down that road before," and it has a lot of potholes.
Mr. Greenspan has had his blind spots, notably in opposing efforts by Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to force banks to disclose the real values of their assets. That, like the tough capital rules, would help to prevent a repeat of the 1980's excesses. But he has helped to get the industry back to a healthy state, and for that he deserves praise.

HEADLINE: Profile/Carol Nelson and Mary Ann Tighe;
Two Movers in a Tough Market

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
CAROL NELSON and Mary Ann Tighe can't indulge in even the mildest self-deprecation when the other one's around. Let Carol say she's squeamish around vermin, and Mary Ann will launch into a tale about how Carol chased down a mouse while the men in the room cried "Eeeek!" Let Mary Ann describe herself as more pragmatic than creative, and Carol will recite chapter and verse of the creative things Mary Ann brings to deals.
It's a mutual admiration society of the first order. It had better be. In the male-dominated and loner-driven world of New York commercial real estate, Ms. Nelson and Ms. Tighe have been virtually joined at the hip for more than four years. 
 Clearly, the partnership works: The two women, both senior managers at Edward S. Gordon & Company, have become one of the -- if not the -- most successful brokerage teams in the country. They helped Sony U.S.A. negotiate its lease for A.T.&T.'s headquarters building at 550 Madison Avenue, the country's largest real estate transaction in 1991. They took the Internal Revenue Service to 1133 Avenue of the Americas. They got The New Yorker to leave the building it had occupied since 1929.
"I've negotiated against them and they've negotiated for me, and believe me, I'd rather have them on my side," said Douglas Durst, vice president of the Durst Organization, which owns many New York buildings.
With the recession drowning most landlords and brokers in red ink, negotiating skills are at a premium these days. Corporations are giving occupancy costs the same high-level scrutiny as labor costs. They are arguing for huge subsidies for customizing space, for flexible leases that let them sublet, expand or contract almost at will, for long free-rent periods at move-in time.
Landlords, meanwhile, have little room to maneuver. Their main priority is to get lengthy leases with freedom to keep jacking up the rent from creditworthy tenants, in order to insure a continuous income stream that will pay debt. But lenders often will not let them give the very concessions tenants clamor for -- the right to keep the space if the lender takes over the building, say, or the right to assign the lease to another tenant.
"Today's brokers not only have to have entrepreneurial drive," said Gerald D. Schein, publisher of Real Estate Forum, a trade magazine. "They have to know how to crunch numbers and analyze leases, too."
Against that backdrop, the track record of these two women, neither of whom has a business degree, is formidable. In 1990, they were responsible for 12 percent of the 11.5 million square feet of office space leased in Midtown Manhattan -- more than any other brokerage team, Crain's New York Business reported that year. Last year, they helped lease 1.4 million Midtown feet, 15 percent of the total. By the middle of this month, they had done 31 deals for a total of 1.1 million feet, for a 9 percent share. "And remember, the year's not over yet," said Ms. Nelson, who hints at yet another deal pending.
It has been a lucrative few years. Brokers' commissions are usually a percentage of rent. Midtown rents hover around $30 a foot. Thus, although they won't talk income numbers, the sheer volume of deals has undoubtedly made them millionaires.
Not bad for two brokers who entered the field at ages when most people are at the peak of their careers. Ms. Tighe, a former curator at the Smithsonian and arts adviser to Vice President Walter Mondale, was 36 when she went into real estate eight years ago. Ms. Nelson, a former full-time homemaker, won't divulge her age, but she was probably well into her 30's when she joined the business in 1975.
Ms. Nelson was "always fascinated by the buildings, by the way deals were structured," she said. Ms. Tighe took more convincing. Sick of a commuter marriage from Washington (her husband is a doctor at Bellevue), she moved to New York to become a programming director for ABC -- only to find that she traveled so much she saw her husband as little as before. On one flight, she sat next to a retired real estate broker. He put her in touch with some real estate honchos, and they led her to Edward S. Gordon.
For several years, the two women inhabited different stratospheres. Ms. Nelson had risen to managing director at Gordon, a level that still is unusual for a woman. And she had garnered a reputation for creative deals.
She was instrumental in getting I.B.M. to become an equity partner in some buildings where it leased space. She had engineered the deal by which 430 Park Avenue, once the Colt Industries building, became Bank of Montreal headquarters. She persuaded Burson Marsteller to move into a converted loft on Park Avenue South -- a move that many industry mavens say sparked the growth of lower Park Avenue as an office center.
 MS. TIGHE, meanwhile, was doing scut work on dead-end projects. One day, the two got to chatting in front of the ladies' room mirror (they both still giggle at living a cliche), and Ms. Nelson invited Ms. Tighe to work for her. Within a couple of years, they went from mentor/mentee to equal partners. "Carol mowed the way, and I got to walk down the path," Ms. Tighe said.
They are a contrast in appearance and style.
Yes, both are on their second marriages, both live in Manhattan, both have children (Ms. Tighe has one, Ms. Nelson has four, including her husband's from a previous marriage).
But Mary Ann Tighe is dark, exotic looking, vivacious. Her words don't so much emerge as tumble out. Carol Nelson is tall and blond and speaks in far more measured terms. Ms. Tighe thrives on details, on processes, on seeing things through. Ms. Nelson loves the sales pitch, the strategizing, the creation of a deal. "Carol's strength is getting that first meeting; Mary Ann's is implementing the transaction," said Dean J. Shapiro, a senior consultant at Gordon who often works with the team.
BY rights, being women should have hurt them. Like most businesses that revolve around negotiations and deals, an awful lot of real estate contacts are made in male-bastion territories like clubs and golf courses. According to Mr. Schein, the publisher, there are only about 400 women commercial brokers in the country, and only about 100 in New York, with its a total of 5,000 or so commercial brokers.
But colleagues insist that, if anything, their femaleness is a help. "They have a soft and polite way about them," said Robert A. B. Baraf, a Gordon managing director. "They are not Leona Helmsley-mean. Their toughness is on the inside."
Mr. Shapiro is more succinct: "They are dealmakers, not bullies."
Ms. Tighe and Ms. Nelson also shrug off any problems their femaleness may cause. "Sixteen brokers named Bob may call a C.E.O., but there's only one Mary Ann," Ms. Tighe said. "We're remembered."
The big thing, clients say, is that they do their homework, often persuading tenants and landlords alike to look beyond the rent numbers in their deals.
"They helped us put a dollar value on location as well as space," said Salvatore Vitale, senior vice president of operations at the Conference Board, which recently renegotiated its leases at 845 Third Avenue.
In another case, they helped the Bank of Nova Scotia create a complex "phantom equity deal" for 300,000 square feet of space at Olympia & York's One Liberty Plaza. If the building becomes profitable, the bank gets a rent reduction. "They really understood how to look at a transaction in a strategic sense," said Richard E. Waugh, a senior executive vice president of the bank, who has since used Ms. Nelson and Ms. Tighe to negotiate with tenants for space in buildings on which the bank has foreclosed.
But perhaps most important in a moribund real estate market, the two seem to have a knack for spotting potential deals hidden in business reports, and for dreaming up unlikely tenant/building matches. "We call it Zen brokerage," Ms. Tighe said.
For example, when Sony bought CBS Records Inc. in 1988, Ms. Nelson immediately called Walter Yetnikoff, then the division's head, to discuss space needs. At her suggestion, Edward S. Gordon called Michael P. Schulhof, Sony USA's vice chairman. A year later, the conversations had ballooned into talk of a whole new headquarters for Sony, talks that culminated in Sony's leasing of A.T.&T.'s headquarters last year.
In 1990, when the I.R.S. was looking for a large chunk of Midtown space, Ms. Nelson's instincts pointed her to 1133 Avenue of the Americas, a Durst building that was fully occupied and didn't seem to fit the I.R.S.'s needs. Still, she persuaded first Mr. Durst, then the I.R.S., to talk things out.
THE deal has gone through against impossible odds. Ms. Nelson pointed out how many leases in the building would expire by 1994, the I.R.S.'s target for moving in. The I.R.S. said there was still not enough space; Ms. Nelson persuaded Durst to cut through to another building it owned behind 1133. The zoning board said the combined building violated rules governing the ratio of office space to land; the team worked out a compromise in which an entire floor at 1133 will remain unused for 20 years. Upshot: The I.R.S. signed a 20-year lease for 240,000 square feet, at $35 a foot.
The commission was $7 million, split among Ms. Tighe, Ms. Nelson and two other Gordon brokers.
Some of this year's best deals seemed, at first blush, similarly unpromising. Leslie Fay, the fashion company, didn't really want to leave 1400 Broadway, where it had been for 35 years. But it needed to expand beyond its 70,000 feet, and the landlord, banking on the reluctance to move, was holding out for a high rent. The Nelson/Tighe team persuaded Leslie Fay to look around. It did -- and wound up taking better space at 1412 Broadway, across the street.
The brokers pulled a mirror image deal for Griffin Bacal Inc., an advertising agency with 60,000 square feet spread over six floors and several years left on its lease at 130 Fifth Avenue. Ms. Nelson and Ms. Tighe guessed that the agency was overpaying, but the landlord wouldn't budge. So Ms. Nelson found the agency nearby space. Then, the team drew a scenario for the landlord if Griffin Bacall moved, showing what it would cost him to find new tenants, and why his lenders would like to have the space locked in for a long term. Result: Griffin Bacall is staying put until 2002, at a much lower rent.
"Carol found the stalking horse that brought the landlord to his knees, and Mary Ann scripted the deal, told everyone what part they had to play," recalled Mr. Baraf, who also worked on the deal. "I would have hated to be on the other side of the table."

HEADLINE: BRIDGE;
Financial Lion Plans A Parlay in China

BYLINE: By Alan Truscott

 BODY:
IT is not easy to combine the roles of bridge champion and Napoleon of finance, but Jim Cayne of Manhattan manages it neatly. Most of his hours are devoted to Bear Stearns, the brokerage house, of which he is president, but he spends much of his free time at card tables.
Three weeks ago in Orlando, Fla., he led his team to victory in the Reisinger Board-a-Match Teams championship. To fit in morning golf lessons, he said he was managing on four and a half hours of sleep nightly. 
 Cayne is friendly with Kathie Wei, who has won three world titles and has long been the standardbearer of the Precision system. A month or so ago, they made a triple plan: they would each win a major title in Orlando, which they proceeded to do, and they would later go to China. At the end of January they will play bridge in Shanghai, where Cayne will establish a Bear Stearns office.
This will follow a visit to Beijing to take part in a true V.I.P. tournament. The competition is expected to include these members of the hierarchy: Wan Li, Chairman of the National People's Congress; Ding Guangen, a member of the Politburo who is Deng Xiaoping's regular bridge partner; Deng Pufang, Mr. Deng's eldest son, who is head of an association for the handicapped; Li Lanqing, Economic Trade Minister; Wu Shaozu, Minister for Physical Culture and Sports; Liu Huaqing, deputy chairman of the Central Military Commission; Qi Huaiyuan, former deputy foreign minister; He Guangyuan, Minister of Heavy Industry; Chen Min zheng, Minister of Health; Rong Gaotang, president of the Chinese Bridge Association; Wang Hanbin, Deputy Chairman of the People's Congress; Wu Wenying, Minister of Textile Industry, and Han Xu, a former Ambassador to the United States.
No other country can boast so many bridge players at the top levels of government. Deng's love for the game has surely much to do with it, but whether they became bridge players because they were politicians or vice versa is unclear.
None of the Chinese players is as experienced as Cayne, who also won the Reisinger in 1988. In Orlando, he showed his skill on the diagramed deal, enlisting the opponents' help in bringing home two spades.
East-West might have gone to three hearts, and would have made at least nine tricks thanks to the favorable lie. But they sold out to two spades and West led the heart ten. South ruffed the third round of hearts and sought to remove West's clubs.
Cayne needed to know how the clubs were divided, so he asked the opposition. He led the club queen, expecting both opponents to give a count signal. West played the four, his lowest card, to signal an odd number of cards in clubs. East played the five, the highest card he could spare, to show an even number of clubs.
Cayne studied the trick carefully and worked out that he could afford to take two more club winners. He cashed the ace, led to the king and thought again. West, he decided, surely held both the diamond ace and the spade ace to justify his opening bid.
Leading to either of his kings was clearly due to fail, so Cayne led a spade and ducked. When this lost to the jack his contract was unbeatable. West could cash his spade ace, but then had no exit card. He had to choose between conceding a trick to South's diamond king or giving an equally fatal ruff-and-sluff.

HEADLINE: What the State Is Giving Olympus

 BODY:
"State Bypasses Town in Zoning Approval" [Dec. 6] contains an important misstatement of fact and has failed to reveal several other important issues. I am a partner in the firm that leases Olympus its current facility in Lake Success. While it is true that their lease expires in 1994, we have offered them numerous opportunities to renew or renegotiate their lease at their present facility. Our proposals were for a long-term lease and included extensive renovations to the premises. As recently as this fall we had offered them a two-year extension. 
 The state has offered Olympus a package of incentives which makes staying in our facility or leasing any of the other numerous vacant buildings uneconomical. Projects built by the state need not worry about sales tax -- typically about 3 to 4 percent of a new project's cost -- mortgage recording taxes, 1 percent of a new project's cost; transfer taxes and my personal favorite, the "Cuomo tax," which is the New York State gains tax.
The state will collect payments in lieu of real-estate taxes, but I can assure you that they will be a fraction of the $4 to $5 per square foot Olympus is paying at their current locations in Nassau County. The state's action will accelerate the flight of users from the high real-estate taxes in Nassau County and exacerbate the problems facing Nassau County and the local governments and school districts. My firm is the fourth largest payer of property tax in Nassau County.
Finally there is the issue of the transfer of large state assets such as 53.7 acres of land without competitive bidding. The state does not purchase a box of paper clips without competitive bidding, but in this case is granting the use of a $5 million-to-$10 million parcel without bidding or even the public disclosure of the lease terms.
The granting of leases on public land in this manner last occurred at Mitchell Field in Nassau County, which was subsequently the focus of numerous investigations. Obviously the ability of any politician to grant an individual developer or corporation a major economic benefit without public scrutiny opens the potential for corruption, or at the very least the appearance of impropriety.
I think that the citizens of New York State should be outraged that the state, while quick to regulate its citizens and businesses into oblivion, is also just as quick to circumvent environmental, zoning, building codes and any other laws that are not convenient at the moment.

HEADLINE: Here's a Plan to Let You Afford a $250,000 College Education

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In a speech before the National Press Club, Neil L. Rudenstine, president of Harvard University, recognizes the growing crisis in the affordability of college because family incomes are growing at a slower rate than college costs (news article, Dec. 1). Keeping colleges and universities open and affordable to students of all economic backgrounds raises serious issues, and it is clear that the costs of higher education are forcing schools to make difficult decisions about resource allocation and, in some cases, forcing substantial cutbacks in programs and services. 
 At Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, the alumni council has formed a funding education committee to propose long-range solutions to the af
fordability problem. With the assistance of Kenyon's administrators, the committee is focusing on the affordability of a four-year private college education for a child born this year who will start college in the year 2010.
We have estimated that assuming annual real growth of 2 percent and annual inflation of 4 percent, based on 1992-93 tuition, room, board and fees, a four-year education beginning in 2010 will cost in excess of $250,000. That figure is so substantial that most people just shrug their shoulders and say they cannot do anything about it. We disagree.
The Kenyon suggestion is that Congress and the President collaborate in creating a tax-deferred savings program for postsecondary school education at a trade school or two- or four-year college or university.
Similar in concept to an individual retirement account, the program would be limited to use for education purposes. All taxpayers would be able to deposit funds into the program annually, up to an agreed annual maximum per child. Deposits would be deductible from current income and would accumulate tax free. Withdrawals would be used for education expenses. Withdrawals for other purposes would be subject to a penalty.
The preliminary details of the proposal are described in an article in the current issue of the Kenyon College Alumni Bulletin titled "Funding Education."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Environmental Fix With a Legion of Doubters

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
FROM the high bluffs along the Ohio River, the nation's newest hazardous waste incinerator looks like a gleaming castle -- a beacon, its Swiss owners say, for the high technology, high wage environmental industries that President-elect Bill Clinton enthusiastically supports.
But to perhaps a third of the residents of East Liverpool, Ohio, an aging river town 30 miles downstream from Pittsburgh, the plant looks much more menacing -- a hulking industrial fortress constructed on a flood plain in a valley infamous for its stagnant air and much too close to hundreds of homes and an elementary school. 
 Whatever one's view, the fight over the $160 million Waste Technologies Industries incinerator, which is scheduled to begin full commercial operation next year, has quickly turned into much more than a job-hungry community's struggle over economic development, pollution and public health. It has also become an early test for Mr. Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore as they seek to square environmental goals with economic ones.
Two weeks ago, fulfilling a promise he made while campaigning in the Ohio Valley, Mr. Gore announced that the first environmental action the new Administration will take will be to investigate the plant's safety and the legality of its construction and Federal operating permits. Mr. Gore said he intends to block the plant's opening until the investigation. Executives at the plant said that they intend to move ahead with their plans to conduct tests in January that could lead to full commercial operation.
Last week, several groups of supporters in East Liverpool and the incinerator's owner, Von Roll, Inc., fired back in an open letter to Mr. Clinton that was published in newspaper advertisements in New York, Washington and Little Rock, Ark. They told the President-elect that the incinerator, which will employ 125 people and provide $1.7 million in local taxes, had passed every regulatory test and legal hurdle put in its path. "It is cleaner than any steel mill, auto factory, computer chip manufacturer, chemical plant, large farm or any other major facility in the nation," the full-page ads said. "Close it and you are setting a standard that will ship millions of jobs overseas -- a bad way to start your defense of America's economic security."
At the core of this highly visible scientific and political debate is whether incineration is a safe way to dispose of the nation's chemical wastes and household garbage. Critics of the technology say that incineration turns the atmosphere into an uncontrolled waste dump for toxic pollutants like lead, mercury and dioxin.
But during the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the Environmental Protection Agency studied incineration, said it was vital to the nation's waste disposal problems and pronounced it environmentally safe. In 1984, Congress prohibited most chemical wastes -- which already could not be dumped in the ocean or stored forever -- from being buried in landfills. Incineration technology inevitably thrived.
More than 60 commercial incinerators now burn roughly 3 million tons of chemical wastes a year, which is about 1 percent of the 300 million tons of hazardous wastes generated annually in the United States. Scores of companies are seeking new permits to gain a share of a market that is now worth $2.5 billion annually and expected to grow, according to E.I. Digest, an industry newsletter.
In addition, 133 incinerators have been built since 1980 to burn household garbage; almost all of them convert the heat generated to electricity. Of all the states, New York and Florida are the most dependent on the technology for municipal waste disposal.
Mr. Gore, though, is suspicious of incinerators because of the hazardous pollutants they are known to release into the atmosphere. In his book "Earth in Balance," he said: "Major health and environmental concerns have never been adequately answered." Mr. Gore, his aides said, also thinks that incineration discourages environmentally safer disposal programs, like recycling or reducing the volume of industrial chemicals. The reason: every incinerator requires a steady supply of wastes to remain profitable.
 
Corporate Persistence
 As if to emphasize an opposition to incineration, Mr. Clinton has named Carol M. Browner, the Secretary of Environmental Regulation in Florida, to head the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. Ms. Browner is not only a former aide to Mr. Gore, but unsuccessfully lobbied for legislation that would have blocked any new incinerators in Florida.
In East Liverpool, Von Roll executives nervously await the conclusion of the Congressional investigation. If the company is allowed to operate its plant, said industry analysts, it would be viewed as a triumph of corporate persistence that could help calm public resistance.
If, however, the East Liverpool incinerator fails to open, it would be the latest in a string of hazardous waste incinerators closed in North Carolina, Kentucky, Illinois and Arizona since 1990. The first was shut because of toxic emissions that harmed workers, two more suffered explosions, and public opposition compelled Arizona Governor Fyfe Symington, a Republican, to buy an incinerator near Phoenix in 1991 before it opened. Should the Ohio incinerator join the list, said industry analysts, it would be viewed by investors as a clear signal that the new Administration was rejecting the technology.

HEADLINE: Clinton, Taking Over the Books, Asks the Shareholders' Patience

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
BILL CLINTON'S extraordinary 19-hour nationally televised teach-in on economics was more than just a novel attempt by the President-elect to play professor to the nation. It was in some ways the opening chapter in an effort by Mr. Clinton to rewrite the rules for how the public should judge a Presidency. Some might call it Bill Clinton's quest for an eight-year honeymoon.
Good luck. 
 As a student of American politics, Mr. Clinton understands that the way Presidential authority is built and sustained in this country is usually through relatively short-term events and short-term success. Like the Pharaohs, Presidents store up political capital in fat years and spend it in the lean years, and if they are lucky the fat years coincide with the election cycle.
But Mr. Clinton also understands that the economic problems he has inherited, and the out-of-control deficit, are long-run and structural in nature. He really does not have the luxury of short-term options.
His dilemma is how a President elected for four years -- on a promise to make things better -- can take actions that may not provide instant gratification, yet will not be politically fatal for him. That requires educating voters in very different ways about their economic predicament and their expectations for their Accountant-in-Chief.
That is what the economic conference was all about. What Mr. Clinton has tried to do both during the later stages of his campaign and through this conference is to shift public attention from economic fluctuations, which usually determine the political fortunes of incumbents, to longer time lines.
He is trying to stretch the boundaries of political accountability in asking the public to define his success not in terms like three straight quarters of improved unemployment figures or housing starts, but by whether he puts an economy in the grip of a long-term structural decline onto a new long-term trend line -- the payoffs of which may come well after his term. No wonder that in his five-minute speech opening the economic conference he used the terms "long-term" and "long-run" six times.
"It is very important to get away from the 100 days trap," said the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. "Roosevelt's 100 days was a unique episode which grew out of a unique crisis. Clinton's crisis has a long-term diagnosis. Of course, every new President pleads for more time, but this device he is using is new, and to use the interregnum before his inauguration this effectively is also quite new.
"What struck me was that Clinton clearly understands that politics is ultimately a process of education and persuasion, not preachment, as Jimmy Carter thought," Mr. Schlesinger added.
Mr. Clinton's tactic was to bring together economists, business leaders and labor representatives and let them bear witness on nationwide television to the complexity, toughness and uncertainty of his options, spicing the discussion with his own homilies, such as: "When somebody tells you it is not a money problem, they're talking about somebody else's money."
Maybe the best way to understand what Mr. Clinton was up to is to contrast him with Ronald Reagan.
 
Selling the Impossible
 "Reagan was the grand master of the politically effective gesture," argued Yaron Ezrahi, author of a major study on the culture of American democracy and a visiting scholar at Princeton. "He exploited the American public's wish to believe that all things will turn out well by offering them various forms of instant gratification. Clinton, by contrast, is trying to make honestly coping with a virtually impossible economic situation a politically successful strategy."
It is the difference, added Mr. Ezrahi, between a doctor who is presiding over an accident victim's very slow and painful return to walking, which requires a longer period of trust and cooperation from the patient and his family, and a faith healer who gets the patient up one time and says: "You can walk. You can walk." Everyone applauds and then the man collapses off stage.
Mr. Clinton has several problems, though, in trying to pull this off.
One is that he himself raised expectations during the campaign by his claims that he had a plan to heal the economy, and it is a little bit late for him to dampen them. Another is that his performance as a schoolmaster was so good, and the way he handled the diverse material so deft, that it further raises expectations for his Presidency. We expect a lot from the class valedictorian.
"The student who impresses people most also gets in trouble quickest if he gets a B instead of an A," said Republican political consultant Kevin Phillips.
And even as Mr. Clinton was dazzling business leaders with his smarts, I.B.M. announced that it was laying off 25,000 people in 1993 and closing plants after its worst year ever, underscoring the larger forces at work in the economy that are out of his control.
The I.B.M. story was almost a parable of what happens to large institutions, be they companies or countries, that do not adapt structurally to the rapidly changing tempo of the times. Incidentally, I.B.M., General Motors and Chrysler were not among the select 329 invitees at the Clinton conference.
"I think the challenge for Clinton is to adjust the rhythms of government to the new tempo in the world economy," said Sheryl Handler, president of Thinking Machines Corp., a manufacturer of supercomputers, who attended the conference.
"Let me give you an example," she said. "The Government procurement process for computers takes up to two years. But in the computer industry today a new generation of computers comes out every 18 months. So the Government is always behind the curve."
 
The Attentive Government
 The underlying structure of the American economy, argued Ms. Handler, is quite robust in many sectors, but it needs a government, and governmental policies, that will be attuned to the different rhythms of each sector, with policies that will get the most out of companies, whether by setting the right standards for them or introducing the right tax legislation.
"If Clinton can do through his policies what he did at the conference, which was demonstrate a real feel for the nuances of the economy, I think he can be quite successful," she added. "It is a different sort of leadership."
Indeed, since the advent of the cold war we have grown used to Presidents building their authority more by moving troops around the globe than numbers across a budget ledger. Mr. Clinton no doubt will get his chance to move troops, probably very soon. But for the moment, it seems he will try to derive his authority as much from demonstrating a grasp of economic policy, and a willingness and ability to educate the public on that subject.
You can almost hear the Clinton inaugural now: "Let everyone know, whether they wish us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend or oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of . . . our budget."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A Lame-Duck Diplomat Wrestles With a World in Flux

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: BRUSSELS

 BODY:
LAWRENCE S. EAGLEBURGER doesn't look much like the Red Adair of foreign policy, flaunting his lame-duck status with a crippled bird pin stuck in his lapel. Yet to be Secretary of State in the unwieldy new world of late 1992 means spending a lot of time putting out raging diplomatic fires rather than crafting Talleyrand-like strategies for the future. In these final days of the Bush foreign policy, it is not a comfortable role.
The Secretary of State went to Stockholm, Geneva and Brussels last week, hoping to focus on three issues: cooperative security measures, a far-reaching nuclear arms agreement with the Russians and the war in the Balkans. Along the way, he repeatedly got waylaid by the unpredictable. 
 There was, most dramatically, the diplomatic equivalent of Orson Welles's "War of the Worlds" broadcast -- the startling speech in Stockholm by Andrei V. Kozyrev, Russia's fresh-faced Foreign Minister, which left many in the hall believing for an hour that Russia was prepared to use military force and economic weapons to recreate the old Soviet Union. It was, in fact, just an attention-grabbing ploy to dramatize the fragility of Russia's reform.
As with Mr. Welles's 1938 radio broadcast, which left many Americans believing a Martian invasion was under way, the Russian's message was less revealing than the credulous reaction of his audience. At least some listeners ended the day a bit closer to realizing something fundamental about the new world order: They are going to have to expect the unexpected.
For one thing, the Kozyrev incident exposed how little the rest of the world knew of the Russian Foreign Minister or what to expect of his boss, President Boris N. Yeltsin. Mr. Yeltsin himself underscored the point at the end of the week when he stunned the White House with an announcement that Russia was ready to sign a nuclear-arms treaty that the Administration believes is still under negotiation.
After the Stockholm meeting, Mr. Eagleburger went to Geneva for a conference on the Balkan war and to Brussels for a NATO meeting. But in the course of the week, he also found himself contending with Ukrainian stalling on arms control, a dispute between Armenians and Azeris over Nagorno-Karabakh, the problems of Georgia, Israel's deportation of 400 Palestinians and a refugee exodus from Tajikistan to Afghanistan.
"In the non-cold war world you get a lot of surprises," said Mr. Eagleburger in an interview over breakfast at the end of the week. "It's constant."
In his own down-to-earth idiom, he described a small part of his first day in Stockholm, at a meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe: "We think we got a process working on Nagorno-Karabakh. But the Armenians the day before attack a city. The Azeris threaten to wreck the process and here we are at a meeting with what we thought was a process working and it begins to come unraveled and you kind of run around trying to talk to the Azeris and the Armenians and say, 'Now you guys got to get back together to talk.'
 
'Pasted-Together Diplomacy'
 "You go talk to the Georgian Foreign Minister and you spend half your time talking about whether Georgia is going to hold together or not. Those sorts of things occur all the time now."
In the intellectual competition over what to call the new chaos, Mr. Eagleburger's phrase is as good as any: "Pasted-together diplomacy." And how does he like his job? "I hate this job. I hate this job," he said, with only a hint that he might not fully mean it.
If navigating in the cold war world was like sailing the high seas -- there were dangers, but there was a map and compass, and identifiable friends and foes were on the shore -- then navigating in the new world is more like a Star Trek mission into unexplored galaxies. In the old days, two superpowers kept most of the smaller players under control. Now the absence of a new rule book has given the other actors a chance to try to set the rules.
In Yugoslavia, for example, the European and North American democracies misjudged Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, whose campaign of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia is a principal issue -- and could be ratified -- in a Serbian presidential election today.
As far back as March 1991 the reclusive ex-Communist clearly detailed his expansionist goal of creating a Greater Serbia, by any means necessary. But the world thought it impossible that he could carry out such a program. Then the unexpected happened: His xenophobic message caught fire and Serbs began to commit atrocities unseen in Europe for decades.
"There was the belief for too long that Yugoslavia was something that could be saved," Prime Minister Carl Bildt of Sweden said last week. "I think we collectively underestimated Mr. Milosevic and his ruthlessness." Now Mr. Bildt deems the Serbian leader worse than President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. "I don't want to say anything remotely positive about Saddam Hussein but what he did was a fairly conventional invasion of another country," says Mr. Bildt, while the atrocities carried out by Serbs "haven't been seen since the Nazi crimes in Europe."
Mr. Eagleburger, who was convinced months ago that the West needed to take firmer action, named Mr. Milosevic, other Serbians and Croats as possible war criminals who should be brought to justice.
 
Concern About Clinton
 All this turmoil and hand wringing means Europe is still looking to America for answers. While foreign ministers attended their meetings, their aides were pumping American officials for information on Bill Clinton's foreign policy and his choice for Secretary of State. A quick sampling of delegations indicates that many of the Europeans want more American engagement, not less, and that they watched Mr. Clinton's economic summit on CNN with some alarm that attention to the American economy could come at the expense of foreign affairs.
The Russians told the American delegation they favor a continuation of President Bush's diplomacy, with the sort of continuity a Colin Powell would symbolize as Secretary of State. In other European delegations, there was little enthusiasm for Warren Christopher, who served in Jimmy Carter's State Department and is regarded as an able negotiator but not the strategist-fireman that the new world needs. Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, told reporters that none of the contacts between Her Majesty's Government and the Clinton team had given him "any great cause for alarm or despondency." In diplomatese, that was one way to say that Mr. Clinton hadn't done much to prompt celebration, either.
What is Mr. Eagleburger's advice for whoever succeeds him?
First: "Do your best to recognize that you'll always be limited in providing yourself time to think about the big issues." Second: "Recognize and use the fact that, while a large part of the world thinks it is now to be heard more forcefully, there is only one power that thinks globally -- and therefore it is absolutely essential that you do your best to develop a world strategy and fit the pieces into it and not the reverse."
And third (half-kidding): "Not to take the job."

HEADLINE: U.S. PENSION AGENCY IS IN DEEP TROUBLE, ECONOMISTS WARN

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
A growing chorus of economists and Government officials is warning that the Federal program that insures corporate pension plans is in deep financial trouble and might eventually require a costly bailout.
Coverage of private plans is just one part of the Government's large pension problem. Because of past inattention, the pension plans for Federal employees -- paid out of separate accounts -- are now underfinanced by more than $1 trillion. 
 Some officials, including President-elect Bill Clinton, have compared the potential problem to the savings and loan disaster. Two Democratic Congressmen with jurisdiction over the issue -- Representatives Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois and J. J. Pickle of Texas -- have told Mr. Clinton that they are concerned about the potential liability to the Government.
 
Insures 40 Million Americans
 The 18-year-old Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation assures that when employers who pay premiums to it go bankrupt, the Government will meet the companies' obligations to their retirees. The pensions of 40 million Americans are now insured by the corporation.
Most companies set aside enough money to cover the pension benefits they have promised their employees. But hundreds of others are neglecting to finance their pensions fully, and those liabilities have grown 70 percent in the last two years alone, to $51 billion at the end of 1991, from $30 billion at the end of 1989. Many underfinanced plans come from the troubled auto, steel, tire and airline industries.
In negotiating new labor contracts with workers, some of these companies have offered to bolster pensions in lieu of raising salaries -- promising, in effect, money they do not have now but hope to have in the future.
 
 
Risks Keep Rising
 The pension agency's annual list of the 50 companies with the largest underfinanced pension plans showed a 13 percent increase in 1991 in guaranteed benefits not backed by money in retirement funds. Among the companies on the list are the LTV Corporation, the Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company, the Chrysler Corporation, Bethelem Steel and General Motors.
While the Federal pension corporation has enough cash to meet its obligations for the next several years, it shows a deficit of about $3 billion if anticipated future losses are factored in. That shortfall is projected to grow to as much as $30 billion as the baby boom generation begins to retire in 15 to 20 years.
This raises the likelihood that premiums, the main source of revenue, will have to be augmented, with taxpayer money making up the difference, corporation officials say. The Government has raised the premiums before, but that prompted many companies to drop out of the program to avoid the increased costs. As it stands now, costs have climbed to about $19 an employee yearly for a company in the plan, from $1 an employee 18 years ago. Rates are even higher for underfinanced plans.
Some critics of the pension agency contend that the problem is overstated and that the numbers show no immediate cause for alarm. But others maintain that the situation will worsen considerably if not dealt with now.
"Corporations in tight straits are making promises," said Representative Pickle, the chairman of a Congressional oversight committee that has been examining the pension insurance program. "We've got to put a stop to it. If three or four major companies go under, so could the P.B.G.C."
To address the problem of its own pension commitments, the Government has begun setting money aside, but making up the deficit will take larger and larger bites of the Federal budget over the next few decades. Already, pension obligations for military and civil service retirees cost the Federal Government tens of billions of dollars a year.
 
How Big a Burden?
 No one has calculated what the Government's overall pension liabilities might be decades from now if the public and private programs remain unchanged. But military retirees, who can retire after 20 years of service and earn 50 percent of their pay for the rest of their lives, account for about half the Government's pension debts. And the Pentagon has projected that it will have to devote an ever-larger percentage of its budget to financing the pensions. The cost of these commitments is expected to grow to $296 billion in the year 2041, from $11.2 billion this year.
By comparison, during the Bush Administration's four years the Government paid $130 billion to bail out the savings and loan industry. The Pentagon's estimate does not take into account any future changes in the military or in the retirement system.
In the Presidential campaign debate in Richmond on Oct. 15, Mr. Clinton said, "We are going to have to change and strengthen the pension requirements on private retirement plans."
A week ago , officials of the Clinton transition team had not met with executives of the pension benefit corporation, said James Lockhart, the program's executive director. And the issue was barely addressed this week during the two-day economic conference that Mr. Clinton convened in Little Rock, Ark.
 
Options for Clinton
 On Wednesday, however, Gene Sperling, deputy director of Mr. Clinton's economic transition team, said his staff would soon present the President-elect various options to deal with the pension problem. Mr. Sperling added that Mr. Rostenkowski had warned Mr. Clinton about the pension corporation in an August letter.
Several Government officials said they thought Mr. Clinton should deal with the problem quickly, before the deficit grows far larger. Generally, they say, the Government should make it harder for financially troubled companies to expand pension benefits while possibly forcing them to pay higher premiums.
Representative Pickle called the looming pension deficit "a tremendously serious problem" and said Mr. Clinton had agreed with his concerns in a recent meeting.
Mr. Pickle said he intended to introduce legislation on the first day of the new Congress that would limit the ability of financially troubled companies in the Federal program to raise employee benefits.
 
'Raising a Red Flag'
 "I am not speaking from a position of panic," Mr. Pickle said. "I am raising a red flag. We've got to lay down some guidelines of what can be permitted from now on, or else it will be worse than the savings and loan scandal." The Treasury is expected to wind up spending as much as $200 billion to sort out the troubled industry and shut insolvent savings institutions.
In the next two decades the baby boom generation will pass through its peak earning years, and Government tax revenues are likely to remain higher than average. But as the members of this huge generational bubble begin to reach retirement age, higher payments will be required from Federal and private pension funds. At the same time, the nation's wage base will be shrinking.
Other Government benefit programs, including Social Security and Medicare, which are financed by payroll taxes, will also feel the strain. By both Government and private accountings, some companies' current contributions to the pension fund are not large enough to finance all the benefits that will come due when these people begin retiring.
And Mr. Lockhart of the pension corporation, as well as Robert D. Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, say the pension insurance program includes the same embedded liabilities and accounting gimmicks that characterized the savings and loan insurance program before it reached a crisis.
The problems with Federal pension programs for Government employees stem from the Government's failure to set aside enough money years ago. Now the Government has worked out a long-term program to pay the debt, with great consequence to the Federal budget in the later years. The Government already spends more than $500 billion a year in retirement costs and health-care payments for retired people covered by Medicare. That represents more than a third of the Federal budget, compared to 22 percent in 1970.
 
Time Is the Enemy
 "This is the time we should be getting our fiscal house into extraordinary good shape," said Neil Howe, the senior economist with the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, based in Washington, and co-author of a 1988 book, "On Borrowed Time" (ICS/Kampmann), that warned about the future burden of Government entitlements.
"If we wait too long to put in reforms" for the pension plan, Mr. Lockhart said, "the companies will have to declare bankruptcy" because the Government will have to impose far higher premiums and make other changes in the system that many companies will not be able to afford. Mr. Lockhart said his corporation projects a deficit of $18 billion in 10 years and $30 billion in 30 years.
Adding to the Government's problem, some companies with well-financed plans are choosing to leave the Federal system, while poorly financed plans are expanding the benefits they offer.
"We need to make sure that Federal liabilities are not increased with abandon by companies having hard times," Mr. Reischauer said.
The officials who think the pension corporation's problems are not so severe point out that the agency reports a surplus in the Federal budget. But the Federal budget shows only an agency's yearly cash flow; it does not take into account future liabilities. On that basis, the pension corporation reported a surplus of almost $800 million last year.
By contrast, the corporation's annual report reported a $500 million loss, using what is known as an accrual accounting method, which is commonplace at private insurance companies. Under that method, money is set aside now for losses expected later.

HEADLINE: New York City Feels Pressure to Protect Precious Watershed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
After half a century in which it has possessed the purest and most bountiful supply of drinking water in America, New York City is facing intense new pressure to protect its reservoirs from pollution and development or spend billions of dollars on a mammoth plant to filter the water.
The Environmental Protection Agency plans to release a complex series of water quality standards this week that the city must meet in the next year. To satisfy the Federal agency, New York will have to enforce a rigorous new plan to control development in the region that supplies its water, including buying ecologically sensitive land in the Catskills. If it does not succeed, the city will almost certainly be ordered to begin constructing the plant. 
 Such a costly enterprise, which Federal officials could impose on the city as early as next year, would quickly become one of the largest public works projects New York has ever tried. Most major American cities already filter their water, as required under Federal law. In the past, however, New York has successfully argued that because most of its water comes from the pristine reservoirs of the Catskills more than 100 miles from the city, it needs only the mildest dose of chlorine to keep it safe.
But tighter Federal regulations, combined with increased pollution and slow but persistent growth in the 2,000-square-mile-area from which New York draws its water, have forced state and Federal health officials to take a new look at the issue.
They say that they are not eager to saddle the city with the huge costs of building a filtration plant, but that unless New York acts fast and effectively to buffer the land that holds its water, there will be no other choice.
"To me this issue is clear," said Dr. William N. Stasiuk, director of the center for environmental health at the State Health Department, which will ultimately enforce any Federal laws concerning the city's drinking water. "The New York City watershed is one of the greatest physical resources any city has on this planet," he said. "It will need protection, not just for 10 or 20 years, but for as long as New York intends to survive. No matter what else it does, the city will have to develop an acceptable plan to protect that area. Then we can talk about putting off filtration."
The Dinkins administration has been presented with what seems like a simple choice: spend a few hundred million dollars now on the region that supplies New York with the bulk of the 1.5 billion gallons of water it consumes each day -- by preventing further development, buying potentially valuable land, stopping soil erosion, and repairing the sewage plants and bridges it controls -- or pay up to $6 billion to build the filtration plant and $300 million a year to operate it.
Easy choice, right?
Not necessarily, because nobody can promise the city that protecting the watershed will be enough to prevent filtration. Some day, public health officials say, the Federal Government may still require New York to filter its water. President-elect Bill Clinton has not yet expressed specific positions on water quality. But many public health officials expect his administration to enforce clean-water regulations more vigorously than did the Bush Administration.
That has made New York politicians, horrified at the prospect of spending so much money in a recession, reluctant to buy land in Delaware County or the Catskills, where most of the city's giant watershed is situated.
"The hardest thing for government to do is to spend money now to save money in the future," said Albert F. Appleton, Commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection, who has made protecting the water supply his chief goal. "Unfortunately, inertia and politics almost always work against good planning."
Uncertainty hurts too, and that uncertainty has turned many environmentalists, who usually argue that filtration is the only certain way to protect the public from new dangers in the water, into ardent opponents of the idea. Like Mr. Appleton, they fear that if the plant is built, New York will lose any incentive or financial ability to protect the reservoir region.

 
 
Land Use: Power and Politics
 New York City has power to control land use in the watershed, along with unilateral rights to stop development. But the political complexities of New York State politics make such authority hard to wield. Upstate legislators have long made it clear that unless the city consults and compromises on watershed growth, other issues crucial to the city, like money for transportation and welfare, will be held up in retaliation.
The water issue has incensed residents of Delaware County, where two of the city's largest reservoirs are located. People there know what growth restrictions would mean: fewer business opportunities and less money in a place where nearly a third of the population receives public assistance and where per-capita income is lower than in Brooklyn or the Bronx.
"It's hard to sit up here and see the city as anything other than vicious and cold," said Kenneth R. Markert, a Delaware County planner who is executive director of the Coalition of Watershed Towns, which represents more than 35 of the small hamlets and villages in the region that oppose the city's plans to control development in the watershed. Mr. Markert's group contends that the city, desperate to avoid the costs of filtration, would gladly force its will upon the politically weak residents of his part of the state.
"For decades they have ignored their obligations to us and to themselves," Mr. Markert said. "They pay less for our water than we do. They neglect the property they control here. And now they are trying to keep us from even trying to make a living. Many people here think New York won't be happy until every one of us is gone and forgotten. Then they can rope off the region and run it the way they like."
On the surface, the battle lines seem clear enough: 100,000 people living a rural life spread among thousands of acres versus the insatiable needs of the nation's biggest and thirstiest city. That is the way it has been for years: balancing the concerns of a small group of upstate landholders against 10 million residents of New York City and its closest suburbs who depend on them for water. Few on either side would argue that New York City, which under state law is responsible for overseeing and protecting the watershed, has been anything but a neglectful behemoth since 1905, when it began to raze villages and burn homesteads in its search for pure water.
Yet, for the first time since regulations for growth in the watershed were last enacted 40 years ago, New York has a rare chance to guarantee the quality of its last untainted natural resource, environmentalists and public health officials say. The city's air remains among the dirtiest in the nation. Its noise levels are unparalleled in America and its garbage problems are worthy of their legend.

 
 
Looming Threat: Filtration Plant
 It was only through a miracle of planning and foresight that the city decided 150 years ago to draw its water from far away. Most major cities went to the nearest river, and today New York is the only American city with a population over 1,000,000 that does not need to filter its water. Everyone agrees that all it would take to preserve that cheap supply of quality drinking water is to shut off development in Delaware and Catskill counties. Faced with the threat of a filtration plant that would cost more than every dam built in the state over the last 100 years, the city finally has the incentive to do it.
"Politics deals with reality," said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a group that is leading the fight to control development in the Catskills. "And reality says if the city feels it has to filter, it simply isn't going to spend the money it should to keep our water safe in the first place. Once we lose that land to development we're never going to get it back. You can't even put a price on that kind of loss."
Such a loss has been demonstrated vividly throughout the Croton watershed in Westchester and Dutchess counties, which now supplies 10 percent of the city's water, and where population has risen by nearly 50 percent in the last 20 years. Once as bucolic and seemingly remote as the Catskills, the Croton system has become so polluted that the city has agreed to spend $600 million to filter its water.
The plant, which is under construction, will make the region's water safe to drink, but nobody thinks Croton water will ever be as good as it was even 20 years ago. And when many planners think about the Catskill and Delaware reservoirs, they mostly worry that what has happened in Westchester could happen again.
That is why the city has proposed stringent new regulations on development, which would prevent new septic systems and the growth they represent from coming to the area. The rules would control farming along the streams that feed its reservoirs, regulate industrial discharges into the rivers and limit the construction of vacation homes.

 
 
Rules Ignite Ire Among Farmers
 Applauded by many conservationists when they were first proposed two years ago, the regulations have ignited nothing but bitterness along the banks of the Delaware River. The original proposals were viewed as particularly onerous by farmers. After much debate the city agreed this spring to spend several million dollars to help farmers there reduce their use of agricultural contaminants that pollute the water. A new system of voluntary pollution restrictions would be tailored to individual farms and be phased in over the next decade.
"I want low-density growth here," said State Assemblyman Richard I. Coombe, a farmer, defeated for re-election last month, who has been a leading opponent of strict regulation in the watershed. "We want the water clean for farming and agriculture and tourism. But the question here is, where do you draw the line? And the city wants to draw it over us."
Mr. Appleton says that is not true. The first city environmental commissioner to seek compromise with upstate residents, he has argued there must be a solution that all can accept.
"This is not a simple issue," Mr. Appleton said. "We pull a major resource out of that region and we ought to recognize it and compensate the people who live there. That has not always been done in the past. But this is not just about growth in Delaware County, where many planners wonder whether growth even makes sense."
"Protecting the environment is about the wise use of resources," he said. "This water is an enormous economic and social asset. I don't think its an exaggeration to say it holds the key to the future of the city, the region and the state."
The residents of Delaware County have heard it all before. New York City is not much loved in those parts. Not since the turn of the century, when the sprawling metropolis started wiping dozens of farm towns off the earth, flooding them to create the lakes and reservoirs that now hold 90 percent of New York's water. Dams and bridges, which the city is required to maintain as a condition of using the region's water, have been allowed nearly to disintegrate.
One bridge, the Dun Raven, used to provide a nice ride across the Pepacton Reservoir, the largest in the Delaware County system. But it began to deteriorate, and fearing disaster, county leaders closed it. Another bridge, in Ulster County, is in such bad shape that school officials no longer permit their buses to drive across it.
The city has started to spend more money on the region lately. Yet, many feel it isn't enough to placate residents there or, barring huge new investment, to keep the region from going the way of the Poconos, where motels dot the land and empty spaces are increasingly hard to find.
The consequences of development for pure water are not debatable. The more construction, the more sewage, the more roads, the worse the water becomes. Today trout run in the waters most New Yorkers drink, clear evidence of its cleanliness.
During the next 10 years, however, the Catskill region is expected to grow by up to 15 percent, and the Delaware by slightly less than that. Most towns in that region have few or no regulations or zoning rules to govern development. Without the mandate from the city, they are unlikely to impose new rules soon.
"You know people used to eat oysters out of the East River and swim in the Hudson," said Robert J. Pirani, director of environmental programs at the Regional Plan Association. "It's sad to think in a few years they are going to look at the water in New York City and say, 'Hey, you used to be able to drink this stuff right out of the tap.' "

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton Social Policy Camps: Bill's vs. Hillary's

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
The social policy of the Clinton Administration is being shaped by separate and in some ways conflicting camps, represented both literally and metaphorically by the occupants of two red brick buildings on Capitol Hill.
One houses the Children's Defense Fund, the child-advocacy group that has become a model of effective liberal lobbying. The other is home to the Democratic Leadership Council, which was founded to criticize and change that same liberal tradition. 
 Hillary Clinton recently led the former; Bill Clinton recently led the latter. The contrast between the groups, and the larger philosophies they embody, is in part between old-style Democrats and self-proclaimed new ones, between those who have spent the last decade denouncing conservative rule and those who have emphasized the need to learn from it.
 
Clash Behind the Scenes
 The two groups do share many important assumptions, not the least of which is that 12 years of Republican Government have left domestic policy a mess. And they both support many of the same proposals, including universal health care and more money for Head Start and child immunizations.
But they have already had a revealing behind-the-scenes clash over welfare reform, one of Mr. Clinton's key domestic proposals. And their differences, in policy and in tone, could shape many other Clinton initiatives, from national service to child care.
"They have had differences in the past," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who like most others involved with social policy was treating the matter as a topic of some sensitivity this week.
With members of both camps gaining powerful posts, no one is eager to offend. "You're onto something, of course, but I'm not going to get into it," said Mr. Moynihan, who is identified with neither group.
The Democratic Leadership Council's research arm, the Progessive Policy Institute, is a major supporter of Mr. Clinton's pledge to make welfare recipients work after two years, or face a reduction in their benefits. The defense fund, now publicly noncommittal about the idea, has long called work requirements punitive.
One Clinton transition official said the conflict between the two perspectives had dominated welfare planning. "I've run into it from the get-go, God, have I ever," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "It's dominated all the discussions. The two sides are very different."
Part of the difference can be seen in the catch-phrase preferred by each. The policy institute talks of "reinventing Government." The defense fund says "we know what to do," implying a need not to reinvent Government but to finance it. The fund offers Head Start as a favorite example, arguing that while few people question the program's merit, it still reaches only 30 percent of its possible universe.
The Children's Defense Fund bears the mark of its founder and president, Marian Wright Edelman, who came of age in the civil rights movement in Mississippi during the 1960's.
In a preface to the group's annual report on American children, released this week, Mrs. Edelman evoked the struggles of the past by recalling that she always used to start her car with the door open. That way, if racial antagonists had planted a bomb, "there was a chance of being thrown out and escaping death."
Since its founding in 1973, the defense fund has been a leader in securing new rights for children and more money for the programs that serve them. For instance, the group played an important role in a series of Medicaid expansions in the 1980's that gave free health insurance to millions of needy children.
Mrs. Edelman's approach is one of relentless, often accusational, advocacy, that has sometimes alienated even her liberal allies. This week's report was characteristic, calling child poverty rates "shameful," "a human and moral travesty," and referring to "small, helpless welfare babies."
Leaders of the fund say they are interested in improving Government programs, but their emphasis has been on financing them. This week's report, for instance, criticizes the decade-old Job Training Partnership Act for reaching "only a fraction" of those who need training. But it fails to acknowledge that a recent evaluation showed that the program actually lowered the earnings of the young men who joined it.
 
Legacy of Mondale's Defeat
 By contrast, the Democratic Leadership Council is quicker to criticize the structure of social programs. It was founded a year after Walter F. Mondale's 1984 defeat, by a group of disaffected Democrats that included both Mr. Clinton and Senator Albert Gore, the Vice President-elect.
"The goal was to find new ways to fulfill the old commitments," said Will Marshall, president of the policy institute.
While traditional liberalism has emphasized the rights of the disadvantaged, the policy institute talks about "balancing rights and responsibilities." It advocates time limits on welfare, for instance, and wants to require students to perform community service in exchange for Government loans.
The institute, which Mr. Clinton headed in 1990 and 1991, has also been a sharp critic of centralized Government bureaucracies, calling for "market- driven" or "entrepreneurial" policies. Rather than increase spending on traditional education programs, for instance, the institute advocates a plan that would let parents or teachers get a state charter to start their own, publicly financed school to compete with those run by school boards.
 
'Substantial Convergence'
 Those involved argue that the differences between the groups are minor.
"You ain't gonna get me into a fight with Marian Wright Edelman, because she's very powerful, and she's been right on a lot of stuff," said Elaine C. Kamarck, a senior fellow at the policy institute.
James D. Weill, the defense fund's general counsel, echoed the sentiment, arguing that there was "substantial convergence" between the two groups.
And indeed there is.
Both are pushing for the Government to tighten the collection of child- support awards and to make the payment itself if absent parents don't. Both support a large expansion in the tax credits that the Government gives to low-income workers. Both groups want to expand the job training offered to welfare recipients. Both favor family leave policies and more "family preservation" programs, to try to keep children from foster care.
While the policy institute places more emphasis on the behavior of the disadvantaged, the defense fund is not silent on the issue. It has conducted a public education campaign, for instance, with stark ads that urge teen-agers not to become pregnant.
 
Signal of Fund's Influence
 The defense fund may have won a highly placed advocate when its chairwoman, Donna E. Shalala, was nominated to become Secretary of Health and Human Services. She succeeded Mrs. Clinton as chairwoman of the fund early this year. When Ms. Shalala listed her five top priorities, welfare reform was absent. That, she said, would take more time.
The Clintons have already blessed both camps with personal appearances at post-election fund raisers. Mrs. Edelman enjoys a friendship of nearly two decades with Mrs. Clinton, who worked at the fund during and after law school. As a signal of the fund's new influence, Mrs. Edelman has been besieged with radio and television requests in the past month. She has repeatedly said she will not go into the Government.
But stalwarts of the "new Democrat" camp are also plentiful. They include Al From, the director of the Democratic Leadership Council, who is heading the transition's domestic policy group. His deputy, Bruce Reed, worked at the council before serving as the Clinton campaign's issues adviser.
Other policy institute staff members involved in the transition include Will Marshall, the institute's president, Robert J. Shapiro, a vice president, and David Osborne, who has written two books whose titles have provided Mr. Clinton with catchy phrases: "Laboratories of Democracy," and "Reinventing Government."
 
Areas of Disagreement
 Future clashes between the two camps may be hinted at by past ones. The Children's Defense Fund has made expansions of the minimum wage a priority. The policy institute's first paper called it "an anachronism -- or worse yet." It argued that tax credits were a better vehicle for channeling money to the poor.
The two groups have also shared different views of child care programs. The policy institute calls for converting the $4 billion in Federal child care money to vouchers, which let parents choose where they send their children.
The defense fund has argued that converting all the money to vouchers could hurt parents in poor neighborhoods, since centers might not open there. In those cases, it argues, traditional direct funding is needed.
That issue was part of a larger child care fight that erupted into unusual view in 1990. Mrs. Edelman accused Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, one of her usual allies, of being "willing to rob millions of children" by making legislative compromises.
Mr. Downey, who lost his recent re-election bid, responded at the time by calling Mrs. Edelman one of "the liberals of the 60's" who had failed to adjust to the times. Mr. Downey, now a Clinton transition aide in the area of social policy, is expected to join the Administration in an influential role.
Isabel V. Sawhill, an economist at the Urban Institute, acknowledged the differing views in the same spirit as everyone else: with carefully chosen words. "This is a very interesting time in trying to sort out, or should I say, integrate the two views," she said.

HEADLINE: Official Says an Increase In Empire Rates Is Likely

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
New York State's Insurance Superintendent said last night that he was likely to grant Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield the entire rate increase it had requested for Jan. 1, which would substantially raise the cost of health insurance for 1.4 million customers.
"At this point I can't see any more money that's available," the Superintendent, Salvatore R. Curiale, said in an interview. "I really can't say what I'm going to do at this point, but we're getting close to the point where I'm going to have to grant the entire rate increase." 
 Mr. Curiale's remarks came after a day when talks between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and state legislative leaders over how to resolve the growing financial crisis at Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield appeared to have broken down. The insurer says that unless it receives more than $420 million soon, its reserves will dwindle to nothing within a few months.
Each side took pains to try to cast blame for any eventual rate increase on the other, and Mr. Curiale's warning could well have been intended to alarm the Senate Republicans into acting on an aid package for Empire. But with relations between the Governor and the Senate particularly bitter as the year draws to a close, it is unlikely that the Senate will relent and grant the company any immediate relief.
Unless it receives at least $85 million from the state in the next two weeks, the insurer's executives say, Empire will have to raise rates for 1.4 million of its small-group and individual customers by an average of 25.7 percent. Mr. Curiale, who is to rule on the rate increase by Jan. 1, had hoped that the Governor and the Legislature would reach some agreement to provide enough money, which would have reduced the amount of any increase.
Governor Cuomo has proposed granting Empire, the state's largest insurer, a one-shot infusion of $85 million from a state fund that provides malpractice insurance to doctors. But that move has been opposed by the Republicans who control the State Senate, who said today that they did not feel they needed to return to Albany to negotiate an aid package and suggested that Mr. Curiale put off his rate decision until the end of January.
Mr. Curiale, a Cuomo appointee who has sole rate-making authority over Empire, said the company's situation was so desperate that he had to make his decision by the end of the year. "Here is a vehicle by which you can pump $85 million into Empire at no cost to the taxpayers," he said. "It seems that the Senate Republicans are adamantly against this."
The issue caused the simmering antagonism between Governor Cuomo, a Democrat, and the Senate leadership to bubble over yesterday in an exchange of words that was nasty even by Albany's rough-and-tumble standards. For more than a month, Mr. Cuomo has tried to get the Legislature to return to the capital to take up several issues, but yesterday the Senate majority Leader, Ralph J. Marino, made it clear that he saw no reason for his members to do so.
The regular legislative session does not start until January, but legislators often return to the Capitol in the off-season to act on one crucial issue or another.
 
Testy Phone Call
 The Senate's reluctance to participate in a special legislative session enraged the Governor, who made his feelings known in a testy telephone call to Mr. Marino yesterday morning. "When I asked him: 'What is the impediment to coming back? Is there a problem? Are you too busy? Is it too cold in Albany?' he wouldn't give me a reason," Mr. Cuomo said in a telephone interview. "They'll come back for Christmas parties; they'll come back for committee meetings, but they won't come back to work."
Whatever happens, the dwindling prospect of a special session further compounds the problems for Empire, which insures nine million people in the New York City, mid-Hudson and Albany areas.
The company says that it needs the money either through a rate increase or a cash infusion from the state, or some combination of both. Last week, a United States Senate subcommittee announced that it had begun a far-reaching investigation of Empire's finances and management, lending fuel to calls for tighter state control over the company in Albany.
Mr. Cuomo has proposed giving Empire $85 million from a state fund set up to provide malpractice insurance to doctors. Empire, which has contributed several hundred million dollars to the fund in the last seven years, has sued the state to get its money back, and the $85 million would come from settling the lawsuit.
The Governor says that although he can settle the lawsuit on his own, he needs the full Legislature to appropriate the money to Empire. For its part, the Senate has suggested that it might appropriate the money anyway -- but sometime in its regular session. And yesterday John E. McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Marino, said the Insurance Department should wait until the end of January before ruling on the rate increase.
But Mr. Curiale said he had no time. This fall Empire filed suit against him after he denied the company's request for a 14 percent rate increase, claiming that his denial had allowed their cash reserves to dip to a dangerously low point. The company won in the lower courts.
 
Other Pressures
 The state appealed the decision, but Mr. Curiale said it would be irresponsible to deny Empire the money it needs.
Along with the Empire rate increase, Mr. Cuomo has been pushing the Legislature to return to Albany to try to fill the Metropolitan Transportation Association's $265 million deficit without raising bus and subway fares, and to act on a proposal to shift nearly $95 million left from the 1988 Transportation Bond Act from Long Island and New York City to communities in upstate New York.
But yesterday, the Governor's efforts to coax, embarrass and threaten the Senate into returning appeared to have been in vain.
The Senate Republicans said the Governor was, in effect, fabricating crises in order to make the Senate look bad. "It is utter nonsense," said Mr. McArdle. "On each of the issues the Governor has yet to make a convincing case as to why we need to come back, and in fact it would probably be more intelligent to address these issues in January."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton Plans to Spread the Wealth In Increased Public Works Spending

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
The transportation industry is gearing up a major lobbying campaign to grab a big share of the increased public works spending promised by the incoming Clinton Administration.
But the Clinton team, which has never spelled out how it would divide the $20 billion in additional money that Mr. Clinton promised to spend each year, appears to be planning a much broader array of programs, spreading the wealth beyond traditional road and bridge projects. 
 Mr. Clinton has made clear that he views "infrastructure," the term usually used to encompass all sorts of public works spending, as a very broad area for investment.
"There's no question that if we increase our investment in infrastructure for tomorrow, that we'll do better," the President-elect said at the recent economic conference in Little Rock, Ark. "We need to do it in not just roads and bridges and water and sewer systems, but in new rail systems, new air transport systems, all kinds of things that are out there for us to do. An information highway, broadly defined, is infrastructure."
 
'Information Superhighways'
 And Vice President-elect Al Gore, long a proponent of increased spending on information technologies, chimed in, "Shouldn't we be giving a lot more emphasis to the kind of national infrastructure we need to share information and create and share knowledge?" He spoke of "information superhighways" that would include "digital libraries, the software and the programs that make it possible for children to come home after school and plug into the Library of Congress."
If its membership surveys are to be believed, the transportation sector alone would have no problem devouring the bulk of an annual increase of $20 billion in spending.
The American Road and Transportation Builders Association has already begun soliciting financial support from its members for a campaign of advertising, publicity and lobbying like the million-dollar blitz that preceded passage of the Surface Transportation Act of 1991, which provided $150 billion in Federal aid over six years.
The new campaign began on Dec. 10, when the all-news radio station in Little Rock began to broadcast pro-transportation commercials that ran 14 times a day until the end of the economic meeting there. A full-page advertisement, also calling for increased transportation spending, was in The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on Monday, the day the conference opened.
But advisers to the Clinton campaign say no further enormous increase in transportation spending is likely to be enacted right away, both because the money is not readily available and because even transportation enthusiasts in Congress doubt that all the projects on the interest groups' wish list can be justified.
Rather, one adviser said, the most that can be expected is something on the order of $5 billion more each year, at least half of which would simply go to financing the 1991 act, whose targets have not been met so far.
Although Mr. Clinton has said he would cut military spending to pay for civil projects, new pressures to cut the deficit could change that plan. The most likely source of additional revenue for transportation spending would be a big increase in gasoline taxes, but Mr. Clinton has appeared reluctant to back away from campaign pledges against raising the gasoline tax.
Another possible source of money is to tap pension funds and other private capital, by marketing new varieties of infrastructure bonds that might be guaranteed by the Federal Government.
Mr. Clinton has not yet named his Transportation Secretary or focused much attention on his public works program, said people involved in the transition.
But many of the people involved in the transition said they believed that if the grand total of public works spending increases is ever to reach $20 billion, it is likely to be through a combination of measures, including research as well as construction, using the broadest possible definition of "infrastructure" in order to flesh out the spending program.
But for the moment, transportation groups are in the best position to list the projects they would spend money on the instant it was made available.
The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, after surveying officials in all the states, said it could spend an extra $8.5 billion in Federal highway money in 1993 beyond what has already been provided by Congress.
The legislation enacted in 1991 might have allowed more than $20 billion to be spent on surface transportation projects in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, but in an attempt to keep the deficit down Congress approved only $18 billion for the year in its annual spending bill. State officials said they could spend as much as $26.5 billion this year, concentrating the additional money in easy-to-start repair projects.
The amount that might be spent on surface transportation could be increased even more rapidly if mass transit agencies were given all they are seeking. This year local transit agencies anticipate spending $4.6 billion in Federal money, and they say they have an extra $7 billion in projects ready to go if the money were made available.
The easiest way to spend the money, said officials of the American Public Transit Association, would be to buy new vehicles like buses, vans and subway cars. The association's survey found that agencies could spend $1.25 billion on buses and vans and $1.64 billion on other vehicles.
There are not quite as many billions of dollars waiting to be spent on aviation, but here too there are lists of projects ready to pursue.
The Federal Aviation Administration's airport improvement spending program this year amounts to $1.8 billion, while the long-term needs for airport projects run about $40 billion over 10 years, aviation officials said.
 
High-Speed Railroads
 The question is how many of these programs could make use of a rapid infusion of money. Joseph Del Balzo, the aviation agency's top engineering official, said that airports had 109 runway projects in mind and that the layout plans had been completed for 77 of them. Of these, 26 are far enough along that environmental impact statements have been issued, a sign that construction is ready to begin.
In the passenger railroad sector, a short-term infusion of money would make little sense unless the investment program continued for years to come. One of Mr. Clinton's favorite programs is the development of high-speed intercity trains like those used in Europe and Japan, but these are years from becoming widespread in the United States.
W. Graham Claytor, president of Amtrak, told the economic meeting in Little Rock that the railroad was ready to start "instantly" to spend more money, adding, "Long-term solutions don't come about unless there's short-term action."
Mr. Claytor said it would "take about a billion dollars to get our national railroad passenger system in first-class shape." He was apparently referring to the railroad's annual spending needs. According to Amtrak's long-term capital investment plan, which was prepared for Congress last year, Amtrak needs to increase investments by $1.2 billion a year on new tracks, trains and other equipment from now until the year 2007. Under the Bush Administration, the capital budget was never fully financed.
To accomplish that, Mr. Claytor is seeking the use of 1 cent of the Federal gasoline tax. He has promised that the money "would produce an Amtrak hardly recognizable by today's standards." Most important, he has said, the railroad would no longer have to turn to the Federal Government for operating subsidies to keep its fares competitive.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
A Populist Inauguration: Jackson, With Decorum

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:
When President-elect Bill Clinton's big rock candy mountain moves from Little Rock to Washington, the contrast with previous inaugurations will be palpable, deliberate and historically aware. While there will be entertainment, fireworks and a multicultural festival on the Mall, it is clearly designed to contrast with the plutocratic touches of the Reagan and Bush inaugurations.
Because a partially open house at the White House is on the schedule the day after the inauguration, there is talk of recapturing the spirit of Andrew Jackson's first inauguration, on March 4, 1829. If so, the Clintons had better roll up the carpets and count the silver first. Contemporary accounts of General Jackson's inauguration serve to caution the Democratic residents of the White House about the wisdom of letting the People join in the fun too democratically. 
 President-elect Jackson avoided a parade, vetoed elaborate balls and celebrations and, accompanied by his friends, walked along the sidewalk to his inauguration. (One reason for the simplicity, of course, is that his wife, Rachel, had died on Dec. 22, 1828; a few weeks later, Jackson left his Tennessee home for Washington.)
Some onlookers thought the lack of ceremony an insult to the office of the Presidency. But Francis Scott Key, author of "The Star-Spangled Banner," said of the 10,000 visitors who crowded Washington to witness the oath of office, "It is beautiful; it is sublime!"
As Jackson and his friends approached the Capitol's East Portico on foot, crowds rushed to catch a glimpse of the new President. All but one man in the procession wore a hat; spotting the tall bare-headed figure, onlookers shouted: "There he is, he with the white head! There is the old veteran! There is Jackson!"
 
Crowds, Then a Mob
 People had come from as much as 500 miles away to see the battle- and duel-scarred new President. A witness wrote that Pennsylvania Avenue "was crowded with carriages of every description, from the splendid Baronet and coach, down to wagons and carts, filled with women and children, some in finery and some in rags, for it was the people's President."
After the oath was administered on a springlike day, the White House was thrown open to the public. President Jackson shook hands with a number of people, then escaped by a side entrance to his lodgings at Gadsby's Hotel.
One guest, James Hamilton Jr., recalled the scene in the White House beginning that afternoon: "The mob broke in, in thousands. Spirits black, yellow, and gray poured in in one uninterrupted stream of mud and filth, among the throngs many subjects for the penitentiary."
Referring to a well-known abolitionist, he continued, "It would have done Mr. Wilberforce's heart good to have seen a stout black wench eating in this free country a jelly with a gold spoon at the President's House."
Twenty thousand people passed through the Executive Mansion, attacking the refreshments, breaking china and glassware, standing in muddy boots on damask-covered chairs, ripping down drapery, trampling on rugs and breaking costly handmade French furniture. The doors could not accommodate the crowds entering and leaving; windows had to be used as exits. The food quickly ran out, but tubs of punch, laced with whiskey, kept flowing. When the tubs were finally moved to the lawn, the mob followed and reeled off into the night.
 
In Jefferson's Path
 The Clinton inauguration will begin Jan. 17, with a visit to Monticello, followed by a bus caravan to Washington, a journey to the White House that pays tribute to the path, and presumably the ideals, of the third President, in 1801.
Thomas Jefferson, the first President to take the oath in Washington, walked to the Capitol from his boarding house, a block away, accompanied by a group of riflemen, artillerymen and civilians. His predecessor, John Adams, drove out of the city at dawn because he did not want to attend the inauguration of a man whom he believed would be responsible for the dissolution of the Republic.
 
Elaborate and Expensive
 Beginning with John F. Kennedy's in 1961, inaugurations have become more extravagant. The cost of the Clinton ceremonies, paid for mainly by Democratic Party contributors and corporate sponsors, is expected to be close to $20 million.
Statistics vary on the costs of the last two inaugurations depending on adjustments for inflation and public and private underwriting, but they were reported to be in the neighborhood of $25 million each.
Even as a populist event, the Clinton inauguration will surely contrast with the first inauguration, at Federal Hall in Manhattan.
Although George Washington was rich for his time, he was land-poor and had to borrow 600 pounds to finance his trip from Virginia to that inauguration. His swearing-in was followed by the firing of 13 cannons and 13 skyrockets.
Two months later, a modest ball was held in rooms on Broadway. Martha Washington did not arrive in time to attend.

HEADLINE: Yugoslavia Votes, Divided and Fearful

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Voters in what is left of Yugoslavia go to the polls Sunday, bitterly divided about their country's future yet agreeing on one thing: the weeks ahead are full of new and terrible dangers.
The two remaining republics that now make up federal Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro -- are rife with rumors of coups, military uprisings and even impending war among the rival factions who are contesting the election within Serbia. No matter who wins the voting, most citizens believe that neither side will accept the results peacefully. 
 "I am so scared I can't sleep at night," one Belgrade worker said. "I want to go into my basement and stay there until the whole thing is over."
Most attention is focused on the crucial contest for Serbia's presidency, although voters will be choosing three new Parliaments, a federal one for Yugoslavia and one for each of its constituent republics, Serbia and Montenegro. The Serbian presidential contest pits two radically different candidates against each other.
 
A Distinct Choice
 The incumbent, Slobodan Milosevic, 51 years old , is a nationalist militant who views himself as the bearer of Serbia's centuries-old tradition. His supporters see him as a heroic figure who embodies the mystic Serbian consciousness. But his critics, among them most world leaders, consider him a brutal criminal responsible for the cruel war still ranging in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Mr. Milosevic's main opponent, Milan Panic, 63, the federal Yugoslav Prime Minister, says he is determined to lead his country into the modern world.
Born in Belgrade, Mr. Panic emigrated to the United States as a young man, made a fortune in the pharmaceutical business, and returned to his homeland less than six months ago to take the job of Prime Minister. He pledges to end the fighting in Bosnia, make Yugoslavia into a democracy, and shake Serbs out of the nationalist fervor that has led them to the status of international outcasts.
Public opinion polls here are notoriously unreliable, so there is no clear indication whether Mr. Milosevic or Mr. Panic is ahead. Most people say they believe that the race is close, and that the five minor candidates will win enough votes to deny anyone an absolute majority.
If that happens, the two leading candidates will have a runoff election in two weeks.
 
Incumbent Advantage
 During the campaign, Mr. Milosevic has used every advantage available to incumbents in authoritarian countries. State-run television has been heavily biased in his favor, and Government funds have poured into his campaign.
But Mr. Panic has run a surprisingly strong race. To many voters, especially the young, he represents the first hope for a genuine change that this country has had since World War II.
Because Mr. Milosevic is a lifelong Communist who has shown himself willing to use all means necessary to win political victories, many Yugoslavs fear that he will not abide by the results if he loses.
"I can't imagine Milosevic out of power altogether," said Stojan Cerovic, who covers the campaign for the Belgrade news magazine Vreme. "For him, it's almost crazy to think that someone should leave office just because of voting. He is surely thinking of using force if that is necessary to keep his job.
"The opposition is not ready to accept defeat either," Mr. Cerovic added. "If Milosevic wins, opposition parties will say that his victory is illegitimate because the campaign was so unfair. People could pour out on to the streets, and you could have a Beijing-style massacre."
 
A Dangerous Time
 "This is quite a dangerous period, and no one can count on a peaceful solution," he said. "I'm pretty pessimistic. There are too many weapons around, mostly on Milosevic's side. He's a gambler."
Much speculation has centered on the role of the army, the police and the various paramilitary forces that have sprouted here during the last year.
The army is under the official control of Yugoslavia's federal President, Dobrica Cosic, a novelist who has wide public support. In recent weeks, Mr. Cosic has held a series of meetings with senior military officers, seeking to guarantee their obedience.
"The police force has been greatly expanded," said Predrag Simic, director of the nonpartisan Institute of International Politics and Economics. "It has more than 40,000 people in uniform, and about 16,000 of them are political police, trained in special tactics and intensely loyal to Milosevic. Many of them are not from Serbia. They are refugees from Croatia and Bosnia who see Milosevic as their only hope to go back home and continue their wars. If you combine them with these ruthless Mafia-style gangs, you see the possibility for a very deep confrontation here.
"Milosevic realizes that the end of his political career could be the end of his biological career," Mr. Simic said. "Something like half of the Serbian population holds him responsible for the greatest catastrophe that has faced them in modern times. The world wants to try him as a war criminal, and except for Cuba or North Korea or maybe China, he has nowhere to hide. Do you know of any examples of a totalitarian ruler going into peaceful retirement?"
 
Threat of Foreign Intervention
 Many Yugoslavs also worry about foreign intervention. World leaders have threatened an increase in pressure on Yugoslavia if Mr. Milosevic wins. Diplomats said responses could include closure of foreign embassies here, blockades of international borders, and cutting of telephone and other services to Serbia.
If Mr. Milosevic wins, diplomats say, Western governments will seriously consider attacking Serbian military positions in an effort to end the Bosnia fighting. These attacks could be aimed at artillery batteries being used to shell Bosnian towns, or at targets inside Serbia itself.
"Outside pressures intended to support Panic and the opposition have been counterproductive, and future pressures will have the same effect," warned Bora Kuzmanovic, a professor of social psychology at the University of Belgrade. "They provoke nationalist feelings. If someone from abroad tries to help the opposition by intervention, even limited intervention, they will cause a pro-Milosevic uprising that will destabilize the whole situation."
Many Yugoslavs say that if Mr. Milosevic cannot win an outright victory on Sunday, his air of invincibility will be lost, and prospects for his electoral defeat will dramatically increase. They fear that if he senses he is losing, he may provoke a violent confrontation, either in the Serbian heartland or in Kosovo or Montenegro, and use it as a pretext to declare martial law or cancel the runoff election.
"This period is very dangerous because Milosevic is a maniac for power," Vojin Dimitrisevic, a law professor, said. "He cannot tolerate the idea that he would be simply an ordinary citizen, and he cannot be bought off with a villa in France like some African dictator. Like Hitler, he would like to induce the whole nation to commit suicide before he commits suicide himself. I am optimistic that there will be no Milosevic by springtime, but I don't know at what cost."

HEADLINE: U.S. Moves to Replace Japanese Head of W.H.O.

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
The United States and its European allies are mounting a spirited campaign to prevent the re-election of the head of the World Health Organization, the agency that leads the worldwide battle against AIDS and other threats to public health.
The official, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, a Japanese citizen who has headed the agency for five years, is being strongly defended by the Japanese Government. The election is scheduled for Jan. 20. 
 The United States opposes Dr. Nakajima's re-election with the argument that he is an incompetent administrator and a poor leader and communicator, whose frequent travels leave W.H.O. headquarters in Geneva in disarray.
 
Japan Accuses U.S.
 In response, the Japanese Foreign Ministry asserts that Dr. Nakajima has not been in office long enough for his efforts to bear fruit, and accuses Washington of spreading dis information. Dr. Nakajima said in an interview that he had not heard any public or private criticism of his record from United States officials.
But Tokyo, Washington and some European capitals are raising wider issues. Japanese officials say Dr. Nakajima is a symbol of Japan's attempt to play a greater role in world affairs, as Washington has urged.
A senior United States official, on the other hand, cited an internal State Department briefing paper that listed what he described as Japan's intimidating tactics in a diplomatic campaign that for both sides has largely taken place out of public view. He said the issue could damage Japan's prospects for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council because it raises questions about Japan's conduct in the area of world affairs.
 
State Dept. Paper
 The paper said Japan's "actions -- some reported and others verified -- amount to a pattern of aggressive tactics, including the pursuit of votes in exchange for favors." It listed these actions, among others:
*An official of the Maldives, which has a vote in the W.H.O. election, told American and European officials that Japan had threatened to cut off fish imports from that country if Dr. Nakajima was not re-elected.
*Similar threats were made to cut off coffee imports from Jamaica and purchases from other unspecified countries, and to block a pending $250 million loan to Algeria by the Export-Import Bank.
*A Japanese official offered a job to an official of the Agency for International Development on the condition that he work to change the Government's position on Dr. Nakajima.
Officials of Japan's Foreign Ministry denied the charges. "We have never threatened but we have been threatened," said Masao Kawai, a senior official at the ministry. The Japanese officials accused the United States and other Western countries of undertaking a campaign of disinformation.
State Department officials said in interviews that Japan was also trying to buy votes in the election by offering delegates from key countries first-class tickets to Japan, $14,000 in traveler's checks and $50,000 contributions to their personal research projects.
United States and European officials also say they have received reports from United States embassies that Dr. Nakajima offered the single deputy's job to four people from four countries influential in the election.
A message from the Uruguayan Government to Japanese officials in Geneva said that Uruguay would support Dr. Nakajima's re-election with the understanding that he will appoint a Bolivian as deputy director general.
Dr. Nakajima denied making such pledges. He said it was not he, but Dr. Mohammed Abdelmoumene, the organization's current deputy director and the main opposition candidate to Dr. Nakajima's re-election, who has promised the deputy's position to others. Dr. Abdelmoumene, who denied the assertion, served as deputy director until August, when Dr. Nakajima dismissed him because he had become a rival for his job. Dr. Abdelmoumene, an Algerian, has the support of Washington and the European Community to succeed Dr. Nakajima.

 
 
U.S. Takes Risk Embarrassing Ally
 The United States is investing considerable effort in trying to unseat Dr. Nakajima, despite the certainty of embarrassing a close ally with whom there are many more weighty issues at stake. The stimulus is the high priority United States officials place on the World Health Organization.
W.H.O. led the successful campaign to eradicate smallpox from the world. With an $850 million annual budget, the largest of any United Nations subagency, W.H.O. runs or helps to sustain critical public health programs in many countries, and United States officials say they fear that the re-election of Dr. Nakajima would put these efforts at risk.
"It appears that W.H.O. is losing its reputation as the world's leader in health matters at a time when serious global health problems present daunting challenges to us all," the Health and Human Services Secretary, Louis W. Sullivan, wrote in a recent cable urging other countries to join the United States in choosing a new head.
"Because W.H.O. is dealing with some of the most critical issues facing mankind, we believe it is essential that the organization have the strongest possible leadership," he added.
An American diplomat who is one of Dr. Nakajima's strongest critics and spoke on condition of anonymity said his re-election would establish a precedent that a rich country could buy a new term for what he called an incompetent incumbent.

 
 
A.M.A. Supports Japanese Incumbent
 United States officials have been embarrassed, however, by the support that Dr. Nakajima has received from the American Medical Association, the largest group of doctors in this country. James S. Todd, the A.M.A.'s executive vice president, wrote Dr. Sullivan in July, praising Dr. Nakajima's leadership in providing "a forum for organized medicine from diversified health systems to share ideas with W.H.O. on a host of health policy issues, including private/public sector collaboration, continuing medical education, quality assurance and access to care."
The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, which represents United States drug manufacturers, said it had intended to support Dr. Nakajima but had withheld its endorsement in deference to Washington's opposition to him.
Dr. Nakajima is the first Japanese elected to head an international agency (others have been appointed), and Japanese officials say they do not want to lose face in withdrawing his candidacy.
"He has been given special attention by the Japanese people as well as the Japanese politicians," said Mr. Kawai of the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
Dr. Nakajima is believed to have strong political backing from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and Japanese officials say it is too late to find another Japanese candidate.
Japanese officials say they have been surprised by the opposition to Dr. Nakajima, adding that his adversaries had not even hinted at their objections in official statements at W.H.O. meetings and had offered only vague criticism in private discussions.
"This is all disinformation from your side," Mr. Kawai said in an interview.

 
 
Western Criticism Is in General Terms
 Western officials have couched their criticism in general terms. They accuse Dr. Nakajima of a lack of managerial acumen, leadership and vision, and an inability to communicate effectively. They say his autocratic style has alienated his staff and major donor countries at a time of crucial health challenges.
Japanese officials respond by saying one term is too short a time to judge Dr. Nakajima's performance and point out that two former directors of the organization, Dr. Marcolino Candau of Brazil and Dr. Halfdan Mahler of Denmark, served for 20 and 15 years respectively.
Dr. Nakajima, 63, is the 10th generation in his family to become a doctor. He studied psychiatry and pharmacology in Paris and did research there. Although his first wife, who died, was French and his second wife is American, critics say he is not fluent in either French or English and that his thoughts are difficult to follow.
As director general, Dr. Nakajima has traveled often; records show that he was away from Geneva 181 days in 1991 and 176 up to mid-November of this year.
To be an effective head of W.H.O., Dr. Nakajima said, he has to go to the countries to see what their problems are. The heads of other agencies travel even more than he does, he said.
United States officials said Dr. Nakajima has traveled to countries without notifying the appropriate regional directors. One official, Rose Belmont of the Health and Human Services Department's office of international affairs, for example, said Dr. Nakajima did not notify the regional director in Washington when he went to Peru after cholera broke out there.
Dr. Nakajima responded that regional directors often are absent because they are traveling on their own business, but Ms. Belmont called that "a pretty lame excuse" because a deputy regional director was usually present.

 
 
A Small Tempest Over Russian Icons
 One official trip in 1991, to the Soviet Union, created a public relations disaster for Dr. Nakajima over the way he handled later charges in the Soviet press that he had been detained when he tried to take six icons out of the country.
Dr. Nakajima, an art collector, said in one of two interviews that he had bought the icons at a flea market for about $150, in the presence of an official Russian guide who did not explain the need to fill out documents before he put them in his checked luggage in Moscow. The suitcase arrived a day later in Geneva without the icons.
Although Dr. Nakajima said he knew that the Russian newspaper articles were circulating at W.H.O. headquarters and reporters were inquiring about the incident, he did not offer an explanation through his public affairs office. Before reporting the incident in August, The New York Times made repeated calls to Dr. Nakajima, which were not returned.
Then, following a wave of adverse publicity, the agency issued a statement saying Russian custom officials had told the agency that Dr. Nakajima had not been detained at the airport and that they did not regard his action as an infringement of customs regulations.
A senior United States diplomat called the explanation muddy and said he believed the Russians, owing to their desperate need for international aid, were trying to avoid further embarrassment to Dr. Nakajima.
But Japanese officials say the charges of smuggling were groundless.
When asked about Japanese officials' attempts to have him re-elected, Dr. Nakajima dismissed any charges of bribery and said he knew little or nothing about the campaign.

 
 
Deputy Director Is Chief Opponent
 There are three other candidates, all from African nations, but Dr. Nakajima and Dr. Abelmoumene are considered the leading ones. United States officials became impressed with Dr. Abdelmoumene's administrative skills when he filled in for Dr. Nakajima during the Japanese director's absences, said John Bolton, an Assistant Secretary of State.
Dr. Abdelmoumene, 55, who once did research at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., said that if elected, he would work to improve harmony between headquarters and regional offices in seeking to fulfill the agency's goal of health for all. He said he would stay in Geneva more to help restore confidence in the organization's administrative ability.
United States officials have said made few public complaints about the way W.H.O. is run.
At a meeting of the organization earlier this year, James O. Mason, Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, asked whether it was "conceptually and organizationally prepared to provide the health leadership needed by the present changed world, or would it leave the task to other United Nations agencies that were initiating activities in the health field."
Ms. Belmont, of Health and Human Services, said Dr. Mason's comments were spurred by his lack of confidence in Dr. Nakajima's leadership. But Dr. Mason, who will cast the United States vote in the election, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.
Mr. Bolton of the State Department said he, Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan had met with Dr. Nakajima to discuss their criticisms. But in an interview at the United Nations, Dr. Nakajima denied receiving criticism from any United States official.
The representatives of 31 member nations are scheduled to vote by secret ballot on Jan. 20. The outcome is too close to call; but whatever the result, the dispute may damage W.H.O.
Japan, which is the second largest contributor to the agency after the United States, has hinted to American diplomats that it will reduce its contributions to both the agency and its health projects if Dr. Nakajima is not re-elected. After Dr. Nakajima's election, Japan increased its financial support, and its total contributions to this year through November were $57 million, up from $41 million in all of 1988. For comparable periods, the United States contribution rose to $125 million, from $94 million.

HEADLINE: Holiday Travel Has Industry Smiling

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Buoyed by the slowly improving economy, back-to-back long weekends and the growing popularity of winter vacations, more Americans are hitting the road this holiday season than any time since 1989. And they are not only taking to the highways in large numbers, but also to the skies, rails and oceans.
In the two weeks through Jan. 4, an estimated 33.7 million Americans will have driven at least 100 miles from home, 23 million will have flown on scheduled airlines and millions more will have taken buses and trains. 
 While those projections are 3 percent to 5 percent above last year's figures, the actual increases may exceed expectations and bring the travel industry back to where it had been when the bottom fell out in 1990 because of the recession and skyrocketing costs of aviation fuel.
"We forecast a 3 t0 4 percent increase in passengers this Thanksgiving over last," said Dave Swierenga, the chief economist of the Air Transport Association of America. "But the actual increase was on the order of 5 to 6 percent."
 
Favorable Barometers
 Many tourist destinations already report a surprising surge. In New York since the beginning of December, visits to the Empire State Building, a usually good barometer of tourist activity, have been running 12 percent higher than last year. Radio City Music Hall added two performances of its Christmas show this year, for a total of 179, and has sold out almost every show.
At Ford's Theater in Washington, a city enjoying a healthy resurgence of holiday visitors, most of the 58 scheduled performances of "A Christmas Carol" are sold out.
Travel experts say this holiday season has also benefited by the changing pattern of American travel. "The Christmas-New Year's season has become the heaviest travel period of the year," said Paul R. Verkuil, president of the American Automobile Association. "Prior to 1989, the Fourth of July holiday traditionally was the busiest."
While many travel officials caution that it is too early to break out the champagne, after two terrible years and after several false signs that recovery was imminent, some are nevertheless popping their buttons if not their corks.
"Every indication we have is that resorts, ski slopes and traditional resorts are filled," said Earlene Causey, the president of the American Society of Travel Agents. "And it's almost already too late to book the most desirable cabins on cruise ships for this time next year."
 
Full Planes and Hotels
 Some airlines also report near-capacity bookings to popular vacation spots. "All seven of our daily flights from the mainland to Hawaii are filled, and we're flying wide-body planes," said Jim Faulkner of Northwest Airlines. "And if you don't already have a reservation, you can't get in or out of Florida on most days because planes are just packed."
In Little Rock, Ark., to which tourists and politicians have been flocking since Bill Clinton's election as President, hotel occupancy is way up; the Hilton Inn reports that bookings are up 63 percent this month over the same period last year
Many theme parks and resort hotels also expect to do a brisk business for at least part of the holiday season. And while this time of year a visitor could hit the jackpot in Las Vegas and be virtually alone, "after Christmas Day the town is riotous, with so many people flocking here to celebrate New Year's Eve," said Myram Borders of the Las Vegas news bureau.
In a nation that offers something for every taste, it is hardly surprising that some people plan to spend the holidays volunteering in soup kitchens, others climbing mountains and still others running marathons or in religious contemplation. At least 20 Americans will be among the 100 revelers who have paid $9,000 each to celebrate New Year's Eve twice -- once in Shannon, Ireland, then again in Bermuda, after a flight across the Atlantic in the Concorde.
 
Time for Family and Friends
 But for Americans of all faiths, the holiday season remains a time of reunion with family and friends, even on ski slopes and cruises. On Tuesday, when the Crown Odyssey sets sail from San Francisco for a 12-day tour and another Royal Cruise Line ship, the Odyssey, sails from Los Angeles on a similar journey, many of the total 1,750 passengers will include not just the usual parents and children but extended families with grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.
As usual, millions of the season's travelers will be college students heading home. "Most of those I talk to want to go home to reconnect with family and friends," said the Rev. David O'Malley, the campus minister of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. "It's part of the spiritual nature of being human."
Another traveler who wanted to spend the holidays with her family was Gladys Finnestad, an 81-year-old widow from Streator, Ill. Waiting patiently at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for her flight to Savannah, Ga., on Friday, Mrs. Finnestad said she had saved all year for the visit with her grandson's family.
"Last year I couldn't afford it," she said. "This year I put away some of my Social Security money. What better way to spend it?"
At Kennedy International Airport in New York that day, Steve Meller of Oak Ridge, N.J., and his wife, Leora, and their almost-2-year-old son, Zachary, were traveling to Aruba with Mrs. Meller's mother, Molly Kalomeer. This will be the family's second Christmas in Aruba, where Mrs. Kalomeer bought a time-share in an apartment.
"I bought the time-share so we could spend the holiday together with the whole family," Mrs. Kalomeer said. "It's a special time."
Midnight Mass at the San Xavier del Bac mission church in southern Arizona is reserved for the Papago Indians, who have worshipped there for 200 years. "But visitors are welcome at the other Masses," said Father Justin, a Franciscan priest at the church on the Papago reservation, "and they usually come in droves."
 
Disrupted by Uncle Sam
 Inevitably, in a country where one in every two marriages ends in divorce, reconnecting with family increasingly means not just with parents, brothers and sisters, but with step-parents, step-brothers and step-sisters -- often in different cities, sometimes at opposite ends of the country.
Ginger Croche, who works for the American Bus Association in Washington, is going back to her native Mississippi this holiday to visit step-children and step-grandchildren in Meridian, then on to see her parents and relatives in Jackson. "On Christmas Day we always have about 25 people at my aunt's house in Jackson," she said.
For the second time in two years, many families' holidays are being disrupted by major American military deployments overseas.
Angie Steele of Oceanside, Calif., had expected to spend Christmas and New Year's with her three young children and her husband, David. But on Dec. 9, two days before the Steeles' 10th wedding anniversary, Second Lieut. David Steele of the Marine Corps shipped out for Somalia.
"When we found out he was going, we put up a tree real quick and held our Christmas celebration then," Mrs. Steele said.
 
Ties to the Old Country
 Some Americans are returning to the old country for the holidays. For the first time in 22 years, Donal McSullivan, the head of a marketing company in New York, will spend Christmas in his native Dublin, taking his wife and young son with him.
But holiday travel is not without its dark side. Baggage theft, pickpocketing and other crimes increase at airports, bus stations and railroad depots. And highway accidents increase, often because of excess speed combined with alcohol from holiday festivities.
But drunken driving is declining nationwide, and in some places dramatically. In Ohio, for example, alcohol-related traffic deaths have fallen each of the last five years, to 36 percent of total highway deaths last year from 44.9 percent in 1989.
"It's never any fun writing a traffic ticket during the holidays," said Trooper Mark Warner, who will be monitoring Interstate 70 west of Columbus, Ohio, on Christmas Day for the State Highway Patrol. "But you think of your own kids and family, and you want those drivers to get where they're going safely."

HEADLINE: Isuzu to Stop Manufacturing Passenger Cars

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 19

 BODY:
In a development that only a few years ago might have seemed unimaginable, one of Japan's automobile companies said today that it would give up production of passenger cars.
The announcement by Isuzu Motors Ltd., which once achieved popularity in the United States with commercials featuring a lying salesman, reflects the hard times that have befallen Japan's automobile industry. 
The move is also part of a new discipline being imposed on companies in many industries as a result of Japan's severe economic slump. With money tight and profits slim, companies that once tried to match competitors in all areas are having to jettison unprofitable products.
"Clearly, we want to focus the organization on our core products," said Donald T. Sullivan, an executive vice president of Isuzu, which is suffering heavy losses. He was sent to help Isuzu by General Motors Corporation, which owns about 37 percent of the company.
For Isuzu, that means focusing on trucks, recreational vehicles and diesel engines.
Isuzu's decision, which had long been rumored, reduces the number of Japanese car manufacturers to eight.
Isuzu makes only one model of car, a compact called the Gemini in Japan. Variations are sold in the United States as the Isuzu Stylus and Impulse and also by General Motors as the Geo Storm. Sales and production have been dropping for several years, and this year the company is estimated to have produced only 90,000 cars, most of which went to General Motors.
"You can't be in the car business with one platform and one product," Mr. Sullivan said.
Despite the economic wisdom of quitting car production, he said "it was a very difficult decision."
Isuzu said it would continue to sell some cars in Japan. But it plans to buy a compact car known as the Domani from Honda Motor Company and resell it under the Isuzu name.
American dealers, however, will not be supplied with cars and will concentrate on selling sport utility vehicles like the Rodeo and Trooper. General Motors told the Reuters news service that it would find a replacement for the Geo Storm from another supplier for the 1996 model year but that it would not offer a Storm model in 1994 and 1995.
In return for getting cars from Honda, Isuzu has tentatively agreed to supply Honda with its Rodeo, which is made at a factory in Lafayette, Ind., owned partly by Isuzu. Honda will resell the Rodeo under its own name in the United States starting in January 1994 and will also consider importing the cars to Japan.
"By exchanging products, both sides will benefit," said Yoshihide Munekuni, executive vice president of Honda.
Such ties between manufacturers are also becoming commonplace. "You have to try to cover as much ground with as few resources as possible," said Peter Boardman, an auto industry analyst with UBS Phillips & Drew in Tokyo.
After years of rapid growth and growing competitiveness that made Japan's automobile industry the envy of the world, car sales in Japan have fallen for two years in a row, and political factors prevent companies from exporting as much as they once did. All the companies have seen their profits slashed dramatically and some, including Nissan, the second largest automaker, are suffering losses.
With slower growth and a depressed stock market that makes it hard to raise money, Japanese manufacturers are focusing their efforts more. Toshiba, the electronics maker, is dropping out of audio products, and some of the consumer electronics companies, like Sanyo and Matsushita, are pulling out of the expensive race to develop computer memory chips.
"The one thing about Japanese companies is that if one company does something and does it well, all the companies follow," said Hiroyuki Mizuno, executive vice president of Matsushita. "We're not going to do stupid things like that."
Analysts have long wondered how Japan could support nine car manufacturers. But as long as the market was growing, the companies could hang on.

HEADLINE: Blacks and Jews on the Relationship: What's Special, What's Myth?

 BODY:
Sixteen months after racial unrest in Crown Heights, black and Jewish New Yorkers are discussing what brings them together and what pulls them apart.
Recently, a group of 14 people -- seven black and seven Jewish -- sat down at The New York Times and asked themselves some hard questions. Is there a natural alliance between blacks and Jews and is that relationship in jeopardy? Is there anti-Semitism among blacks and racism among Jews, and what can be done to heal it? 
 The dialogue was set in motion by an ugly chain of events that began in Crown Heights in August 1991, when a car driven a Hasidic Jew accidently struck and killed a black child, Gavin Cato. Hours later, in apparent retaliation, a group of black youths surrounded and stabbed a Hasidic scholar, Yankel Rosenbaum, who later died.
The late October acquittal of Lemrick Nelson Jr., a 17-year-old black youth accused of being Mr. Rosenbaum's killer, set off seven weeks of bitter criticism of the Mayor by some Jewish New Yorkers, who felt the Mayor should have denounced the verdict.
Many blacks in Crown Heights, meanwhile, accused the city government of pandering to the Hasidim.
On Thursday, 1,200 black and Jewish leaders gathered at the Apollo Theater in Harlem to watch a documentary on the black soldiers who liberated Jews from Nazi concentration camps. At the end, the leaders held hands, wept and vowed to put their differences behind them.
Whether that can happen was at the heart of The Times's round-table discussion. The following was taken from the transcript of the conversations with two reporters, Michael T. Kaufman and Felicia R. Lee.
ALICE FIXX In the beginning is the notion of whether there is a specific problem between blacks and Jews. I mean, I am well aware from the paper about the problems in Crown Heights, but my life is isolated from that. My work and my life are in Manhattan. . . . I couldn't honestly say that I felt that there was specific friction between blacks and whites other than in neighborhoods where there were large pockets of either group, especially the Crown Heights section.
It seems to me, in my environment, that any conflict, sub rosa or on the surface, is between whites and blacks, and not Jews and blacks.
RICHARD BREGMAN For me, the question is almost presumptuous. It assumes, it presupposes that there are certain, I don't know, diplomatic relations between Jews and blacks.
Q. Like two nations almost.
MR. BREGMAN: That's right. And envoys and diplomatic things. . . I never thought that there were special relations between Jews and anyone, blacks and anyone. I understand the sort of perception that's around from a Jewish standpoint that, you know, Jews are persecuted people historically, and blacks also in this country and elsewhere are oppressed, persecuted. And there's a -- a what? -- an identification, an empathy there. But I never understood there to be anything special between blacks and Jews that had gone awry particularly.
RABBI DAVID LAZERSON: Several months ago, another colleague of mine who is involved with the project here, Richard Green, from the Youth Collective, we were invited out to Stony Brook. It was one of the first times in the history of the school that they had an evening sponsored together by the Black Student Union and the Jewish Student Union. And they wanted us to speak about some of our efforts in Crown Heights, and where we saw the problems, and where we saw our successes. . . .
On the same panel was Amiri Baraka And I sat next to him . . . And, to my surprise, we found ourselves nodding our heads to each other's statements pretty much throughout the whole evening.
And he said a statement which perhaps crystallized a feeling that I have had, but was always maybe afraid to verbalize it. Was that, sure, we have our different cultures and we have our own unique sense of heritage and where we've come from, but there's -- and something you alluded to -- there's a lot more that unites us than divides us.
And what he said was it's almost as if the real powers that be in the media and in the country, it's almost as if they have a divide and conquer mentality. Like, "Let's keep these two very powerful minority groups apart. Because, you know, if they get their act together and sort of unify in ways that we have in certainly earlier times . . . " -- So, if we got our act together in that sense, we could perhaps make some serious changes that some people don't want us to make."
HENRY RICE I grew up in Crown Heights . . . Things are blown up now. But before, what people don't realize that you had a group of black kids that would run down to Kingston Avenue on Halloween and throw eggs at the Jewish kids. And then the Jewish kids would run into the black community and do the same thing back. And this rivalry, it was like, "I don't know anything about you, you don't know anything about me. We're different, we don't speak to each other. So, therefore, you're my enemy." . . ."
What I'm saying is that there have been numerous incidences of bias-related attacks happening in Crown Heights. They just never got the media like this one has. And there have been people in the community trying to express this for years and years, it's like a pot, and it just finally boiled over.
MOE FONER There are problems that go back a long time between whites and Jews and between blacks and Jews. And when I was a kid growing up in Williamsburg, I remember that Italian kids would come in on Halloween and beat the hell out of us. And we would not be seen -- we were told to stay off the street. . . .
I believe that fundamental to all of this is economics. That what exists here and in the city, and that it affects black people, but particularly is the economics of injustice. It's what Jonathan Kozol calls "the savage inequality." And I think that that's what got black people angry and bitter. And it's taken out in various ways.
I think that Crown Heights is a particular, peculiar kind of situation because of the -- first of all, it's a very small community, it's a very tight space. You have the Hasidim, a fundamentalist group who stay together very tight. And there are many problems that stem from that kind of relation. . . .
I believe that this situation that has developed from the Crown Heights situation is made to order for Rudolph Giuliani and for Andy Stein. . . . And they will continue to work on it for all it's worth. Because it is the only way that they can get through, is by dividing the constituency that has been supportive of Dinkins.
RABBI MICHAEL PALEY: I think there are a lot of Jews struggling with their identity. I think there are a lot of blacks struggling with their identity. I think the Afrocentric movement among black students is a movement of pointing fingers to people that oppressed them. Fair enough. Fair enough.
 
. . .
 But the Lubavitch Hasidim, who have been murdered and cowed and finally gassed, in this century, to an extraordinary, obscene number, all of a sudden they say, "This is America, and we're strong. And we have big shoulders and we're going to push back." And that, in some ways, you know, that moment has provided a liberating moment for Hasidim. Because they say, "We can stand up and we can yell at the Mayor of New York City and make him pay attention to us."
 
. . .
PAULA CARLOTTI: Is it blacks and Jews? Or is it blacks and whites? I think that certainly Jews have the advantage of being able to cash in on being white whenever they're in a situation of power or when they're being challenged.
RABBI PALEY: But 50 years after Hitler, I'm damned if I'm going to be called white.
MS. CARLOTTI: Well, then you're -- I think that's an individual opinion.
RABBI PALEY: I mean, I don't care if you call me white. Why not? I am not the problem.
MS. CARLOTTI: It doesn't really matter whether you are calling yourself white or whether you can cash in on being white.
RABBI PALEY: Why not? I like those chances.
MS. CARLOTTI: Most black people don't often have the opportunity to cash in . . . What I would say is that black people are the most discriminated-against group . . . I think they are by so far and away more clearly discriminated against than any group, and certainly more so than any group that can cash in on being white. That whenever they find themselves in conflict or in competition with any group, be they Italian, German, Jewish, that they will have less access to the things that you said are the most important, housing, cleanliness, safety, protection.
And this Crown Heights situation, the group happened to have been Jews. I grew up on the Lower East Side and went to the public schools there when the conflict then was control of the Community School Board, therefore, control of jobs in that community. And, more importantly, control of the programs that were to educate the children and secure their futures.
 
. . .
 So I, being a person who grew up in a family who was very involved in the Civil Rights movement and would never allow us to speak of Jews, or allow us to feel hatred towards any group of people, and particularly not towards Jews, the people with whom we were in conflict were Jewish people. I really believe they were white people who happened to have been Jewish people in that neighborhood . . . My experience is that I don't believe that blacks hate Jews. I believe they have conflict with the whites.
MILDRED SCOTT: What we are talking about is power, raw power. We are talking about the services. And since they think . . . -- the Hasidim -- that they are going to get less of the loaf, this is what the whole thing is about. . . .
KEVIN SMYLEY: My point is, the frustration is not necessarily at the Hasidim . . . but it's what they have been able to get and we can't. What's it like living under that frustration? . . .
VERNA HOBSON: I wanted to take it away a little bit from the Lubavitchers and Crown Heights . . . Back even to historically . . . when it was fine to have attitudes, to mistreat, to abuse, to enslave blacks. Until a time when laws were passed, which hasn't been too long ago, where it was no longer acceptable or allowed to do that. With that, people started to change not necessarily their feelings, but what they found acceptable to show . . . And, so, it became unpopular to be racist. . . .
But . . . in the last 10, 15 years or so . . . things started to shift back. People's feelings started to emerge, and they started to become acceptable to have racist feelings. . . .
Bonds that we thought that we had with groups, we began to see maybe we're not really quite there as we struggled for our identities as blacks. There became competitions; there became struggles. . . . Somewhere in the last 10 or 12 years, I began to sense that something was going wrong. . . .
Maybe there was some confusion going on within Jews and their struggles for their identities . . . And some of it was, I think, that some of them were beginning to feel that they were now perhaps becoming white enough not to be thought of as Jews, as far as being segregated against or put into a negative basket as Jews. And with that, they started feeling that it then allowed them the freedom to have attitudes against blacks that they never wanted to admit that they had before.
MS. BACK: What goes on in Crown Heights is deeply disturbing to me, but I personally do not bond with those Jews in Crown Heights. I don't bond with many Jews in mainstream organizations. I've had to form and participate in the formation of other sorts of Jewish organizations that would represent my personal political concerns, as well as my world view, my social vision. . . .
I understand that we're talking about multiple communities. That it has never been a monolithic Jewish community, it has never been a monolithic African-American community. And those communities have been diverse because of class within those communities, because of ethnicity and color in those communities, because of religion in those communities, and because of a whole other assortment of reasons.
Q. What's the bottom line?
MS. BACK: What I mean is that race and racism is the bottom line in this country that separates and divides people.
RODNEY CRUMP: The challenges against black people are coming a great deal from Jewish people.
Q. Why do you think that is?
MR. CRUMP: The issue of anti-Semitism, and defining anti-Semitism, some of our greatest scholars, Dr. Skip Gates and Cornel West, have had to speak on this issue. And they've spoke about black anti-Semitism. But no one ever talks about Jewish racism. No one ever talks about white racism and the historical implications of that. . . .
 
. . .
 We have competing agendas here, and you expect me to separate from my leaders or people who have done wonderful things for my community and say, "No, to hell with them." Just because Jesse Jackson says Hymietown, he's no longer acceptable. Just because Louis Farrakhan does this, he's no longer acceptable. And that's a problem.
FRAN HANDMAN: I think it's fascinating now that Jews have become the enemy for blacks. I mean, Malcolm X was not killed by a Jew. . . . The Panthers were not killed by Jews. The FBI, the CIA went after Malcolm X. Martin Luther King was not killed by Jews. And the Jew -- if you decide that the Jew is your enemy, you're being sucked in just the way the people in South Africa --
MR. CRUMP: No, I'm not saying that the Jews are my enemy. . . .
MS. FIXX: Would you not agree that there's been a very strong anti Israeli feeling amongst Afro- Americans coming out?
MR. CRUMP: Why is there anti-Israeli feeling? Israel has a historic relationship in supporting South Africa. And supporting South Africa, that is a big problem.
Q. What suggestions do we have to make things better?
ROSCOE BROWN JR.: I think we've already had one in terms of the Jewish community at large indicating to the Hasidic community that some of the privilege may have to be resolved in some fairer way than they are now being resolved. As overall context -- I think all of us need to stop romanticizing the fact that there's been such a close relationship between blacks and Jews over the past thirty years and recognize like all people that we have worked together and do work together on occasion . . . But that it isn't just an automatic relationship between blacks and Jews.
Secondly, I think that Jews should desist as much as possible from labeling every black who disagrees with them as anti-Semitic . . . Thirdly, I think we have to recognize that the present crisis is very much fueled by the political fire . . . Some people in the political field will use any type of conflict to suggest that the Mayor who ran on a platform of bringing people together is not effective. And I think we are not to fall into that trap of accusing either the Jewish community, the black community of being anti-this or anti-that and then going to politicians who will then get up and say, "And, see, I can tell you that this man is that way." And, finally, I think that we need to continue dialogue.
MS. HOBSON: I would like to hope that we can ask of our leaders that when we see our group committing wrongs against other groups, we can have the daring and the reasonableness and the fairness to speak out and not only when we feel our group is being wronged against.
MS. BACK: This has been a discussion about difference and we shouldn't be afraid of that and we shouldn't be afraid of separatism, because there are times when we need separatism and concurrently we also need coalition and cooperation and co-sponsored whatevers.
But we shouldn't be afraid of that in the same way that we shouldn't be afraid of the kind of frank conversation we had tonight, where we threw out words like power and like race and like the privilege of whiteness . . . I'm not so sure we all agreed in this room about even using those terms. I'm not so sure there wasn't in fact a lot of resistance to some of those terms. But those are the terms that have to be used again and again and again in every setting. You know, in the Mayor's office and in the classroom. At your police precinct meetings and, you know, obviously at your student union meetings . . .
Let us not romanticize the past. That has been I think one of our biggest downfalls, is that we've romanticized in the past of the relations between blacks and Jews. At the same time let's look for inspiration from the past. Because we certainly have inspiring moments to look towards. We certainly have inspiring leaders and we need those. We saw that when we brought in 6,000 school kids, public school kids to this exhibition at the Jewish Museum. We saw how they so much wanted to find some models, some inspiration.
RABBI PALEY: It seems to me right now the people that are suffering the most are the black communities and that to work against oppression is an important thing and the critical thing and that both communities should unite on that.
MS. CARLOTTI: I have always found Jews to just be more compassionate human beings than other whites. In other words, they have been less white than other whites. No, I mean that seriously because I think that's the only thing that white really means. I mean, it doesn't mean Italian or Irish; it means your ability to oppress other people. And I don't think this conversation would have been possible with a community from Bensonhurst. I think because in that instance the history is a history of hate. And maybe because those people don't have the same degree or the same experience of oppression as Jewish people have, dialogue often involves them hiding their expression of hate. And I don't find that to be the problem when there's dialogue with Jewish people.
MR. CRUMP: The issue of race in this country especially has not developed its own vocabulary that we can all use. However, I think that it's important that we all express ourselves honestly and understand that interpretations oftentimes lie within our own preconceived notions and intuitions about what people are saying . . . We have to listen to everyone, including the dull and the ignorant. You just have to do that. You have to go see Mordecai Levy, yes; you have to go see Al Sharpton, yes; you have to go see all of these different people and all the different perspectives . . . In difference there is some type of solidarity. We can agree to disagree and do so respectfully . . . It's just a matter of being a human being who cares about other human beings, period.
MS. HANDMAN: I was out with a friend of mine, a black friend the other day and she was saying she doesn't know what her name is because she didn't know where her name came from. I know what my name is. I know what my grandfather's name and great grandfather because I can go back. She can't go back and it's a great loss to her. And there are sensitive areas that are specific and particular to certain people. And when you listen, when you make a relationship you have to listen very carefully and you have to respond to what's happening with somebody else and not impose who you are and your value system on what they want. . . .
What I'm talking is about the sensitivities that things that touch nerves, real honest nerves in people of different backgrounds and so on and that when you want to make that bridge from one person to the next or one group to the next, you have to know what that nerve is. It isn't superficial things necessarily that seem very apparent, but they are things that are so close to the hearts of the people that you're talking to and they're not your values necessary, you have to listen and you have to respond. And that's I think how it's going to happen.

HEADLINE: Life in Brooklyn's Forgotten Section;
In Red Hook, 3-Year-Olds Hear Gunfire and Duck for Cover

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Carmen Cruz stood silently alongside the worn and windswept patch of dirt and grass that cut through the mall in the center of the Red Hook Houses, just steps from where Patrick Daly lay mortally wounded the day before. Her friend Elizabeth Gonzalez crouched by a small wooden fence post, pounding a nail into an index card that would become part of the flower-strewn memorial to the grade school principal they and their children had known, loved and ultimately grieved for in the quarter-century he walked among them.
"You was an angel," the card read. "Now get your wings." 
 Ms. Cruz wondered if the time had come for her to fly away, too. She has lived in the same apartment in the Red Hook Houses for half her 41 years, raising four children in the shadow of violence and far from the eye of the rest of the city. She tried to start anew in Texas this summer but returned discouraged after three months in which she alternated between low wages and no wages.
"I came back here because it is the only place I have," said Ms. Cruz, who hopes to get a job in social services after completing a job training program. "Now my kids want to leave again after this tragedy. They're scared to come out. They're even scared to be in the house because of the shots."
Fear, drugs and guns have been part of the Red Hook landscape as much as the towering rows of red-brick apartment towers that line the housing project mall where on Thursday morning Mr. Daly walked into what the police say was the crossfire between rival drug dealers.
Such gunplay is common in the project. But residents remember when it wasn't so, and they remember Mr. Daly as someone who reminded them that the future held promise even for children whose early education includes lessons in ducking for cover.
Now, with Mr. Daly's death, some residents wonder if their community will ever be free of the armed urban terrorists whose numbers are small but whose violence has drastically altered the daily rhythms of the hard-working families and single mothers trying to raise their children. Others, retired from work or finished with raising their families are now talking about leaving.
"I'm going to go so far from here there ain't no coming back," said R. M. Jones, who prides herself on singlehandedly seeing her two daughters through school and helping keep crime out of her building through her work in a tenant patrol. Now, she does not call the police when she spots an intruder or hears a burst of gunfire because she fears retaliation from drug dealers. As soon as her 17-year-old daughter finishes high school, she plans to move from the city, which she feels has ignored the community that sits, cut off from the rest of Brooklyn by the Gowanus Canal, on a spit of land that juts into New York Harbor.
"I'm putting my mother on my back and taking her with me," she said. "This place is sinful. There's a lot of good people here. Tax-dollar-paying people. We deserve better."
The Red Hook Houses, among the largest public housing complexes in the nation, dominates much of the area, which once bustled with rough and tumble activity along its ports and piers. Vestiges of that world can still be found along the waterfront, where cobblestoned streets run past blocks of uneven slate sidewalks and clumps of dry, brown weeds. Other corners of the community, past the projects, are dotted with brick row houses, and three-story apartment buildings are home to old-time Italian and Irish residents.
 
Steady Decline
 The community is ethnically mixed and free of the racial strife that has riven other parts of the borough. It is the kind of place where those who have lived there a decade are still "new people" to other residents.
It is hard to escape the looming cluster of the buildings in the housing project, many of which are six stories tall, where first-floor windows are secured with child guards on the outside and iron gates inside. Some 10,000 people -- at least 40 percent of them in poverty -- live in the housing projects, nearly 40 percent of them under 18 years of age. There are almost equal numbers of black and Hispanic residents, who account for about 90 percent of the housing project's population.
Longtime residents lament the steady decline of their neighborhood, which while always gritty, became deadly with the advent of crack and its enforcers about a decade ago. The place was so orderly that parents would be warned by management if their children rode their bikes down the wide walkways and square plazas.
"The halls used to be spick and span," said a 58-year-old woman who has lived there since 1962 with her husband, a Transit Authority employee, and their three children. "If anybody got in trouble, they'd throw you out. Maintenance would come in 15 minutes. Now it takes five or six days to get anything fixed."
 
Dealers on Patrol
 The woman, who would not give her full name, recalled how years ago her youngest son, who is now in college, romped outside, while she could leave her apartment door wide open.
"Before you didn't have no crime," she said. "Now, I got three locks on my door and gates on my windows."
Eduardo Colon, 14, who lives a few blocks away from the projects, said some youths didn't take seriously the impact of the violence. "People laugh when somebody gets killed," he said. "It's a big joke."
He worried that the drug dealers were killing off the good people, like Mr. Daly.
A dog barked in the distance.
"Even the dogs hate people here."
Where children once played, drug dealers now stand, controlling the wide public spaces whose sidewalks and plazas between buildings are up for grabs. Inside, too.
"They sell in buildings and they don't care if you got kids around," said Eric Smith, a 32-year-old man who has lived in the projects much of his life. He walked down one of the many paths that snake through the projects, cradling his infant daughter. "They got control around here."
The powerless stay inside.
A woman who said she worked in the guidance department at Public School 15, said she rues the day six years ago she moved into the Red Hook Houses, after a fire drove her and her son from their apartment in the High Bridge section of the Bronx. The woman, who would not give her full name, said she had been assaulted once by a woman who clubbed her with a hunk of free cheese when she thought she had jumped a food distribution line. Her son, who was taunted by a local girl, has few friends in the neighborhood. Besides, she said, they venture to other parts of Brooklyn when they want to divert themselves with a movie or other entertainment.
"I'm not used to living like this," she said as she walked her dog, a small, scruffy mutt she got for protection. "If you're not on drugs, you're not one of them, so you have to isolate yourself. I like to be friendly, but you get hurt by people. It's not a healthy way of life."
Young people know they have been denied the chance to do a lot of things that others their age take for granted.
 
Children in Hiding
 "I don't go outside; it's ridiculous," said an 18-year-old who declined to give her name. "There's nothing for us to do." She worried most about those still growing up, diving for cover when they hear gunshots outside.
"How can you raise a child that way?" she said. "A 3-year-old hears a shot and hides behind a couch -- and they live on the third floor?"
Yet children are raised, and some succeed despite the obstacles. "A lot of people are fighting, are going to school," said William Green, the administrator of the South Brooklyn Health Center. "Our pediatric population is the best-taken-care-of population we see. They're well nourished, well dressed and cared for by their parents."
The Rev. John Waldron, the sole priest and pastor of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Roman Catholic Church, said that in some parts of the projects, tenants had organized effective associations that have kept thier buildings from tumbling into chaos. And while the face of crime is getting discouragingly younger, he knows of youths who are going on to college and good jobs.
Needs remain, and he would like to transform his parish's old grammar school building, which was closed in 1975, into a community center, adding to a small core of centers that cater to the youths in the area.
The important thing, he said, is to fight the apathy that can sink in when living in a community that is physically -- if not psychically -- severed from the rest of the borough. "There's a feeling of being overlooked and neglected," he said. "You start to accept whatever comes your way."
But there have been encouraging signs, he said. Residents successfully blocked the construction of a sewage disposal plant this year, and there is new economic life along the waterfront, holding out the promise of jobs in an area where those who work often have to spend their first hour's wages on fares to get to work in Manhattan.
"I'm a person of hope," he said. "I still see enough hope to think it has to get better."
The Housing Authority police said that violent crime in the Red Hook Houses has been decreasing in recent years, and that there have been only two murders this year, compared with six the previous year. Residents and those who work in the area say crime may be down, but guns and drugs are not.
"I don't think they're counting the amount of gunfire," Mr. Green said. People don't report hearing a gun being fired."
 
Lives in Danger
 He added that since Mr. Daly's death on Thursday, residents have begun circulating a petition asking state lawmakers to stiffen the penalties for possessing and and firing guns. "There has got to be some concept that not only will you get arrested for having one," Mr. Green said, "but you are endangering the lives of thousands of people in the projects."
A few blocks away on Van Brunt Street, few shops remain along blocks that once brimmed with bakeries, barbershops and other stores. But not all trace its initial downfall to the advent of crack.
Andy Massaro was born in Red Hook 63 years ago, once worked on the piers as a longshoreman for the Barber Line and now owns a cluttered toy shop known to all as Skinny's, for the name that most people use for him.
"What happened here is during the war everybody went into defense and they made big bucks," he said. "When they made big bucks, they left to Staten Island and left us with all the garbage."
Despite his tough words, he dotes on an 8-year-old girl who wants to buy one of the many toys he purchases in damaged condition and repairs for sale at a discount. Children aren't born bad, he said, but something happens along the way -- he's seen it happen to his son, who he said nearly wiped him out with a crack habit.
The street outside his store was dark and nearly deserted when Cathy, a red-haired bundle of nerves, swept into his store and asked for a dollar. She used to work for the post office, but resigned after 20 years, she said. She used to have a house down the block, she said, but she lost it after years of using it as a shooting gallery where she and her friends used heroin. She lives on the streets now, walking countless times each day by her old house, which stands boarded up and empty.
"She tried to commit suicide four or five times," said Mr. Massaro after he gave her a dollar. "But God don't want her."
He said that although he didn't venture outside at night, he didn't feel like a prisoner. "The people in the projects, they're trapped," he said.
Another man ducked his head into his store, seeking a handout. Mr. Massaro waved him off.
"Satan himself is walking the earth," he said. "These kids' souls are taken."

HEADLINE: Cutting Fiscal Corners in Trenton

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
For the last 11 months New Jersey's administration and lawmakers have been using a new and largely subterranean system of deficit financing to keep the government running, tapping into billions of dollars worth of bonding authority and pension funds -- all the while avoiding the dreaded word "taxes."
In the process, they have sidestepped both the requirement for a public vote for capital bond issues and prohibitions against unbalanced budgets and the use of bond money for general operations. 
 For the most part, despite some grumbling about "one-shot gimmicks" and "quick fixes," the fiscal maneuvering has the tacit support of both both the Democratic administration and the Republican Legislature.
Just this week, for example, Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, signed a new bond issue bill that was approved by a joint committee of both houses of the Legislature, which are controlled by Republicans.
 
Lonely but Outspoken Critic
 The Senate minority leader, John A. Lynch, is a lonely but outspoken critic of not only the bond bill but the new drift of state finances in general.
"A single gimmick here and there may not be bad in the scheme of things," Mr. Lynch said in an interview. "But three and a half billion dollars in 11 months is disastrous."
Mr. Lynch was referring to a series of fiscal maneuvers since January, when the Republicans took control of both houses of the Legislature, including these measures:
 
'Inadvisable,' U.S. Says
 *The method of valuing the state's public employee pension funds was changed to allow the state to cut its contribution to those funds. Public employee unions angrily protested the shift. The United States Department of Labor called it "inadvisable" -- and hinted that it might be illegal -- but the change put nearly $1.2 billion into the badly imbalanced budget coffers.
*Last month, legislative leaders and Florio administration officials agreed on a health care plan for the uninsured that will siphon $1.6 billion out of the state's unemployment insurance fund into the new health care fund over the next three years. When the administration of Gov. Thomas H. Kean tried to do the same thing three years ago, with considerably less money, $100 million, the Federal Government declared the whole thing illegal and forced the state government to pay back the money, plus $35 million interest. This time, the shift was done by a more circuitous route to create at least the appearance of propriety. The Federal Government has not publicly commented.
*This week, the Legislature unveiled yet another plan that would divert $357 million over the next two years from the state's Transportation Trust Fund to pay for other state operations. The diversion, accomplished by "de-appropriating" -- removing from the budget -- the state's contribution to the fund will mean the fund will have to issue yet more bonds to complete its capital program.
*Then there was the new borrowing approved this week, described as "refinancing" to take advantage of current lower interest rates. In fact it is mostly new debt, coupled with a modest chunk of genuine refinancing to make it possible to call the whole thing refinancing. That was done to allow the whole package, including the new borrowing, to be done under the cloak of the Refunding Bond Act of 1985, which gave the state broad authority to refinance bonds to take advantage of favorable changes in interest rates.
 
Like a 2d Mortgage
 The principle is roughly equivalent to refinancing a home mortgage to get the lower interest rate. But in this case, the state also took out what amounted to a huge second mortgage, and plans to use part of that to pay old debts and interest.
What the state is in fact doing is refinancing $700 million of old debt at newer, more attractive rates, then borrowing an additional $912 million in new money.
The new money will finance new building projects like bridges and hospitals, but part of it, $335 million, will be set aside to pay existing bond debts. That means that the state is borrowing money to pay the interest and principal on its existing debt. And it is issuing new bonds without a popular vote of approval in a general election as would be normally required by law for such a bond issue.
In addition, the use of the newly borrowed money to make the existing bond payments makes it possible to transfer the $335 million that would normally be used to pay off the bond debt into the general fund and to a so-called "rainy day fund" for fiscal emergencies. Labeled as "surplus," it will be used however the Governor and Legislature ultimately choose.
 
Selling Highway to Itself
 The fiscal shuffling actually began two years ago, when the state sold part of Interstate 95 to itself. The transfer back to its own turnpike authority cost the authority $400 million. The exchange was made because the turnpike had $400 million in bonding authority the state's general fund didn't have.
In signing the legislation enabling the $1.6 billion bond revision and new issue, the Governor applauded the Legislature for its "willingness to put politics aside for the benefit of New Jersey."
Senator Lynch describes the fiscal maneuvering "nothing more than gimmicks and raids that doesn't include the more than $30 million in fee increases to plug gaps" in the budget.
The Legislature has been working to close the budget gap by raising various fees and imposing new ones. The state's hospital admission fee, for example, was raised to get $1 million more in revenue; the co-payment that the elderly, the indigent and Medicaid recipients make for prescription drugs was raised to $5 from $2, which raised about $16 million, and a similar increase in the prescription drug fee for state employees raised another $3 million.
All told, the various fee increases written into the new budget produced about $24 million in new revenues to replace those eliminated by the cut in the state sales tax to 6 percent from 7 percent.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Hardball Isn't New To Top Negotiator

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH

 BODY:
Sonny Hall, the president of New York City's 37,000-member Transport Workers Union, does not profess to know about the inner workings of major league baseball's labor-management relations. But Hall is not at all surprised that as new negotiations approach, some very new twists are about to be introduced to some age-old baseball arguments.
Revenue sharing. Revenue participation. Salary cap. 
 "That doesn't surprise me at all," Hall said of the landmark goals. "That sounds like Dick," he added, and laughed.
 
Peace Is Priority
 Dick, to those unfamiliar, is Richard Ravitch, former head of New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, architect of the revitalization of the Urban Development Corporation and the Bowery Savings Bank, former mayoral candidate and now the point man on labor for baseball's 28 owners.
Two weeks ago, Ravitch, president of the Player Relations Committee, the owners' bargaining arm, announced that the owners had decided to reopen the basic labor agreement with the players union, albeit by a slim 15-13 vote. The task at hand now, for both Ravitch and the union representatives, is to find a way to win the peace before another war breaks out in the form of a strike or a lockout. Ominously, it is something neither side has been able to avoid in seven consecutive sets of negotiations.
To try to reverse history, Ravitch will try to alter the staid approach to business that many in management, including Ravitch, insist has brought small-market teams to the precipice. And, as Hall pointed out, it is not the first time Ravitch has tried to buck overwhelming odds.
As chairman of the M.T.A., Ravitch once came up with what Hall described as "a radical concept that scared us and others" -- the capital rebuilding of the subway and bus systems using a bonding system that would offer fare boxes as collateral.
 
Right in Most Cases
 "It was a dramatic change for anybody to look at and it made a lot of people nervous because of the very fact that it was a radical change," Hall said. "It was not the way business was done. Putting that weight on the fare boxes scared everybody."
Ravitch, allied with wary state officials, carried the day, and Hall says now that if he had not, "the rebuilding of the subway system of New York just never would have happened."
"So we've been fortunate," Hall said. "He has been proven in most cases to be right when he did radical moves with us."
No one can predict whether that will happen again, especially in a unique industry where players and their employers both boast multitudes of millionaires, where the union basically demands that the status quo be preserved, and where the owners' local interests are often at odds with the game's national interests.
But Hall does point to one certainty he is sure to come baseball's way.
"Dick makes people face the issue," Hall said. "If you're opposed, he's going to make people explain why they're opposed. You can't use the argument with Dick Ravitch that, well, we've never done business this way."
To some, the comparison between Ravitch's past predicaments and his present situation are too delicious to pass up.
 
'A Lot of Parallels'
 "I imagine trying to handle the subway situation there in New York has got a lot of parallels with trying to figure out how to try to make baseball come together," said George W. Bush, a general partner with the Texas Rangers and a supporter of the course Ravitch is plotting.
Ravitch chose to explain his presence in baseball more bluntly.
"Some would say I have a neurotic addiction to difficult problems," he said in an interview last Wednesday. "Look, I love sports and it was presented to me as a challenge of limited duration but one fraught with significance to the future of baseball."
Ravitch decided to join the sport about a year ago for all of the above reasons plus one more.
"Baseball is a very important part of my culture, and I thought it would be an interesting thing to do," he said.
Ravitch came to the game as well-schooled as possible in the history of those who have gone before him and knows it is neither pretty nor for the faint of heart. But he believes things could change, for both the game and himself.
"I think that the times are different and that the definition of my role is different from that of my predecessors," he said. "And my mandate, my privately stated mandate, was to deal with the total economic situation in baseball, not just with the union contract."
 
A Broader Look
 That Ravitch was instructed to take a broader look by the owners perhaps best explains both why and how he was presumed to be a major player in baseball's major conflagration this past summer. That firestorm consumed baseball's last commissioner, Fay Vincent, after Vincent resisted the effort by Ravitch and some owners to cede the commissioner's "best interest of baseball" powers in the area of labor.
Ravitch has steadfastly declined to discuss his role in that battle publicly other than to insist he was neither empire-building nor trying to succeed Vincent. "I have no other agendas," he said.
Vincent also declined to discuss events that led up to his forced resignation. Nor will the former commissioner comment on Ravitch other than to say, "I think he's in a very tough spot, a no-win situation, because he's walked into a mess and he didn't know what he was getting into."
Perhaps, but as Bush points out, Ravitch did survive the summer's blood letting, did extract the vote he desired on the re-opener and is still standing.
"And I think one reason why he's survived without getting his foot blown off is that he's been through politics," Bush said. "He understands that in politics there's a time to enter the fray and there's a time to stay out. He's been very judicious in that choice.
"I also think it's important for people to recognize that he knows who he works for. He's an employee. So I think he's had a nice touch of leading and getting out of the way."
 
A Continuing Challege
 Building a consensus among owners is not only a continuing challenge, but it is also one-half the chore. Ravitch must also deal with the powerful Major League Baseball Players Association which, as Ravitch is well aware, remains unbeaten and untied on its particular field of play.
Ravitch generally has nothing but praise for his counterpart, Donald Fehr, who declined to talk about Ravitch. And he accepts as part of the job some of the gibes that have come his way from what is, for the most part, a tightlipped union team. For instance, he said he took it as a compliment when Mark Belanger of the Players Association labeled him a dangerous man.
"It's flattering, if it means they believe I do my homework and come to the table prepared," Ravitch said.
And both Hall and former Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York both take exception to a charge that riles Ravitch as well: that he is a union buster brought in specifically to dismantle the players' association.
"Union buster? No," Koch said with a laugh Friday. "The fact is, during the 1980 strike, I was the tough guy." Koch was referring to an 11-day transit strike in which Ravitch negotiated for the M.T.A. and the city. "I said that the city won the battle in the streets, but I was unhappy with the settlement that was obtained at the table. But on the other hand, he would say, so was the union, and therefore he did his job. So it is foolish to call him a union buster."
Koch's comments are indicative of those who have crossed swords with Ravitch only to come back in calmer days with undeniably flattering statements.
"I think he's very much in the mold of former Mayor Wagner, with infinite patience, and that's what you need when you're engaging in negotiations," Koch said. "That's what he has. He's very intelligent, very well-versed in city affairs and the private sector as well. He's a Renaissance man."

HEADLINE: Don't Wax Nostalgic for Airline Regulation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is quite apparent that Mr. Pevsner either did not take economics in college or has forgotten all that he was taught. Return to those days when everyone was charged the same air fare, resulting in vacation travelers subsidizing business travelers? Mr. Pevsner seems intent on depriving millions of Americans of the advantages of low fares when they book ahead. 
 If Mr. Pevsner, a lawyer, is such a fan of regulation, he should first propose regulation of his own industry, an industry in which lawyers are not loath to charge $300 an hour for a simple document that could be prepared by a paralegal for a tenth of the cost.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Clinton's Security Trio

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB; Anna Quindlen is on vacation.

 BODY:
What do we know about President-elect Clinton's national security team? What do these choices tell us about Clinton policies and how they will be made?
The short answer is that the expected appointees -- Warren Christopher for Secretary of State, Les Aspin for Defense Secretary and Anthony Lake for National Security Adviser -- are highly experienced problem solvers. Like almost all their predecessors when they took office, these three are untested at the highest levels. 
 They like President Bush's new-world-order rhetoric about standing for American values, paying more attention to international economics and using force for humanitarian as well as strategic reasons. But unlike Mr. Bush, they take those words seriously and will try energetically to turn rhetoric into reality. None of the trio seeks the limelight, and all will fit comfortably with Mr. Clinton's plan to make policy in the White House.
Contrary to comment, the trio bring to their posts as much high-level government experience as most of their predecessors. Mr. Christopher has held the number two jobs in the Justice and State Departments. Mr. Aspin, a Pentagon alumnus, has served in Congress for two decades and for eight years as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Mr. Lake started as a career foreign service officer, worked for Henry Kissinger and directed the State Department's policy planning under President Carter. They know where the land mines are.
All three have their roots in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party but have evolved into pragmatists of different sorts. Mr. Christopher is a cautious liberal, Mr. Aspin a conservative activist and Mr. Lake an eclectic pushing toward the new world order he helped sketch in Mr. Clinton's campaign speeches.
If they have a weakness as a group, it is their lack of pre-cooked clout. None brings commanding stature to his job or possesses a movie-star personality. Each will have to fight to prove he's tough and worthy.
Also they have little expertise in foreign economic policy, the area Mr. Clinton rightly made so much of during the campaign. Mr. Lake will turn to the much-respected Samuel Berger, expected to be his deputy. The others will turn to their deputies.
Mr. Christopher was one of my bosses in Carter's State Department. He is no less stiff and formal privately than publicly. His jacket is always buttoned. He listens impassively, nodding "uh-huh, uh-huh," and says little. Ever the world-class lawyer, he is exceedingly careful, tidy, disciplined, precise -- no mistakes.
When troubles came, Mr. Carter and Secretary of State Vance usually turned to him. "Chris," as he is called, is a brilliant political tactician and negotiator. He helped to gain Senate approval of the Panama Canal treaties and negotiated the release of the American hostages from Iran.
Mr. Christopher is not a policy maker and has no known policy agenda, though he himself wrote that the Secretary of State "must be the architect" of U.S. policy. He thinks case by case. But he can take any policy paper and find its flaws and make it viable.
Mr. Aspin and I first worked together in the Pentagon in the Johnson Administration. He is disheveled, folksy, informal. At the same time,he is often detached and abstract in the manner of a policy wonk or intellectual.
Mr. Aspin is a defense intellectual. That is his life. No one has thought harder or better about the military power the U.S. will need in the decade ahead and when to use it. He would make do with somewhat fewer forces than the Bush team, yet be more willing to use force in places like Bosnia -- and would have used it sooner in Somalia. He strongly backed the Persian Gulf war. (Mr. Lake supported the basic war policy also. There is no record of Mr. Christopher's position.)
Mr. Lake's office adjoined mine in the Vance State Department, and before and after that we co-wrote articles and books. "Tony" is puckish and deeply committed to traditional liberal values, yet power oriented and a careful bureaucrat. Sometimes hawkish, sometimes dovish, he is as tough and aggressive as his smile is cherubic.
Mr. Clinton will almost certainly turn to him and Mr. Berger to shape an overall strategy for a world that seems to defy one. But Mr. Clinton, by far the strongest personality of the lot, will shape the trio more than they shape him.

Fischer Indicted for Defying The Yugoslav Embargo

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
Ever since he was stripped of his title as world chess champion 17 years ago for refusing to defend it, Bobby Fischer had lived in virtual obscurity. That changed this fall when he agreed to an exhibition rematch in Yugoslavia against Boris Spassky, a reprise of their celebrated 1972 contest. He defeated Mr. Spassky, again, and won the $3.3 million purse, but the price for the tournament may now be permanent exile from the United States. 
 Last week a Federal grand jury indicted the temperamental chess genius for violating the American economic sanctions order against Yugoslavia. The indictment was hardly a surprise. At a news conference in September, Mr. Fischer had spit on a letter from the Treasury Department warning him against playing. He faces the choice of staying abroad, where extradition would be difficult, or returning for trial and a possible 10-year sentence.

HEADLINE: What Has the World Done for Bosnia?;
A Diary of Disgrace

 BODY:
February 1992 -- Serbian forces opened a campaign of aggression against the former region of Yugoslavia called Bosnia and Herzegovina. In short order they launched a relentless bombardment of Sarajevo, the historic city that gave living proof that many faiths can coexist. This assault was only the most visible part of the Serbs' barbaric campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Muslim Slavs -- 44 percent of Bosnia's 4.4 million people. What did the world do?
April 7 -- The U.S. recognized Bosnia. Five days later the United Nations disclosed plans to send 100 observers to Bosnia, and the Security Council discussed dispatching 10,000 peacekeeping troops. None of the troops were sent. 
 April 14 -- After a major Yugoslav Army offensive, Bosnia reported "mass massacres" by Serb irregulars. No reliable casualty counts were available but estimates reached the thousands. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled in terror. What did the world do?
April 14 -- Secretary of State Baker condemned the use of force and urged the European Community to issue a joint protest, threatening economic and political isolation of Serbia. Nothing was done to tighten the economic sanctions against Serbia.
Mid-spring -- The U.S. Government received the first unconfirmed reports from Bosnia that Serbs were setting up concentration camps in which Muslims were being tortured and killed. By U.N. estimates, some 30,000 Bosnians were becoming refugees every day. What did the world do?
Washington did not press for immediate investigation of the camps. Instead, it tried to keep the reports from becoming public. If other countries received similar reports, they gave no public sign.
May 4 -- With Serbs in control of half the country, the Bosnian Government appealed to the world, with poignant logic, to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and give it the means to defend itself. What did the world do?
The arms embargo remains, to this day.
May 7 -- Serb and Croat nationalists in Bosnia agreed to carve up the republic, a process the European Community blandly called cantonment. Five days later the U.N. reported a concerted effort by the Serbs to create "ethnically pure" regions in Bosnia "in the context of" the E.C. negotiations on cantonment. What did the world do?
May 14 -- The State Department expressed concern about "allegations of ethnic cleansing." A day later the Security Council backed sending humanitarian aid to Bosnia, but not the armed force needed to deliver it. And the following day the U.N. evacuated its staff of 200 from Sarajevo.
Late May -- The siege of Sarajevo tightened. Serb gunners took deliberate aim at civilians, blasting away at bread lines. The Serb commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, was overheard ordering his gunners to "drive them crazy" and "burn it all." What did the world do?
May 30 -- The U.N. finally imposed an economic embargo on Serbia but stopped short of enforcing it. Secretary of State Baker said that "Before we consider force, we ought to exhaust all the political, diplomatic and economic remedies that might be at hand." An unnamed U.S. official said, "We are really talking about the need -- maybe -- to do something next time. Everyone in the loop concedes that Yugoslavia is a past case already."
Early June -- Outside Sarajevo, the carnage of ethnic cleansing continued. Serbs had by now overrun two-thirds of the country, displacing 700,000 people. What did the world do?
June 6 -- President Bush said, "We're concerned about the situation in Yugoslavia, but there's no commitment on that." Ten days later the U.S. agreed to help airlift food and medicine to Sarajevo, but only after a U.N. force of 1,100 took control of the airport. The U.N. said it could not send in such a force until a cease-fire took hold.
Throughout June -- Relentless Serb shelling continued to reduce beautiful old Sarajevo to rubble. What did the world do?
June 26 -- The Security Council gave the Serbs an ultimatum: Stop shelling Sarajevo and put all heavy guns under U.N. control or face military action. A senior American official said, meanwhile, "No action is imminent."
July 3 -- The Serbs temporarily withdrew from the airport but without relinquishing their heavy guns. The airlift began, but only fitfully under intermittent Serb shelling. Three weeks later Roy Gutman of Newsweek visited Serb-run camps and heard eyewitness accounts of murders and atrocities. Other reporters uncovered rape camps where Muslim women were violated by the thousands. What did the world do?
The U.S. expressed concern and insisted that the Red Cross be allowed into the camps. It said nothing about freeing those imprisoned or punishing the perpetrators.
Summer and fall -- Serbs conducted hundreds of bombing and strafing raids on Bosnian towns. What did the world do?
 Oct. 9 -- The U.N. Security Council banned military flights over Bosnian territory. But it ducked a vote to enforce this ban.
Late autumn -- The Serbian air raids slowed, but reconnaissance and troop flights continued. The shelling continued. So did ethnic cleansing. And many camps still operated, unvisited. By now more than 100,000 Bosnians, mostly Muslim Slavs, were dead or missing. And what has the world done?
Washington, finally, is prodding the U.N. to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia -- four months too late. The U.S. is prepared to lift the arms embargo that effectively keeps Bosnia from defending itself -- six months too late. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger now denounces Serbian war crimes, doubtless hoping that will help defeat the strongman Slobodan Milosevic in today's Serbian election.
But even now Washington, and London, and the European Community, and NATO and the U.N. shrink from forceful actions to counter the Serbs' aggression and slaughter in Bosnia:
Attack their big guns and supply lines;
Send in enough U.N. troops to secure safe havens in areas now menaced by Serb-sponsored ethnic cleansing;
Threaten to attack military installations in Serbia unless it stops its brutal aggression in Bosnia and the rest of Yugoslavia.
After a year of savage slaughter, mass rapes, ethnic cleansing and undoubted genocide, the world has responded with all the right words. But the question remains, What will the world do?

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Growing Market For Gay Travel

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
IN the last 10 years suppliers and opportunities for travel by gay men and women have increased enormously. Some travel experts describe the market as virtually recession-proof, pointing to the usual pattern among gay couples of two jobs and no children. Luxurious ocean cruises are increasingly popular, providing what has been described as a private city for people who do not always find a welcoming environment for leisure. This column touches on a few new offerings in a rapidly growing field.
A landmark event was scheduled for yesterday, when Seaspirit, a 207-foot cruise ship launched in 1983 by Clipper Lines of St. Louis for the luxury trade, was to make her first sailing as a gay-owned, gay-operated vessel, under United States registry and the ownership of RSVP Travel Productions, a tour operator in Minneapolis. Seaspirit was due to sail from St. Thomas for a week's cruise in the Virgin Islands, including Jost Van Dyke, Salt Island, Tortola, Norman Island and St. John. Saturday sailings are scheduled until April 10 next year. The per-person prices for a week, with two to a cabin, range from $995 to $1,795. 
 According to Andy Schmiedel, director of advertising and sales for RSVP, the clientele on the cruises is mostly gay men, but a few women do join. A women-only week is scheduled for Jan. 30 to Feb. 6, and single men's weeks are Jan. 9 to 16, Feb. 6 to 13 and March 6 to 13. After spring trips to the mainland and up the East Coast to reposition, the vessel will sail a New York-New England itinerary.
Since it was founded in 1986 by its owner, Kevin Mossier, RSVP has chartered ships for gay cruises and when the 100-passenger Newport Clipper came up for sale, RSVP bought the vessel for $2.5 million, refurbished it and put it into service as the Seaspirit.

 The big cruise company for lesbians is Olivia, which began as an offshoot of 20-year-old Olivia Records and has chartered nine cruises for women, attracting 4,500 passengers in three years. Judy Dlugacz, the president, said that when she started out in travel, she chartered a ship for a year later, and then learned she needed to put up considerable money. To her surprise she found that 600 women would pay the full amount right away.
From Feb. 13 to 20, Olivia will charter the Commodore Line's 730-passenger Enchanted Isle for a cruise from San Diego to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Per-person prices in double occupancy range from $795 to $1,595. The company's first land-based venture will involve rental of Club Med at Playa Blanca, Mexico, from May 1 to 8. Six hundred guests will pay $895 each, double occupancy.
Ms. Dlugacz is already planning a cruise to leave from New York after the Gay Games there in the summer of 1994. She will charter Commodore's Crown Monarch for 530 passengers to travel to Provincetown, Mass., Bar Harbor, Me., and up the St. Lawrence to Quebec and Montreal. Information: Olivia Cruises, 4400 Market Street, Oakland, Calif. 94608; (800) 631-6277.
Steve Jackson, operations director of Pride Tours, a wholesale travel company in Queens, went into Manhattan for two days this month to book 10,000 hotel rooms and as many dormitory rooms as possible for the summer of 1994. Mr. Jackson was preparing for Gay Games IV to be held around New York from June 25 to July 4, 1994.
Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York announced in April that the city would play host to the games and 15,000 participants from 40 countries, only one indication of the strength the movement has built. Like the Olympics on which they are modeled, the Gay Games are designating the agencies and operators to sell official packages, in this case, members of the International Gay Travel Association, whose officers and membership include both men and women. This association, in its ninth year, has 580 members, principally retail travel agents, tour operators, cruise lines, hotels, resorts and guesthouses.
While the organization does not have the staff to provide a referral service, it runs ads in the gay magazine Advocate that list a selection of member companies.
 
A Newsletter's Ratings
 A travel newsletter for gay readers, Out and About, began this fall, and its owners say that with 700 subscribers it is halfway to breaking even. The owners, David Alport and Billy Kolber, decided that gay guidebooks tended to be out of date and thought there was space for a newsletter. "Magazines and newspapers provide good information," Mr. Kolber, the editor, said, "but it's not particular to gay travel."
They wanted to evaluate the offerings in destinations popular with gay travelers, like Key West, as well as report how welcoming mainstream places were. For instance, Mr. Kolber said, in the Caribbean few places cater exclusively to gay guests, but there are three or four that are "better choices" among the others. "We are travel people first," he said, "then people who appraise places according to the specific needs and sensitivities of our readers."
The newsletter also discusses attractions, like a walking tour of the Castro district in San Francisco, that are naturals for gay travelers. The most recent issue contains the first of two articles on travel health by Dr. Frederick L. Altice of the Yale School of Medicine.
The newsletter accepts no advertising and the owners and their researchers have not accepted free rooms or meals. The owners both formerly worked for American Express -- Mr. Alport at headquarters in New York in marketing and sales, Mr. Kolber as manager of the New Haven, Conn., office -- and their research bookings are made at the travel agent rate.
Out and About is published 10 times a year and will have 16 pages starting with the January-February issue. Subscriptions cost $49 a year. Back issues are $5. Information: Out and About, 542 Chapel Street, New Haven, Conn. 06511; (203) 789-8518.
Our World, a magazine directed at the same market, began in 1989 and broke even after five issues. It carries advertising. The magazine now has 18,000 subscribers, according to Wayne Whiston, the editor. The December issue covers cruises, including yacht charters. A subscription for 12 issues -- there are 10 a year -- costs $44. Sample copies are $5. Information: Our World, 1104 North Nova Road, Suite 251, Daytona Beach, Fla. 32117; (904) 441-5367.
The gay community faces a dilemma in Colorado. Aspen Gay Ski Week, scheduled this winter for Jan. 23-30, has been going for 15 years and last year attracted 3,000 visitors. Yet on Election Day, Colorado adopted an amendment that prevents the enactment of laws to protect homosexuals from discrimination. The board of the International Gay Travel Association does not want to support travel to such a state, Mr. Jackson said, but it held a phone poll immediately after the election Nov. 3 and while the board voted a Colorado boycott, it exempted those who already had tickets for Gay Ski Week because they would lose deposits and it would hurt travel agents who backed the event as well as the "very supportive" town of Aspen. A peaceful march has been planned for Jan. 23, according to Tom Mooney of the Aspen Gay and Lesbian Community.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 3, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Practical Traveler column on Dec. 20, about accommodations for gay vacationers, included an outdated schedule for the Gay Games of 1994, in New York. The dates -- now June 18 to 25 -- have been moved ahead a week, so the games will precede Stonewall 25, the observance of the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Inn clashes on June 27, 1969.

HEADLINE: Bigger Presence for Green Point Savings

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN

 BODY:
SWIMMING against the tide of bank closings, the Green Point Savings Bank, with headquarters in Flushing, Queens, recently opened four branch offices in Westchester and Rockland Counties. The offices -- in Ossining and White Plains in Westchester and Pomona and Chestnut Hill in Rockland -- were acquired from the Crossland Federal Savings Bank and bring the number of Green Point's branches to 25.
"This is the largest expansion in our history," said Michael J. Gagliardi, chairman and chief executive officer, in a recent interview at the Tarrytown Hilton here. "We usually build new branch offices from scratch, but the Crossland offices were in locations that suited our marketing plan." Negotiations for the acquisitions were begun last June. 
 Green Point first tested the Westchester waters in 1987 when the bank opened a branch in Eastchester.
"During that first year of operation in Eastchester we had deposits of $40 million," he said. "This year Eastchester has $174 million in deposits, which encouraged us to open other branches in the area," he said. "We feel there is enormous potential for growth for our type of bank in Westchester and Rockland Counties."
 
Assets of More Than $6 Billion
 Green Point, he said, is the largest state-chartered mutual savings bank in the country and one of the strongest financially.
Green Point's assets exceed $6 billion, making it the 20th-largest thrift institution in the nation, Mr. Gagliardi said. The bank's assets and net worth have grown steadily throughout the recession, he added, saying: "We have been heavily committed to the residential mortgage market since the bank was founded in 1869. High volumes of home mortgages make up 83 percent of our assets. We have the money to lend. Our primary role is residential mortgages, but our specialty is no-income-verification loans. We fund all our lending in investment programs entirely by deposits generated through our branches."
In order to attract depositors, Mr. Gagliardi said, Green Point has consistently paid some of the highest desposit rates available. Former Crossland depositors, he said, will receive higher yields from Green Point.
"In our new branches the yields will be 3.56, up from 3.3," he said. "We are the largest mortgage lender in Brooklyn and in Nassau County and one of the largest in the entire metropolitan area."
 
Maintaining High Equity Value
 In return for not requiring income verification, Mr. Gagliardi said, the bank charges borrowers a point more on a fixed mortgage and half a point more on an adjustable mortgage.
"No-income-verification loans carry a higher element of risk," he said. "Not many banks make them. In order to successfully make these loans, we have to have first-hand knowledge of local property values. Unlike most banks, we don't depend upon outside appraisers. Instead, we have an expert staff of two dozen in-house appraisers who know property values in each of our marketing areas."
And to cut the margin of error even further, he said, the appraisers are subject to review by a senior appraiser who, in turn, is reviewed by the bank's executive loan committee.
"Our tight control over the appraisal process is what assures us of high equity value on our loans," he said. "In 124 years, our loss level has been very small."
The new branches in Westchester and Rockland add $245 million to Green Point's deposits, which were $5.2 billion as of Sept. 30 -- an increase of $236 million over Dec. 31, 1991, Mr. Gagliardi said. He added that the new offices were part of a five-year expansion plan within a 35-mile radius of Green Point's headquarters in Flushing.
"Controlled growth, not overexpansion, has always been our policy in seeking major branch locations," he said. "Our average branch deposit size is $258 million. We feel our new branches have the potential. For instance, our six-month goal for the White Plains office is $125 million; for Ossining it is $90 million." As for former Crossland employees, none of them will lose their jobs, Mr. Gagliardi said.
 
A Former C.P.A.
 "We also transferred their tenure," he added. "Having an experienced staff in place is an asset for us. The staff knows their customers, and we hold training sessions to familiarize them with our methods, but we feel it will take about a month for customers to absorb the conversion, which is why we're planning our kickoff celebration for January."
Mr. Gagliardi is 52 years old and a former certified public accountant. Part of the work he did for his accounting clients was to examine records at their banks.
"Banks were easy," he said. "Their inventory was cash. I became an expert at examining financial institutions, which was an important reason why I was recruited in 1975 for my first banking job for a small bank in New Jersey as vice president and controller."
Mr. Gagliardi was eventually recruited by a larger bank that needed to raise capital, and after he managed that bank's conversion to private ownership, he received an offer to join the Green Point Savings Bank.
"They asked me to become executive vice president," he said. "I knew the chief executive was ready to retire, and I felt that here I had an opportunity to become president of a strong bank." Last Jan. 1 Mr. Gagliardi was named chairman, president and chief executive officer of Green Point.
"This year has been a good one for us," he said. "We're projecting a record-earnings year, the highest in our history. When I'm asked why we have been successful while other banks have not done as well, I say one reason is our low overhead costs, thanks to the large level of deposits of each branch and the $240 million growth of our mortgage portfolio."
And when a bank has been in business for 124 years, Mr. Gagliardi added, it earns customer loyalty.
"We received one of the nicest letters I've ever read, in response to a mailing we made to Crossland depositors," he said. "It came from a customer in Ossining who wrote that she grew up in Green Point, Brooklyn, and that the Christmas she was 7 years old she got a $5 bill, the first one she had ever received for a Christmas present."
"The letter said in part: 'I remember how my father walked me to the Green Point Savings Bank on Manhattan Avenue and opened my first bank account. I can remember walking into that bank and seeing the high domed ceiling, hearing the clicking of the cash registers and experiencing the hushed tones and dignified atmosphere in which the business of the bank was carried on.' The letter writer added that she kept the account until she got married and moved to Pennsylvania. "Now years later I am back living in Westchester County," she said. "I feel I have come full circle: to have an account in the Green Point Savings Bank again, back where all my financial transactions started."
"Isn't that a great letter?" Mr. Gagliardi said.

HEADLINE: CHRISTMAS OBSERVED;
A Quarrelsome Peace

BYLINE: By Jane Smiley; Jane Smiley's most recent novel is "A Thousand Acres," for which she won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize.

 BODY:
The editors of the New York Times Magazine decided it would be a fine seasonal gift to ask some of America's most accomplished writers of fiction and essays to compose short stories of reminiscences about Christmas. The initiative was an unconventional one for this magazine, which traditionally has published nonfiction. The startlingly contemporary reference points the writers choose - malls, a precinct station house, broken homes - also seemed unconventional at first. But reflecting on these settings appear to sustain old tradition. Christmas is a holiday that encourages us to celebrate out shared experience. 
 The reason Mary Ann makes her first mistake is that Bonnie's anguished cry, as she throws herself down in front of the Christmas tree, happens to rouse her from one of those comalike sleeps she can achieve only in the afternoon. Of course Mary Ann jerks upward in a panic. Of course she doesn't know where she is, only that Bonnie needs something. Of course, when Bonnie screeches, "We haven't bought a present for Mr. Jones," Mary Ann tries to employ her calmest, most conciliatory manner. She barely realizes what she is saying -- this is the mistake: "We can go to the mall now, if you like."
Bonnie rises from the carpet immediately and goes to the closet for her coat. It takes Mary Ann considerably longer to rise from the couch, because she is nine months' pregnant (due after New Year's), and despite the conversation she is still mostly comatose.
She moves in a heavy daze toward her coat and her purse. She says: What? Where are we going?"
Bonnie says, "We're going to the mall to buy Mr. Jones's Christmas present."
Mr. Jones is the cat.
Mary Ann is having second thoughts. She begins, "Honey. . . ."
"You said you would! He has to have a present. He always has a present. Except this year! This year, no present."
This year! New husband, new stepbrothers, new house, new baby! Bonnie's tone distills the betrayals of the year into the bitters of this representative one. That is why Mary Ann puts on her coat after all and picks up her purse in order to drive through Christmas traffic to the mall, where she will buy a present for a cat who comes up from the basement every morning solely to pull garbage out of the garbage disposal, who lives on permanent feline unemployment because he doesn't know how to groom himself and has nothing else to do, and whom even Bonnie doesn't like to pet much because he insists on crawling up your chest and putting his head in your mouth when you show him any attention whatsoever. A cat that Mary Ann has been glad not to touch since discovering she was pregnant.
On the way to the mall, 8-year-old Bonnie is much like her old self -- alert and talkative, drawing Mary Ann's attention to light displays and Christmas trees in picture windows. She cheerfully solicits an old story, "Did you really have a pink Christmas tree, Mom?"
"No," says Mary Ann, "it was made of aluminum. It looked pink because we shined a pink light on it. And all the glass balls were pink, too. Grandma had it because her new family room was decorated in pink, black and white. We all hated it, but she would say, 'It looks very Christmassy to me.' " Bonnie joins her on the punch line, imitating her grandmother perfectly, and they laugh.
But when they park far from the entrance and Mary Ann has to support her protruding belly with one hand and pull herself out of the car with the other, Bonnie's look darkens, and Mary Ann has a sense that she has often had lately of a new Bonnie snapping closed over the old one, hiding her completely. The new Bonnie is unrelentingly critical and dissatisfied, especially with the fact that the baby, according to the amniocentesis, is a girl.
Mary Ann had assumed that everyone in the family assimilated the baby's female identity months before -- they have been calling her Liza since August -- but lately Bonnie speaks of the baby only as a grotesquely exaggerated SHE, as in "SHE doesn't need presents. SHE won't even be here for Christmas," a remark Bonnie made at the table to Isaiah and Jake, her younger stepbrothers, who then burst out crying inconsolably because they and Mark, Mary Ann's husband of eight months, had just spent the afternoon buying baby toys and equipment. A look of recognition had crossed Mark's face -- Mary Ann saw it -- recognition that Bonnie was truly unpleasant and obnoxious. This is a recognition that Mary Ann has had herself, though she hasn't voiced it.
Now, as they enter the mall, Mary Ann can feel the pressure building up, the pressure to do just the right thing and do it quickly, before Bonnie loses her temper and makes a scene. As if in response, the baby, who was quiet during the car ride, jams her feet against Mary Ann's diaphragm and her head against Mary Ann's bladder. To distract herself, Mary Ann says, "What do you want to get Mr. Jones?"
"Catnip. A new scratching post." She pauses, then snaps, "Something really good."
Something, Mary Ann thinks, that will transform him from a dusty, needy scavenger who has been known to extract a potato from water boiling on the stove and flee with it to the basement to another cat entirely -- sleek, elegant, independent.
Bonnie exclaims: "We took the wrong turn! The pet store is in the other wing."
The thought of trudging to the other wing is almost more than Mary Ann can bear. They are near Walgreens, however. Mary Ann uses her most ingratiating voice, a voice that Mark maintains she uses too often with Bonnie. "That's awfully far, honey, but Walgreens is right here. They have a pet section there."
"But there's nothing special there."
"O.K." Mary Ann calls reserves of energy she is probably supposed to be saving for labor and delivery. Of all her mistakes with Bonnie, this is the one she makes most -- thinking that pleasing the child will help her into an easier state of mind. But, as with all her mistakes, Mary Ann realizes it is a mistake only after she is committed.
It may be that she and Bonnie do not present the spectacle of gray exhaustion and bleak rage that Mary Ann thinks they do as they make their way through the crowds to the pet store, but most of their fellow shoppers are smiling, and some are humming along with the piped-in Christmas carols. The bags and packages they are carrying look promising and richly heavy. The groups of teen-age girls who always roam the mall today look almost innocent, as if Christmas has succeeded in returning them partway to childhood. Everyone, everyone, looks as if he or she is anticipating returning home in the bustling dusk to a delicious, festive meal. Mark and Mary Ann have agreed to avoid the cooking by going to friends of his who Mary Ann doesn't know well, but now Mary Ann almost regrets that -- their own kitchen will be cold and clean, their own house dark on the most domestic night of the year, a night when they might have found, after eight slippery and difficult months, their footing as a family. It may be that she and Bonnie do not present such a spectacle, but when they pass some mirrors, Mary Ann notices that they do look unhappy and disheveled, and she thinks that she would feel sorry for them if she were anyone else in this mall.
Bonnie gives out a penetrating wail compounded equally of disappointment and anger, and Mary Ann's immediate response is a physical one -- her hand twitches with the desire to cover Bonnie's mouth and muffle that sound. The sign on the door of the darkened pet store reads, "On Christmas Eve, we will close at noon. Happy Holidays."
"Well," says Bonnie, "I guess we'll have to go back to Walgreens."
"I can't," says Mary Ann. "It's too far."
"We have to. We have to!" She whirls on Mary Ann, and her face is ugly and insistent, the face of every spoiled child and every failed maternal effort that Mary Ann has ever seen and deplored. It is not happy families that are alike, but unhappy children -- noisy, selfish, dissatisfied, reduced by unhappiness to a mechanical condition of repeating demands and high-pitched whining.
Bonnie yells: "Why are you having this baby! I know it was a mistake. You and Mark weren't even married."
No cat presents in this wing -- only the Gap, the Limited, County Seat and the faces of all the happy shoppers turning curiously in their direction. In a low and serious voice, Mary Ann says something she doesn't mean and will always regret. She says, "You were the mistake, Bonnie."
For a moment she is pleased, because her remark has the desired effect -- Bonnie is so shocked that she falls silent. Her face loses, for once, that aggressive and determined look that has been its principal feature for months. In fact, the child's face loses all expression. It freezes into an unreadable mask, so remote and inhuman that Mary Ann's pleasure evaporates into fear, then into regret -- fear that this mask is the only other face Bonnie has to offer these days, regret that she has summoned it. And at Christmas, too. She says, "I didn't mean that, Bonnie." The stony mask does not soften. "It's just that I'm really tired and what you said hurt my feelings and, um, embarrassed me. . . ."
Still, Bonnie's face remains impassive, and Mary Ann realizes that she has been harboring a wish for many months. It is of Bonnie not exactly coming over to her side, but relinquishing her intransigence. The most salient component of this hope is the feeling Mary Ann remembers of Bonnie's body nestling into hers, seeking warmth and comfort. She has been missing that contact half-consciously for months, and no other contact with Isaiah or Jake or Mark, none of the intimate flutters or rollings of Liza within, and certainly nothing in Bonnie's stiff hugs and formal kisses have made up for it. Now Bonnie stands resolutely apart from her, the distance of six cool hard tiles in the floor of the mall, and Mary Ann knows that they have cast their lots on opposing sides of a quarrel that will never end.
And at Christmas, too. Mary Ann is resentfully, but nevertheless fully, subject to that sentimental irony.
She looks at Bonnie, who is looking at her, and two things happen. The first is, she gives it all up -- her wish that Bonnie would melt toward her, her shame at the person Bonnie has become, her sense that Bonnie has somehow betrayed her, even her desire that Bonnie and Mark and Isaiah and Jake like each other. As if to underscore that she has no choice but to give up all these feelings, the baby stretches gently against her left side and one of her feet presses firmly against her right. The second is, Mary Ann all at once sees their new situation from Bonnie's point of view -- little gained but new rules and inconveniences, much that is familiar and private and relied upon lost forever. The fact is, she has resisted seeing things from Bonnie's point of view, probably out of fear. Mary Ann starts to cry.
Bonnie pushes her toward a nearby bench.
They sit down.
Bonnie says, "Why are you crying, Mom?"
Mary Ann blubbers, "I'm sorry it's Christmas."
"Me, too," says Bonnie. She sighs. She puts her hand, which is surprisingly small for someone who looms so large, on Mary Ann's leg.
They sit through "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen," "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear," "What Child Is This?" and most of "Jingle Bells." Finally, Mary Ann blots her eyes on the hem of her skirt. She looks around. The mall is emptying out. Bonnie's face is no longer masklike, or even defiant. It is calm, as if she, too, has come to some conclusion, but Mary Ann resists prying. She says, "I guess we'd better get home."
"Do we have any hamburger?" Bonnie says.
"Yes."
"Can we give Mr. Jones some of that?"
"Yes, I guess."
"Well, he'll just have to settle for that this year. That's all there is to it."
When they are almost to the exit, and can see the full darkness outside, Mary Ann says, "Do you think he'll mind?"
Bonnie says, in a mild voice, "Probably." And Mary Ann accepts that.

IZZY
A Biography of I. F. Stone.
By Robert C. Cottrell.
Illustrated. 388 pp. New Brunswick, N.J.:
Rutgers University Press. $25.95. 
 BY the end of World War II, I. F. Stone, who died in 1989 at the age of 81, was already at the top of his profession. He worked as a columnist for a string of New York dailies and was the regular left-winger on "Meet the Press" 's panel of journalists. But his sharp opposition to American cold war policies led to his exile from the radio and television program. By November 1952, when The New York Daily Compass, for which Stone wrote a column, went out of business, he had become, in his biographer Robert C. Cottrell's words, "an unemployed, middle-aged journalist and Old Leftist who appeared to be yet another victim of the temper of the times."
But Mr. Cottrell tells us in "Izzy" that what might have been the end of Stone's professional life was really the beginning. He decided to start his own newsletter, which he called I. F. Stone's Weekly, and in which he pioneered a new kind of investigative journalism, based upon the close reading of government documents. In the 1950's, he gained renown for exposing the hazards of nuclear testing. Then, as the United States became embroiled in Vietnam, he became one of the war's most persistent and effective critics and a hero to a new generation on the left.
Mr. Cottrell, an associate professor of history at California State University, Chico, has written the first book-length biography of Stone. Without concealing Stone's more foolish or ignoble opinions, particularly on the Soviet Union, Mr. Cottrell portrays him as an ink-stained saint -- an "American original." Stone's fans should welcome this book, but it is not a very good biography. Mr. Cottrell's narrative is clumsy and repetitious. And despite his air of familiarity with Stone, whom he repeatedly calls Izzy, he fails to make his subject come alive. At a minimum, this biography would have been more interesting if Mr. Cottrell had simply quoted more extensively from Stone, who was a witty and acerbic writer, rather than constantly paraphrasing his opinions.
Most important, Mr. Cottrell does not adequately account for the changes in Stone's underlying political philosophy -- from uncritical admirer of Soviet and American Communism to anti-anti-Communist to self-described "liberal" opponent of the war in Vietnam. Mr. Cottrell relies entirely on Stone's own reminiscences five decades later to explain his support in the early 1930's for a "Soviet America." As for Stone's liberalism, the author fails to quote enough of Stone for the reader to be able to judge what he believed. This is all the more important because, in an unrelated context, Mr. Cottrell quotes Stone in 1983 praising the Soviet Union as a "distortion of socialism" but "still socialism."
Mr. Cottrell is justifiably effusive about Stone's journalism in the 1950's and 60's. Stone was a remarkable reporter who did not flinch from facts that contradicted his hopes. After a 1961 visit to Fidel Castro's Cuba, he warned of a "revolutionary euphoria" and "demagogy" that seemed "dangerously unrealistic." Stone also sensed very early that the 60's New Left was destroying itself by mimicking the sectarianism of the Old. Mr. Cottrell is on shaky ground, however, in applauding Stone's work before 1952.
Stone was, unfortunately, another brilliant intellectual whose brain was addled by the Russian Revolution. He was still defending the Soviet Union in 1939, when many prominent intellectuals and journalists, including Edmund Wilson and Dwight Macdonald, already understood that the Revolution had fatally miscarried. Mr. Cottrell terms Stone's cold war criticisms "remarkably astute," but after World War II Stone tended to grant the Soviet Union the benefit of the doubt while believing the worst of American intentions. Unlike Walter Lippmann (who was also a cold war critic), Stone failed to understand that the pro-Soviet regimes in Eastern Europe were sustained by Soviet tanks, not by the wonders of Marxism-Leninism. And like Henry Wallace, whom he supported for President in 1948, he mistakenly read into the politics of the late 40's the onset of an American fascism.
Mr. Cottrell says in his introduction that Stone's life "serves as a microcosm through which to view the state of the American left, political journalism and the intellectual experience over the course of the better part of the 20th century." That is true enough (even today, when some on the right are accusing Stone of having been a paid Soviet agent), but Mr. Cottrell fails to make good on the potential that this interesting microcosm holds.

IZZY
A Biography of I. F. Stone.
By Robert C. Cottrell.
Illustrated. 388 pp. New Brunswick, N.J.:
Rutgers University Press. $25.95. 
 BY the end of World War II, I. F. Stone, who died in 1989 at the age of 81, was already at the top of his profession. He worked as a columnist for a string of New York dailies and was the regular left-winger on "Meet the Press" 's panel of journalists. But his sharp opposition to American cold war policies led to his exile from the radio and television program. By November 1952, when The New York Daily Compass, for which Stone wrote a column, went out of business, he had become, in his biographer Robert C. Cottrell's words, "an unemployed, middle-aged journalist and Old Leftist who appeared to be yet another victim of the temper of the times."
But Mr. Cottrell tells us in "Izzy" that what might have been the end of Stone's professional life was really the beginning. He decided to start his own newsletter, which he called I. F. Stone's Weekly, and in which he pioneered a new kind of investigative journalism, based upon the close reading of government documents. In the 1950's, he gained renown for exposing the hazards of nuclear testing. Then, as the United States became embroiled in Vietnam, he became one of the war's most persistent and effective critics and a hero to a new generation on the left.
Mr. Cottrell, an associate professor of history at California State University, Chico, has written the first book-length biography of Stone. Without concealing Stone's more foolish or ignoble opinions, particularly on the Soviet Union, Mr. Cottrell portrays him as an ink-stained saint -- an "American original." Stone's fans should welcome this book, but it is not a very good biography. Mr. Cottrell's narrative is clumsy and repetitious. And despite his air of familiarity with Stone, whom he repeatedly calls Izzy, he fails to make his subject come alive. At a minimum, this biography would have been more interesting if Mr. Cottrell had simply quoted more extensively from Stone, who was a witty and acerbic writer, rather than constantly paraphrasing his opinions.
Most important, Mr. Cottrell does not adequately account for the changes in Stone's underlying political philosophy -- from uncritical admirer of Soviet and American Communism to anti-anti-Communist to self-described "liberal" opponent of the war in Vietnam. Mr. Cottrell relies entirely on Stone's own reminiscences five decades later to explain his support in the early 1930's for a "Soviet America." As for Stone's liberalism, the author fails to quote enough of Stone for the reader to be able to judge what he believed. This is all the more important because, in an unrelated context, Mr. Cottrell quotes Stone in 1983 praising the Soviet Union as a "distortion of socialism" but "still socialism."
Mr. Cottrell is justifiably effusive about Stone's journalism in the 1950's and 60's. Stone was a remarkable reporter who did not flinch from facts that contradicted his hopes. After a 1961 visit to Fidel Castro's Cuba, he warned of a "revolutionary euphoria" and "demagogy" that seemed "dangerously unrealistic." Stone also sensed very early that the 60's New Left was destroying itself by mimicking the sectarianism of the Old. Mr. Cottrell is on shaky ground, however, in applauding Stone's work before 1952.
Stone was, unfortunately, another brilliant intellectual whose brain was addled by the Russian Revolution. He was still defending the Soviet Union in 1939, when many prominent intellectuals and journalists, including Edmund Wilson and Dwight Macdonald, already understood that the Revolution had fatally miscarried. Mr. Cottrell terms Stone's cold war criticisms "remarkably astute," but after World War II Stone tended to grant the Soviet Union the benefit of the doubt while believing the worst of American intentions. Unlike Walter Lippmann (who was also a cold war critic), Stone failed to understand that the pro-Soviet regimes in Eastern Europe were sustained by Soviet tanks, not by the wonders of Marxism-Leninism. And like Henry Wallace, whom he supported for President in 1948, he mistakenly read into the politics of the late 40's the onset of an American fascism.
Mr. Cottrell says in his introduction that Stone's life "serves as a microcosm through which to view the state of the American left, political journalism and the intellectual experience over the course of the better part of the 20th century." That is true enough (even today, when some on the right are accusing Stone of having been a paid Soviet agent), but Mr. Cottrell fails to make good on the potential that this interesting microcosm holds.

THE WIVES OF HENRY VIII
By Antonia Fraser.
Illustrated. 479 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $25. 
 "WHO does not tremble when he considers how to deal with a wife?" asked Henry VIII in 1521.
That the King was writing on behalf of marriage, emphasizing the precious and sacred charge involved in such a union, must surely be one of the odder ironies of history. Odder still, given subsequent events, was that his motive in writing "The Defence of the Seven Sacraments" was to refute Martin Luther's heretical challenge to Pope and church. For Henry's efforts, the Pope granted to him and his successors the title Defender of the Faith.
Just six years later, Henry initiated the divorce that ultimately propelled England into the maw of schism. The divorce (never, of course, recognized by the Holy See) took another six years to orchestrate, but, once accomplished, ushered in a period of marital chaos whose extremes have rarely been equaled -- even in our own era of rampant family dysfunction. Renaissance Europe watched aghast as the King of England ordered his second wife, Anne Boleyn, beheaded on trumped-up charges of treason after only three and a half years of marriage, then registered with disbelief the coronation of four more Queens of England in the space of little more than a decade. When apprised of the news that Henry had repudiated his fourth wife, whom he had married just six months before, to place on the throne an adolescent named Katherine Howard, the King of France shook his head in wonderment and asked: "The Queen that now is?"
To keep track of the dizzying list of royal mates, Lady Antonia Fraser tells us in the introduction to her latest work of popular history, people took to counting them off in a little refrain: "Divorced, beheaded, died; divorced, beheaded, survived." The six women in question, Lady Antonia observes, have come to be "defined in a popular sense not so much by their lives as by the way these lives ended." She proposes, in "The Wives of Henry VIII," to rescue them from this historical injustice.
One might object in passing that to be remembered for the manner of one's demise, provided it was spectacular enough, is not an uncommon fate. But a much stronger objection to Lady Antonia's point is that divorce, as modern experience has proved, need not be the end of one's life. Indeed, the popular refrain that Lady Antonia cites reveals a more important point, for it fixes the moment -- and means -- at which these women ceased to be regarded by the King as his wife (with the exception, naturally, of his widow, Catherine Parr). One of the most interesting aspects of Lady Antonia's book, in fact, is its exploration of the manner in which the two divorced wives, Catherine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves, dealt with the limbo in which they were cast by divorce.
There have been many fine individual biographies of Henry VIII's queens, but until the publication earlier this year of Alison Weir's lively study "The Six Wives of Henry VIII," there were few responsible collective treatments, probably because the very idea of uniting these six biographies in one volume requires that their subjects be defined, first and foremost, as wives. Putting these life stories together, however, turns out to have an unexpected advantage: it throws into relief the ways in which six women of very different character and background learned -- or failed to learn -- to cope with a prodigiously difficult man. Conversely, looking at the story as a whole allows us to see how grappling with Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, two very powerful and (each in her own way) defiant women, fundamentally influenced not only Henry's next choice of a wife, the relatively docile Jane Seymour, but also determined the way he would behave toward wives who followed. After Henry's experience with the fiery, intelligent, plotting Mistress Anne, Lady Antonia notes, "the King would specifically order his future wives to avoid argument." If they failed to keep this caveat in mind, he would darkly remind them of their predecessor's fate.
Not surprisingly, the King's favorite wife was his third, Jane Seymour, who took as her motto "Bound to obey and serve." Of all his wives, she alone produced a male heir, and she did him the favor of dying before he could tire of her. For it was Henry's own peculiar destiny to be attracted to women of spirit and discover afterward that spirit in a wife was an irritation he could not suffer gladly.
Another strength of "The Wives of Henry VIII" is its author's determination to retell the story as though she did not know what its end might be. "Although we know Henry VIII will marry six times," Lady Antonia writes in her introduction, "we must always remember that he did not." Unfolding the story from its relatively innocent beginning, she takes us step by step through the process of moral compromise through which the Renaissance's splendid, golden boy king was transmogrified into a repulsive old tyrant whose monstrous proportions perfectly mirrored his ego. Like that of Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray, Henry VIII's character coarsened by degree with each violation.
Yet, despite her obvious disgust with Henry, Lady Antonia is determined to be fair. She puts events carefully in context, supplying the political and social underpinnings of what looks to 20th-century eyes suspiciously like one long royal nervous breakdown. She reminds us, for example, that by 16th-century standards Henry was a fairly good husband to his first wife for nearly 20 years until, deeply distraught over Catherine's repeated miscarriages and the realization that no more children would come from the marriage, he finally turned to divorce as a means of freeing himself to produce a male heir. Lady Antonia points out, furthermore, that Henry's desperation over the succession had its roots in the fact that his father had won his crown at the battle of Bosworth Field. Henry VII, the usurper, passed on to his son what might be called an intense throne anxiety. Without an indisputable -- that is to say, male -- heir, Henry feared that England might well fall once again into civil war.
Lady Antonia also disentangles the highly complicated strategies by which the King justified his actions, always managing to preserve "the tender conscience on which he prided himself." The same man who did not shrink from letting his ministers invent the charges on which Anne Boleyn was tried was nevertheless reluctant to tell an outright lie himself. "Taxed many years later with having had an affair with three Boleyns, two daughters and a mother," Lady Antonia writes, "the best he could do was to reply shamefacedly: 'Never with the mother.' "
"The Wives of Henry VIII" does, as it promises, admirably succeed in bringing to life, with economy of detail, the six women who married England's ruler. But, despite Lady Antonia's assertion that "this is not his story," the biography's focus keeps wandering inevitably back to "the gigantic Maypole . . . round which these women had to dance." This may be, however, an unavoidable consequence of the fact that what these six women had in common was coming to terms with Henry. Finally, the book's greatest interest lies in its deeply engaging portrait of a marriage -- in serial.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton's High-Stakes Shuffle To Get the Right Cabinet Mix

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 20

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton's effort to fill his Cabinet has become a high-stakes game of mix and match as he struggles to create an inner circle that is diverse in race, sex and point of view.
Even some of his closest aides are unfamiliar with his thinking as he has continuously shuffled the personnel deck. "Hiring" a Cabinet, to use Mr. Clinton's word for the process, has become an unexpectedly complicated task of fulfilling his campaign pledge to create an administration that "looks like America."
 
Puzzling for Nominees
 Aides to the President-elect said that in some cases he had settled on some nominees, then changed his mind, holding a job up to each candidate like a suit of clothes that can be exchanged for a better fit. Even today, aides said Mr. Clinton had decided to pass over Senator Timothy E. Wirth, the early favorite for Energy Secretary, to select Hazel R. O'Leary, a Minnesota power company executive. [Page D11.] 
 The deliberative approach is typical of how Mr. Clinton has made tough choices as Governor and as a campaigner, and it provides an early look at how he will govern in the White House.
Some involved in the process have said they feel as if they have become caught in a maze without a map.
"They've got this puzzle, and I'm a player who can play a number of parts in the puzzle for them," said one potential nominee whose name surfaces regularly.
For Mr. Clinton, picking a Cabinet from the broad range of academics, politicians and intellectuals who are suddenly available for jobs in a Democratic administration after 12 years out in the political cold has been akin to turning a child loose in a candy store, his aides said.
"I didn't want a Cabinet of strangers," Mr. Clinton said at a news conference last week. "But neither did I want people whose only criteria for having a job was that they had somehow been involved with me before."
Such goals seem reasonable enough. But Mr. Clinton's desires to create an inclusive Administration while fitting all his appointees into the roles that would suit them best has created minor chaos behind the scenes.
Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee who was a valuable ally during the primary election process, had signaled the Clinton transition team that he wanted a foreign policy job, perhaps Secretary of State. Mr. Clinton was unwilling to give Mr. Brown that big a reward and instead discussed whether Mr. Brown would instead accept United States Trade Representative or United Nations Ambassador. They even briefly considered bumping the United Nations job up to Cabinet level.
But Mr. Brown settled for Secretary of Commerce instead, aides close to the process said, because he was assured that he would be part of the economic team. A Cabinet post also assured Mr. Brown that he would have a direct line to Mr. Clinton without having his suggestions vetted first by other officials.
A similar switch occurred for Robert B. Reich, the Harvard professor who has headed Mr. Clinton's economic transition team. Mr. Reich's name first surfaced to fill the newly created post of economic security adviser, and then as a potential choice to head the Council of Economic Advisers.
But there were two problems. Some business leaders on Wall Street expressed uneasiness at Mr. Reich's more liberal views. And other advisers in the transition process said that Mr. Clinton's chief adviser on economics should be a trained economist, which Mr. Reich is not. In the end, Mr. Reich ended up as Labor Secretary.
"A lot of it is instinct with him," one transition aide said of Mr. Clinton. "A lot of it is also wanting to mix things up so nobody feels too secure. I think the best executives keep in control."
Part of that process for Mr. Clinton is deciding when naked politics counts and when it does not.
Among Mr. Clinton's closest advisers will be a prominent and respected Democrat, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who waited until the last possible minute in the primary campaign before he agreed to support or help raise money for Mr. Clinton, whose nomination was by then inevitable.
Some Clinton aides point to the selection of Mr. Bentsen to be Treasury Secretary as evidence that the President-elect prizes policy over politics. Mr. Bentsen helped Mr. Clinton formulate his position on the North American Free Trade Agreement, a stand that allowed the Governor to mollify organized labor, environmentalists and business interests.
"He's extremely analytical," one aide said. "He knows the difference between the process and the result."
In other cases, likely nominees were able to impress Mr. Clinton after they arrived for their interview in Little Rock. Such was the case with Representative Leon E. Panetta, whose stock rose as a candidate for director of the Office of Management and Budget after he and Mr. Clinton hit it off during three separate meetings.
Shortly after that, Alice M. Rivlin, who had been considered the leading candidate for the job before the Panetta interviews, was appointed deputy director of the budget office instead.
 
Indications of Leadership
 Mr. Clinton's methodical search for a Cabinet is sprinkled with clues to the way he will lead the nation. Early on, his campaign advisers gained a reputation as an unwieldy collection of political professionals. But they built a cohesive and focused working group by the time the campaign ended.
"What I've seen in the past is he will constantly share his tentative thinking," said Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's poll taker. "He'll very self-consciously go out to a broad range of opinion makers and advisers. And if you think you know where he was at any given moment, you're wrong, because it's all a process for him."
One adviser tells of being called in to consult with Mr. Clinton, who asked him his opinion of a top Cabinet prospect. Before the adviser could construct an answer, he said, Mr. Clinton named two reasons why he would not choose the prospect.
The adviser left Mr. Clinton thinking the President-elect had nixed his leading choice. But days later the supposedly rejected candidate got the job.
Using this approach, Mr. Clinton surrounds himself with a range of seemingly dissimilar advisers whose primary allegiance is to the man who appointed them.
"I have taken a lot of time in this process because I'm trying to make sure the people I send up there share my vision," Mr. Clinton said Thursday. "Because I want a Cabinet with some greater diversity, and I'm working very hard on that, and because I want a personal relationship with my Cabinet members."

HEADLINE: EXPERTS SAY STORM LEFT COASTAL AREA HIGHLY VULNERABLE

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
A week after the worst flooding in 30 years clawed the New Jersey and Long Island coasts and leveled sand dunes, experts say the already precarious beaches are extremely vulnerable at many points, exposed to dangerous new flooding from even average winter storms.
From the Hamptons on eastern Long Island to Sandy Hook and Long Beach Island on the New Jersey coast, the four-day storm swept away millions of cubic yards of sand from beaches that had already been considered alarmingly narrow and undernourished for a decade or more. 
 And almost as soon as the seas calmed, the debate began along the 150 miles of coast line on how much should be done to restore the beaches and who should pay the price, which could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. [A map and a town-by-town list of damage estimates are on page B6.]
 
Erosion Called 'Staggering'
 While homeowners desperately sought help to shore up their beaches, scientists and environmentalists said the storm presented an opportunity to consider which beaches could reasonably be saved and which could not.
"The extent of the erosion is staggering, and the news reports didn't prepare me for what I found when I walked the beaches," said Dr. Michael S. Bruno, director of the Davidson Laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, where two of the largest wave tanks in the country simulate coastal engineering problems.
 
Homeowners Seek Protection
 "The New Jersey shore as most people know it isn't there any more," he said. "Boardwalks have been wiped away, dunes are gone and beaches are flat, roadways and sea walls have been undermined."
Individuals with beachfront homes now vulnerable to the next churning high tide are clamoring for municipalities and the Federal Government to quickly build a dune line to protect against a further battering by the ocean in the stormy months ahead.
Such an operation may be possible with a combination of Federal grants made available for disaster relief and 25 percent matching funds put up by local communities and the states.
But some doubt that such spending would be prudent.
"This was a benchmark storm," said Dr. Norman P. Psuty, associate director of the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University.
"The barrier islands are in retreat from the ocean," he said, noting that the sea level has risen 16 inches along the Jersey Shore this century. "The islands are being slowly drowned and in some areas we may have to consider giving up property instead of pouring money and sand into the ocean."
Some homeowners, like William Warren, who has a beachfront, cedar-shake summer home in Mantoloking, N.J., expect most of the expense will come out of their own pockets.
"Private property owners just last spring paid to have the dunes pushed up higher," said Mr. Warren. On Saturday morning he and his wife, June Peel, inspected the wooden sun deck that was broken and split.
"Before you could barely see over the dunes to the beach from the deck," Ms. Peel said. Now they can look straight to the beach below.
 
Pilings Exposed
 Twenty-five miles to the south, another couple, Bob and Marion Norbe, watched as trucks dumped sand on the beach at Harvey Cedars on Long Beach Island to protect the homes from another assault. They and other homeowners are convinced that it will take a large-scale Federal and state effort to set up a new dune line along the beach to help them to get through the winter. The emergency sand-dumping was provided by state and county governments with the hope that the Federal Government would eventually help pay for some of the costs.
The 40-foot wide grass-covered dunes that once stood between the Norbes' house and the beach has simply disappeared. Moreover, the storm chewed away the firmly-packed sand beneath the ground level of the house, exposing nearly half the length of 25-foot pilings that anchored the house.
"Someone has to immediately do something -- the Army Corps of Engineers or someone -- to throw something up between us and the ocean before the next storm hits," Mr. Norbe said.
Mayor Harry Marti of Harvey Cedars said that it was possible that some of the beachfront homes buckled by the storm might not survive the winter, and that the houses behind them, in turn, would be endangered.
 
Infrastructure Damaged
 Experts agreed that the storm has ruthlessly imposed a timetable for critical decisions along the region's coastlines. They say it was a new warning that sooner or later the sea would claim some barrier beaches, no matter how high new dunes are bulldozed.
Dr. Bruno of the Stevens Institute and others also worried about damage to infrastructure abutting the beaches, like roadways and sewer lines.
Dr. Bruno argued that shore areas in the region were of such economic and recreational value that it was unthinkable not to spend public money to protect those beaches that could reasonably be spared further damage. "There are very few regions in the world where the beaches are more used and appreciated than in our area," he said. "In New Jersey, the Shore is part of the state's psyche. To see it so destroyed is shocking."
But some beaches, he acknowledged, may be too far gone to waste money propping up houses that sooner or later will be claimed by the sea.
 
A Protective Berm
 That opinion was shared by Dr. James R. Allen, a coastal geomorphologist for the National Park Service, who toured Fire Island on Thursday. He dismissed the idea, put forth by the Fire Island Association and other private groups, that the Army Corps of Engineers construct an emergency berm, or artificial dune, to protect structures in imminent danger of washing away.
Such measures were taken after a 1962 storm. But Dr. Allen and others noted that the 1962 storm struck in March and that the dunes were built in the spring. Summer is a time of natural accretion of sand on beaches in the Northeast, so the berm helped buy time until nature could help heal the wounds, they said.
But a normal winter may bring 8 to 10 more storms, they said, and if one or two hit at high tide or during a full moon, much of the new dunes could be washed away and millions of dollars in work lost.
Much of the sand lost in the storm was deposited offshore in sandbars, and smaller amounts were trapped by groins, jetties and other man-made structures. Wind and waves carried tons inland.
Just how much was carried away by the sea and deposited in ocean canyons too deep to yield their catch any time soon can only be guessed, said D. W. Bennett, director of the American Littoral Society, a national coastal study group in Sandy Hook.
"The ocean is fine, the fish are fine and the habitat is in good shape," he said. "The beach has just been moved around where the ocean wants it."
Perhaps this storm, he and others said, presented an opportunity to look beyond emergency measures and work on long-term solutions that will accept the fact that the sea is an inexorable force that will not be denied its progression against barrier islands. "One of our arguments is that if people in an oceanside community can't afford to pay for it themselves, then maybe it's time to let the ocean take some of the beaches it wants," he said.

HEADLINE: Economic Pulse: California;
California, Struggling in Slump, Faces High Hurdles to Recovery

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
Economists say salvation for California's staggering economy lies in small entrepreneurial companies like the Invitrogen Corporation here. A maker of gene-isolation kits and other products for biomedical research, it has shrugged off recession, expanding from 20 employees in 1989 to 105 today in a 30,000 square-foot plant amid tall pines in the La Jolla area.
But now that Invitrogen stands ready to expand even further, its brash young leaders may move all or part of the company to Oregon or Washington State. And therein lies the major question facing once-booming California -- home for one in eight Americans -- as it struggles through its longest economic slump since World War II: Is it too late to recapture the spirit that made California golden and prevent even the few bright spots like San Diego's thriving biotechnology industry from going dim too? 
 Much as they love San Diego, with its splendid climate and proximity to top medical research units like the Salk Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, Invitrogen's owners say manufacturing has become almost prohibitive in California. They cite uncertain water supplies, strict car-pooling rules, growing crime, poor schools and the high costs of workers compensation and health insurance, waste disposal, taxes, housing and legal fees.
It is so expensive to dispose of radioactive waste here that the company has a scientist with a Ph.D. sort the garbage daily.
 
A Costly Life Style
 "The problem with Southern California as we move from the research phase to manufacturing is that the cost of the life style here is prohibitive to the people we need to hire," said Lyle C. Turner of Invitrogen, who, with shoulder-length blond hair over a tennis shirt, hardly looks like the president of a company with $8 million in annual sales.
As national economic signs, holiday retail sales and new jobs point to recovery in most of the rest of the country, California finds itself in the odd company of New York and New England -- excluded from recovery, with little hope of improvement for at least a year. Indeed, even as the national unemployment rate dropped to 7.2 percent in November, California's rose, from 9.8 to 10.1 percent, for the highest rate of any industrial state.
In all, California has lost 808,000 jobs in the last 29 months, many of them high-paying aerospace and military-related ones, according to the California Department of Finance -- and this when it would take a quarter of a million new jobs a year just to keep employment even. The state has lost about 25 percent of its aerospace-manufacturing and construction jobs, with the heaviest losses in Southern California. Forecasts are that employment in the aerospace and electronics industries will drop by an additional 8 percent or 10 percent during 1993.
California smugness has turned into alarm, prompting a rare degree of cooperation between business and government to try to create new industries, like electric vehicles, to replace the declining military industry.
The Speaker of the State Assembly, Willie L. Brown Jr. of San Francisco, recently called for an economic conference of the state's business, political and academic leaders. Aides to Gov. Pete Wilson say the economy has become his chief priority, not least because he faces another $7.5 billion budget shortfall over the next 18 months.
"This is clearly one of the pivotal times in California's economic history," said Lee A. Grissom, senior economic adviser to Governor Wilson, a Republican. "I have traveled all around the state in the last few weeks. There are economic summits all over. They all ask the same thing: What can we do locally to keep things from getting worse?"
 
Problems
Flaws Masked By Prosperity

There are no ready answers. For California is struggling to overcome deep-seated problems that were masked by years of healthy economic growth, problems of deteriorating schools and roads and, at least in the opinion of many businessmen, environmental and other regulations that are oppressive. A kind of economic vertigo has set in whereby the forces that drove the California boom in the last decade, like its sizzling real estate market and immigration, have turned into negative factors.
"The California economy was like a beautiful house being undermined by termites," said Raymond Brady, research director at the Association of Bay Area Governments in San Francisco, "When an earthquake came, it began to collapse around us, and we couldn't figure out why."
Efforts to improve the economic climate have begun. For example, the San Diego City Council, in rare unanimity, recently approved an economic development package cutting the time needed to acquire permits for new and expanding businesses. In the troubled Los Angeles area, a venture called Calstart has been mounted to achieve the "conversion" from military to peacetime industry, so far an elusive notion. With the help of public agencies and major private companies, it is trying to create an electric-vehicle industry in Southern California to replace bomber manufacturing.
To the north, in the fiercely competitive cauldron of computer innovation known as Silicon Valley south of San Francisco, many companies have put aside their rivalries and antipathy to government to take part in "Joint Venture: Silicon Valley," a project to rescue the area from a decline in its international competitiveness.
The picture is complicated because it is uneven. Never having boomed during the 1980's like Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area has weathered the recession better than more populous Southern California and appears better poised for recovery. Also, the agricultural Central Valley has fared comparatively well, except for the state capital of Sacramento, hit by salary reductions for state employees.
Hardest hit is the Los Angeles area, stunned by the combined forces of military cutbacks, a decline in Japanese investments, a downtown office vacancy rate of nearly 30 percent, the recent civil disorders and last June's earthquake in the desert. Bad times have washed over into the outer reaches of Los Angeles's economic orbit, into Orange County, the "inland empire" areas of Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and down to San Diego. Southern California has suffered 80 percent of the state's job losses. All of this has caused falling real estate values and therefore grave troubles for California banks.
 
Prospects
Some Envision National Recovery
 The election of Bill Clinton, who won California overwhelmingly, has stirred a measure of hope. His focus on promoting American technological prowess and emphasis on environmental technology plays to California's strengths, though his promise to cut military spending even further is ominous.
Some economists, particularly Stephen Levy and Robert K. Arnold of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto, maintain that California's troubles are mainly tied to the national recession and military cuts rather than underlying flaws in California. They argue that a "vigorous" national recovery of 5 percent growth stimulated by the new President would bring full employment to California by the end of 1994.
But few other economists or executives are so optimistic. David Hensley, director of the Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles, sees continuing decline in California at least until next fall, and only "small growth" after that.
The president of the California Business Roundtable, Robert E. Wycoff, expects only a "modestly improved" state economy after two years. "And that's on the optimistic side," said Mr. Wycoff, who is president and chief operating officer of Los Angeles-based Arco. "Most see a long period of flatness of several years."
The San Francisco-based Roundtable, a nonpartisan group of top officers of major companies, recently issued a survey that found that executives and voters favored substantial reforms in the state's health insurance and workers' compensation rules.
The signs of troubles are obvious, in the acres of vacant office space in downtown Los Angeles, in the collapse of famed Los Angeles restaurants like L'Ermitage and Trumps, in the long rows of vacant storefronts in Hollywood and even Beverly Hills, in the ill fortune of people like Keta and Tom Nelson of Los Angeles. Ms. Nelson was recently laid off from her job as a bank clerk, her husband from his job as a service-station cashier, and they are preparing to leave for sunnier economic climes. "I don't think it's going to get any better," Ms. Nelson said. "Look around here and see how many people are out of work."
At the landmark Yamashiro Restaurant overlooking Hollywood, the owner, Thomas Y. Glover, says that business in November was down 30 percent from last November and that he was "doing very well" compared with other restaurants.
Even worse is construction. "You hear that employment is picking up, but our out-of-work lists are so long that you've got to lie down to read them," said Bill Perry of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, which represents about 45,000 carpenters in Southern California.
At a restaurant under construction on Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood, two men building a wooden floor said that they had resorted to buying old blue jeans and cowboy boots at garage sales and thrift stores and selling them to Japanese buyers in swap meets for five times the price. "Without my family's help, I'd be homeless," said one of them, Csaba Buzy, 25, laid off from his job as a Mercedes-Benz mechanic four months ago.
 
Bright Spots
Some Industries Are Growing
 But some light is emerging from all this darkness. Certain industries, like apparel design and manufacture, environmental services, foreign trade, motion picture and television production and health care have seen growth this year, much of it fueled by ambitious immigrants like Li-San Hwang, a Chinese civil engineer who is president of Tetra Tech of Pasadena. The company, which employs nearly 600 people and specializes in environmental cleanup of nuclear-weapons testing and production sites for the Government, grew by 30 percent this year and expects similar growth next year.
But economists say none of this will soon replace the hundreds of thousands of highly skilled engineering and technical jobs lost in the aerospace collapse.
To that end, though, an unusual effort has been mounted in an old plant where the Lockheed Corporation once assembled airplanes near Burbank Airport. Symbolically, the hangar has been converted into a laboratory for the emerging electric-vehicle industry led by Calstart, a nonprofit consortium of more than 40 companies and government agencies that hopes to gain $19.8 million in Federal and state grants over the next two years.
Calstart is premised on the notion that worldwide environmental demands for cleaner vehicles makes the Los Angeles area ideal to supply the parts and technology for such vehicles, using the idled expertise of aircraft and missile engineers. "We are taking what have been perceived as problems -- air pollution and the area's downturn -- and turning them into a competitive advantage," said Calstart's president, Michael J. Gage, a former deputy mayor of Los Angeles.
Calstart recently rolled out a prototype electric vehicle and is working on creating the framework for cleaner transportation, including building a network of charging stations, training mechanics and testing electric buses. The participants include all of California's major electric utilities and such companies as General Motors, Intel, I.B.M. and numerous small outfits making batteries, sensors and other components.
Nearly 400 miles to the north, another engine of California prosperity, the computer and semiconductor industry, remains relatively healthy compared to the slumping military production areas in Southern California. But even as demand for semiconductors and other products increases, high tech employment in the area has fallen by 42,000 jobs since 1987, partly because of higher productivity, partly because major companies like the Advanced Micro Devices Corporation of Sunnyvale, have placed their new chip-making plants in less expensive areas like Austin, Tex.
"We are creating manufacturing jobs for other regions," said Thomas C. Hayes, manager of corporate relations for Applied Materials of Santa Clara who is chairman of Joint Venture: Silicon Valley. It has taken advantage of hard times to bring together the valley's go-it-alone entrepreneurs who previously would have little to do with each other but who are now worried about what Mr. Hayes calls "this weird phenomenon of jobless economic growth."
With $1 million in seed money from the valley's corporate giants, Joint Venture has enlisted about 1,000 business executives and local government officials to hammer out solutions to the region's problems. "We are using a downturn like this to get things together that we could not have done in a go-go period," Mr. Hayes said. "These are maverick entrepreneurs, Somali warlords. Half did not know where City Hall was; now they do." The group is working on problems like traffic gridlock, housing and education problems.
Silicon Valley suffers not only from recession but also from dramatic changes in technological industries, said Douglas C. Henton, assistant director of the Center for Economic Competitiveness at SRI International, a Menlo Park research company engaged by Joint Venture. Companies are turning to machinery to raise productivity and buying components and business services elsewhere, often from distant locations in other states and foreign countries. Hence the seeming contradiction of higher sales and fewer jobs.
Mr. Henton said Silicon Valley was well poised to take advantage of the high-tech growth industries of the future, expected to be software development, bioscience, environmental technology and the application of digital technology to products like flat tubeless televisions.
"But we need to create a 21st-century infrastructure for that," he said, "the technical base, the work force, the regulatory environment." Joint Venture is exploring the possibility of wiring the entire valley with optic communications to ease connections between companies. "People are worrying now about the competitiveness of the region, not just their own firms," he said.
 
San Diego
Trying to Keep What It Has

1
Similar issues have begun to grip San Diego, with the fourth-largest concentration of biotechnology companies in the country. The 120 or so companies, mostly clustered in the Torrey Pines area near the University of California at San Diego, are one of the few sources of growth in an otherwise sagging local economy. Many are on the cutting edge of biomedical research, said Bryna W. Kranzler, associate director of Connect, a program set up by the university to ease contacts among the companies, government and research institutions.
But as they prepare to expand, to make money instead of burning it, she said these companies were looking elsewhere. "The C.E.O.'s enjoy the quality of life in San Diego, and the intellectual life," Ms. Kranzler said, but not the high housing costs and rents, water shortages, waste-disposal problems and insurance.
Consequently, other states have tried to lure away San Diego companies. One target is the Alliance Pharmaceutical Corporation, which is awaiting Federal approval to start production on its blood substitute for surgery, expecting to add 75 to 100 employees and 80,000 square feet of space. Company officials have been looking at sites in North Carolina, Texas, South Dakota and New York State. The company's executive vice president, Theodore D. Roth, said that he had not ruled out keeping production in San Diego but that he was dubious, considering the drought and other impediments.
"We are very dependent on water; our product is half water," he said, adding that insurance costs were 10 percent to 15 percent higher here than in other states and that the "general business climate" was often hostile. "There was always a perception in San Diego that people would come because it was California, that the weather and the Golden State were enough, that they did not have to try to attract business."
Responding to such complaints, the Mayor-elect of San Diego, Susan Golding, recently signaled her intention of keeping biotechnology companies by saying she favored financing manufacturing plants with the city's ability to issue bonds and giving guarantees of water to those companies in case of prolonged drought.
 
Entrepreneurs
Hoping to Nurture Creative Spirits
 Invitrogen, the research-kit maker, is the kind of company that has long flourished in the California entrepreneurial hothouse. It was started just five years ago by three friends, who furnished the first office in San Diego with carpet fished out of a disposal bin. Now they are doing $8 million annually in sales, projecting $60 million by 2000 -- and worrying about numbing matters like workers' compensation premiums and housing costs for new employees.
"Scientists take a significant hit in standard of living when they move here from the Midwest," said one of the founders, Joseph M. Fernandez. He added that the company was also having difficulty complying with car-pooling rules, in that scientists often worked odd hours and that the company had no regular shifts.
Still, Invitrogen is divided internally on whether to leave California. The production people want to move to Oregon or Washington State, while the researchers prefer to stay close to San Diego's biomedical nucleus. "From the research point of view, one of my major concerns is whether we can sustain the intellectual energy," said Invitrogen's research director, Malcolm J. P. Finlayson.
Some economists, like Mr. Arnold, argue that California can prosper even if manufacturing goes elsewhere, as long as companies like Invitrogen keep their research and administrative functions in the state. That view is not shared by Governor Wilson and his advisers, who have proposed a long list of reforms to change what Mr. Grissom, his economic adviser, calls "the whole arrogance California had manifested toward business."

Graphs/Map: "Looking for a Way Out"
 In the 1980's, California's economy was the picture of health. Unemployment kept pace with the national rate. Personal income, retail sales and construction grew steadily. But since 1990, unemployment has risen faster in California than in the nation and economic indicators have fallen.
 Graphs track average annual civilian unemployment rate for the U.S. and California since 1980 and percentage of manufacturing jobs lost in the U.S. and California from May 1990 to September 1992. Also tracked from 1980 to 1992 is Califonia's growth in income from previous year in per capita income, monthly average retail sales, monthly average value on building permits.

HEADLINE: MISSION TO SOMALIA;
Better Late Than Never, Aid Organizations Say

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Moved by images of suffering in Somalia and confident that donations can make a difference now that United States troops are in the country, Americans are contributing generously to a blizzard of fund-raising appeals, relief officials say.
Yet with satisfaction has come soul-searching among relief officials about the tardy response to the crisis by some agencies, as well as ill feeling over the recent stampede into Somalia by groups that had no operations there until press attention made fund-raising lucrative. 
 "Some N.G.O.'s seem to be cashing in on the images of hunger," said Angela Raven Roberts, a British-born anthropologist who has lived and worked in Africa for 25 years, referring to nongovernmental organizations. "Some of the newer ones going in all anxious to help could have been there a year and a half ago. They're going because there is a need, but also because they can take advantage of the publicity."
 
The Public Needs Pictures
 Jim Newton, a spokesman for World Vision, an American organization rushing to establish operations in Somalia, said: "All humanitarian organizations have some regrets that we didn't move in sooner, but part of the problem was that we did not have the funds. One of the dilemmas is that the public does not respond until they see pictures. When the TV began to broadcast pictures, people began to respond."
Several relief officials said some potential donors had asked why new aid is needed, since relief supplies have been piling up on Somali docks in recent weeks amid the country's disorder. But Charles Planck, a spokesman for CARE, said that now that the military intervention has reopened distribution channels, huge quantities of food supplies will be needed for at least six months to prevent further starvation. The International Committee of the Red Cross estimated this month that 4.5 million of the country's 6.5 million people need food aid.
 
3 American Agencies
 Before Somalia made headlines in July, only three American relief agencies were working there, along with a handful of European groups. The three were World Concern, a Seattle group; International Medical Corps, based in Los Angeles, and CARE.
CARE, which has operated in Somalia for a decade, has 170 staff workers in the country. It has coordinated the unloading and warehousing of United Nations food in Mogadishu and handled the distribution of food airlifted into two Somali towns by the American military and the organization of convoys of food to other relief agencies, according to Mr. Planck.
CARE officials have sought to emphasize their central role in the Somalia effort in a drive that has raised nearly $1 million since September, much of it recently. Among those giving money last week was an economics professor at Columbia University who wrote a $10,000 check to CARE.
"I don't spend all my salary and Somalia is the part of the world where people are in the worst conditions now," the professor said. "So that's why I did it." Another donor gave $3,000 to CARE.
"It's hard not to be generous when you see these pictures of people starving," she said. Both donors asked that their names be withheld.
The International Committee of the Red Cross, based in Switzerland, has been directly feeding more Somalis than any other group, operating nearly 900 feeding centers. The American Red Cross has raised $2.4 million this year to support the International Committee's work. The money has paid for the operation of 42 of the International Committee's 900 feeding centers, according to John Thomas, an American Red Cross vice president.
A smaller group that has been working in Somalia for about 10 years is World Concern, based in Seattle. The group's staff of 12 Americans and 165 Somalis has set up 75 feeding centers in and around Mogadishu and the southern port of Kismayu, said Fred Gregory, the group's director.
Since the crisis reached the American public's attention this summer, eight American and several foreign relief agencies have approached World Concern with donations and requests to collaborate on Somalia projects, Mr. Gregory said.
"This is a new experience to have people come to us and ask if they can help out, and I'm delighted that the world is finally responding," Mr. Gregory said. "What is a sensitive issue, however, is the new players that come in and start acting like experts, especially the ones with high-profile P.R. efforts."
One group working to establish operations in Somalia is Food for the Hungry, based in Scottsdale, Ariz. It is still developing plans and has no permanent staff in Africa yet.
A spokeswoman, Karen Randau, said the group had recently sent $600,000 worth of supplies to Somalia for distribution by other agencies. But after another relief agency challenged that figure, Food for the Hungry lowered the estimate to $450,000 and conceded that some of the supplies may have gone to feed Somali refugees in neighboring Kenya.
 
New Drive Going Well
 Nonetheless, a new drive appears to be going well. Food for the Hungry has recently mailed out 50,000 solicitations on the Somali crisis, and Ms. Randau said donations were already 90 percent above what the group received during its major drive last year, which centered on the Kurds in northern Iraq.
Another group that has recently moved into Somalia and is raising money is World Vision of Monrovia, Calif. The agency has not worked in Somalia since 1983, though it has been financing World Concern's Somalia work for four years.
In September, World Vision opened six feeding centers in and around the Baidoa, and its staff of 7 Westerners and 193 Somalis is expanding, according to Mr. Newton. The group says it plans to spend $8 million in the country during the next five years.
World Vision has bought extensive advertising time on television and in newspapers, according to Gary Roebbelen, World Vision's communications manager. Since August, the Somali effort has raised $4.3 million, he said.
"We have to strike while the iron is hot, because when the crisis ends the donations will drop off," Mr. Roebbelen said. "We really are pulling out all the stops on Somalia."

HEADLINE: Isuzu's Cutbacks Cause New Problems for G.M.

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The decision by Isuzu Motors Ltd. to stop building cars may be good news for its rivals in Japan's overcrowded auto market, but it is another setback for the biggest American auto maker, the General Motors Corporation.
On Saturday, Isuzu confirmed widespread speculation that it was getting out of the car business, citing high costs and poor sales. Isuzu also announced an alliance with the Honda Motor Company, under which it would supply sports utility vehicles to Honda, which will provide cars for Isuzu to sell through its dealer network. 
 The departure of Isuzu, which made fewer than 100,000 cars this year, will help to ease oversupply in the crowded Japanese market, which is also suffering from a recession.
 
Creates Gap for G.M.
 But for G.M., which owns 37.2 percent of Isuzu, the Japanese company's decision is a blow to its Geo line of low-priced cars. Isuzu will stop supplying the Geo Storm model at the end of 1993, leaving a hole in G.M.'s lineup.
A spokesman for G.M. said the company would be forced to stop selling the subcompact car at the end of next year, though G.M. would later revive the name.
A spokesman for G.M., David Hudgens, said that "there will be a gap of two model years" with no Storm model.
Isuzu, meanwhile, outlined plans to expand the marketing of its successful four-wheel-drive recreational vehicles, including the Trooper and Rodeo, and its trucks. The expansion will be helped by the strategic alliance with Honda.
Isuzu will make the Rodeo for Honda to sell under its own name in the United States and Japan, and Honda will supply Isuzu with cars for its Isuzu dealerships.
Honda hopes to sell 20,000 of the Rodeo models a year, mostly in the United States. The Rodeos are made in Tippecanoe, Ind., by Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc., of which Subaru's parent, Fuji Heavy Industries, owns 51 percent and Isuzu 49 percent.
Isuzu now sells 50,000 Big Horns, known as the Trooper in the United States, each year. It hopes to raise annual sales to 100,000 by 1994-95, officials said.
 
Move Was Predicted
 Industry analysts have long speculated that Isuzu would be forced by its losses to cut models and form ventures with other auto makers.
Isuzu, which is scheduled to announce its 1992 results on Tuesday, is likely to report a loss of more than $100 million, analysts said. It posted a $393 million loss in the year ended October 1991. As Isuzu's biggest shareholder, G.M. is hurt by the losses.
But Isuzu said the strategic shift would help lift its results strongly by 1994-95, when it expects an operating profit of $300 million. Isuzu said it was not having talks to change its affiliation with G.M.
A G.M. spokesman, Ronald Theis, said the American auto maker did not take a lead role in Isuzu's decision not to remain in the car business. "That's a strategic decision arrived at by Isuzu," he said.
As recently as Thursday, the companies announced an agreement to assemble Isuzu medium-duty trucks at G.M.'s assembly plant in Janesville, Wis.
G.M. said Isuzu would continue to supply the Geo Storm through the end of the 1993 model year. Chevrolet-Geo will not have a 1994 or 1995 Storm model but plans to offer a new Storm model in 1996 supplied by another auto maker.

Los Angeles Times Pulls Back From San Diego

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Dec. 20

 BODY:
While other cities have seen competition among newspapers disappear, this city, the nation's sixth largest, has the distinction of going from three daily metropolitan papers to one in 10 months.
On Friday, the San Diego County edition of The Los Angeles Times, begun in 1978, closed after its last press run. In February, two papers owned by Copley Press Inc. -- the morning San Diego Union and the afternoon Tribune -- were merged into The Union-Tribune. 
 The San Diego edition of The Times was gaining slightly in circulation and advertising, but not enough to keep it alive, said Phyllis Pfeiffer, the edition's general manager. The circulation of The Times in San Diego was some 60,000, while The Union-Tribune's daily average is 380,000.
"Our study of the long-term prospects showed we could continue to grow, but in small numbers," she said. "Otis Chandler's dream of being a newspaper from Santa Barbara to Tijuana isn't going to happen in this economy." Mr. Chandler, the noted former publisher of The Times, is now the chairman of the executive committee of the Times Mirror Company, which owns The Times.
Ms. Pfeiffer said that advertisers in Los Angeles were not interested in reaching readers in San Diego 100 miles away, and that when the military and aerospace industries in Southern California began to decline, so did advertising revenue.
The Times is now focusing its efforts on the San Fernando Valley and Orange County editions, where it competes more closely for readers and advertisers with The Daily News of Los Angeles and The Orange County Register. "These are bad days for the newspaper industry in general," said David Laventhol, publisher and chief executive of The Los Angeles Times and president of Times Mirror. "An industry evolution has been taking place since the advent of television, and we're seeing the end of head-to-head competition of metro dailies in most regions."
He said competition for advertisers and readers was now mainly between big metropolitan dailies and smaller local papers, with increasing pressure from more specific publications like "shoppers," free papers that consist largely of advertisements.
The Los Angeles Times expects to save about $8 million by closing its San Diego edition. "The view in 1978 was that there was an opportunity there," Mr. Laventhol said. "It turned out to be less so than we thought."
The Los Angeles Times does not release advertising figures on specific zoned editions, but overall ad linage for The Times has been falling quickly. The paper fell from 7.3 million inches of advertising in 1990 to 6.3 million in 1991. Figures for the period ended September show the decline continuing, The Times said. The Times's overall circulation is 1.1 million.
Russell Harris, acting editor of The Oceanside Blade Citizen, a 50,000-circulation paper in northern San Diego County, said that it was not just the economy. "The L.A. Times can't tell Oceanside readers what's going on in their neighborhoods," he said. "People still like to see their names in print."

HEADLINE: Job Growth in Region's Suburbs Outpaces Cities'

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
The dizzying boom of the 1980's dramatically and permanently shifted the economic geography of the New York region as the cities yielded to the outer suburbs their role as employment hubs, according to a new study by Rutgers economists and figures provided by state labor departments.
Not only have the suburbs outgrown the cities in absolute terms, they have also in most cases weathered the recession better. 
 In New Jersey, the trend toward employment sprawl found its starkest expression in the adjoining townships of Edison, Franklin and Piscataway. Together, the three townships support as many jobs, 115,129, as Newark, according to the Rutgers study. Newark, with 117,152, is still the state's leader in jobs, but with only half the number it had 40 years ago.
In New York State, Suffolk County added more jobs between 1979 and 1989 than Manhattan, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, and some of the sharpest growth of jobs by percentage was in upstate counties.
In Connecticut, the contrast was also stark: All of the net job growth in the state between 1979 and 1991 took place in towns of less than 50,000 population, which in the aggregate surpassed the state's larger cities as the place to find work, according to the State Economic Development Commission's figures.
 
'Greatest Deconcentration'
 "The decade of the 80's probably saw the greatest deconcentration of economic activity in the region's history," said James W. Hughes, a Rutgers economist and one of the report's authors.
"The dominant economic dynamic in the region took place in the suburban ring," he added. "That was where, clearly, the bulk of the job growth took place, where the bulk of the new office inventory was added and where the great majority of the retailing expansion came."
While the burgeoning job market in the suburbs meant stasis or decline for the region's cities, Dr. Hughes speculated that having the a broad range of suburban business campuses in addition to the core area in Manhattan is an advantage to the region that could benefit the cities.
"To some extent, it gives the regional economy a much greater diversity, and that will allow the region to compete more effectively," he said. "Some corporations clearly prefer a suburban option, so that if you combine our new suburbs with the unique centrality of Manhattan, you really have a wide set of options."
In New Jersey and Connecticut, the rising suburbs most brashly muscled the old cities aside in creating new service jobs in law, banking, insurance, retailing and real estate.
According to the Rutgers study, the strongest employment growth in New Jersey was in a widening arc of towns in Morris, Somerset and Middlesex Counties.
Meanwhile, the Connecticut figures disclose that, among cities of more than 50,000, heavy job losses in Bridgeport, East and West Hartford, New Britain, New Haven and Waterbury swamped gains in places like Stamford and Manchester.
The state's job growth was scattered over dozens of smaller suburbs, such places as Avon, outside Hartford; Branford, east of New Haven; Enfield, on the Massachusetts line, and Middletown, in the middle of the state.
On balance, Connecticut's cities of more than 50,000 lost 1,870 jobs from 1979 to 1989, less than 1 percent of their job total, while the rest of the state gained 157,000, an increase of 23.7 percent.
"These aren't just the suburbs anymore. These are the new, outer suburbs," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, head of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics' New York region. "Whoever heard of Hunterdon County in New Jersey? Yet it was the star of the decade in growth."
Dr. Hughes and his co-author, Joseph J. Seneca, also an economist, report in "The Suburban Employment Perimeter" that the growth of job centers represents the third stage of suburban development.
The suburbs' first flowering, as bedroom hamlets on commuter rail lines, began around the turn of the century. It was followed by the second phase, developing retail centers, after World War II, which set the stage for what came next, the authors wrote:
"The invasion of large-scale post-industrial corporate settlements, their service retinues and a complete roster of metropolitan functions marked the advent of suburbia's third generation. Added to the inventory of suburban functions in the 1980's was the role of primary work-place destination."
Of the five New Jersey municipalities with the greatest increase in jobs between 1982 and 1990, four are suburban: Edison, Secaucus, Franklin and Parsippany-Troy Hills. The exception, Atlantic City, was an anomaly, Dr. Hughes pointed out, since its growth resulted from the rise of legalized gambling.
Conversely, of the five biggest job-losers, four are cities: Newark, Linden, Hoboken and Elizabeth. The fifth is another anomaly: Lower Alloways Creek, in Salem County, made it to the list because it lost thousands of short-term jobs when a big electric generating plant was completed mid-decade.
In New York State, an old resort area, Saratoga County, registered the biggest percentage increase in jobs between 1979 and 1989, adding 16,000 jobs for a 66 percent increase. Putnam County was No. 2 in job growth, adding 5,800 jobs, while Staten Island was third with 23,000 new jobs for the decade. Tompkins County, in the Southern Tier upstate, was the fourth-fastest-growing job center, with 13,400 new jobs, and Suffolk, adding 146,000 jobs in the decade, was fifth in percentage increase but first in absolute numbers.
In June 1991, the last date for which figures are available, Manhattan had 1,744,601 jobs, and by any measure, Manhattan, is still the core of the state's jobs.

HEADLINE: Seeking a Moderate Image, Mormons Expel Extremists

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: MANTI, Utah, Dec. 18

 BODY:
In a move that underscores the desire of the Mormon Church to cultivate a more centrist image, the church has started to excommunicate many of its ultraconservative followers.
Some experts on the church describe the action as a purge, an effort to do away with extremists whose talk of conspiracies and impending world ruin do not square with a fast-growing faith eager to enhance its standing in the American mainstream. 
 The Salt Lake Tribune reported that hundreds of dissidents have recently been expelled in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada and Utah, perhaps the largest wave of excommunications in the church since the 1850's, when thousands of followers were ousted, including for reasons like poor hygiene and low church attendance.
 
'Grossly Exaggerated'
 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not release information on excommunications, but a church spokesman, Don LeFevre, said the numbers had been "grossly exaggerated."
Michael Quinn, a former professor of history at Brigham Young University and an expert on the church, said: "The church clearly wants to distance itself from the right wing. But this is a witch hunt."
In this tiny town in the isolated Sanpete Valley, where 143 years ago Brigham Young directed pioneers to build a Mormon temple, a dozen or so of the excommunicated followers gathered recently to pray and commiserate.
"They call us apostates," said Steve McKinley, a 39-year-old carpenter. "But it's the church that has changed from early doctrine, not us."
The dissidents here claim church leaders kept them under surveillance and took the license plate numbers of cars parked at a house where ultraconservatives were meeting.
By some measures, the action seems to represent a stunning turnabout for an institution that has traditionally been regarded as a staunch ally of political hard-liners on the right.
Indeed, the church president, Ezra Taft Benson, was seen as a philosophical ally of the ultraconservative John Birch Society and a champion of right-wing causes before he became infirm. He is 93.
But others in the church hierarchy differed sharply with Mr. Benson, even before the decline of his health. And they apparently now hold greater sway on church positions.
Extremists have long been a source of embarrassment for the Mormon Church, which has 1.8 million members around the world. The rare, but highly publicized standoffs between police and Mormon survivalists or polygamists, for example, often resurrect a caricatured image of church members in the minds of people otherwise unfamiliar with Mormons.
"The last thing the Mormon leadership wants," one church expert said, "is another picture of some armed fanatic in a bunker."
 
Promoting Mainstream Image
 The church banned polygamy more than a century ago, but some groups of "traditional Mormons" live in plural marriages in Colorado City, Ariz., and Hilldale, Utah.
Experts say the church has long sought to promote a more mainstream view of the faith. The church pays for an extensive campaign of television commercials, for example, that deal with everyday issues, like the demands of parenting, rather than heavy-handed religious appeals.
Excommunications and lesser forms of reprimand are handled by bishops, who govern each congregation, or ward, and the presidents of each "stake," which has jurisdiction over several wards apiece.
There are generally only two grounds for excommunication: apostasy, or teaching false doctrine, and immorality.
"Excommunications are very rare," said Mr. LeFevre, the church spokesman, who disputed the idea that Mormons have been expelled for political beliefs. "It's neutral on politics."
He added: "But the church doesn't get into predicting the end of the world. And if somebody is doing that, they're off base."
Church leaders have recently warned Mormons in speeches against fundamentalist interpretations of Scripture or early church doctrine. In a recent speech, Elder Malcolm Jeppson urged followers "not to take out of context words and statements made by church presidents that were given at a different time and circumstance than the present."
And Boyd K. Packer, an apostle in the church, warned against "colonies of cults" who "tell of impending political and economic chaos."
One of the fears of the ultraconservatives is the emergence of a single world government, and they claim that President Bush tipped his hand after the Persian Gulf war by hailing "a new world order."
Ultraconservatives also express concerns about "the mark of the beast," a Satanic code that some say is inscribed in the lines on the bar codes used at grocery stores.
Linda Erickson, a divorced mother of eight, said she taught her children at home rather than expose them to the "anti-Jesus Christ teachings" of the public schools. She said a church official summoned her and demanded an explanation of her fears.
 
Expects to Be Excommunicated
 "He said, 'Are you telling me you think the children will be given the mark of the beast in school?' "
She said she replied, "I don't know; it could happen."
Ms. Erickson is scheduled to stand trial at church court later this month, and expects to be excommunicated.
Jim Harmston, a retired college professor, said he was excommunicated because he adhered to early church doctrine. "The church wants to be more acceptable to the rest of the world," he said. "This is all about image management."
Mr. Harmston and his wife, Elaine, said they were reported to church authorities by a woman who demanded to know their views on polygamy. Mr. Harmston said that while he did not practice polygamy he viewed it as a "true principle" that would someday return.
Mrs. Harmston said: "When she heard that, she got all bent out of shape. She said, 'I'm not going to be in any plural marriage.' "
The excommunications have set off a debate throughout Mormonism, and many liberals have come to the defense of the ultraconservatives.
"The church used to attack liberals and now it's attacking conservatives," said Mr. Quinn, who said he resigned from his job at Brigham Young University in a dispute over his research into Mormon history. "People think that's inconsistent. It's not inconsistent at all. The leadership just wants everybody to be in the center."
"I probably disagree on every political and religious point with those who were excommunicated," he added. "But I still think this is an outrage."

HEADLINE: New Bias Case Fuels Dispute With Dinkins

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
A 41-year-old black man told the police that he was severely beaten without provocation on a street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, early yesterday by 10 to 20 Hasidic men, some shouting racial slurs. The police listed it as a bias crime, and Mayor David N. Dinkins called it another case of racially motivated violence in a troubled city.
But later in the day the police said they were looking into reports by Hasidic community leaders that gave a different interpretation to the case. These suggested that the attack had stemmed from an attempt by the black man, Robert Johnson, to steal a car and that a group of Hasidim had chased and caught him and that he had been injured in their efforts to subdue him. 
 Mr. Johnson, who the police said is unemployed but sometimes pumps gasoline for tips at a Williamsburg service station, was released after treatment at St. Vincent's Hospital for facial cuts and body bruises. No arrests were made in the case, and detectives continued last night to refer to Mr. Johnson as a cooperating victim, not a suspect. But much about the matter remained in doubt.
 
Conflicting Versions
 With its racial overtones and conflicting versions from black and Jewish witnesses, with the Mayor's swift -- some said premature -- response even as crucial details were unfolding, the incident echoed the politically explosive case of Ralph Nimmons, a homeless black man who was beaten by 20 to 30 Hasidic men, some of them muttering racial slurs, in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood on Dec. 1.
Mr. Nimmons, 25, who had a record for burglary and other crimes, said he was rummaging for clothing in an alley. But Hasidic Jews said that he had tried to break into a Lubavitcher headquarters at the scene and that he had been injured when he resisted efforts by Hasidim to subdue and hold him for the police.
Mayor Dinkins, whose quest for re-election next year has become entangled in bitter controversy over his handling of the city's racial problems, was widely criticized for being too quick to denounce the beating of Mr. Nimmons as a racially motivated crime.
Yesterday, after initial police reports of the Williamsburg case went to City Hall -- reports calling it a bias crime and saying an independent witness had confirmed the victim's story -- the Mayor issued a statement denouncing the attack on the black man as well as an unrelated verbal assault on Saturday in which a white man reported that anti-Semitic slurs had been flung at him from a passing car.
"We cannot permit the few intolerant individuals to threaten the very fabric of our city's social life for the majority of New Yorkers," the Mayor declared. "We must work together to replace bigotry with benevolence, anger with acceptance, and hatred with humanity."
But later, after the police said they were looking into conflicting accounts in the beating, Rabbi David Niederman, executive director of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg, called the Mayor's statement "very premature," and said official comments should be reserved until all facts had been established.
"The answer to crime is not violence, and we condemn racial or religious epithets under all circumstances," Rabbi Niederman said. "However, it is not clear at this moment that this incident was motivated by racial animus. It is premature to call it bias when there is other information that this is the result of someone committing a crime."
 
Tensions and Resentments
 Williamsburg, a community of tenements, factories, warehouses and industrial buildings bordering the old Brooklyn Navy Yard and the Williamsburg Bridge, has long been a setting of tensions between Hasidic residents on its north side and Hispanic residents on its south side, bordering the predominantly black Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.
The Jews of Williamsburg are mostly Satmar Hasidim, who are distinct from, and sometimes rivals of, the Lubavitcher Hasidim of Crown Heights. But for all its tensions, resentments and misunderstandings, the area has seen no major racial or ethnic violence in recent years.
Little was known of Mr. Johnson, the focus of yesterday's incident, who gave his address as 153A Lexington Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, about 10 blocks south of the scene of the assault. A woman at that address, Ethelmal Dixon, said she and her two daughters lived with Mr. Johnson.
The police said the attack occurred about 1 A.M. at Wallabout Street and Franklin Avenue, an all-but-deserted intersection surrounded by warehouses and industrial buildings. Mr. Johnson told investigators he was walking by when he saw a white man and a black man by a parked car.
He said he spoke to them, learned that the car had stalled and offered to try to fix it in exchange for a ride home. The strangers agreed, he said. But as he leaned over to look at the problem, he said, the white man walked away and the black man ran away, behavior that appeared to suggest that the car had been stolen.
Suddenly, Mr. Johnson said, he looked up and found himself surrounded by 10 to 20 men in Hasidic garb. He said they punched him in the face, kicked him and shouted anti-black slurs. He said he was also struck by a car driven by one of the assailants, who then fled.
 
Call From a Witness
 The police said they received a call to 911 from a witness who described an assault against a black man by Hasidim in progress at the intersection. But when officers arrived minutes later, no one was there, the police said. Mr. Johnson was found two blocks away, bleeding from facial cuts. He was standing by a telephone booth and said he was about to call 911 to report the assault.
On the basis of Mr. Johnson's account, the police listed the case as a bias-related crime and Mayor Dinkins issued his statement, coupling the incident with another on Saturday in which unknown men in a passing car had shouted anti-Semitic remarks at a 33-year-old white man walking at 50th Street and 12th Avenue in Borough Park, Brooklyn.
The race of the men in the car was unknown, the police said. The complainant in the verbal assault, whose name was not released, was not physically injured, and police officials said they had no information on whether he was Jewish or, if so, had been identifiable to those in the car as Jewish.
 
A Different Account
 Hours after the Mayor's statement, members of the Hasidic community went to the 90th Precinct station and gave the police a different account of what had happened to Mr. Johnson. They said a group of Hasidic men, whom they did not identity, had seen him trying to break into a car and had chased, caught and subdued him.
Rabbi Niederman said that the police "have received and are investigating information that the victim was interrupted breaking into an automobile, by the vehicle owner, immediately before the incident occurred." He said he had no idea who inflicted the beating and he made no attempt to justify the violence.
But he said: "Not every incident involving people of different backgrounds is bias-related, and too-casual application of the term diminishes its value. We need all of the facts relating to the incident and the auto break-in reviewed by the District Attorney in a fair and complete way as soon as possible."
Lieut. Joseph Heffernan, commander of the 90th Precinct detectives, said last night that there were indications that a car break-in had preceded the assault, but he noted that Mr. Johnson was cooperating and that investigators were still trying to sort out the facts.
"We're trying to be fair to everybody," he said.

HEADLINE: Some Voices Missing At Clinton's Conference

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
After nearly 20 hours of talk in Little Rock, Ark., last week about the economy, the intriguing question is, "What wasn't said?"
Plenty, if you ask some economists who did not attend President-elect Bill Clinton's economic conference. 
 "People in Little Rock weren't a representative sample," said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard professor. "Solow, Blinder and Tobin are great economists, but they are from the more Keynesian end of the spectrum." He was referring to Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate at M.I.T., Alan Blinder of Princeton and James Tobin, a Nobel laureate at Yale.
 
Expansion Is Dismissed
 Small wonder, said Professor Mankiw and others, that little was discussed at the meeting about the distinct likelihood that an economic expansion may already be under way. Several prominent economists who held forth at the conference, including Professor Tobin, pooh-poohed recent upbeat economic numbers and proposed going ahead with a large dose of added deficit spending.
Had Robert Lucas, an economist at the University of Chicago and one of the nation's most prominent anti-Keynesians, been there, he said he would have made a different point: "The economy's in much better shape than either side thought in the campaign. Why not move on to other issues?"
As it happens, many economists, especially younger ones, do not think that fiscal fine-tuning really does much to smooth out the ups and downs of the business cycle; they also believe that deficit spending aimed at getting the economy moving often ignites inflation.
"My view is that the short-run problem is a much smaller problem than the long-run," Professor Mankiw said. "If it diverts Clinton from the long-run issues, he shouldn't think about it at all. He should leave it to Alan Greenspan."
 
Costs Versus Benefits
 Another point of view barely heard in Little Rock last week was skepticism about big government in general and government intervention in business decisions in particular, a skepticism that became especially widespread among younger economists in the 1970's and 1980's.
"I'm skeptical of the benefits of all these new programs, not because we can't afford them," Professor Lucas said. "We're a rich country; we can afford anything. The benefits aren't as big as the costs."
The skepticism is most intense when it comes to industrial and trade policy.
"We want to encourage high-tech industries and trade," said Christina Romer, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. "And there may be a role for government."
She continued: "What we didn't see at the Little Rock conference is a sense of caution about where government weighs in. Government may screw up. It may choose the wrong industry or encourage tons of lobbying. I'd be much happier with across-the-board research and development tax credits than with government setting up a bunch of Sematechs or saying one industry's R.& D. is the right kind of R.& D."
The most notable gap at Little Rock, however, was details on what economists like to call the hard choices -- the sacrifices necessary to achieve a goal, whether it's more public investment, higher savings or cheaper health care.
"The big thing that was not done in Little Rock was to address economic problems in terms of trade-offs," said Alan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh who heads the monetarist Shadow Open Market Committee.
"Everything pays for itself," he said. "We can have investment without saving. We can have protection without retaliation. We can have the expansion in all sorts of command-and-control regulation -- environmental, labor, whatever -- without any effects on the economy. That's baloney."
Vice President-elect Al Gore's suggestion that no tradeoffs were needed between environmental regulation and economic growth was also received skeptically by some economists.
"The rhetoric that's come out of this transition that suggests that strict environmental regulation is automatically free is just wrong," said Richard Schmalensee, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who served on President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers.
 
Global Well-Being
 Finally, what struck some economists was that despite an eloquent plea for more American leadership on behalf of the former Soviet Union, there was little sense in Little Rock that America ought to invest in economic security in the rest of the world.
"Clearly, we have to fix our own economy," said Stanley Fischer, an economist at M.I.T. and former chief economist at the World Bank, "but we simply will not be able to do that by taking a nice vacation from the troubles of Latin America and Eastern Europe.
"Neglecting Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union is very dangerous to us because we're all going on the assumption that the end of hostilities is a fact," he said. "It's not a fact. The end of hostilities depends on economic assistance which we haven't yet provided."
For all their skepticism about the Little Rock meeting, some economists regard it as an unqualified political success.
"After four years of watching the Bush team amateurs, it's fun to watch the pros play again," said Martin Anderson, President Ronald Reagan's economic and domestic policy adviser in 1981 and 1982. "Clinton has just done a brilliant political job of building support for whatever he wants to do."
