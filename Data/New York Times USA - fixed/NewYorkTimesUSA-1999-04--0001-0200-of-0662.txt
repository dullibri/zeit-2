HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
In Every Color, Finding the Blues

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Looking for a sure cure for the blues?
Just head for the New Victory Theater in the new Times Square and latch on to a ticket for "It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues." 
 Now, that title bears some parsing, because this rich, evocative, rousing show, with some 50 musical numbers ranging from African chants and spirituals to Delta and Chicago blues, with plenty of stops along the dusty roads, river banks, broken country hearts and juke joints in between, is more than a musical feast.
Besides its cornucopia of splendidly interpreted song, "It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues," through April 11, is a potent blend of visual eloquence and historical sweep that engages the eye and touches the heart while its songs soothe the ear, occasionally work mischief on the funny bone and always raise the spirits.
As the splendid cast assembled by the much-praised Crossroads Theater Company of New Brunswick, N.J., applies its individual and collective vocal, musical and actorly talents to songs like "I've Been Living With the Blues," "Blues Man," "My Man Rocks Me" and "St. Louis Blues," photographs projected onto screens behind the performers brim with history.
Here are sketches of slave auctions and pictures of thirsty women working the fields with their little children nearby, a black man dangling from a lyncher's noose, rural poverty, a riverside baptism, country churches, the great blues man Robert Johnson, and changing fashions in clothes and entertainment, as well as the economic, social and cultural upheaval surrounding the great black migration from the South to Chicago.
Presented in association with the San Diego Repertory Theater and the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, "It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues" is based on an idea by Ron Taylor, who wrote it with Randal Myler, its director, and Lita Gaithers, Charles Bevel and Dan Wheetman.
Mr. Taylor, Mr. Bevel and Mr. Wheetman, with Gretha Boston, Carter Calvert, Eloise Laws and Gregory Porter constitute the powerhouse lineup of singers who step up, step out and put over one number after another. Depending on the song, they can be heartbreakers, heartbroken, sexpots or absolute rapscallions. And after intermission, when they trade their simple attire, rustic airs and simple instruments for shapely gowns and stylish suits, each seems good-naturedly determined to outdo another, as they make their way with the backing of an enhanced band through pieces like "I'm Your Hoochie-Coochie Man," the sly, slinky, humorous "Crawlin' King Snake," "Walkin' After Midnight," the bitter "Strange Fruit" and "Let the Good Times Roll."
By this time the band is making the floor vibrate, and the cast and audience are raising the roof.

HEADLINE: Relying on the Competence Of Strangers

BYLINE: By JENNY LYN BADER 

 BODY:
A MANHATTAN jury was startled when a woman carrying a garment bag interrupted a murder trial. She turned out to be the justice's personal shopper. "She took out three or four outfits, and the judge chose from among them," said Kevin Scott, one of the jurors. Then the trial resumed.
A Sun Microsystems engineer in Silicon Valley, his wife and their 3-year-old son had not slept for two nights after the boy misplaced his favorite teddy bear. Les Concierges, a San Francisco-based company that runs bothersome errands internationally, found a replica 2,000 miles away. 
 And Linda Rothschild, the president of Cross It Off Your List, a personal services company in Manhattan, bubble-wrapped homemade matzohs and sent them to Hawaii by Federal Express in time for a Passover dinner.
From the specialists who locate objects of desire to those who locate other specialists, there are now alluring experts for every household quest. With people spending more hours at work than a decade ago, the do-it-yourself movement, as an approach to home decoration and an outlook on life, has declined, giving way to a wide-ranging "let others do it" trend. Its credo is simple: to save time, just delegate tasks to pick up the dry cleaning, pamper the pets, coddle the offspring. Emerson, advocate of individualism, would be alarmed to learn that these others include professional organizers, new mentors called "life coaches" and household managers -- updated butlers who will supervise any other others you may hire.
Some see the boom in personal services as a sign of rising polarization and specialization: the rich get richer, and the poor get to run their errands. But some of the runners aren't poor, and many of their clients aren't rich. What they are is overworked, insecure and increasingly dependent on the competence of strangers.
"We want to give that custodian, that administrative assistant, that salesperson, the feeling that he can get the same thing that the C.E.O. gets," said Phil Wexler, an executive vice president of Les Concierges, which has 600,000 corporate and private customers. One client had Les Concierges orchestrate his marriage proposal. And last Thanksgiving, 27 million Americans ordered in.
Whatever happened to self-reliance? During the last two decades, employment in private-sector day-care centers increased by more than 250 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And that's not counting the many au pairs and sitters operating without licenses.
Pets now have sitters, too -- not only cats and dogs but also ferrets, snakes and birds. "Ferrets are getting popular," said Marianne McDermott, the executive director of the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters, which is based in Washington and whose members visit an estimated 169,000 households a year. For $45, the Puddles pet service, in Manhattan, offers pet sleep overs, in which an employee has a slumber party with your pet when you leave town. And it has a 24-hour beeper service for last-minute business travelers who suddenly need to page a pet sidekick.
Things were not always this way.
In the summer of 1976, with the do-it-yourself movement flourishing, John Spadola, a private-school math teacher, decided to transplant his family from the Upper West Side to a mountain in rural Maine. He planned to build a house by himself from scratch, no contractors or decorators allowed. His 6-year-old daughter, Meema, learned to build a fire and immersed herself in the "Little House on the Prairie" books.
Like most postmodern pioneers, they found that doing it yourself is harder than it looks. Mr. Spadola's family ended up living in a tent from June until October. Today, his house is still not finished.
By the 1990's, customers had become so overwhelmed that the Home Depot, the dream mall for the truly motivated, and Ikea, the home-assembly furniture empire, added decorating departments with design consultants. So did ABC Carpet and Home, Pottery Barn, Ethan Allen and Hechinger's.
A continuing nationwide study begun in 1995 by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University shows that many projects historically done on a do-it-yourself basis are now being hired out to professional contractors. "During the 70's and 80's, there was an awful lot of do-it-youself home remodeling," said Kermit Baker, the director of the study and a senior research fellow at the center. "And there is less of that done now than there was 10 years ago, and we project there will be less of it in 10 years from now."
The number of hours a woman spent on housework in America dropped from 27 hours a week in 1965 to 15.6 hours in 1995, said John Robinson, the director of the Americans' Use of Time Project, a national survey conducted through the University of Maryland.
The drop in drudgery chores reflects many social shifts -- more women in the workforce, more men agreeing to vacuum -- but it also portends the privatization of housework, which now extends beyond drilling and dusting to the mere act of being at home.
Les Concierges will wait around for the cable guy or the plumber, take your dog to the vet, pick up a guest from the airport. Les Concierges procured a live Siberian tiger for one client and a World War II military tank for a private event. "It had to be fully operational," said Valerie Raszka, the company's director of marketing relationships.
Once available only to corporate clients, Les Concierges now offers a full range of services to private members for a monthly fee of $500.
Ms. Rothschild, of Cross It Off Your List, once obtained a British telephone booth for a party. More typically she helps customers move households or overhaul closets. "Paper is a big problem for a lot of people," said Ms. Rothschild, whose rates start at $65 an hour.
But many personal services, often part time or once in a lifetime, are no longer just for the rich. Starting at rates of $15 an hour, errand-service providers will do your holiday gift-shopping. For $12 to 15, a pet sitter will visit a lonely tarantula. For $8 to $16 a person per meal, a personal chef will get fresh groceries, visit your home and make your favorite food for your family. David MacKay, a co-founder and the executive director of the United States Personal Chef Association, which started in 1991 with five members and now has nearly 2,500 members nationwide, estimates that 60,000 clients use personal chefs. He said that he and his wife, Susan Titcomb, the other co-founder, wanted to take having a personal chef "out of the realm of the wealthy," as housekeeping services had done regarding private maids. The average combined family income of surveyed customers is $80,000. Mr. MacKay believes the service is so popular because it caters to individual whims. "When you go out to your favorite restaurant, you can't say to the chef, 'I really like your beef stroganoff, but can you make it a little extra spicy and leave out the onions?' " he said. Chefs are trained to create anything from creme brulee to chitlins.
The idea behind subcontracting the personal is to simplify one's life. But it doesn't always work that way. "Finding the right people to delegate these things to is not easy," said Pepper Schwartz, a sociology professor at the University of Washington in Seattle. "You may be spending more to delegate things than you should. You may also lose the pride in creation of the actual experience. You may also lose some experience of your own creativity."
All this delegating does create jobs. Eileen Appelbaum, the research director of the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research group, said that countries that have experienced the most rapid employment growth, like the United States, Britain and Sweden, are those in which household services and personal services have increased. "The real problem confronting the industrialized economies is how to provide these personal services without impoverishing the workers who provide them or having a tax burden that burdens the middle class excessively," she said. "We haven't solved that problem."
But are these the jobs we really want to be creating? Prof. Juliet Schor, a Harvard economist, said the rise of personal services reflects "an increasing polarization of good jobs and bad jobs." Professor Schor, an author, whose books include "The Overspent American" (1998), published by Basic Books, said: "It's a sort of new servant economy in a slightly different form, because people are not specialized in one employer. You don't have all-purpose servants -- you hire five different servants, and the servant has five different masters."
With so many others just a cell-phone call away, it is hard to remember to look for the answers within. Meema Spadola, who is now 29 and a filmmaker living in Manhattan, believes the hands-on ethic of her childhood taught her crucial lessons. She admits that she wouldn't try to build a house herself now. "But I made a film," she said. And she still feels nostalgic in hardware stores.
Carolyn Goldstein, the author of "Do It Yourself: Home Improvement in 20th-Century America" (Princeton Architectural Press, 1998), said that there is a "small niche of people who really take this stuff seriously and have a lot of skill comparable to a professional level of skill." She admires friends who do their own sanding. But she doesn't have time to do it herself, at home in Boston. "I don't really have that many hobbies," she said. "Nor am I going to go around slapping up aluminum everywhere."
Other than Martha Stewart, few are willing to slap up aluminum everywhere. "We don't make our own candles anymore," Professor Schwartz said. "Should we spin our own linen? Imagine women's lives in the 18th century. We don't want to get so nostalgic that we forget how little of our time was left when we really had to be self-sufficient."
Delegating one's personal life to others has obvious drawbacks: the loss of family time, of self-expression, of basic abilities. And with design consultants and personal shoppers in every other store, there is no need to develop personal taste. Mr. Scott, the Manhattan juror, not only was surprised that the State Supreme Court justice allowed her personal shopper in the courtroom, but also marveled at the justice's other decision. "If you ask me, I think she chose the wrong outfit," he said.
(This reporter has never consulted a personal shopper but did once hire an organization consultant. The "organizer" completed two hours of filing and went home, forgetting her sweater. The irony was too delicious to ignore: I was relying on the organizational techniques of an individual who had the same drive toward entropy that I had.)
And a message left one morning with the National Association of Professional Organizers, a group based in Austin, Tex., with an answering service stating that calls are retrieved daily, went unreturned until the next day.
Then there is the potential for pure disaster, from the infamous au pair convicted of shaking a Boston baby to death, to the more obscure Upper West Side dog walker fired for losing the dog. It was the walker's first day on the job. Which begs the question of all who would subcontract important tasks: How do you distinguish between the truly qualified and the cooing impostor? Worse, how do you tell if your life coach knows a thing about life?
At least with chitlins, you can tell whether they're chitlins.

HEADLINE: Pepsi Spinoff in Lackluster Stock Offering

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
An initial public offering yesterday by Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. provided a stark contrast to the pyrotechnics of recent Internet offerings.
In a spinoff from its parent company, Pepsico Inc., Pepsi Bottling sold 100 million shares at $23 each, for a total of $2.3 billion, which will be used to pay off debt. 
 The initial offering price was settled at the low end of the estimated range of $23 to $26, an indication that prepricing demand was less than the company had anticipated.
The stock closed at $21.6875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts were quick to distinguish Pepsi Bottling Group's offering from the string of highly successful recent Internet deals, whose phenomenal openings have conditioned investors into expecting huge first-day gains.
"This is an old-fashioned business that has prospered internationally," said Robert Mescal, an analyst with the Institute for Econometric Research in Deerfield Beach, Fla. "It has assets and a well-grounded financial background. There's nothing to get too excited about; it's just another soda company. But on the other hand, a very valuable asset to your portfolio."
Mr. Mescal said investors were expected to view Pepsi Bottling as a long-term investment.
With 155 million shares outstanding after the sale, the offering created a market capitalization for Pepsi Bottling of about $3.5 billion.
Pepsi Bottling's offering was the largest so far this year, and one of the five largest initial offerings ever, according to Securities Data/Thomson Financial.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Who's Losing NATO?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NATO's military objective was clear: to "degrade" Serbia's ability to drive the ethnic Albanians out of its province of Kosovo.
Some degradation. After a week of Milosevic's ethnic cleanskrieg, a third of the unwanted population has been driven out, many civilians murdered, the Kosovo Liberation Army decimated. Slow-moving NATO's bluff was called and fast-moving Serbia is winning the war. 
 Why? One reason is that Clinton's poll-following and wholly unnecessary promise of no use of ground troops emboldened the Serbian dictator. Another is that our cautiously phased air campaign concentrated on Serbian air defenses, thereby protecting our pilots, rather than combining that with an attack on Serbian field forces as they swiftly carried out their savage sweep.
In the face of seven days of defeat, NATO will now punish Serbia by bombing government buildings in Belgrade. That may salve our pride, but an equivalent discomfort -- an evacuation of the Pentagon -- would not stop America's ability to wage war. Pinpoint bombing of Belgrade headquarters will only solidify Serbian patriotic support for Milosevic.
We will also take more risks flying lower over Kosovo. That may take out 400 tanks and heavy artillery pieces now shelling towns, but will not stop the panicked exodus driven by men with rifles.
That leaves the West on a classic Vietnam spot: Serbia, the subpower, is fighting to win, while NATO, the superpower, is painfully escalating as it yearns to settle. To end brutal internal aggression against innocents, we have to break that pattern.
On the military front, beyond tactical air attacks on the cleanskrieg, NATO bombers should darken Belgrade. The removal of electricity would disrupt military communications and remind triumphant Serb leaders of the greater human hardship being inflicted by their orders on Kosovars. Then we should target industrial plants around Belgrade and Nis, and sink all Serbian naval vessels.
Ground troops? The prospect of body bags is anathema to Bill Clinton despite his bluster about genocide. Without his willingness to ask Congress to put our troops where his mouth is, Europeans and even Turks will not take on the nation that bloodily battled Hitler and stood off Stalin.
What can be done is to mass a NATO ground force near Albania and Macedonia borders, protecting and training a K.L.A. guerrilla force. The very presence of five armored divisions nearby, prepared for action under air supremacy, would radically change the local power equation.
Economic pain can be inflicted by the seizure of Serbian assets around the world to subsidize the upkeep of refugees. Psychological war can be waged by shortwave, leaflet and even the Internet, to Serbs now getting only Milosevic propaganda. Just as fissures will develop within the NATO alliance, political splits in the initial Serbian solidarity should be exploited.
On the diplomatic front, forget the Russians. To them, keeping Kosovo under Serbian rule means keeping Chechnya under Russian rule. Primakov's Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, said this week that NATO officials, not Serbian killers, should be tried as war criminals for their "undisguised genocide." The long-term Russian interest is to diminish NATO; Primakov cannot be its intermediary.
Our former political goal of an autonomous Kosovo under Serbian sovereignty has been overtaken by atrocity. Take the mushy offer we made at Rambouillet off the table. The allies should now stand for a separated Kosovo and be willing to consider a partition plan that lets Serbia keep revered historic sites but joins most of the area long populated by Albanians to Albania.
After his victorious first week, Milosevic will not hear of it. He sees what has not happened to Saddam Hussein's Iraq and logically assumes nothing serious will happen to his Serbia. We have not yet reached the end of the beginning.
But after sustained strategic and tactical bombing; after an economic blockade and asset seizure that squeezes his political supporters; after the buildup of troops on his borders that protects the seekers of vengeance, and might just roll tanks forward to establish fortified havens for innocents -- after all that, as crowds now cheering in Belgrade start to grumble about shortages and isolation, the conqueror of unarmed Kosovo might be more inclined to trade a little land for peace with Europe.

U.S. and Europe at Impasse On New World Trade Chief

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 31

 BODY:
A month before the head of the World Trade Organization is to leave his post, the search for a successor reached a stalemate today over the inability of the 134 members to decide between the two finalists.
After a yearlong search, the European Union and the United States appeared to be deadlocked over the choice between Suphachai Panichpakdi, the Thai Commerce Minister, and Michael Moore, a former Prime Minister of New Zealand. 
 Ali Mchumo, the Tanzanian representative, who leads the search committee, said the difficulties faced by the two candidates "are so serious that neither of them can enjoy consensus from the membership to enable them to be elected as the next Director General." He made the statement to a gathering of trade negotiators tonight, the deadline the organization had imposed for itself to choose a new director.
The leader of the trade organization runs its day-to-day affairs and helps settle contentious disputes among members. It is unclear what the group will do if it has not selected a Director General by April 30, when the term of Renato Ruggiero of Italy, the current chief, expires.
The deadlock comes as the United States and the European Union are fighting over a number of contentious trade disputes -- notably banana imports and resulting American sanctions, hormone-treated beef and aircraft noise.
Mr. Mchumo, describing the trade group's failure to meet its deadline as "unfortunate and disappointing," also alluded to complaints that certain nations, including the United States, were impeding the selection process. "It is clearly very unhealthy for this process to drag on because such delay breeds rumors, suspicions and even puts personal friendships at stake," he told negotiators.
The European Union's caretaker Trade Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, expressed his grievances in a letter to Mr. Mchumo, which was later faxed to journalists, accusing "unnamed countries" of threatening to veto a candidate.
"Anonymous vetoes are plainly inconsistent with the kind of transparency within the W.T.O. that we have been seeking," Sir Leon wrote.
Under its rules, the trade organization chooses a Director General by consensus, which has generally been accepted to mean there is no vote and no veto allowed. The idea is that every nation, regardless of size, gets an equal say and the trading giants cannot tip the balance.
However, the only time the process has been used before -- in selecting Mr. Ruggiero four years ago -- it took nine months and was plagued with delays, accusations and recriminations. The United States was accused of delaying the selection of Mr. Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister, because of concerns that his background and approach were too bureaucratic.
European officials have asserted that once again, the Americans are holding up the selection and have been working behind the scenes to insure that Mr. Moore wins. The United States has never publicly stated a preference.
More than half the European Union's 15 countries back Mr. Suphachai. However, several countries, including France, appear to have shifted allegiances back and forth between the two candidates.
Rita Hayes, the United States delegate to the trade organization, called Sir Leon's letter "very difficult," but refused to comment further on its contents.
Although Mr. Moore insisted in a radio interview earlier this week that the contest for the post did not reflect a split between industrial and developing nations, interviews with trade diplomats say that is an element. The United States and other industrial nations support labor standards that require developing countries to insure minimum levels for wages and working conditions. Developing countries generally oppose such standards, arguing that they would raise the cost of their exports and make them less competitive.
Some trade envoys say the United States does not think its best interests would be served by Mr. Suphachai, 52, who is an economist.
"He's an academic, he's intellectual," said a European trade official, who insisted on anonymity, adding that the Americans "don't see having a cozy relationship with him."
Mr. Moore, this official said, "talks the language labor likes to hear."
"The Americans say he can also talk to Congress, which is suspicious of the W.T.O," the official noted.
Pakistan's envoy, Munir Akram, said Mr. Moore, 50, a former union activist, "is more likely to push for labor standards."
Pakistan has led an effort by developing countries to insure that one of their leaders becomes the next Director General.
Both Mr. Moore and Mr. Suphachai visited the trade organization's headquarters here for last-minute lobbying. Thai officials have won support not only from Asian and many European nations, but from Latin American and Caribbean countries as well.
Delegates are to meet again next week to try to choose between the two men. Countries backing Mr. Suphachai, envoys said, have threatened to block Mr. Moore if Mr. Suphachai's candidacy is derailed.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Fall, Bringing Worst Quarter in 3 Years to a Close

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bonds fell yesterday, finishing their worst quarter in three years, as a report on manufacturing activity in the Midwest raised concern that brisk economic growth will quicken inflation later this year.
The 30-year Treasury bond fell 17/32 , to 94 21/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.62 percent, the highest since March 4. The benchmark bond lost 7.59 percent in the quarter, its worst decline since the first quarter of 1996, when it fell 8.38 percent, according to Ryan Labs Inc. in New York.
"Inflation is an issue for the first time this year," said John Breazeale, who oversees $250 million at Weiss Money Management Inc. in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. The trigger was the release of a report yesterday by the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago, which showed an unexpected improvement in manufacturing and a jump in the group's inflation gauge.
So far, inflation, which erodes a bond's value, has been under control, increasing at just a 1.6 percent rate over the last year. The Federal Reserve signaled it was not concerned about inflation by holding interest rates steady at a meeting this week.
Even so, the Chicago purchasing managers' report jolted investors. The manufacturing index rose to 57 from 52.9, while the index of prices paid, an inflation measure, surged to 52.5 from 41.6 -- the largest monthly increase since 1980 and an indication that more companies reported price increases during the month.
"The economic numbers are still strong," and that's a reason to steer away from Treasuries, said Bill Stevens, who oversees $1.8 billion of bonds at Montgomery Asset Management in San Francisco. He favors corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
Some traders worry that yesterday's report presages a strong reading in the National Association of Purchasing Management's national manufacturing report today, which carries more weight because of its broader scope, analysts say.
Bond yields have risen about a half percentage point over the last two months as reports on jobs, consumption and housing showed the economy was not about to slow.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of a 14-day cash-management bill:

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: NEWS ANALYSIS;
It's the 21st Century Arriving Early

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, March 31

 BODY:
Kosovo could be a template for the century to come.
The crisis there, which has produced a stern test for NATO and a catastrophe for the ethnic Albanians who form the province's overwhelming majority, bears little resemblance to the cold war that shaped the last half of this century. It is not about ideology. It does not directly involve the vital political or economic interests of the great powers. It carries with it no threat of nuclear annihilation. 
 Yet it presents precisely the kind of problem that the Western democracies, for all their wealth and military might, find it most difficult to cope with. And it is likely to be repeated elsewhere.
Unlike World War II, or even Korea or Vietnam, crises like this take place in a twilight zone, full of uncertainty, where rules are formulated (and broken) as the participants choose. It is hard to measure who is winning, sometimes harder to know who has won.
One catalyst for the Kosovo "war," if that is the correct term, is the mounting belief in much of Europe and North America that human rights matter more than national sovereignty -- that no leaders, whether democratically chosen or self-appointed, have the right to slaughter their citizens. Another is modern television.
NATO's bombing in Kosovo, a clear sign that the West puts a higher priority on human rights than on sovereignty, began a week ago. On that same day, England's highest court ruled that Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean president, could be extradited to Spain, even though under Chilean law he is exempt from prosecution for the offenses alleged, which occurred in his own country.
Both events dramatized the weakening of sovereignty, a development that disturbs both China and Russia.
If slaughter and television come together, as they did in Kosovo, "right-minded" people in Europe and America demand that their own governments do something about it. (If television is absent, as it largely was from the genocide in Rwanda, the demand is much less insistent, however great the loss of innocent life may prove to be.)
The United Nations is often in no position to act. Such is the case this time, with Moscow and Beijing ready to cast vetoes.
So the burden falls upon the Western democracies, which usually means the United States, acting in concert with NATO, as in Kosovo, through an ad hoc alliance, as in the Persian Gulf war, or sometimes alone.
But the new ardor for human rights, even when fanned by violence and misery on the television screen, stops well short of heedless passion. Few American or French or Belgian families are willing to risk the lives of large numbers of their sons and daughters in ground combat; because of the Vietnam quagmire, which still registers powerfully on the American political consciousness, the reluctance to commit ground troops is especially marked in the United States, particularly when the underlying strategic goals are ill-defined.
The answer to this paradox, so far at least, is air power: bombs and cruise missiles, launched from as far away and as high an altitude as possible to minimize the chances of a pilot's being captured. For television can cut two ways: pictures of human calamity can arouse the Western world to act, but pictures of Western soldiers or airmen dying or suffering humiliation, as in Somalia, can quickly discourage action.
By itself, air power may not prove adequate. In the case of Kosovo, it has given the Serbs time to intensify their campaign against the ethnic Albanians. Like the air strikes against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, these may have caused a stiffening rather than a weakening of resolve. And even if the bombs eventually cripple the military forces of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, it may be too late; most of the "ethnic cleansing" may already have been completed.
One possibility for additional action is sending arms to the Kosovo Liberation Army. Another is to try to foment a military coup against Mr. Milosevic. Still another is to begin laying a political predicate for sending in NATO ground troops. Clearly, some of the NATO allies would resist such a move, and President Clinton has said he has no intention of committing Americans in an offensive role.
Yet Mr. Clinton has compared Mr. Milosevic to Hitler, just as President George Bush compared Mr. Hussein to Hitler. Either Mr. Clinton's words were hyperbole, or his present means are inconsistent with the problem at hand. It took Mr. Bush a long time, but he sold the American people and several key allies on the idea that sweeping Mr. Hussein from Kuwait was worth the loss of many Western lives.
He managed to do so in part because he was able to convince people that Mr. Hussein's aggressiveness constituted a strategic threat to Western oil supplies. But NATO's strategic goal this time is unclear. Mr. Clinton has spoken of degrading the Serbians' ability to wage war against the Kosovo Albanians. President Jacques Chirac of France said on Tuesday that Europe could no longer tolerate either Mr. Milosevic or his regime.
The prospect of a diplomatic deal remains dim as long as NATO insists, as it did after the attempted Russian mediation this week, that its troops be allowed to monitor any peace in Kosovo -- an idea that profoundly offends the Serbs. More likely is an indecisive, lingering conflict, not unlike the one in Iraq, with the dictator still in power and the West repeatedly frustrated.
"Make no mistake," said a Balkan diplomat who knows Mr. Milosevic and talks with him often. "The man pays attention, and he has watched Saddam Hussein gain strength as the bombs have fallen."
The two situations are different, of course. Mr. Hussein is not currently engaged in ethnic cleansing, for one thing.
But Kosovo and Iraq closely resemble each other in one crucial respect: neither problem seems susceptible to a short, sharp solution. Wars like the one in the Falkland Islands look like a thing of the past.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
I.B.M. vows to pull ads from Web sites that lack clear policies on protecting consumer privacy.

BYLINE: By Jeri Clausing 

 BODY:
SAYING it hoped to ward off Government regulation and increase consumer confidence in electronic commerce, the International Business Machines Corporation, the second-biggest advertiser on the Internet, said yesterday that it would pull its ads from Web sites that lacked clear privacy policies.
In a letter sent to 350 Web sites it advertises with in the United States and Canada, I.B.M. said that as of June 1 it would advertise only on sites that posted such policies. 
 The announcement, thought to be the first by a United States company, comes as the Federal Trade Commission, Congress and the European Union are closely monitoring the effectiveness of efforts by on-line businesses to police themselves on the issue of buying and selling personal data they gather.
I.B.M. said its own recent survey had found that only 30 percent of the 800 sites worldwide from which it buys ads had privacy policies posted.
"It was a little to our surprise, frankly, that so many sites didn't have privacy policies," said Abby Kohnstamm, I.B.M.'s senior vice president for marketing.
Ms. Kohnstamm and Chris Caine, vice president for governmental programs, cited three factors behind the decision announced yesterday: I.B.M.'s own history of protecting consumer privacy, research showing that consumer concerns about privacy are inhibiting the growth of electronic commerce, and the need for the industry to prove that it can regulate itself.
"Market-led policies need market leaders," Mr. Caine said.
Robert Pitofsky, the trade commission chairman, who last year told Internet companies to make fundamental improvements in protecting consumer privacy or face tough new regulations, said he was encouraged by the announcement.
"I think it is a good move," Mr. Pitofsky said. "I'm not sure whether it will catch on or not, but I think it is important that a company with the stature and prestige of I.B.M. take the first step. Time will tell if others see it in their best interest."
Even privacy advocates who view industry self-regulation as ineffective and unenforceable called the I.B.M. move a positive step in pushing companies to tell consumers what type of personal information they collect and how it is used.
"It is exquisitely timed," said Jason Catlett, president of the Junkbusters Corporation, which promotes consumer protection on line. "I don't think it's going to have an enormous effect," he added, but "I still feel I have to applaud I.B.M. because their heart is in the right place."
Mr. Catlett, saying that I.B.M. had a good history of protecting privacy, also pointed out that the company had avoided negative publicity like that recently faced by the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation for embedding in their products identifying numbers that could allow marketers and others to track computer users' movements through cyberspace.
All three companies are members of the Online Privacy Alliance, which was formed last year to push companies to address privacy concerns after a survey by the F.T.C. found only 14 percent of Web sites had clear privacy policies posted.
Microsoft, the No. 1 advertiser on the Internet, applauded the move by I.B.M. and said it would watch its effects closely. "Because privacy is very important to us, we are always considering all ways in which we can encourage privacy protections," said Tom Pilla, a Microsoft spokesman. "We don't have any immediate plans to follow suit."
Although I.B.M. will not dictate standards for what privacy policies on Web sites should be, it does refer Web publishers to the Online Privacy Alliance, which has a list of recommended practices that are based on principles recommended by the F.T.C. last year.
The debate over the issue has reached a critical point as the F.T.C. nears a decision on whether a report to Congress due this spring will recommend the passage of new laws to protect on-line privacy.
A group of business interests, in conjunction with the F.T.C. and Georgetown University, recently completed a follow-up to the F.T.C. survey last year of on-line privacy practices. The results of that study, which have not been released, are expected to be a determining factor in the agency's decision.
Mr. Pitofsky told Congress last year that he would push for regulation if significant improvement was not found. He said yesterday that progress was being made, but he acknowledged, "I just don't know how much, and I hear radically different versions from differing groups."
He also emphasized that the report to Congress would look at more than just the numbers. "You want to know what kind of policy" that Web sites "are putting up there," he said. Some key points, he said, are whether the policies are clear and whether they explain that consumers have a choice in how the information they supply is used.
Indeed, I.B.M. cited the new survey in the letter that its on-line advertising agency, Ogilvy One Worldwide, a New York unit of WPP Group P.L.C., sent out yesterday morning.
"We believe that this presents a very timely opportunity for the private sector to continue to take the initiative in posting and following privacy policies," the letter said in reference to the survey. "While the appropriate privacy statement will vary from site to site, we strongly encourage Web site owners to employ industry best privacy practices."
I.B.M. said it spent about $45 million on on-line advertising last year, or 7 percent of its worldwide media budget. That is expected to increase to $60 million, or 10 percent of its budget, this year.

Brazilian Central Bank Plans A Currency Insider Inquiry

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 31

 BODY:
The nation's central bank said today that it is conducting an investigation into accusations that several domestic and foreign financial institutions used inside information about an impending shift in exchange-rate policy in January to profit from the devaluation of the currency.
The assertions -- first made public in February by Aloizio Mercadante, a member of Congress from the opposition Workers Party -- include charges that nine banks used access to Government officials in the days leading up to the Jan. 13 policy shift to make trading decisions resulting in a combined profit of roughly $1 billion. The list of banks includes Citigroup, J. P. Morgan and BankBoston. 
 Many banks in recent weeks have reported preliminary results to the central bank showing they made substantial profits after the devaluation of the currency, the real, largely through a combination of successful bets in futures markets and purchases of dollar-linked Government bonds. The enormous size of these profits comes as the economy is struggling with recession, and has resulted in calls by several members of Congress to look into the legality of such financial results.
This week, Senator Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the president of the Senate and a man widely considered Brazil's most powerful legislator, said he would support a Congressional inquiry into the accusations that some banks used inside information to profit from the devaluation. That move is separate from the central bank's investigation.
Georges Lamaziere, a spokesman for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, said on Tuesday that the Government sees no problem with the Congressional inquiry going forward. The central bank's investigation should be finished by next week and the results will be announced then, a spokeswoman said in Brasilia, the capital.
Most of the banks have said they broke no laws by accumulating profits in the aftermath of the devaluation, which pushed the real down by 40 percent against the dollar.
There had been widespread expectations for months that Brazil might have to abandon its artificial support for the currency and let market forces of supply and demand determine its value. Currency traders at banks and other financial institutions who had bet on that possibility, based on publicly available information, did nothing illegal.
"When you have a devaluation, you tend to make money," said Richard Howe, a spokesman for Citigroup in New York. J. P. Morgan and BankBoston also denied any wrongdoing.
At the time of the devaluation, the central bank was led by an interim president, Francisco Lopes, who has since resigned. It is now headed by Arminio Fraga, a former fund manager, who ordered the insider-trading investigation last week. He has also ordered an inquiry into accusations that the central bank may have acted illegally in helping two small Rio de Janeiro investment banks, Banco Marka and Banco Fonte Cindam, after the devaluation. The banks lost millions of dollars after betting against the likelihood of a devaluation. Marka has since been taken over by the central bank, while Fonte Cindam has been sold to Banque Nationale de Paris.

HEADLINE: Short-Lived Dose of Shirt-Sleeve Temperatures

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
It was decidedly shirt-sleeve weather, and all across the region yesterday, people doffed their jackets and overcoats to take a walk, appreciate spring's blooms and otherwise enjoy a day that reached 73 degrees in Central Park.
"What is notable is the air is dry," said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. "It's like the climate of Arizona has come to New York City." Although warm, the temperature did not set a record. Last March 31, temperatures reached 86 degrees in Central Park. 
 Les Martin spent part of yesterday in his yard in West Hartford, Conn., after returning from the winter in Florida. He was uncovering purple crocuses as he raked out leaves and branches. "It's nice to come back to temperatures that are almost the same as they were in Florida," he said. "It's just the ideal day to be out."
Brunella Ibarrola, an adjunct professor at the University of Connecticut in West Hartford, sipped a soda before her evening nutrition class. "It's a glorious day," she said, wondering aloud how many of her students might "succumb to the temptation to go elsewhere."
On Broadway at 112th Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Dave Shargani, 33, a baseball card vendor, said business was booming. "When the weather's like this sales go up about 40 percent," he said.
Nearby in Riverside Park, Phong Bui, an engineering student at City College, drew the buildings along Riverside Drive on a large sketch pad. "When I looked out my window this morning I said springtime is finally here," said Mr. Bui, 27, who is from Vietnam. "It's beautiful and it's definitely helping inspire my drawings. The only problem is I have allergies and I'm going to have to go inside soon."
Two women admiring a planter of bright yellow daffodils in Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan said that the warm weather promoted cordiality.
"We don't know each other," said one of the women, Bebe Carlson, an unemployed medical secretary from Long Beach, N.Y. "We just sat here and started talking."
Not everyone in Bryant Park was dressed for the day. Two visitors from England compared their spring day in the park with what they had left behind. "This is a lot better than the weather back home," said Robin Trotman, 30, a Londoner who said he works with the disabled. "When we left home, it was raining a bit, about 50 degrees and gray."
While Mr. Trotman was sporting a T-shirt, his friend, Richard Thomas, 36, a social worker from Bristol, was wearing a black leather jacket. Mr. Thomas said he was warm, but explained that the jacket wouldn't fit in his knapsack. "Plus I didn't want to crease it," he added.
Mr. Thomas's jacket may be of more use today and tomorrow. Mr. Gadomski, the meteorologist, said the gentle temperatures and the dryness were fleeting. Thickening clouds last night meant that it was expected to be about 10 degrees lower today, he said. "There will be some showers here and there," he added. Temperatures will drop even more by Friday, with highs in the mid-50's and lows in the high 30's, he said.
The cooler temperatures are sure to please those people who were not quite ready for the heat yesterday. Greg Zuccolo, 31, of Manhattan, a performance artist, was in Bryant Park putting his resume together with 8-by-10 glossies of himself. "I'm not a fan of this weather," he said. "I'm from Canada, and I prefer it to be cold for a lot longer -- at least mid-April."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Investors Stick to Big Names in Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
In its final sprint to the 10,000 mark, a peak once scarcely imagined, the Dow Jones industrial average showed that stock market investors intensified what had already seemed an inexhaustible preference for the biggest and best.
"It was all the big names -- the big caps," said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis, in reviewing the first three months of 1999 yesterday, as managers finished dressing their portfolios for client inspection. "We're in a very selective market, so the deal is, you've got to buy the big-name stocks." 
 Yesterday's action, however, was not entirely a matter of professionals adding recent winners and shedding losers, since the market suffered a late sinking spell that pushed the Dow 127.1 points lower to pare its gain for the quarter to 6.6 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500, also dominated by large companies, lost a proportionally similar amount to finish the quarter ahead by 4.6 percent.
It was the first time since the final quarter of 1996 that the Dow beat the S.& P., and it did so despite a 35 percent skid by Philip Morris Companies. Much of that slide came this week after an Oregon jury ordered the company to pay $81 million in damages to the family of a Marlboro smoker who died of cancer.
By contrast, Standard & Poor's indexes of medium-sized and small companies slumped 7 percent and 9 percent, respectively.
"You still have the large-capitalization, global growth companies leading the market and still have the narrowness that prevailed last year," said Timothy E. O'Grady, senior portfolio manager for First Capital Group in Morristown, N.J.
Software, computer and many other high-technology companies also sparkled, with Microsoft rising 29 percent, to finish at $89.625, where its total value surpassed $450 billion, 25 percent more than the No. 2 General Electric.
The Nasdaq market, which is heavily weighted with technology, spurted 12 percent over the winter, with CMGI, which develops and operates Internet and direct marketing companies, soaring 244 percent to finish at $183.0625. Amazon.com, the Internet bookseller, jumped 61 percent, to $172.1875, to surpass the price of Yahoo, the leading Internet search directory, at $168.375, up 42 percent for the quarter.
Joining the high-technology winners were brokerage houses, airlines and various retailers, beneficiaries of continued avid consumer spending that itself is partly fueled by rising stock prices.
Citigroup posted the biggest gain among Dow stocks -- although it was not the biggest contributor to the average's 605-point gain -- as it climbed 29 percent, to $63.875, more than double its low of last October when foreign economic turmoil was its most intense.
Charles Schwab & Company and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette paced a giant run-up in brokerage firm stocks, which were badly battered last year. Each of them rebounded 70 percent during the latest quarter. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter climbed 41 percent, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch & Company by about one-third and Bear, Stearns & Company by 25 percent.
Airlines, aided by low fuel prices, as well as free-spending travelers, were led by Delta and Southwest, each up 33 percent, and UAL, which rose 30 percent. AMR, which experienced a 10-day sickout by its pilots, and U S Airways, however, edged lower.
Among retailers, Consolidated Stores, up 50 percent, and Dollar General, up 44 percent, posted some of the biggest gains. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the No. 1 retailer, gained 13 percent to push its market capitalization -- what it would theoretically cost to buy every share -- above the $200 billion level.
Drug stocks were mixed, with American Home Products 16 percent higher, Pfizer up 11 percent and Merck up 9 percent. Abbott, Bristol-Myers and Eli Lilly all lost between 4 and 5 percent, while Warner-Lambert, maker of the controversial diabetes drug Rezulin, lost 12 percent.
Utilities weakened as interest rates crept higher, with the S. & P. utility index falling 10 percent. Nonetheless, there was little sign of faster inflation, and precious metals turned in another poor performance, with the Philadelphia gold and silver index slipping 8 percent.
Looking ahead, the Dow after millenary milestones has advanced in the following quarter on two of every three occasions, and has also done better than other market indexes. Its biggest rise was 12.5 percent after the average hit 6,000 in late 1996, according to LIM Research.com. The biggest loss was 1.2 percent in the quarter following the Dow's July 1997 surge to 8,000.
The research company also noted that the Russell 2000 underperformed the general market in the quarter following seven of the last eight 1,000-point milestones.

HEADLINE: The Man Behind the Exams;
New York's Education Chief Pushes Agenda of Change

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
When Richard P. Mills came to New York as its Education Commissioner three and a half years ago, the state had just drafted a detailed set of blueprints, contained in thick bound volumes, for how to teach nine subjects from English to science in every grade from pre-kindergarten through high school.
But as he visited schools from the South Bronx to Buffalo, Mr. Mills was dismayed to find that the plans, called "curriculum frameworks," had made almost no impact in the trenches. 
 Few teachers even knew they existed, let alone used them. Finally, he pulled a teacher aside and asked why. "You don't get it," the teacher said, with what Mr. Mills remembers as almost a sneer. "If the standards are not on the test, they're not real."
Fortified by that insight, Mr. Mills, who came to New York from Vermont with a reputation as a progressive educator, has emerged as a leader of the national movement to promote standards through old-fashioned testing. He has made testing at all levels the centerpiece of state policy, using scores to judge districts, schools and students. And he has imposed stark consequences -- like withholding high school diplomas -- for failing to meet those standards.
"It's not fair to graduate children without the knowledge and skills to make it in the world," Mr. Mills said. "We are setting them up for failure."
Mr. Mills's testing agenda struck fear into fourth graders and their parents in January, when he introduced a new three-day reading test, which required 9-year-olds to write essays with correct spelling, grammar and punctuation, rather than fill in the simple multiple choice bubbles of the past. In New York City next year, the tests may be used as a factor in promotion to fifth grade. His tough new high school graduation standards have forced school administrators from affluent suburbs to impoverished inner-city schools to scramble to prepare struggling students for what was until now considered an honors curriculum.
Mr. Mills says he is challenging a state-sanctioned system of low expectations that for decades has consigned many poor and disadvantaged children to a second-class education. But to his critics, including many academics, teachers and administrators, he has become the Darth Vader of educational reform, whose focus on testing could deny diplomas to thousands of children and brand scores of schools as failures.
"There will be casualties," said Jay Heubert, co-editor of a study on high-stakes testing for the National Academy of Sciences.
Whoever is right, the policies adopted by the State Board of Regents have set the stage for years of bruising political and educational confrontation. Mr. Mills and the Regents have decided that next year, all high school seniors -- including most immigrants who do not speak English fluently -- will be denied diplomas unless they pass a three-day, six-hour English Regents examination that in the past was reserved for honors students. By 2003, students will have to take exams in five subjects to graduate.
State officials are urging students with learning disabilities to at least attempt the Regents exams. And Mr. Mills is negotiating with private schools to set similar standards. One academic describes him as pursuing a shock therapy approach to education reform. If the new standards had been in place last year, 27 percent of all high school seniors in the state -- 37 percent in New York City -- would have failed to receive diplomas, and the percentages would have been much higher in some schools.
Despite his aggressive policies, Mr. Mills, who goes by Rick, cultivates the outward demeanor of a colorless corporate manager, declining, for instance, to be called "Dr.," even though he has a doctorate in educational leadership. One legislator once compared him to Clark Kent.
Though mild-mannered, he has had a testy relationship with Rudy Crew, the New York City Schools Chancellor, almost from the moment they were appointed to their jobs, Mr. Mills in September 1995 and Dr. Crew a month later. Four days after Dr. Crew arrived in New York from Tacoma, Wash., Mr. Mills threatened to close down 16 failing public schools in New York City unless they improved by the end of the school year.
Dr. Crew called Mr. Mills "a strategic ally," but bridled at the notion that the State Commissioner was setting the agenda for New York City.
"The monkey is on our back to produce here, but that's not a function of Rick Mills," Dr. Crew said. "That's a function of what we believe to be true."
Mr. Mills seemed an unlikely warrior for testing when he arrived in New York. As Commissioner of Education in Vermont for seven and a half years, he introduced a method of evaluating students that is almost the antithesis of standardized tests -- portfolios. A favorite tool of progressive educators, portfolios are collections of student work that are evaluated by committees of teachers or outsiders. The Rand Institute on Education and Training found that the portfolio system in Vermont had improved teaching, but was too subjective to be fair or reliable as a testing tool.
In his dark-paneled office in Albany, where the only personal touch is a set of oversized red and green cardboard blocks that spell STANDARDS, Mr. Mills said that his testing program in New York was not a repudiation of his experience in Vermont.
He said he still thought that portfolios, although in need of fine-tuning, were the right testing system for the town-hall, populist environment of Vermont, where there was no history of statewide testing. But he insists that conventional standardized tests fit the educational culture of New York State, which has a history of giving Regents examinations that goes back to the Civil War.
"People just assume that you pack a suitcase full of ideas that you bring over the border and impose," Mr. Mills said. "You have to use the tools at hand."
Mr. Mills had his first brush with old-fashioned standards when he was 10. He was born in Paris, Ill., the son of a peripatetic insurance executive, who moved on to Ohio and then Winnipeg, Manitoba. Going from a progressive to a traditional school, he discovered that he was no longer the smartest kid in class. "It was a very useful experience when I was young to have to really scramble," he said.
Planning to become a historian, he entered a master's program at Columbia University. But academic life felt suffocating, he said, and he answered a posting to teach history to junior high and high school students at Dalton, the exclusive Manhattan private school.
At Dalton, he became part of a group of teachers who wanted to try new ideas. With four older teachers, Mr. Mills, then 26, ended up resigning and creating a challenge to the system -- the 35-student Elizabeth Seeger School in Greenwich Village, with a progressive faculty that believed in hands-on learning, like visiting the Federal Reserve Bank to study economics and a farm in New Jersey to read King Lear.
After two years, he decided that he did not know enough to run a school, and he returned to Columbia to earn a business degree, and later a doctorate in education.
As Mr. Mills applies a bottom-line mentality to education, his biggest challenge may come not from his direct opponents, but from those who say he is trying to do too much too fast.
Until now, New York has had a two-tier diploma system -- Regents diplomas for the best students and local diplomas for the rest. But research shows that two-tier diploma systems lead to a dumbed-down curriculum for students in the lesser track.
Still, Dr. Heubert, who studied the issue for the National Academy of Sciences, says that asking children to meet higher standards before schools have demonstrated that they are teaching the material is unfair, and likely to be challenged in court.
Randi Weingarten, president of the city teachers' union, said the standards could not be met without more money to lower class sizes, train teachers and improve facilities like laboratories.
And teachers and children may fail because the standards are not clear enough, said Diane Ravitch, an Assistant Secretary of Education in the Bush Administration, and an advocate of national testing and curriculum. She wants the Regents to be more prescriptive about curriculum, down to the literature children should read, the historical events they should study and the methods they should use to learn math.
"I think you have an obligation to say that if you learn these things, you will pass this exam," Dr. Ravitch said.
To Mr. Mills, such arguments are a Catch-22: without a test, there is no way to tell how well schools are teaching.
Carl T. Hayden, Chancellor of the Regents, said that the pressure to meet graduation standards would drive stronger curriculum, more money and better teacher training. "It will make politicians more accountable," he said.
Already, the specter of failure has driven some changes. To help students pass Regents tests, New York City is spending $12 million this year to reduce the size of high school English and math classes. West Lake High School in Westchester County is giving students at risk of failing the Regents exams an extra period of instruction every day, said Louis Cuglietto, the principal. Even so, Mr. Cuglietto said, he is nervous.
Just how far he has veered from his original educational course dawned on Mr. Mills one day soon after he became Commissioner. He was signing routine paperwork when a document from the Elizabeth Seeger school crossed his desk. The school had closed in 1981, but the other teachers had maintained its operating permit, apparently in hopes of someday reviving its unconventional program.
But in that winter of 1996, as Mr. Mills embarked on the biggest testing program in New York history, his onetime fellow rebels were giving up, and his signature was needed to confirm the end of their experiment.
"They were surrendering their charter," he said, a hint of regret in his voice.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Says Deal Is Near On Obstacle at Stadium Site

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 31

 BODY:
Just two days before a deadline requiring them to show progress on a plan to build a stadium for the New England Patriots, Connecticut officials said today that they were close to a deal to remove the biggest obstacle to the plan: a steam plant on the site.
Officials of the company that owns the plant, C.T.G. Resources, were more cautious in describing negotiations on moving the plant. But they said that the talks, which had broken down in public finger-pointing between Gov. John G. Rowland and the company, were now progressing. 
 "The change in tone suggests the possibility for a successful completion of negotiations," said Lynn C. Blackwell, a spokeswoman for the company. But, she added, "There are an awful lot of open issues."
State officials, who saw the stadium plans bog down over one unexpected issue after another, spoke more optimistically about the outlook for the stadium than they have in weeks.
"All the points of disagreement that were on the table were either removed or substantially modified," said Richard D. Gray, the Governor's chief negotiator. "We believe there can be an agreement between the parties soon."
C.T.G. also has renewed talks with the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority about the agency's offer to replace the steam plant, and both sides reported progress.
On Friday, the state is scheduled to present the Patriots with the first of several reports showing progress on preparation of the site, intending to have the stadium ready for play in the 2002 season. Under the contract signed by Governor Rowland, the team could walk away from the deal within 30 days of receiving Friday's report if it concluded that adequate headway had not been made.
C.T.G.'s headquarters and steam plant occupy the riverfront site in downtown Hartford where the state hopes to build a stadium for the Patriots. Ten days ago, the company was demanding $49 million to move its headquarters, double the amount that had been raised by the private backers of the stadium complex, which is to include a hotel and convention center.
Officials involved in the talks say that C.T.G. is now considering leasing a new building instead of buying it. C.T.G. has withdrawn its demand for indemnification against environmental cleanup costs, and instead the state and the company will buy an insurance policy covering the site, state officials said today.
The state has prepared a draft of its 30-page report to the Patriots. Governor Rowland said he was confident the report would show sufficient progress, adding that the "degree of specifics we'll get to will be hammered out in the next couple days."
"Failure is not an option," he said. "The Patriots will be playing in Hartford."
Governor Rowland also met this morning with a group of Hartford's corporate leaders to enlist them in building enthusiasm for the stadium plan, which has suffered a decline in public support, a poll has found.
Last week, the Governor had said he planned to ask the group of about 20 executives to help finance C.T.G.'s demands. "They've been asked to show up with their checkbooks," he said.
Instead, over coffee and bagels at the Capitol today, he asked the executives to join his "pro-stadium effort," including such gestures as "writing letters to the editor and talking amongst their friends."
"We're going to start to get out and publicize the benefits of having the stadium here and the benefits, economically and otherwise, of having the Patriots in Hartford," he said.
The Governor said the executives said they might be willing to help with loan guarantees, and by supplying legal, architectural and other services to the stadium development complex, to be called Adriaen's Landing.
The poll, taken for The Hartford Courant by the University of Connecticut, found that the stadium's support had declined to 45 percent this week from 58 percent in December. The poll of 500 state residents was conducted from Thursday to Sunday and has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
Governor Rowland said he was not alarmed by the decline. "This has been a huge vacuum over the last two months," he said.
"We had a lot of excitement when we had the press conference and the announcement and the development agreement and the legislative activity. Now it's the lull, as you go through the minutiae of hammering out the plan."

Heightened NATO Air Raids Aim to Weaken Milosevic
NATO opened an expanded bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, and alliance officials said they were planning weeks of air strikes intended to undermine President Slobodan Milosevic's hold on power. A1
 
Three American infantrymen patrolling Macedonia's border with Kosovo were missing after reporting by radio that they were surrounded and under fire, the Pentagon said. A1 

NATO adopted a strategy of bombing Yugoslavia despite several military assessments and intelligence warnings that it alone would not deter attacks in Kosovo. A1
 
France will provide 10 airplanes to protect Kosovo refugee convoys from Serbian forces, and Italy will send police officers to Albania to bring order to refugee camps. A13
 
Russia said it would send a reconnaissance ship to the Mediterranean to monitor the conflict in Yugoslavia, a move criticized by the United States as unhelpful. A14

HEADLINE: New Nigerian Leader Says Democracy Can Thrive

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The President-elect of Nigeria, Olesegun Obasanjo, says he is paying no heed to skeptics who argue that a legacy of corruption has rendered Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, incapable of sustaining democratic rule.
Mr. Obasanjo met Tuesday with President Clinton to reaffirm his commitment to democracy, saying his nation needs a stable civilian government in order to prosper. 
 "I understand and sympathize with the skeptics, but I don't go by the views and the thinking of the skeptics," he told reporters. "The success of democracy in Nigeria will signal success and be a catalyst to success of democracy elsewhere in West Africa, and indeed in Africa."
Mr. Obasanjo said Mr. Clinton had expressed "not just understanding, but also sympathy" for Nigeria's political and economic situation. Nigeria has $30 billion in foreign debt. The peacekeeping force it leads, Ecomog, has seen its share of assistance from the United States fall from $3.9 million in 1998 to $1.3 million this year.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obasanjo talked for half an hour about establishing democratic rule in Nigeria, which the Administration regards as a potential force for political stability on the continent.
Mr. Clinton emphasized that democracy was essential if Nigeria hoped for economic reform and increased investment, the White House national security spokesman, Mike Hammer, said.
Mr. Obasanjo said he assured Mr. Clinton that Nigeria would continue to lead a West African peacekeeping force now in Sierra Leone, which has been racked by civil war. He also promised to insure that Nigeria's military would become more professional and would remain under civilian control.
Mr. Obasanjo was Nigeria's military leader from 1976 until 1979, when he yielded power to a civilian government. The military took over again four years later.
Mr. Obasanjo had been jailed by the dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died last June. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, steered Nigeria toward civilian rule. Mr. Obasanjo was elected in February.
The visit to Washington is part of a tour of several countries before his May 29 inauguration. Mr. Clinton has been invited but has not yet said whether he will attend.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
No Comfort in New Solvency Figures

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
The Administration boisterously pointed this week to new actuary studies showing that Medicare and Social Security will remain solvent for a few more years than previously estimated. Social Security would not go bankrupt until 2034, rather than 2032, and the Medicare trust fund would last until 2015 rather than 2008.
But the revised estimates should bring little comfort to anyone who looks seriously at the numbers. Solvency is an accounting measure that can be achieved merely by shifting costs from the trust funds to general taxpayers. The fundamental problem posed by Government retiree programs has not gone away. 
 Longer life expectancies, rising medical costs and falling birth rates combine to drive up the working Americans' burden of supporting the elderly. Add up the cost of Social Security, Medicare and the part of Medicaid that pays for nursing homes for the elderly. These three retiree programs alone will account for more than a third of Federal spending next year.
By 2030, retirement benefits will account for more than two-thirds of the budget. That means the fraction of the Federal spending devoted to other parts of Government, from law enforcement to housing subsidies, will shrivel unless Congress substantially cuts the growth rate of retiree benefits or raises taxes.
Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute points out that the baby-boom generation can look forward to generous retiree benefits even as birth rates fall, leaving fewer workers to support a growing number of the elderly. By locking in layers of retiree benefits for rich and poor alike, Mr. Steuerle observes, the baby boomers are leaving themselves a Government "almost the sole purpose of which will be to care for their consumption needs in retirement, a Government by, of and only for the baby boomers."
The footprints of Mr. Steuerle's stern warning lie all over the White House and Congressional budgets. Sam Elkin of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities tracks domestic discretionary spending, which encompasses nearly all the programs except military and entitlement programs like Social Security and welfare. Mr. Elkin points out that under the recently passed Republican budget, such spending will fall by 18 percent by 2002 and almost 30 percent by 2009, after taking account of inflation.
That would take domestic discretionary spending from almost 3.5 percent of the national economic output today -- which is as low as this figure has been since the early 1960's -- to about 2 percent by 2009. As Medicare and Social Security costs rise thereafter, this figure would fall further still. By comparison, domestic discretionary programs accounted for more than 5 percent of the economy in 1980.
The proposed evisceration of discretionary spending comes as no surprise from the party that has all but declared war on big government, but the fact is that President Clinton's budget would not restore the proposed cuts.
In his winning Presidential campaign in 1992, Mr. Clinton pledged to raise Government spending by $50 billion a year on public programs, for example high-speed trains and improved training for the work force. His current plan would use about 10 percent of the expected surpluses over the next 15 years to preserve some descretionary spending. That would avoid more than half of the Republicans' proposed cuts.
But the added money would not come close to honoring his 1992 pledge, even though the current and projected economies are flush compared with the economy that Mr. Clinton inherited from President George Bush. Indeed, Mr. Elkin said that after taking account of inflation, Mr. Clinton's latest budget would probably cut domestic discretionary spending by 7 percent by 2002 and 13 percent by 2009. There goes part of the President's investment bridge to the 21st century.
To do more, Mr. Clinton would have had to propose trimming retiree benefits, perhaps by proposing to raise the eligibility age for Medicare. Or Mr. Clinton would have had to propose cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for upper-income families, measures neither he nor the Republicans would touch.
Instead, he proposed to use most of the expected surpluses to give Medicare and Social Security first call on general tax revenues in the future when the trust funds run dry. Therein lies the fate of future discretionary programs.
There are important differences between the Clinton and Republican plans. His plan buys back far more of the Government's $3.7 trillion debt from the public, a sound economic step that would pump trillions of dollars into private capital markets for use by companies to invest in plants and equipment. The Republicans would return about $800 billion of the future surplus to taxpayers in the form of a tax cut over 10 years. They would not use the surplus to bolster domestic discretionary spending, unlike the President.
But the similarities overwhelm the differences. Both budgets call for a future wherein the Government takes in tax dollars from a diminishing number of workers in order to support the consumption of an increasing number of elderly.
Few take seriously the prospect that Congress, even if it stays in Republican hands, will gut discretionary spending anytime soon. It would seem ludicrous to believe a Congress that needed decades to summon the political courage to strip wartime subsidies from the producers of mohair would immediately whack nearly a third out of the budget for border patrols, medical research and highway construction.
But budget logic will eventually have to overcome cowardice. Over time, Congress will have only grim choices: trim retiree benefits, eviscerate discretionary spending or raise taxes. "Never before," says Mr. Steuerle of entitlement spending for the elderly, "have so many commitments and so much growth been scheduled in our laws -- literally for an eternity."
Many economists make the point that in about 30 years a third of the adult population will be retired and that these people will spend about a third of their lives in retirement. Congress can promote private savings in a number of ways. It can generate Federal surpluses far into the future.
But, Mr. Steuerle points out, there is no way that Congress can spur savings enough "to support close to one-third of the entire adult population on Social Security for one-third of their adult lives," adding, "Doesn't the blessing of longer life involve some obligation to share in its cost?"

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: PROTECTORS;
Western Countries Organize Security Plans for Refugees

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
France announced today that it would send 10 airplanes to the borders of Kosovo to protect refugee convoys from Serbian forces, and Italy plans to send police officers to Albania to bring order to refugee camps.
The French aerial cover could protect refugees from attacks like the one described today by a NATO briefing officer in Brussels, who said refugees were fired on by Serbian artillery and tanks in the Paragusa Valley, a stronghold of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. According to the separatist guerrillas, 50,000 Albanians in the valley are under attack by Serbian and Yugoslav forces. 
 Overnight 40,000 new refugees were forced across Kosovo's borders into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, bringing the total of people displaced in the last 10 days to 140,000. Insisting they not be quoted by name, officials in the Clinton Administration and relief organizations now fear that the total could reach one million before the air war is over. Before the Serbian push against the Kosovar Albanians, they accounted for about 1.8 million of the province's population of 2 million.
The Administration today pledged $50 million to aid the refugees, including $25 million from the Defense Department to provide a mobile air traffic control operation, to repair or build roads, airstrips and ports and to supply food and tents.
"The Defense Department stands ready to provide whatever assistance we can," said Kenneth H. Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, who said that the refugees "are fleeing a murder machine."
Most of the NATO countries also offered millions in aid today for food, shelter and medical supplies and governments sent assessment teams to Macedonia and Albania. Germany and Britain began an airlift to the region today, with four German military planes carrying medical supplies and a British military transport plane filled with blankets and tents arriving in Skopje, Macedonia, and Tirana, Albania.
Setting up makeshift camps for huge numbers of refugees along the Kosovo border raises serious political and military questions as well as humanitarian problems.
Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro (a republic in the Yugoslav federation with Serbia) are politically and economically fragile and ill equipped to care for these newcomers.
Already Albania has accused Yugoslavia of shelling across its borders, which could force the refugees further inland. Kosovar Albanian leaders hope to keep the refugees grouped near the border so they can return to their homes once the war is over, a goal of the Europeans as well. Moreover, if the shells hit Italian police officers, that could incite demands for retaliation by NATO.
The Italian effort was outlined by Alessandro Di Franco, counselor for press information at the Italian Embassy. "We are preparing a major massive humanitarian effort," he said. "The Albanian Government has asked us for tents, food, shelters and for our police forces to bring order to the camps."
The French effort was described by Francois de Lattre, press attache at the French Embassy here.
Today's announcements from Italy and France, and pledges of $40 million of aid from Germany, were measures of the fear in all of Europe that the refugee crisis is becoming a nightmare, and that a failure to keep open the possibility of the return of the refugees to Kosovo could force Europe to absorb them as new immigrants.
Although the relief organizations, along with the United States and other NATO nations, had put aside food stocks several weeks ago, they were not were prepared for this vast flight, according to Administration officials, foreign diplomats and aid officials.
"We've already reached our worst-case-scenario projection of 150,000," said Karen Abuzayd, Washington director for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. "Our projections now are for over half a million refugees."
Mr. Di Franco described the Italian effort in detail. The program, valued at $10 million, was approved today by the Italian Cabinet. After consultations with the United States, Italy agreed to provide security for the refugee camps immediately, using the 80 Italian officers already aiding the Albanian Government; this group is to be supplemented by a larger contingent from Italy, though the size was not announced. At Durres, an Albanian port city, the Italians will build a camp for 25,000 refugees and use the Italian soldiers and sailors already stationed in Albania for security.
If Albania asks for troop support in the camps along the Kosovo border, Italy is prepared to ask NATO for approval, according to Mr. Di Franco.
At the same time, the Serbs have apparently speeded up their forced expulsion of Albanians from Kosovo.
"It's just exploded today, and refugees have just been pouring over the borders," Ms. Abuzayd said. "The Serbs are running trains from Pristina carrying 3,000 Albanians on a 12-car train."
"We're fortunate we had food in our warehouses in anticipation of a refugee crisis," she said. "Now it is a question of organizing the offers and getting the supplies quickly where they are needed."
Among the other help offered today, France and Britain each pledged $15 million.
All of the relief agencies have been thrown out of Kosovo and most have left Belgrade, where they had stored three-fourths of their supplies. No international agencies remain to provide help or protection to the 260,000 Albanians displaced from their homes during the war, according to the United Nations agency. The buildings of most foreign agencies in Kosovo were looted and some were burned down by the Serbs as soon as the relief workers fled, Ms. Abuzayd said.
While the United States and the NATO allies have pledged that the refugees can return to Kosovo when the shooting stops, some critics of the Administration wonder if that will be possible without sending in ground troops.
"Over the long term, we have to decide whether we really are going to bring them back to Kosovo," said Morton Abramowitz, the former Ambassador to Turkey who oversaw the 1991 return of Kurdish refugees to northern Iraq under the protection of the American military. "And that's not going to happen unless we're prepared to put in force. If we haven't committed troops so far, I don't think it will be possible when it's time to bring the refugees home.

HEADLINE: Elegant Resort Faces an Inelegant Battle Over Gambling

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W. Va., March 26

 BODY:
The paradox of a luxury resort in a working-class county has always been apparent here in southeastern West Virginia. But now it is fueling a political fight, pitting the values of rural Christian fundamentalists against a life style of golf, aromatherapy and finger bowls with breakfast.
For the second time this century, the Greenbrier is planning to expand. Almost 90 years ago, the owners built a golf course that helped turn the stately hotel into one of the nation's best-known resorts, a favorite of the rich and the famous. 
 Now, as it faces financial uncertainty because of a dwindling number of visitors in the winter, expansion plans are under way again. This time the owners want to convert a once-secret bomb shelter built under the hotel for the use of Congress in the event of a nuclear war into West Virginia's first casino, for the exclusive use of the Greenbrier's guests.
Proponents say the casino would generate new jobs and tax revenue that are desperately needed in West Virginia, one of the poorest states in the nation. A study for the Greenbrier by West Virginia University says the casino would pump an additional $34 million into the local economy.
But building another golf course at the resort might be easier.
Led by local church leaders who regard gambling as evil, many residents of Greenbrier County are vowing to defeat a county referendum that would allow the casino to open, no matter what economic benefits it might generate.
Even guests at the Greenbrier, who now pay as much as $645 a night at the peak of the golf season, say they are not sure casino gambling belongs at a place so genteel that signs posted outside elevators at night ask for quiet, saying, "It's sleepy time down South."
"When I walked in here for the first time I thought I was stepping back in time, it was so elegant," said Becky Belew, a lawyer from Stuart's Draft, Va. "If you allow gambling to come in here, you would somehow diminish that."
The casino's leading opponents are less concerned with elegance than decadence. For years, they say, they have cherished the 672-room hotel as a good neighbor and the chief economic engine of Greenbrier County. The hotel staff grows to 1,600 during peak seasons, making it, by far, the largest employer in a three-county area. And jobs pay well. Even dishwashers can earn $10 an hour.
But opponents fear casino gambling will usher in a new era at the Greenbrier, which is owned by the CSX Corporation, a holding company primarily engaged in transportation operations and based in Richmond. Many say they fear that a casino would attract "the wrong kind of people" and fuel addictions to gambling, causing many to lose far more than they can afford.
"I love the Greenbrier," said the Rev. Patricia Jarvis, a vocal opponent of the casino who is pastor of the the United Methodist Church in Lewisburg. "I am certainly in favor of anything that strengthens it. But I don't think this is the way. You look around where gambling is a part of the landscape, and you see it has ruined the moral texture of the place."
The Rev. Mark Flynn, pastor of the Trinity United Methodist Church in nearby Ronceverte, said: "My intention is not to prevent people from having a good time. My intention is to prevent a large out-of-state corporation from setting up shop in my county to prey upon people who have a problem."
Objections by religious leaders are all the more striking in that only paying, registered guests of the Greenbrier would be permitted inside the casino. After rebuffing the hotel's lobbying efforts for five years, state lawmakers this month passed a narrowly written bill that bars outsiders from entering and prohibits the management from offering free rooms as a lure to well-heeled guests the way hotels in Las Vegas, Nev., and Atlantic City do.
The legislation would also channel a large portion of the casino's revenue to the state: 52 percent of the money from slot machines and 37 percent from gaming tables. Greenbrier County would get 4 percent of the gross revenue, the town of White Sulphur Springs 2 percent and the remaining six towns in the county would share another 2 percent.
Gov. Cecil H. Underwood, a pro-business Republican who is facing re-election next year, is expected to sign the bill soon.
But state lawmakers left final approval to voters in Greenbrier County as a concession to those who oppose gambling in general and fought the legislation on the ground that the state has all the gambling it needs in three horse racing tracks, a dog track and a lottery.
County officials predict that the referendum will go before voters next year, giving both sides time to plot strategy in what could become a bitter and costly fight.
Already, the fight is under way. Some church leaders have begun preaching against gambling in their Sunday sermons. At Ms. Jarvis's church, which opposes even raffles and Bingo, officials have circulated fliers that quotes the church's Book of Discipline, which says: "Gambling is a menace to society, deadly to the best interests of moral, social, economic and spiritual life, and destructive of good government. As an act of faith and concern, Christians should abstain from gambling and should strive to minister to those victimized by the practice."
Mr. Flynn said some religious leaders in the county had met with a political consulting firm in Clarksburg to discuss fund-raising in an effort to counter what they expect will be a hard fight from the Greenbrier for passage of the referendum.
Their instincts are good.
Ted J. Kleisner, president of the resort, said he would try to persuade county residents who might never see the inside of the casino that its potential economic benefits to the region outweigh concerns over gambling. If opened, Mr. Kleisner said, the casino would eliminate the off-season layoffs that leave as many as 800 hotel employees without jobs for three months of the year.
Mr. Kleisner also said he was sensitive to the tastes of typical guests, and promised that the casino would have none of the garishness of Atlantic City or Las Vegas and that building it in the former bomb shelter, a distant wing from the main lobby, would keep it far from children.
Aside from its potential status as the only legal casino in West Virginia, the Greenbrier gambling hall could become the only one ever built in a bunker to provide protection against nuclear war.
Constructed under utmost secrecy in the cold war, from 1958 to 1961, the bunker was designed to accommodate members of the House and Senate and their staffs for an indefinite period to assure that the legislative branch of the Federal Government could function in case of attack.
The bunker was fully maintained through 1992, when its presence was disclosed in a Washington Post magazine article. As a result, Congress voted to end its budget, and the bunker was closed in 1995.
Over the years, parts of the bunker were routinely used for hotel functions, although guests never knew their real purpose. The House and Senate chambers, for example, often served convention groups, and the staff meeting area became the hotel exhibition hall, which is where the casino would be built.
For now, it is unclear how the referendum vote might go. Both sides say they expect a turnout of about 40 percent of the county's 16,100 registered voters. But rather than break along party lines -- there are now 11,500 registered Democrats and 4,600 Republicans -- many county residents say the deciding factors are more likely to be moral and economic.
Eugene W. Walker, who owns a furniture store in Rainelle, Harold Hinkle, who owns a one-chair barber shop in Rupert, and other entrepreneurs in the county predicted that the casino would help put more people to work. "I'm all for it," Mr. Walker said.
But others are struggling with the choice. In her small flower shop in the tiny town of Rupert, Karen Patterson said she was in favor of more jobs but did not hesitate to sign a petition circulated by her church condemning the casino.
"As far as business-wise, it's good," she said. "But as far as Christian-wise, it's bad."

HEADLINE: Russian Woes May Aid U.S. Emissions Goals

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The United States and other industrial countries may find it easier and cheaper than expected to comply with a proposed treaty to fight global warming, thanks largely to reduced fuel consumption in Russia, the Government's energy-forecasting agency said today.
Because the agreement on global warming allows international trading of pollution credits as a way to control emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like those that come from burning fossil fuels, more of the cuts that the treaty seeks may come from the former Soviet Union and less from the United States, the Energy Information Administration said in its annual long-range forecast. 
 That would mean that the United States, the world's leading source of greenhouse gases, could meet the treaty's targets without completely reversing its recent increases in emissions, which have grown with energy use as the domestic economy blossomed. But substantial reductions in emissions would still be needed.
The agreement, negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 and signed last year by the Clinton Administration, has not been ratified by the Senate, where it faces significant opposition from lawmakers who say it would be too costly and would cause disruptive cuts in energy use.
The Kyoto Protocol calls for the United States to cut its emissions of greenhouse gases within 10 to 15 years to a level 7 percent below its emissions in 1990. Emissions in 1997 were 10 percent above the 1990 level and the energy agency has forecast that by 2010 they will be 33 percent above the 1990 level unless measures are imposed to reduce them.
But even as the United States and some other countries continue to burn more fossil fuels and to emit more carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, Russia and its neighbors are burning and emitting less than previously forecast, the agency said today.
Under the treaty, countries that give off more greenhouse gases than the treaty allows may buy surplus reductions from countries that give off less than their targets.
The energy agency said the continuing depression in Russia and other former Soviet states was holding down energy use and would probably produce a huge bubble of emissions credits by the time the treaty is supposed to come into force, between 2008 and 2012. The expected emissions of carbon dioxide in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in the year 2010 are likely to be 13 percent lower than predicted last year, the new forecast said.
These countries will have at least 374 million metric tons worth of carbon credits available to sell to other countries, it said. Last year, the agency forecast that these countries would have only 196 million metric tons of carbon credits. (Under the treaty, emissions of all greenhouse gases are tallied in units of carbon, one of the elements released when fossil fuels are burned.)
For countries like the United States whose emissions are growing far beyond the limits set by the treaty, the change is significant.
To meet the targets of the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized countries would need to eliminate about 822 million metric tons of carbon from their anticipated emissions.
"If the industrialized nations that have agreed to carbon emissions caps can purchase these credits, this level of trading alone would allow their carbon emission levels to rise by an average of 7 percent over 1990 levels, and still meet the Protocol's average emissions target of 7 percent below 1990 levels," the energy agency said.
Worldwide, the agency said, carbon emissions are expected to be 39 percent greater in 2010 than they were in 1990. While that is 4 percent less than the agency predicted last year, it suggests that the world as a whole is doing far less than needed to head off the risks of global warming.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE IRAQI CONNECTION;
Serbs Seek Iraqi Help For Defense, Britain Says

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The British Government said today that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia had formed a "close relationship" with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and that they had stepped up their military cooperation in the face of a common threat from American air strikes. American officials, however, were skeptical about the degree of cooperation.
Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the British Defense Staff, said at news conference in London to outline the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia that the Milosevic Government "is now a key military ally for Iraq" and that a Yugoslav delegation toured Iraqi air defense sites last month -- "no doubt to learn tactics on how to down allied aircraft." 
 "We have seen some of the tactics put into practice already over Serbia," he told reporters. "We are aware from a variety of sources that over the last six months this relationship has grown in depth and bredth, as both Milosevic and Saddam have come under increasingly pressure from the West."
He said there had recently been a "continuous two-way flow of military and defense industry delegations" between Yugoslavia and Iraq.
Clinton Administration officials confirmed news reports this week that a delegation of Yugoslav defense specialists visited Iraq in February, presumably to discuss air-defense tactics against American warplanes.
And they said that Yugoslav forces may have adopted tactics recommended by the Iraqis in dealing with the threat of American air strikes, including the movement of antiaircraft weapons into populated areas less likely to be attacked by NATO planes.
But they said today that American intelligence agencies had little evidence to suggest that the cooperation between the Yugoslav and Iraqi armed forces was as sweeping as the British suggested.
"The reports of contact between the Serbs and the Iraqis on air defense are true," said an intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "There were these contacts about a month ago. But I would not take from that the implication that there is an active and ongoing advisory or resupply effort. I just don't think we can substantiate that at this point."
He said that Iraq would be condemned by other Muslim nations in the Arab world if it assisted Yugoslavia in the persecution of the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo, which is mostly Muslim. The Iraqi Government today condemned the assault on Yugoslavia as "cowardly NATO aggression that is a flagrant violation of the United Nations charter and of international law," Iraq's official news agency, I.N.A., reported.
Still, the Pentagon has said publicly that recent military contacts between Yugoslavia and Iraq were no surprise, given that Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Hussein find themselves confronted by a common adversary.
"These are two countries, both subject to attack by forces within NATO," Kenneth Bacon, the Defense Department spokesman, said earlier this week. "They both have primarily Soviet-built or purchased air-defense systems, and they are both subject to international embargoes. So they obviously might look for ways to work together."
"I'm sure that the Yugoslavs believe that the Iraqis have learned a thing or two over the last seven years in dealing with Western aircraft," he continued. "What they've learned is that they haven't been able to deal with them very successfully."
Yugoslavia and Iraq have a history of military cooperation that predates by the Kosovo crisis by many years. In the 1980's, Yugoslavia sold Soviet-made air-defense equipment to Iraq and helped Baghdad in the construction of airfields, underground command centers and other infrastructure projects.
American and British officials said that Iraq, which has been the target of an international arms embargo since the 1991 gulf war, would be eager to obtain spare parts from Yugoslavia, especially for its air-defense network, while Yugoslavia would seek detailed information from Iraq about its knowledge of American combat tactics.
George Robertson, the British Defense Minister, said today that "what links these two countries together appears to be a determination in the face of domestic and economic difficulty to continue to build a war machine and, secondly, a callous disregard for human life."
Reaching for equally tough language, Sir Charles said that "all of this adds up to a close relationship between Saddam and Milosevic or, as somebody said to me, a marriage of convenience based on the suffering of their peoples."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE OVERVIEW;
NATO PLANS WEEKS OF BOMBING TO BREAK GRIP OF SERB LEADER

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, March 31

 BODY:
NATO opened its expanded bombing campaign against Yugoslavia today, and alliance officials said they were planning weeks of air strikes intended to undermine President Slobodan Milosevic's hold on power.
The stepped-up bombing of a broader range of sites as the second week of air strikes begins is intended to give the alliance a more effective tool to press Mr. Milosevic to halt the Serbian onslaught in Kosovo, NATO officials said. 
 NATO plans to bomb throughout Yugoslavia, with some exceptions, and the alliance's military commanders were quick to use their expanded authority today.
Kenneth H. Bacon, the Defense Department spokesman, said at the Pentagon that allied bombers had struck the headquarters of the Special Unit Corps, the Yugoslav equivalent of the American Special Forces.
"I believe it was the closest to downtown Belgrade that has been struck to date," Mr. Bacon said. He also reported that several tanks had been struck.
In unusually blunt language, the German general who is chairman of the alliance's military committee outlined the goal of the stepped-up attacks, which may take aim at command posts and Government buildings, including those in downtown Belgrade.
"We clearly intend to loosen his grip on power and break his will to continue and, as weather permits, to chip off his assets in Kosovo." Gen. Klaus Naumann said of Mr. Milosevic.
"If we start to chip away at the institutions that keep him in power, he may think it over," the general said in an interview.
The bombing of Yugoslavia has had the opposite effect so far. Serbs, including some who oppose Mr. Milosevic, have united behind their leader, who has cast himself as a heroic David against a bullying Goliath.
NATO's change in tactics stems from its continuing inability to halt the Serbian advances in Kosovo. Up to now, NATO has concentrated on bombing air defense sites and on striking the Serbian forces that are pressing the attack on ethnic Albanians in the province.
With bombing there hampered by bad weather, alliance officials were searching for other ways to compel Mr. Milosevic to call off his attacks.
"The more the action moves closer to Belgrade and other population centers, the more we will rattle the rather exuberant nationalist opinion," a Western official insisted.
NATO officials also hope that Yugoslavia's deteriorating economy, coupled with reluctance within the country's army to stand by as its bases and equipment are destroyed, will add to the pressure on Mr. Milosevic.
Mr. Bacon said NATO planes had reported hitting several tanks and other armored vehicles in Kosovo, although he said there had been no confirmation by reconnaissance planes. He said there were about 400 tanks in and around Kosovo.
"I don't think that anybody would expect to hit them all at once," he said. "But we are, as we have said many times, systematically attacking these forces, and we will continue to do that."
Mr. Bacon said NATO had struck "a major ammunition manufacturing plant" in the town of Cacak, 60 miles south of Belgrade. Reporters there were shown what the authorities called an appliance factory damaged in a strike.
With the flood of refugees into neighboring countries growing, NATO officials said there were reports of Serbian tank and artillery units shelling fleeing columns of Albanians in Kosovo.
France said it would detail 10 fighter planes to try to protect the refugees on their way to Albania and Macedonia, while other countries pledged logistical and financial support for the refugees.
Russia announced that it was sending some of its aging Black Sea warships into the Mediterranean to "monitor" the Balkan crisis, a gesture that United States officials said they did not consider a military threat but feared might lend moral support to the Milosevic Government.
The ships include an intelligence vessel that could provide some information to Belgrade on NATO military operations in the Adriatic Sea.
Officials said today that NATO's classified order setting the terms of the air strikes called for a campaign to "break the will" of Serbia's leadership if Belgrade did not back away from attacks against ethnic Albanians. The officials said they were planning for a brutal test of Mr. Milosevic's resolve that could go on for weeks.
Javier Solana, the NATO Secretary General, said he hoped that the campaign could be concluded before the alliance's summit meeting, which is to begin on April 23. Other officials were not so sure.
NATO leaders gave their military commanders the broader authority to attack Yugoslavia at a meeting here that ended early this morning.
The expansion of the target list came after a closed-door debate among the NATO allies. The United States proposed that the alliance open a new, more offensive stage of operations that would enable allied warplanes to attack military and industrial sites throughout Yugoslavia and Government ministries in downtown Belgrade. In NATO, that stage was referred to as Phase 3.
But allies like Italy and Greece have been uneasy over the bombing campaign, and a compromise was worked out giving the alliance a broader range of targets, but not as much flexibility as the United States had proposed.
"As always in NATO decisions, there was a compromise," a senior NATO official said. "What we got will give the executing commanders sufficient leeway to act."
Using its new targeting authority, NATO will be allowed to broaden its strikes to include command-and-control centers throughout the country and Government headquarters in the Yugoslav capital.
"No facility, no unit which is currently being used to plan, conceive, direct or carry out operations is going to be a sanctuary," a NATO spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said today.
NATO commanders used their new authority just a few hours after the alliance approved it this morning. And a NATO official said the alliance appeared to have deflected pressure from Greek and Italian diplomats, as well as the Vatican, for a pause in the bombing for Easter.
But the air operations will fall short of the Phase 3 plan that the United States had wanted to carry out. Some of Yugoslavia's military-industrial complex and infrastructure north of the 44th parallel will remain off-limits for now.
The alliance will not attack Yugoslavia's television broadcasting system without further discussions among NATO members, a Western official added.
The presidential palace used by Mr. Milosevic also cannot be attacked, according to the guidelines. NATO officials said that as the palace of the former King of Yugoslavia, it is considered to be a historic and cultural site. Also, it has a Rembrandt on its first floor.
"How can we win the hearts and minds of the people of Yugoslavia if we destroyed the palace?" a NATO official said.
Even though military experts are debating the use of ground forces, NATO officials said there were no current plans to send them as a invasion force to take over Kosovo or for the less ambitious mission of protecting enclaves of refugees within Kosovo.
The fight in Kosovo has emerged as one of the clearest tests of air power. Some Air Force officials have long argued that laser-guided bombs and cruise missiles would enable technologically superior powers to win a victory through air power.
Pinpoint strikes against command centers, communications links and internal security forces, these officials have insisted, could destroy the levers of power that the enemy leadership needs to control its society. At the same time, punishing raids would generate unrest within its military.
The theory was put to the test against Iraq during the Persian Gulf war of 1991 when the United States used F-117 stealth fighters and cruise missiles to take their attack to downtown Baghdad. But President Saddam Hussein was still in power after six weeks of air strike, and eight years later he still is.

HEADLINE: Many Hospitals in New York Quit Plan for Fewer Doctors

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
Two years ago, dozens of teaching hospitals across New York State embraced an unusual pilot program to ease the nationwide glut of physicians. The Federal Government would pay bonuses to the hospitals if they trained fewer doctors, just as it once paid corn farmers not to grow corn.
But half those hospitals have now dropped out of the plan after finding that they cannot function without the low-cost labor provided by doctors in training, known as residents. 
 The development, which comes even as the Government is planning to expand the New York pilot program nationwide, raises doubts about Federal efforts to curb the number of doctors in the nation, and it illustrates a conundrum of health care today. While society at large can ill afford to have an oversupply of doctors, which experts say drives up the cost of health care, hospital officials cannot afford to run their institutions without the trainees who will add to that oversupply.
"The financial benefits to teaching hospitals are still so great that there's an incentive to train more physicians, whether they are needed in the long run or not," said Edward Salsberg, director of the Center for Health Workforce Studies at the State University in Albany.
The pilot program in New York was devised by officials from the Greater New York Hospital Association, an influential trade group. It was approved in early 1997 by the Federal agency that pays for training of physicians, the Health Care Financing Administration, which hoped to reap eventual savings of hundreds of millions of dollars.
Essentially, hospitals needed to cut 20 percent to 25 percent of their residents over six years to receive the subsidies.
But the hospitals found that in many cases, they were replacing the trainees -- fully qualified medical doctors who log 80-hour weeks and earn about $50,000 a year -- with more established doctors, who work a more typical 40-hour week and earn about $150,000.
"It became clear how indispensable the residents are to providing high-quality care on a day-in, day-out basis," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the hospital association. "When you actually began to go to the drafting board and engineer it, that's when all the problems began to pop up. It became clear that they couldn't do it."
The hospitals that have dropped out -- mostly large private institutions like New York Hospital and Beth Israel Medical Center -- knew what the program entailed when they entered it. But they had been counting on two things that never materialized: declining patient populations, which would reduce the need for residents, and sharp cuts in the Medicare reimbursements paid to hospitals to train doctors.
The two dozen hospitals that have remained in the program have, in fact, experienced declines in their patient loads, making it easier for them to pare their resident positions.
The Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y., eagerly joined the program but soon discovered that the "replacement costs were extraordinary," said Edward A. Stolzenberg, the center's director.
Center officials estimated that it would actually cost the institution $1.5 million a year to stay in the Federal program. So three months ago, they withdrew and are now planning to put back most of the 40 resident positions they had cut.
While costs were the main reason that Westchester Medical bowed out, the less tangible benefits of running a robust training program also affected the decision. "Residents keep you on the cutting edge," Mr. Stolzenberg said. "They push the faculty to a higher standard of care. When a student is watching you and you're teaching, it's harder to get away with short cuts."
For years, health care experts have decried the overabundance of doctors in the United States. A surplus of doctors, particularly specialists, pushes up health costs, economists say, and drains Medicare, the Federal insurance program for the elderly that provides $7.4 billion a year nationally to hospitals for medical training. In 1995, one group, the Pew Health Professions Commission, recommended shutting down a quarter of the nation's medical schools.
On the face of it, an excess of doctors could be expected to reduce costs, based on theories of supply and demand. But most health economists say the opposite is true. The oversupply of doctors in many specialties and in urban areas of the country, they say, results in unnecessary tests, procedures and referrals to other doctors.
"In the case of medicine, supply and demand are not dependent," said Mr. Salsberg of the Center for Health Workforce Studies. "If you have 100 doctors, they will keep themselves busy, and if you have 200 doctors, they will keep busy also. If a specialty gets crowded, you wind up with subspecialists, and the danger is they will have a narrower perspective and you can end up with more services being delivered."
New York State, which trains 15 percent of the country's physicians, is by far the nation's largest producer of new doctors. That is one reason the Health Care Financing Administration was interested in pursuing a pilot program in New York. The agency is now writing regulations that would expand the program nationwide, as required by the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.
Health care analysts and even some hospital officials say Medicare's reputation over the years as a generous provider of training dollars has led, in part, to the continuing expansion of hospital residency programs. Medicare pays hospitals up to $100,000 a year for each resident they train, and there was no ceiling in early 1997 on the number of residents that a hospital could have.
Some health care experts say hospitals have traditionally made money on the trainees, though officials at the Greater New York Hospital Association deny that, pointing out the costs of employment benefits, administration costs and the inefficiencies associated with rookie doctors.
The 49 hospitals that joined the Federal program in New York, officially known as the Medicare Graduate Medical Education Demonstration Project, were facing a radically altered health care landscape that offered unprecedented financial pressures.
First, there was managed care, newly established in New York and dictating price concessions from doctors and hospitals. Then, there was deregulation. At the start of 1997, New York lifted the state-mandated rates that hospitals could charge insurers, a move that ushered in a new era of competition among hospitals for managed-care contracts.
Finally, Medicare itself seemed poised to scale back the reimbursements to hospitals for training doctors as Congress hashed out the terms of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. A separate proposal before the Medicare Commission was even more worrisome, removing the financing for graduate medical education from Medicare altogether and handing it over to a special appropriations budget so that New York would have to compete with other states for a limited pool of money.
"A lot of hospitals thought inpatient capacity would plummet like a stone," said Patricia J. Wang, a senior vice president of the Greater Hospital Association of New York, "and if it drops, you can't have all these residency programs."
Hospital officials in New York reasoned that the Federal subsidy program would help end their reliance on medical residents, who treat patients under attending physicians' supervision, and would help them withstand expected cuts in Medicare funds. Under the pilot program, Medicare continues to pay participating hospitals as if those young doctors were still there, slowly phasing out the payments over six years.
But for many hospitals, the sky never fell. The average length of time a patient stays in the hospital has dropped, but the number of admissions has stayed about the same or even risen. At the same time, the Balanced Budget Act lowered the reimbursement rate just slightly, although it did cap the number of residents that Medicare would pay to train at 1996 levels.
Perhaps most importantly, the Balanced Budget Act created its own incentive for hospitals to shrink residency programs. Though the subsidy was smaller than New York's pilot program, it did not entail the specific reduction targets or timetables. Hospital officials realized that they could derive some benefit from downsizing, but at their own pace.
The hospitals in the New York program were also struggling to cut their residency programs while adhering to state rules, adopted in 1989, that limit the workloads of medical residents to 80 hours a week.
"They were trying to meet two contradictory objectives," said Bruce C. Vladeck, former administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, the Federal agency that runs the pilot program.
"One objective was to reduce the number of residents and the other was to reduce the number of hours the residents are working," said Mr. Vladeck, who is now the senior vice president for policy of the Mount Sinai N.Y.U. Medical Center and Health System. "They weren't able to square that circle."
To date, 26 hospitals have left the program, including three hospitals in the Mount Sinai consortium and five in the New York University consortium that defected early last month. Officials of the Health Care Financing Administration, which is part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, are certainly not pleased that so many participants have pulled out but assert that the program has still succeeded in raising awareness.
"We're not surprised that some of the hospitals have chosen to withdraw because the residency reductions are demanding," said Dr. Robert Berenson, director of the administration's Center for Health Plans and Providers.
The retreat by so many hospitals from the New York program may come as a surprise to critics from other states who contended that the Federal Government was playing favorites in giving New York such a sweet deal. If the original participants had all stayed in the program, the Government would have paid the New York hospitals $400 million in incentives. But that was $300 million less than what the Government would have spent if the current system was continued.
"This ought to pretty conclusively demonstrate to people that this was not a giveaway of largess from the Federal treasury to New York hospitals," said James R. Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund, a research and philanthropic group. "It was partial assistance for a very difficult shift."

HEADLINE: A High-Definition Gambit;
Chinese Test U.S. Market With Cheaper HDTV Sets

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Think "Made in China," and plastic toys, T-shirts, sneakers and simple tape recorders come to mind, all assembled cheaply in anonymous factories for foreign brands.
One Chinese manufacturer, the Konka Group Company, wants to change that image. With considerable hubris, Konka is seeking to make the leap from a well-known brand in China to global consumer electronics maker by grabbing a share of the United States market for television sets. 
 The American market is among the toughest in the world, but Konka is betting that it can compete in large part by being among the first and the cheapest in offering Americans the next generation of TV sets: those that will offer the digitally improved picture and sound of high-definition television.
"They're trying to come up the food chain in terms of technology," said Jack C. Fensterstock, president of the China Capital Corporation, a venture capital firm in Bethesda, Md., that invests in Chinese companies, but not in Konka.
While it is too early to start talking about China Inc., Konka's plans point to new ambitions among Chinese manufacturers, ambitions that echo those of young Japanese and South Korean manufacturers in earlier decades. A slowdown in China, after two decades of explosive growth, combined with fierce domestic competition, has forced Chinese companies to consider how to pursue growth in foreign markets more aggressively -- even if it means going head-to-head against the world's leaders in technology and marketing.
Chinese manufacturers "really want to show that they've come a long way," Mr. Fensterstock said. "It's a national strategy to do this in China."
Wendy Wu, Konka's head of sales and marketing in the United States, said: "We think we are strong enough to come to this country. This is the right time. We don't see the right time in another five years."
She added that other Chinese companies were tracking Konka's progress in the United States. "Everybody's watching us," she said.
But breaking into the $8 billion United States television market will not be easy. Some 98 percent of households already own at least one set. And Konka must still enlist a major distributor to get its products in national chains if it is to face up to the firepower of bigger and better-known manufacturers.
"Most Americans take their televisions very seriously," said Nick Donatiello, the president and chief executive of Odyssey Group, a market research firm in San Francisco. "This is not a frivolous thing. Brand names matter a lot, and the top brands are very powerful. It's not enough to have your televisions sitting in Good Guys or Circuit City."
Still, Konka's history fits a familiar pattern in consumer electronics. Like the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company of Japan, maker of the Panasonic brand, and LG Group of South Korea, maker of Goldstar, Konka began assembling electronics for foreign manufacturers drawn by cheap labor. And as those Asian giants did, Konka is counting on taking a great leap forward in consumer electronics through technology.
Konka contends that high-definition television, still in its infancy, offers an opening for a newcomer. The sale of HDTV sets is but a trickle -- fewer than 20,000 sets since their introduction in August -- and programming is limited. Yet as HDTV's bright, vivid picture and crystal-clear sound seduce more consumers, and as broadcasters step up their transition to digital programming, the potential is vast in a nation of 250 million conventional sets.
"We see the HDTV revolution as a great opportunity," Wei Rong-chen, Konka's president, said in a telephone interview from Hong Kong. "As a new brand bringing in a new technology, we can deliver a message to the consumer that Konka is not just a common TV manufacturer.
If Konka puts its sets on American shelves, -- no major regional or national retailer has so far agreed to carry them -- many consumer electronics analysts expect its greatest selling point will be price. Konka plans to introduce a $3,000 32-inch-screen HDTV set this fall. At the moment, that is less than half the price of sets with more familiar names, now selling for $7,000 to $8,000.
Later this year, however, the price advantage will narrow somewhat, as HDTV sets from RCA, made by Thomson Multimedia of France, and from Panasonic and other big names are expected to be offered for several thousand dollars less. Hitachi of Japan is already selling an HDTV set for $2,999. Hitachi's and Konka's sets, as well as most others, will still require the purchase of a set-top box, costing at least $700, to translate analog signals into digital ones until more HDTV programming is available.
Konka says its digital set is made with technology the company developed in China and at its new research and development plant in San Jose, Calif. The company will provide the cabinets and much of the circuitry for the sets. The picture tubes, the most costly part of a set, are provided by other electronics companies like Thomson and Toshiba -- a common practice in the industry. And the HDTV chip which powers the sets will also come from a foreign maker.
"It probably won't be the highest- resolution set," said Richard Doherty, director of research at Envisioneering, a market research firm, who saw a Konka set at a recent trade show. Nonetheless, he believes that price alone can attract buyers.
"I'm not saying it's the full quality of a Sony," he said, "but wow, it's going to be an awful lot of value for the money."
While price may give Konka an in-road in the United States, it will never be able to compete with Sony and the other giants until it develops its own technology.
"Each time they have to wait for the Japanese companies to come up with a new product, and then they copy," said Yasheng Huang, an associate professor at the Harvard Business School. "No Chinese company has permanent competitiveness. You try to catch up with the innovators, but you're never the first."
Konka is not wanting for ambition. It is entering the United States on its own, a difficult task given that two much bigger companies, Thomson and Royal Philips Electronics of the Netherlands, established themselves by buying American brands. Thomson bought RCA in 1987; Philips bought Magnavox in 1974, and LG bought control of Zenith in 1995.
In October, Konka began selling some of its conventional analog sets, including models in bright blue or silver cabinets, in California and Florida through small, regional consumer electronics retailers like Brandsmart U.S.A and Fry's Electronics. The Home Shopping Network has begun offering a white 13-inch Konka set for about $120. Konka will also sell digital videodisk players and two television set-top boxes.
So far, Konka says it has shipped 25,000 conventional televisions to the United States; its goal is 250,000 sets this year, anticipating that only 2,000 will be HDTV sets. Those are very modest goals, given that more than 26 million sets were shipped to United States dealers last year, according to the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association.
Konka, based in Shenzhen, a boom town on Hong Kong's border, started assembling small, portable television sets for Thomson, and others in 1979, when the Chinese economy first opened up. The company began selling televisions under its own name in 1993 and now has 25 percent of China's television market -- more than Panasonic or Sony. Konka sold 4.7 million sets in China last year.
It began tackling overseas markets in Australia, Russia, Latin America and the Middle East. In those markets, Konka was able to gain market share by using the same price strategy that made it a success in China: underpricing better-known brands and offering retailers greater margins to entice them to carry the sets. And Konka placed stronger emphasis on advertising, marketing and brand image than other Chinese exporters had done in the past.
Marketing strategies that worked well in China and elsewhere, however, may not translate in the United States.
"They're aiming their pitch directly at price and at Sony," said Kathleen Maher, editor in chief of The Peddie Report, which follows the graphics and multimedia industries. "They have televisions in colored boxes. I have no idea why American consumers would be interested in colored boxes. If you're trying to compete with Sony, it seems contradictory to have purple television sets."
Yet Konka does have other advantages. All its products are now manufactured in China. Beginning in July, conventional television sets destined for the United States will be made at a 30,000-square-foot plant it is building in Tijuana, Mexico. Manufacturing in China and Mexico will help keep Konka's costs low. Konka says it costs the company about $2,000 to produce an HDTV set and about $400 to $500 to manufacture a 32-inch conventional set.
It costs the big manufacturers on average about $12,000 for an HDTV -- more than its price, as demand is still low -- and $650 for a 32-inch conventional set, Mr. Doherty of the Envisioneering Group estimated. Konka has "cost structures few companies can afford to beat," he said.
For now, Konka is barely on the radar screen of the consumer electronics industry.
Dave Arland, a spokesman for Thomson, said the company was not worried about the prospect of a $3,000 HDTV set from Konka, noting that "$3,000 is still a lot of money."
" People pick names that they know, that have figured out this technology and that they know are not going to disappear," he said.
Still, if Konka executives are able to dispel whatever doubts American shoppers may have about quality or about the wisdom of purple TV sets, they can take heart in history.
"At one point," Mr. Doherty noted, " no one had heard of the brand name Sony either."

HEADLINE: EATING OUT;
The Theater District

 BODY:

Frequently asked question: Where can I eat near the theater district? Here are a dozen options. (These summaries, written by Eric Asimov, are taken from Ruth Reichl's and Mr. Asimov's dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times.)
 
1. Bali Nusa Indah
+
(212) 265-2200
651 Ninth Avenue, near 45th Street
$ All major cards
Indonesian restaurants are rare in New York, but Bali Nusa Indah is a good one, offering fresh and lively dishes in a pleasant, pretty setting. As you might expect, the food is forcefully spiced, and if it's still not hot enough, the tables are set with two sambals, or hot sauces: one searing and the other incendiary. Among the dishes worth trying are Javanese fisherman's soup; corn fritters gently flavored with shrimp; nasi goreng, the wonderful Indonesian version of fried rice, and sea bass broiled in a banana leaf. For dessert, you might try lapis legit, a mellow cinnamon cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 

2. Firebird
** Rating: Two Stars
(212) 586-0244
365 West 46th Street
$$$ All major cards
With its ornate, lavish air of czarist aristocracy, Firebird now dominates the fantasy vacuum left by the closing of the Russian Tea Room. Both the sumptuous dining room downstairs and the cozy parlor upstairs enhance the illusion of old-fashioned elegance. Champagne and caviar help, of course. Caviar arrives with a covered pot of blini, a dish of sour cream, a pitcher of butter and its own private waiter, who turns the service into a distinctly Russian performance. Caviar is just the beginning of the selection. The menu also features wonderful Ukrainian borscht, exceptional grilled sturgeon and fine grilled marinated lamb loin.
 
3. Frico Bar
** Rating: Two Stars
(212) 564-7272
402 West 43d Street
$$ All major cards
Once just a place for a casual bite after the theater, Frico Bar has taken a serious turn and is serving the most interesting Italian food in the theater district. Frico specializes in foods of the northeast, a region that prizes meat and cheese. Sformata di parmigiano, a cheese flan, is a dreamy dish, so light it seems to float above its bed of spinach, while the most impressive appetizer is cotechino, flavorful sausage set on a bed of braised lentils and marinated turnips. The unusual pastas range from the lightest potato gnocchi imaginable topped with a wild boar ragu to delicate crespelle, lacy crepes folded around a mixture of chard, spinach and herbs in a smooth cheese sauce. Main courses, like cod with fennel and chicken in rosemary sauce, are big and solid. Of course, if all you want is a snack and a glass of wine, you can still get that. A traditional frico, the namesake dish -- a crisp pancake stuffed with potatoes, onions and herbs -- makes a perfect little meal.
 
4. The Garrick
+
(212) 489-8600
242 West 49th Street
$ All major cards
This handsome, clubby little restaurant in the lobby of the Mayfair, a small hotel on West 49th Street, has a theatrical pedigree. Named after the 17th-century Shakespearean actor David Garrick, who founded a London club called the Garrick, it has wood-paneled walls covered with wonderful 1940's-era celebrity photographs, borrowed from the Museum of the City of New York. It's worth a visit to see the original photo of Lauren Bacall reclining sultrily on Harry Truman's piano. But the food is just as important a reason to come. The menu is largely a retrospective of 1940's favorites, matching the era celebrated in the photos. It is not entirely $25 and under, but the Garrick offers an excellent $25 three-course prix fixe, including many of its best dishes, available pre-theater and Sunday nights. Oysters Rockefeller is rich and luxurious, while the puff-pastry pissaladiere, topped with olives, caramelized onions and garlicky snails, is excellent. Lobster thermidor is a tasty retro novelty, the chopped seafood blended with white wine, shallots and mustard, while roasted baby chicken has a Provencal brightness to it.
 
5. Ipanema
+
(212) 730-5848
13 West 46th Street
$ All major cards
Ipanema is not a formal restaurant, though there is a certain formality to its appearance: a polished wood floor, beige walls, vases of dried flowers in wall niches and lighting so dim it is impossible to make out any of the small works of art on the wall. But the lusty food counters any stiffness in the decor. Caldo verde, an intense, smoky soup with strips of kale, potato and slices of linguica, the Portuguese sausage, is a delicious appetizer, as is linguica frita, a big plate of sausage cut into small rounds and fried until just crisp around the edges. Feijoada, the national dish of Brazil, is both an impressive presentation and an unmanageable portion. First comes an iron platter full of a rich black bean stew and various types of smoked pork and sausage. Then comes a bowl of rice, a dish of orange slices, a plate of crunchy cassava blended with egg, and a portion of collard greens. Mixed together, it's a wonderful balance of bold flavors and textures, and altogether too much for one person.
 
6. John's Pizza
+
(212) 391-7560
260 West 44th Street
$ All major cards
John's Pizzeria, a branch of John's of Bleecker Street, is a temple for worshiping pizza, almost literally. Housed in what used to be the Christian Alliance Gospel Tabernacle Church, John's, with 400 seats, is both the largest pizzeria in New York and the most beautiful. A restored stained glass rotunda is the centerpiece here, bathing the airy two-story main dining room in a mellow glow.
The beauty of John's pizza is its simplicity, unmarred by excess or exaggeration. The crust is thin and faintly smoky, just crisp enough to offer a delicate crunch, while the other ingredients are fine: creamy mozzarella, slightly spicy tomato sauce, crumbled fennel sausage from Faicco Pork Store in the Village. Two important differences from the original: The service is much nicer and you're likely to be able to get a seat without waiting.
 
7. Shaan
** Rating: Two Stars
(212) 977-8400
57 West 48th Street
$$ All major cards
Most of the food at Shaan is delicious, but the big menu can be a minefield. Sometimes different dishes turn out to taste more or less the same, and it does not help that the waiters, who are quite formal, seem reluctant to step in with suggestions. But order right, and the food can be a complete delight. Dahi batata poori, tiny puffs of the great Indian bread stuffed with a searingly spicy mixture of minced potatoes, chickpeas and bean sprouts, are a great beginning, as is tawa chicken, moist, boneless pieces of white meat cooked with onions, peppers and lots of spices. Tandoori quail is an inspired use of the clay oven, and lobster, rolled into a smooth, spicy red sauce rich with chilies and ginger, is fabulous. Vegetable dishes like methi palak corn, baby corn in a sumptuous spinach sauce shot through with the strong taste of fenugreek, are a joy.
 
8. Sugiyama
*** Rating: Three Stars
(212) 956-0670
251 West 55th Street
$$$$ All major cards
This tiny restaurant doesn't look much different from many other little Japanese restaurants, but the food is so extraordinary that a visit to Sugiyama feels like a dreamy voyage to Japan. The chef and owner, Nao Sugiyama, serves modern kaiseki meals: you tell the chef how many courses you want (5 to 14) and how much you are willing to spend (the top of the line is $150 a person) and simply put yourself in his hands. This artful food makes no concessions to American prejudices. Splendid sushi is a part of each meal, but there are often sliced sea cucumber in vinegar, tiny crabs no larger than a fingernail (you pop the whole creature into your mouth), lily roots, ginger buds and blocks of soft tofu laced with tiny fish. Mr. Sugiyama often begins the meal with ankimo, the smooth Japanese version of foie gras (actually monkfish liver), served with a tiny wooden spoon. Most meals continue with zensai, beautiful little appetizers arranged with great delicacy, then an assortment of sashimi, then perhaps rich, decadent black cod marinated in sake lees. The meal invariably closes with a trio of miso soup, pickles and rice. Traditionally it would be followed by an improbably expensive piece of fruit. In its place Mr. Sugiyama offers a refreshing grapefruit jelly splashed with cream.
 
9. Virgil's Real BBQ

(212) 921-9494
152 West 44th Street
$ All major cards
This big, two-story restaurant is a virtual primer on American barbecue, offering uncanny reproductions of barbecue styles from North Carolina to Texas, as well as dishes from other parts of the Southern food spectrum. Pork ribs and pulled Carolina pork are top-notch, as are biscuits, fried chicken and even hot dogs. In addition to a huge selection of beers and bourbons, Virgil's offers an unexpectedly interesting wine list, practically all American.
 
10. Wu Liang Ye

(212) 398-2308
36 West 48th Street
$ All major cards
Wu Liang Ye is part of a Chinese restaurant chain that has three branches in Manhattan and specializes in peppery, robust Sichuan dishes. Sliced conch is one of its more unusual dishes, firm, chewy and nutty, served with spicy red oil. Twice-cooked bacon with chilies is a fine dish that alternates fat and heat in a very appealing way, while spicy bean curd comes in a gingery sauce. The other Manhattan branches are at 338 Lexington Avenue, near 39th Street, in Murray Hill, and at 215 East 86th Street in Yorkville.
 
11. Ya Bowl
+
(212) 764-3017
125 West 45th Street
$ All major cards
While the atmosphere at this sweet little restaurant is unmistakably Japanese, the small dining room could almost be mistaken for any New York living room. Posters of French advertisements and an orchestra conductor adorn one wall, while another is lined with bookshelves. The raison d'etre of Ya Bowl is the bowl meals, one-pot meals in which hot food is served over rice in a bowl, a delicious and economical method. Salmon teriyaki is typical -- a well-cooked salmon steak brushed with sweet teriyaki sauce, which drips into the rice below. Even better is the unusual sukiyaki, the beef-and-vegetable stew, which is simmered in a sweet soy sauce and served with egg over rice. Chicken cutlet, a boneless breast pounded thin and deep-fried, is crisp and greaseless and is especially good flavored with a mild curry sauce, a popular adopted food in Japan. Ya Bowl also serves excellent soba, brown buckwheat noodles, in a sweet sauce of soy and rice wine.
 
12. Zuni
+
(212) 765-7626
598 Ninth Avenue, at 43d Street
$ All major cards
This appealing little restaurant not far from Times Square draws a regular crowd of theater people and local residents. As its name suggests, the original focus was Southwestern, but the menu has evolved as the kitchen has changed hands. The current chef, John Chee, is all over the map with Southwestern dishes like chili-rubbed rib-eye steak, New Orleans specialties like chicken and shrimp jambalaya, and geographically indecipherable offerings like sesame-crusted salmon with mango-black-bean salsa and basmati rice. If it's too confusing, settle for the meatloaf and garlic mashed potatoes. It's usually all pretty good.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 8.
 
Now Playing
 
* "ANALYZE THIS," starring Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow and Chazz Palminteri. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title, concept and teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the lights go down, so think of this comedy as an offer you can't refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, Mr. De Niro is hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic goodfella style. His mobster finds just the right comic foil in Billy Crystal, as the psychiatrist who utters the immortal: "When I got into family therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind." There's a lot more where that came from in this breezy comic treat (Janet Maslin). 

"BABY GENIUSES," starring Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd and many toddlers. Directed by Bob Clark (PG, 94 minutes). One way to get through this guaranteed 100 percent laugh-free comedy is to wonder whether it really is the worst film you've even seen. Probably not, but it's pretty darn close. Woefully substandard production values give it a ghastly look, made all the worse by the grotesque computer morphing of young children into adult-style wise guys. The plotting is shrill, bordering on incomprehensible. Ms. Turner lurches through the film with a performance that just says, "Hey, it's a living" (Maslin).
 
* "CENTRAL STATION," starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Mr. Salles's film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Mr. Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's very best (Maslin).
 
"THE CORRUPTOR," starring Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg. Directed by James Foley (R, 111 minutes). A conventional but above-average police drama set in Chinatown in New York City, "The Corruptor" finds the rookie cop Danny Wallace (Mr. Wahlberg) learning the ropes from his rule-bending partner, Nick Chen (Mr. Chow), who has gotten dangerously chummy with Chinatown's mob bosses. The atmosphere is gritty, the action sequences sleek and the questions the story raises about loyalty, ethics, friendship and betrayal, although familiar, are still worth bringing up. "The Corruptor" is a more effective showcase for the brooding charisma of Mr. Chow, a Hong Kong action superstar, than "The Replacement Killers," his English-language debut (Stephen Holden).
 
* "THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN," starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams, Whoopi Goldberg and Jonathan Jackson. Directed by Ulu Grosbard (PG-13, 108 minutes). Ms. Pfeiffer gives a fine, affecting performance in this adaptation of Jacquelyn Mitchard's best seller. And Mr. Grosbard carefully delineates its story of a child's disappearance and its aftermath, showing the ways that such a catastrophe affects his family. Restrained and unsentimental, this astute drama deals thoughtfully with the chasm between real and idealized family lives (Maslin).
 
* "EDTV," starring Matthew McConaughey, Ellen DeGeneres, Woody Harrelson, Martin Landau, Jenna Elfman and Rob Reiner. Directed by Ron Howard (PG-13, 120 minutes). In this good-humored, deceptively easygoing satire, Mr. Howard holds up a fun-house mirror to a world ruled by voyeurism and specious fame. The subject matter is familiar by now, but this film about a Trumanesque nobody as 24-hour-a-day television star has a shrewd way of drawing the audience into its web. Permeated by all the crassness and absurdity inherent in celebrity-mad culture, and by our collective obsession with snoopy trivia, it features a fine ensemble cast and a dependably jokey screenplay by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. It helps that most of the principals, in a cast that also includes Elizabeth Hurley, have played this game for real and act their roles with a comic vengeance (Maslin).
 
"ELIZABETH," the Oscar winner for best makeup. Starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124 minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Elizabeth I as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays the Queen as if her principal responsibilities were being bejeweled, selecting consorts and saying "Leave us!" with a wave of the hand. For all its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, this is historical drama for those whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene reminiscent of "Saturday Night Fever," it winds up imagining the Queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman afflicted by a super-intense case of having it all (Maslin).
 
"FORCES OF NATURE," starring Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck. Directed by Bronwen Hughes (PG-13, 102 minutes). Does Ms. Bullock's loopy girl-next-door charm really make audiences want to follow her anywhere? If so, they'd better be prepared for an amusement park ride with senior citizens, a long romp through K-mart and the other equally desperate settings for a road movie that otherwise has nowhere to go. A would-be screwball romantic comedy about a man thrown together with a zany drifter en route to his own wedding, it shows off Ms. Bullock to amusing if overly frenetic advantage. Mr. Affleck fares less well with the film's wimpier role. Some of the material's many gaps are filled by special-effects hail and windstorms, which are as close as the title comes to making any sense (Maslin).
 
* "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL" (winner of the best foreign film and best dramatic score Oscars), directed by and starring Roberto Benigni (named best actor) (PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to find humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly entertaining as its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more somber second act, Mr. Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear (Maslin).
 
* "LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS," starring Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Sting, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Nick Moran. Directed by Guy Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since "The Usual Suspects" has there been such an oversupply of cool macho schemers in a single film. And they're served up with a quick, tart economy that bespeaks the filmmaker's background making videos and commercials -- actually an advantage, for a change. There's not much beneath the surface here; what's most entertaining is Mr. Ritchie's droll, hard-boiled storytelling and the rogue's gallery of a cast that he has assembled. All the film need do is juggle assorted miscreants and four separate gangs who, figuratively speaking, can't shoot straight (Maslin).
 
* "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN," Oscar winner for best cinematography, best editing, best sound and best sound-effects editing. Starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg. Directed by Steven Spielberg (winner of the best-director Oscar) (R, 168 minutes). Mr. Spielberg's soberly magnificent new film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning back the clock to restore passion and meaning to the genre, he works in a spirit of urgent communication to look at war as if it has not been looked at before. Tour de force battle scenes are frank without sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who made you believe there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet has made this an irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Mr. Hanks continues to astonish with admirable modesty, and the rest of the casting is comparably inspired. As he did with "Schindler's List," Mr. Spielberg has made a landmark film of devastating power (Maslin).
 
* "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE" (the Oscar winner for best film, best original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best comedy score.) Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench (best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of "Romeo and Juliet," glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
 
* "TANGO," starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and directed by Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro (PG-13, 100 minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and virtuosity. And it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say that the dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most electrifying dance film, Mr. Saura offers transfixingly beautiful glimpses of the dance and the great range of emotions it can conjure. Mr. Storaro's dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the nuances this material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly consumed by tango fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).
 
* "TRUE CRIME," starring Clint Eastwood, Isaiah Washington, James Woods and Lisa Gay Hamilton. Directed by Clint Eastwood (R, 127 minutes). In his most quietly poignant film since "A Perfect World," Mr. Eastwood directs a death row thriller with redemption on its mind. Beginning almost casually, and taking on growing urgency as it moves toward an imaginatively suspenseful ending, it tells of a jaded newspaper reporter who, to his own surprise as much as anyone else's, finds himself fighting at the 11th hour to save a possibly innocent man from execution. Mr. Eastwood is older than the man he plays, but not too old to be plausible as the father of an adorable little girl in the cast; she happens to be his real daughter (Maslin).
 
* "A WALK ON THE MOON," starring Diane Lane, Viggo Mortensen, Liev Schreiber, Tovah Feldshuh and Anna Pacquin. Directed by Tony Goldwyn (R, 107 minutes). This evocative 1969 period piece, set on the brink of Woodstock in a Catskills holiday camp, is as seductive as the handsome, itinerant hippie who turns its heroine's life upside down. Thoughtfully conceived and movingly acted, it sweeps a housewife and mother named Pearl Kantrowitz (Ms. Lane) in a torrid extramarital romance and then weighs the consequences. With a tenderness that's unusual for a contemporary American film, it tells an enveloping tale enhanced by artfully selected Woodstock-era music. Mr. Mortensen may strain credulity as the foxiest blouse salesman in the Catskills, but he certainly does wonders for the movie (Maslin).
 
Film Series
 
"JEANETTE MacDONALD: HOLLYWOOD DIVA." Opposite Nelson Eddy, she was one of America's sweethearts. In the films of Ernst Lubitsch, she was a sexy charmer. Her name was Jeanette MacDonald, whose lyric soprano and high spirits made her a Hollywood star who bridged high art and pop culture in her heyday in the 1930's. Currently she is the focus of a series presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center at the Walter Reade Theater. At 6:45 P.M. today, directed by Robert Z. Leonard in "The Firefly" (1931), a rarely seen adaptation of the Rudolf Friml operetta, she shows off her talents as a dancer and a singer. This screening will be introduced by Edward Baron Turk, the author of a new biography that bears the same title as the series. Other films this weekend include W. S. Van Dyke's "San Francisco" (1936) and "Sweethearts" (1938), Lubitsch's "One Hour With You" (1932), Leonard's "Maytime" (1937) and Frank Borzage's "Smilin' Through" (1941). The series continues through Tuesday at the Walter Reade, at Lincoln Center. Admission: $8.50; $5 for Film Society of Lincoln Center members; $4.50 for the elderly at weekday matinees. Information and screening schedule: (212) 875-5600 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, April 1

 BODY:

Now Nixon The Comedy
Few episodes of American postwar history have been treated with more solemnity than Watergate, particularly in Hollywood. Americans have pondered, shuddered, railed at and perhaps even wept over the break-in that brought down a Presidency and influenced a generation. So now, in the era of Monicagate, maybe it is time to laugh.
That, anyway, is the intention behind "Dick," a comedy that might be dubbed Watergate Lite. Imagine a movie with Oliver Stone's paranoid vision and the sensibility of "Clueless," and you have "Dick," which is scheduled for release on July 9. 
 The movie follows the antics of two teen-agers, Betsy Jobs (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene Lorenzo (Michelle Williams), who visit the White House of Richard (Dick) Nixon (played by Dan Hedaya, who was in "Clueless"). The two wander into a room filled with Presidential secrets, which prompts a frightened Nixon to hire them as dog walkers so he can keep an eye on them.
The two fumble their way through the Watergate mess as unwitting but crucial players while the audience learns what really happened to those 18 minutes of erased tape, the identity of Deep Throat and what supposedly made President Nixon so paranoid. The baby-boom generation was torn by those questions; Generation X is now going to have a good chuckle over them.
The movie was produced by Gale Ann Hurd (left), who has produced 22 movies and is well known not for frothy comedies but for high-adrenaline pictures like "Armageddon," "The Terminator," "Aliens" and "The Abyss." Ms. Hurd, 43, said she was proud of her ability to raft white-water rivers and take on the toughest mountains on her bike.
She acknowledged that "Dick" was something of a switch and said it grew less out of her political interests ("When I got to college I decided I was going to be a Marxist," she said. "My first B was in Marxist economics, so I decided to become a righteous capitalist.") than a sense that it might just be time to laugh at Watergate.
"Nothing really dark and twisted happens in this film," Ms. Hurd said. "I think, given where we are, it's the best possible time to laugh at this. It's cathartic."
She added, "After doing a lot of special-effects-driven movies, it's really nice to think about character for a change."
Ms. Hurd said that "Dick" was aimed partly at a teen-age audience, given that the engines of Nixon's misfortune are two teen-agers, although teen-agers looked at Watergate almost as ancient history.
"They didn't necessarily get the more obscure Watergate references, like Gordon Liddy, but they loved the movie in our test screenings," she said. "It was nice to do this without that cynical 90's patina."
 
Life in Fast Forward
Making movies that connect with teen-agers has always required a somewhat irreverent approach. Such films often drip with sarcasm, and their characters tend to joust with authority. But for the current generation, the introduction of new entertainment technologies like computer games has in some instances even changed how stories are told.
In "Go," for example, a new comedy by Doug Liman scheduled to be released on April 9, the plot repeatedly stops and rewinds, each time with a new character in the lead, suggesting the branching structure of an adventure computer game.
There won't be any computer mice by the theater seats. But icons will be onscreen in the form of the stop-motion faces of the actors, on which the director clicks before unspooling their delirious and often amusing tales.
"The structural part of it fits the mind of young people today," said Mr. Liman (above), 32, whose first movie, "Swingers," introduced audiences to a retro-hip milieu. "This audience doesn't like receiving information in the traditional ways."
The movie follows the nocturnal antics of a group of 20-somethings as they party, botch drug deals, duel with the police and, in one memorable sequence, go wild in Las Vegas. It takes place in the span of a night and a day, and ends with the frayed threads coming together in a spirit of manic energy and a near-total lack of restraint. The ensemble cast includes Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Desmond Askew, Timothy Olyphant, Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf.
"These characters do unlikable things, but you love them for it," Mr. Liman said.
The director said he had resisted the unusual narrative structure when he started to read the script, which was written by John August.
"I don't like gimmicky things," Mr. Liman said. "I was like, 'Oh, I was really liking this script until he started jumping around with the narrative. Oh, well.' But I read more, and he got me over the bump. By the third story line, he had earned my confidence."
He added: "I don't read a magazine from front to back. I read three books at once and might be watching TV and changing the channels. That's the way we experience things."
Key to the characters' misadventures is that in the end, they survive despite their self-destructive tendencies. Mr. Liman, who recently earned his pilot's license, compared that to a new four-seat airplane he had just bought, part of a new aircraft generation that has a parachute built into the fuselage as an extra safety feature.
"When you're 18 it's like you've got that parachute," Mr. Liman said. "You've got that 'get out of jail free' card. That's what the characters in the movie have. The name 'Go' refers to that. They react rather than think."
 
Thinking Small
This year's Oscar derby was more contentious than usual, full of more blatant publicity gimmicks but less interesting to the public, with the show's Nielsen ratings down sharply. If there was a lesson, it was that smaller production houses, the so-called independents, are getting better at developing the more engaging and successful movies, at least in terms of peer recognition if not the box office.
Though Miramax stole the show by winning the prizes for best movie, best foreign-language film and much more, the "other" independent, Lions Gate, also did well. This relatively small operation drew five nominations and prizes for two films that it distributed last year, "Affliction" and "Gods and Monsters."
This year Lions Gate is aiming for more of the same. While the major studios are cranking out their big-budget special-effects thrill rides for the summer, most notably the latest "Star Wars" movie, Lions Gate and other independents are counter-programming, looking for fare that is more intimate, unusual and, though few want to admit it, appealing to the people who vote on the prizes.
"If I never hear the word Oscar again, it will be too soon," said Mark Urman (above), the co-president of Lions Gate Releasing, the distribution arm of the company. "Everything we've ever released is a sort of antidote to Hollywood. That's what we try to think about. We're doing that again this year."
Lions Gate is releasing "Metroland," a bittersweet romantic adventure in which two old friends from London (played by Lee Ross and Christian Bale) escape their homes during the 1960's, only to return years later and confront their middle-class origins and dashed hopes. Emily Watson of "Hilary and Jackie" plays a prominent part.
There will also be a sex farce, "Friends and Lovers," and what Mr. Urman described as a classic French romantic farce, "The Dinner Game," a throwback to the freewheeling French comedies of the 1960's.
The company's biggest hope for the year is "The Red Violin," a costume drama with a relatively big budget, if $15 million can be considered big when Hollywood studios spend on average nearly $50 million a movie.
The movie has an international ensemble cast, including Samuel L. Jackson, Carlo Cecchi, Greta Scacchi and Sylvia Chang. It is directed by Francois Girard and has a score by John Corigliano.
"The Red Violin" follows a famous violin over 300 years and the events that unfold around it. From Lions Gate's perspective, it presents a counterpoint to the big studio movies, which tend to be heavy on action.
"Sometimes," Mr. Urman said, "the more different you are, the better off you are."

HEADLINE: Flurry of Economic Reports Suggests Growth Is Not at Risk

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
Manufacturing strengthened in March as consumer spending on automobiles, computers and furniture remained strong and export orders grew for a second month.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index rose to 54.3 last month from 52.4 in February. The third straight monthly increase lifted the index to its highest level since November 1997. Readings of 50 or more suggest manufacturing is expanding. 
 Other reports today showed that first-time jobless claims fell last week and that consumer income and spending rose in February. That helped send auto sales, for example, to an annual rate of 17 million, a record for that month. Construction spending also soared in February, another sign the economy's expansion, now in its ninth year, is on track for more growth.
The association's index measuring export orders stayed above 50 for the second straight month, suggesting that orders from overseas increased after 14 months of contraction.
The group's March price index, considered an indicator of inflation trends, rose to 43.2 from 35.9 in February. It was the largest monthly increase in the index since May 1996, though the index stayed below 50, which means more manufacturers surveyed said prices for materials fell than said they rose.
The rise in the price index is almost certainly tied to higher prices for oil, gasoline and other energy products, said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Bank of America Private Bank in Jacksonville, Fla.
That is "a warning flag that the low point of inflation has passed and commodity prices aren't likely to continue to hold down the rate of inflation," she said. Even so, "the ability of companies to pass on price increases is still limited," she said.
The price gauge is only a rough measure of the direction of prices, the association said. Respondents are asked only to indicate the overall change in the prices they paid in the survey month: up, down or unchanged.
All components of the survey showed demand increased in March. Manufacturers said orders for goods rose, with the new-orders index rising to 58.2 in March from 57.2. The production index rose to 59.6 from 56.9, and the employment index rose to 48 from 45.
The index measuring export orders was the only component to post a decline, falling to 51.7 from 54 in February. That just suggests slower growth in exports, though, because the index stayed above 50 for a second month. Before February, the last time the export index registered above 50 was November 1997.
The strength of domestic demand was reflected in a separate Commerce Department report showing that Americans' personal incomes rose five-tenths of a percent in February after increasing six-tenths of a percent in January. Personal spending rose seven-tenths of a percent in February -- the biggest gain in two months -- after increasing four-tenths of a percent a month earlier.
Spending on big-ticket durable goods like automobiles rose 2.9 percent in February after declining 2.6 percent in January.
The Labor Department reported first-time applications for state unemployment benefits fell by 6,000 last week, to 289,000. It was the ninth week in a row that claims stayed below 300,000, the longest stretch since an 18-month run ended in December 1973.
Meantime, construction spending is on the rise, driven mainly by a big jump in government spending on highway and street construction after three consecutive years of record housing growth.
Construction spending rose 2.2 percent in February, to a $706.5 billion annual rate, after rising 1.7 percent in January. February's rise marked the fourth consecutive monthly increase and the largest since a 2.4 rise in June. Government spending on roads, hospitals and schools increased 4.7 percent.

Optimism Over the Internet's Growth Leads Shares Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as Yahoo's acquisition of Broadcast.com raised expectations for consolidation in the on-line industry and lifted prices for SBC Communications and other telephone companies on optimism that the Internet's growth will increase demand for data transmission.
"People say the Internet is one of the best inventions since the Industrial Revolution," said Robert Bloom, the chief executive at Friends Ivory & Sime, which manages $4 billion. "As long as the I.P.O.'s with the dot-coms after their names keep going up, this thing will continue." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 46.35, or 0.5 percent, yesterday, closing at 9,832.51 after being little changed for much of the day. The rise late in the session came from computer-guided buy programs, said Birinyi Associates, a research firm in Greenwich, Conn.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 7.35, to 1,293.72, and the Nasdaq Composite index, which is packed with Internet stocks, climbed 31.97, or 1.3 percent, to 2,493.37. Advancers and decliners were about evenly matched on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Dow, after closing above the 10,000 milestone for the first time Monday, added just 9.99 points for the week. Stock markets are closed today in observance of Good Friday. The Nasdaq Composite index rose 3.1 percent, its biggest weekly gain since the end of January. The S.& P. 500 gained 0.9 percent.
Volume yesterday was lighter than usual, with some investors out for Passover. Some 705.7 million shares changed hands on the Big Board.
"A lot of people are pulling back from the marketplace, because they're worried about Kosovo," said Ken Ducey, the chief trader at BT Brokerage, a unit of Bankers Trust. "We have a three-day weekend coming up, and anything could happen over there."
Yahoo and Broadcast.com rose after Yahoo agreed to buy Broadcast.com for $5.7 billion, fueling speculation of more Internet combinations. Broadcast.com rose 11 13/16 , to 130, and Yahoo advanced 11 3/8, to 179 3/4.
Following their lead, Intervu, which helps corporate Web sites transmit video and audio events, soared 15 1/8, to 59 1/2. Realnetworks, which makes software that lets users send and receive sound and video over the Internet, rose 35 11/16 , to 157 7/8.
"There are going to be plenty more Internet tie-ups," said Benoit Flamant, who manages $330 million as chief executive of IT Asset Management in Paris. "The priority for Yahoo and others is not profits but to grab subscribers and market share."
America Online rose 3, to 150, and was the most active stock in United States trading. Since joining the S.& P. 500 just three months ago, America Online has become the 12th-most-valuable stock in the index. It is still the index's only Internet company.
Telephone stocks gained, leading the S.& P. 500's advancers, after Blake Bath, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said strong growth in the data business would compensate for competitive pricing and regulatory uncertainty. He raised his rating on SBC to buy from neutral.
SBC rose 2 9/16 , to 49 3/4; Ameritech rose 2 5/8, to 60 1/4, and BellSouth rose 1 3/16 . to 41 1/4.
American Express rose 3 1/4, to 121, contributing most to the Dow's advance, after Athina Meehan, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst, said earnings at the world's biggest charge card issuer would rise as it issued more cards overseas.

Treasuries Are Lower
 The prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday after several economic reports heightened concern that inflation could become a problem.
The 30-year bond fell 2 2/32 , to 93 31/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.67 percent, from 5.62 percent on Wednesday.
The drop was largely the result of the report by the National Association of Purchasing Management, whose index of manufacturing activity climbed in March. Its index of prices, a gauge of inflationary pressures, also rose.
Additionally, the Commerce Department reported that Americans' personal incomes and personal spending rose in February, and the Labor Department said first-time applications for state unemployment benefits fell last week.
Because the observance of Passover and Holy Week is this week, yesterday's session was shortened. The bond market will close at noon today, and some commodities markets will hold abbreviated sessions this morning as well.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Exporting Kosovo

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Buoyed by their role in helping turn a Balkan civil war into shivering, desolate, crowds of refugees, a political booby trap for America unmatched since Vietnam, a perversion of NATO purpose and a planning debacle, the 15 nations of the European Union are now trying to export their collective political wisdom to shape the Mideast, which may God in Heaven forfend.
 Of course, the European Union did have great assistance in the Kosovo tragedy -- the abominable thug who is Serbia's dictator, and a Kosovo Liberation Army with a yearning itself for ethnic expulsions, of Serbs. 
 Particularly important has been President Clinton. He was elected nude of experience in or feeling for foreign and military matters. But in six years in office he has reached new heights of ineptitude, exhibiting the attachment to truth and candor that became his trademark at home.
Still the E.U. came up with ideas guaranteed to bear fruit -- of tragedy. Europe's mind-set about the Mideast is pretty much the same that brought the fall into the pit of Balkan war. They are telling Israel that all of Jerusalem, not merely what Palestinians claim as their capital for the while, is a corpus separatum, separate international entity, not an inch of it legally under Israeli control. They are telling Israelis and Palestinians that nobody has the right to try to stop the establishment of a Palestinian state.
 Palestinian independence and Jerusalem are supposed to be decided during the final series of Israel-Palestinian talks. So there is not much reason to go ahead with it, is there? Just let the two sides fight it out to the death, while the European Union thinks up more great ideas.
 Don't be surprised at these proposals -- the European nations are simply selecting a time that could do most damage to disinter their old vicious gambit that the U.N. partition resolution of 1947 still stands.
 The Jews agreed to partition and an internationalized Jerusalem in desperate pursuit of acceptance of their homeland by the Arabs. The Arabs rejected the resolution and fell on the Jews then and throughout the next half a century. Israel declared the resolution nullified.
 Why do the Europeans commit this act of public grave-robbing now? One -- Europe's mercantile policy toward the Arabs: oil and weapons contracts in feudal Arab countries are put far above profits to be made with high-tech Israel. Centuries of warfare among European tribes have dulled their brains. Two -- they don't, well, care for Israel very much.
 In Israel, Likud and Labor told Germany, current president of the E.U., to stuff these proposals. But Palestinians are already using them as a pressure point against Israel. If they go on too long, they will kill negotiations permanently and invite war. Kosovo will seem a merry little place.
 The Europeans have no "plan" for Mideast agreement. Neither do they, NATO or Washington have one in Kosovo.
 Bernard Trainor, retired Marine lieutenant general, put it best on MSNBC: all they have in Kosovo is a script. So, when the Serbs did not follow the script by surrendering and instead drove more Albanians out of Kosovo, NATO spokesmen looked all sad and hurt.
 Where were the supplies for the refugees that should have been stockpiled? Coming; show check in mail.
 The script treats Serbs as inferiors who would docilely give up under bombing -- which neither they, nor the British nor the Russians did in World War II.
 Will the world be upset about Germans bombing children and grandchildren of the million Serbs the Nazis killed? Drop bombs, cut upset shot.
If Serbs lose Kosovo they will return to combat soon. They may prefer to fight on somebody else's land for a change -- like neighboring Hungary. Now it is a NATO member entitled to full NATO protection -- "full" meaning including nuclear.
 What to show? Nothing; cut from script. What about from our minds? Shut up. Bill Clinton, not golfing today, says carry on.
 Write new scene. Bring in troops, persuade some refugees to return, guard them. But for how long, chief?
 Could we show us helping others attain some liberty -- Iraqis, Kurds, Tibetans, Sudanese? And please, please, could we show a policy? Then we could have an honest plan. But what does a policy look like? I forget.
 Shut up and get on the team.

HEADLINE: Fed Panel Considered Reversal Of Earlier Rate Cut in February

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers in February considered -- but rejected -- taking back at least one of the quarter-point interest-rate cuts they made last fall, according to the minutes of their meeting, which were released today.
In three steps from late September to mid-November, the Fed reduced the benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks to 4.75 percent from 5.5 percent to protect the United States economy from market turmoil after the collapse of the Russian ruble. 
 In a meeting on Feb. 3, members of the Federal Open Market Committee noted that "the market unsettlement that had in large measure prompted the committee's easing actions during the fall had now lessened appreciably."
"In the view of some," the minutes continued, "those actions might need to be reversed, at least in part." The minutes, however, showed the panel voted unanimously against changing the Federal funds rate.
On Tuesday, the committee again decided to leave the rate unchanged. Minutes of that meeting will be released in May.
At the February session, one member -- the minutes did not say who -- argued for a policy directive declaring that higher rates were more probable than lower rates in the future. But, in the end, all members accepted a directive giving equal weight to the possibility of cutting or raising rates.
In the discussion of the economy, the minutes said that the panel had found "few signs that the economic expansion had moderated to a more sustainable rate, but most continued to anticipate substantial slowing."
Among the reasons were "the waning effects of the earlier increases in stock market wealth on consumer spending and some slowing in the extraordinary growth in business expenditures for equipment."
The panel also agreed that it favored extending the legal requirement that it report to Congress twice yearly. That requirement is scheduled to lapse the end of this year.
The minutes said the Congressional reports "had given the committee an effective means to explain its policies and communicate its views on a variety of issues and had enhanced its accountability to the public and the Congress."

HEADLINE: DaimlerChrysler Vehicle Sales Rose by 16.5% During March

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 1

 BODY:
DaimlerChrysler A.G. reported sales of 16.5 percent more Chryslers, Dodges, Plymouths and Jeeps in the United States last month than a year ago, setting first-quarter and March sales records, as demand for new vehicles continued to show an increase.
Nearly every auto maker that reported March results today also had double-digit increases. 
 The Toyota Motor Corporation said its sales increased 10.5 percent over March 1998, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation continued its rebound with a 63 percent improvement, and Volkswagen A.G. gained 52 percent for its best March in 18 years.
The Honda Motor Company's sales were up only half a percent but enough to break its March record. Even the ailing Nissan Motor Company managed a 4 percent gain, in part because of a big improvement in sales of its Quest minivan that was redesigned for 1999.
Among the 12 major auto makers that have reported so far, total sales were up 15 percent over the first three months of 1998. Executives said the quarter's torrid sales pace was unexpected.
"The economy has defied predictions of a slowdown through the first quarter, and there is clear evidence that strong industry sales are on track to continue well into the summer," said Yale Gieszl, a vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA.
Analysts were surprised, too.
"It's amazing, isn't it?" said Nick Colas of Credit Suisse First Boston.
Mr. Colas suggested that one contributing factor was the increase in electronic filing of income tax returns, which has resulted in earlier tax refunds. But the major factor remains the sound economy.
"Everything we knew about the economy last year is still true," he said. "Unemployment remains quite low, confidence is high, interest rates are benign.
"This magic potion that worked for the past couple of years is still working." But he does not expect it to continue.
"We'll see some slowing -- not enough to call it a recession or to have a big effect on earnings," Mr. Colas said.
Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president of United States sales and marketing, was more optimistic: "Our economists say they think that unless something happens that nobody's predicting, they don't see much change."
DaimlerChrysler's sales were led by a 20 percent gain in light trucks. Car sales rose 9 percent.
The company's American brands broke their March record set in 1994 and a first-quarter record set in 1996.
Honda had a 7 percent drop in car sales, but that was offset by strong demand for its redesigned Odyssey minivan and its CR-V sport utility vehicle; combined minivan and sport utility sales were up 55 percent.
Mitsubishi benefited from robust demand for its sedans and the Montero Sport sport utility; the Japanese auto maker doubled sales of its redesigned Galant family sedan.
Among smaller auto makers, Land Rover was up 76 percent; Subaru posted a 19.5 percent gain; Audi rose 28 percent; Saab A.B. enjoyed a 9.5 percent improvement; Volvo was up 8 percent, and Isuzu Motors Ltd. edged up 4 percent.
The comparisons are based on the daily sales rate; there was one more sales day last month than in March 1998.
The Ford Motor Company plans to release its March sales figures Tuesday, followed by the General Motors Corporation's on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE EUROPEANS;
Already Burdened, Western Europe Is Reluctant to Take in Kosovo's Outcasts

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, April 1

 BODY:
The huge numbers of ethnic Albanians fleeing Kosovo are raising acute concerns in west European countries about the potential arrival of tens of thousands of refugees in societies already strained by high unemployment, sluggish economic growth and simmering resentment of foreigners.
Fearing a politically explosive influx, Germany said today that Kosovo's Albanian outcasts should remain in the Balkans and stay outside "western or northern Europe." 
 Germany, where over 4 million people, or more than 10 percent of the work force, is jobless, and where 350,000 refugees poured in from Bosnia during the 1992-95 war, is particularly concerned. But France and Italy face similar problems and appear equally determined to insure the refugees do not move west.
Over time, aid officials said, the issue could drive a wedge between the United States and its European NATO partners because it illustrates how broadly destabilizing the conflict is on the European continent while America has a large buffer, the Atlantic Ocean.
"We believe the refugees should remain as close to Kosovo as possible," the German Deputy Foreign Minister, Gunter Verheugen, said during a brief visit to the Macedonian capital, Skopje. "Our assumption is that we will soon achieve our political goal and the refugees will be able to return to Kosovo."
It was not clear, given the state of the conflict, what led Mr. Verheugen to that assumption. He added that "acceptance of the refugees into western or northern Europe" would send "a completely false signal."
The implications of a policy of zero acceptance of refugees appeared fraught with danger for the Balkans. For it will mean that fragile states, with scant resources and, in the case of Macedonia, a tenuous balance of ethnic groups, are to be subjected to enormous new social pressures if the refugees are unable to return soon.
Yet accepting refugees also involves political risk. Austria, a country of just over 8 million people that took in 70,000 refugees during the Bosnian war, has said it will accept refugees from Kosovo. But today the party of the Austrian far right-winger Jorg Haider, who has consistently campaigned against foreigners and immigrants, said Austria had neither the space nor the ability to cope with the influx. He recently did outstandingly well in provincial elections, and tensions over Kosovo refugees could further strengthen his party, already Europe's strongest far right movement, in national elections in October.
With the number of Kosovo Albanian refugees totaling almost 190,000 over the past week alone, the scale of reported "ethnic cleansing" in recent days appears comparable only to the first months of the Bosnian war.
In the spring and summer of 1992, over 750,000 Bosnian Muslims were hounded from their homes by the Serbs, using methods of terror that appear now to have been revived. In just a few days in August 1995, over 150,000 Serbs poured out of Croatia, fleeing a lightning Croatian attack to take back land seized by the Serbs during the Croatian war of 1991.
Mr. Verheugen's statement came as Joschka Fischer, the German Foreign Minister, today chaired a hastily convened conference in Bonn on the plight of the refugees.
After talks with other European ministers and with Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Fischer suggested that Western policy should consist of sending money and food to the Balkans to sustain the refugees there, rather than opening western Europe's doors to them.
Germany today pledged $13.8 million to help the refugees and flew 45 tons of goods and medicine to Albania and Skopje. Spain and France dispatched a total of 50 tons of food.
Keeping the refugees close to Kosovo also helps to underpin statements by ministers in NATO governments that the ethnic Albanians will -- unlike many of the refugees who fled Bosnia -- eventually go home.
The policy outlined at today's conference was consistent with that of the center-left Government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, which has tried, under fierce attack from the right, to make German citizenship available to more of the seven million foreigners living here, but has been intransigent in saying that there is no room for new arrivals.
In general, with their social insurance budgets strained by aging populations and a large number of unemployed, western European societies have become progressively more closed to accepting refugees. Although still marginal, rightist movements in France and Germany have grown by exploiting anti-immigrant sentiment.
The huge influx of Bosnian refugees cost Germany over $11 billion and fed resentments rooted in an unemployment level that exceeds 20 percent in many parts of the former East Germany. Since the Bosnian war ended, all but 80,000 of the refugees have been sent back -- some of them forcibly -- but the tensions have not abated.
The German Government has had solid support for its participation in the bombing of Yugoslavia, 54 years after the collapse of the Third Reich. But it apparently was not prepared for the possible social consequences.
Other NATO governments could also come under severe strain because of the refugee problem. Greece borders both Albania and Macedonia, which have received the bulk of the massive influx of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo; Italy is just across the Adriatic from Albania and Montenegro, the Yugoslav republic that is also receiving Kosovo refugees. Albania's near-collapse in the past decade already has sent tens if not hundreds of thousands of its citizens flooding into Italy and Greece.
The German Government's current stance of refusing more refugees appeared certain to anger the more left-leaning fringe of the governing Green Party, known as the "fundamentalist" wing. Already restive over a sustained bombing campaign that runs diametrically counter to the party's pacifist roots, these members of the Green Party back an open-door policy to political refugees.
Hans-Christian Strobele, a Green member of the Bundestag, has already collected 500 signatures from party members demanding an end to the bombardment. Some evidence of the strength of this movement should become apparent during the so-called Easter Marches this weekend that traditionally rally German pacifists.
Whatever the outcome of the marches, it is clear that the Greens are undergoing strains that could undermine the governing coalition, especially if NATO's bombing continues for weeks, as some alliance commanders have suggested.
Several leading German newspapers have also attacked the Kosovo refugee policy. "The Germans' decision to deport Bosnian refugees back to their homeland was made with the explanation that resources were needed in case of a new catastrophe," the Suddeutsche Zeitung commented today. "That catastrophe is here."

HEADLINE: Canada's Eskimos Get a Land of Their Own

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: IQALUIT, Nunavut, April 1

 BODY:
A bold attempt to right past wrongs and bring hope to an entire region was launched as this day began and the map of Canada was redrawn to make room for the new territory of Nunavut.
At midnight, with the wind chill here hovering around 45 below zero, and a rare blue moon encircled by a halo of light, Ottawa divided the old Northwest Territories in two and Nunavut, which means "our land," was created from the eastern 60 percent of the region, with this remote city of 4,500 residents becoming the capital of the new territory. 
 "What we affirm today, with the stroke of a pen, is the end of a very long road," said Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who came to Iqaluit this morning from Newfoundland, which is celebrating its own admission to Canada 50 years ago -- the last major change in the country's map before today.
While Mr. Chretien called Nunavut a "rare and precious opportunity," other Canadians criticized it as a waste of money and, worse, a dangerous precedent for fostering racial tribalism.
"One-fifth of Canada will be put under a government whose purpose it is to represent one ethnic group," The Ottawa Citizen said in a recent editorial. "Canada will have its first Bantustan, an apartheid-style ethnic homeland."
The creation of Nunavut (NOO-na-voot) caps a notable transformation not only for northern Canada's residents but for all Eskimos in polar regions around the globe. With Nunavut firmly in the hands of Eskimos, a people also called Inuit, roughly two-thirds of the estimated 150,000 Eskimos on earth, including about 7,000 in Alaska, have won some degree of self-determination.
"It is now like a chain stretching from Greenland to the Russian Far East," said Oran R. Young, director of the Dickey Institute of Arctic Studies at Dartmouth College, "and Nunavut is a huge link in this chain."
What is even more remarkable about Nunavut is that by conventional measures of political influence, like the votes they control or the funds they have access to, the new territory's 27,000 residents -- 85 percent of them Eskimos -- would have been considered almost powerless.
Yet, over a generation, using a mixture of patience and compromise that reflected traditional Eskimo ways, they have made notable strides that are being watched by indigenous groups around the world. And what they accomplished they did without the court battles, angry protests or sporadic violence that has marked movements for Indian rights throughout North America.
But that is not to suggest the process of creating Nunavut was easy or painless. The first Eskimo call for a new territory came in 1976, and the law providing for Nunavut was not enacted until 1993. That law also settled the largest native land claim in Canada's history, giving the Eskimos, who had never signed a treaty with the Canadian Government, title to 135,000 square miles of their traditional territory, with mineral rights in about one-tenth of that space.
As part of the deal, the Eskimos surrendered claim to all other land in the north and accepted a financial settlement that will exceed $1 billion over 14 years.
Nunavut encompasses 770,000 square miles of ice and snow that becomes a riot of mud and color in the brief spring and summer. Roughly equal in size to the land mass of Mexico, its southern boundary roughly follows the tree line above the province of Manitoba. It stretches north to the very top of the world. On the east it is bounded by Quebec's Ungava Peninsula. Nunavut's uneven western boundary was drawn to exclude the city of Yellowknife and the newly opened diamond mine near Lac de Gras.
Technically, Nunavut is a territory like Yukon and the Northwest Territories, which have smaller populations and fewer taxing powers than Canada's provinces. Nunavut's non-partisan Government is open to every resident, Eskimo or not. But demographics make this an Eskimo territory now and will see that it stays that way for some time.
In the first local Parliament, sworn in today at the local high school, 15 of the 19 legislators are Eskimo. And although some critics worry that Nunavut will exclude non-Eskimo, the first premier of Nunavut, Paul Okalik, is a 34-year-old Eskimo lawyer, made clear today that that would not happen.
"We have established a public government that will represent all the people of Nunavut equally and democratically," Mr. Okalik said during a ceremony introducing Nunavut's new flag.
Other critics question the need for one more layer of government. "The federal Government has committed $1 billion to Nunavut," said Mike Scott, an opposition member of the federal Parliament who is the Indian affairs critic for the Reform Party. "That is a staggering price-tag for some questionable gains."
The rump state that remains in the West will continue to be called the Northwest Territories. Its population is more racially mixed than Nunavut's. After division, 52 percent of its 40,000 residents are non-indigenous, 10 percent Eskimo and the rest from various Indian nations.
Nunavut's challenges are enormous. It starts out with some of Canada's highest rates of unemployment, alcohol and substance abuse, and suicide. More than 90 percent of its annual budget comes from the federal Government.
There are few industries and even fewer roads. At least at the beginning, Mr. Okalik, the new premier, believes the Government itself will be the engine of economic growth, the contemporary equivalent of the trans-continental railroad that brought opportunity to the West a century ago.
For the 56 percent of Nunavut's people who are under 25 years old, Nunavut represents a new world. "Inuit power!" said Darcy Kablalik, 23, who came to attend the ceremonies from Rankin Inlet. "We've been waiting for this for a long time."

CBS to Buy King World For $2.5 Billion in Stock
As expected, CBS announced that it had agreed to buy King World Productions, the syndicator of television hits like "The Oprah Winfrey Show," "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy," for $2.5 billion in stock. 
 CBS has long been looking to extend its control over programming for its owned-and-operated stations. And King World not only has $800 million in cash on its balance sheet, but it also requires little capital expenditure and carries no debt, so it will contribute immediately to the bottom line of CBS.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Manhattan Apartments Drawing New Wave of Foreign Buyers

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
As Manhattan's robust housing market continues to attract a steady number of foreign buyers, the main change is where those buyers are from.
While there are no exact figures, real estate professionals said Asian buyers, particularly the Japanese, hard hit by Asia's economic turmoil, have moved to the sidelines in the last year, replaced by buyers from the Middle East, Europe and South America. 
 Ellen Bitton, president of Park Avenue Mortgage Group of Manhattan, said international buyers might be motivated to purchase in Manhattan because of either the strength or the weakness of the economies in their countries, or, in the case of Israeli buyers, by a change in law last May allowing them to invest in real estate abroad. Qualified foreign buyers also want to tap today's low mortgage interest rates, she said, noting that her firm closed 24 mortgages to international buyers in the last six months, compared with 12 over the same period in 1997-98.
Seth Cohen, managing director of the Home Mortgage Acceptance Corporation in Manhattan, said his company closed 207 loans to international buyers in 1998, up 14 percent from 1997. "Manhattan real estate is a safe haven that allows them to diversify their investments into U.S.-dollar-based assets, protect their money from economic and political uncertainty at home and generate a nice return," he said.
Such buyers want the flexibility of condos over the restrictiveness of co-ops, which, among other things, require buyers to face the scrutiny of a board of directors, including demands for personal financial records. "Co-ops want the net worth of their purchasers to be in New York, which international buyers don't have," said Diane M. Ramirez, executive director of sales at the Halstead Property Company, a Manhattan brokerage.
Condominiums can be sold relatively simply and generally are easier to rent than co-ops, which is "an option foreign purchasers always want," she said.
Most foreign buyers, brokers agree, purchase apartments first as an investment and then as a second home. An increasing number of workers, transferred by international companies to Manhattan for three to five years, are also buying "with the hope their investment will have an upside," said Paul F. Purcell, executive vice president at Douglas Elliman, another Manhattan brokerage. He said international sales represented 12 percent of his company's total sales dollars last year, up from 5 percent in 1997.
The Real Estate Board of New York reported that 1,232 condos in prewar buildings were sold last year at a median price per square foot of $357, up from 883 units sold at $312 in 1997. At the same time, 4,123 condos in postwar buildings were sold at a median price per square foot of $369, compared with 2,213 units sold at $327 in 1997.
"The higher prices reinforce the confidence foreign buyers have in Manhattan real estate," said Marc J. Isaacs, a Manhattan real estate lawyer who works with international buyers. "They also know there will be a guaranteed return in the form of rent."
While the Japanese have slowed their buying, they have been selling. "Though some have been selling at a loss, they are taking out the equity from their Manhattan apartments to send or invest their money back home," said Mika Sakamoto, president of the American Real Estate Group, who works with foreign buyers.
Japanese owners are refinancing their mortgages for similar reasons. "The weak yen, coupled with several years of appreciation of New York real estate, means they can refinance their apartments and realize a substantial profit," Mr. Cohen said.
Ms. Sakamoto said people from southern Asia, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, are also selling. The difference is that many are "reinvesting their profits back into Manhattan real estate," she said, adding that others continued to buy.
May Ng, a shipping entrepreneur from Singapore, recently bought a two-bedroom condo for $1.6 million at 610 Park Avenue. She made the deal sight unseen as an investment, said Mr. Isaacs, Ms. Ng's lawyer, noting that she expects to rent the unit for $9,000 to $10,000 a month, "which will more than cover her monthly cost and generate a profit."
Brokers agree that Israelis make up the fastest-growing group of foreign buyers as they take advantage of the change in Israeli law last May that lifted restrictions on ownership of real estate outside of Israel. "We're seeing more individuals buying, compared with mostly large Israeli companies, which was the case before the change in law," said Shlomi Reuveni, sales associate at the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan brokerage.
The law change is one reason that Dahlia Gal-Ghelber, an Israeli journalist, said she was buying a one-bedroom condo in the $300,000 range at Trump Place on Riverside Boulevard, between 68th and 70th Streets, where she had been renting a studio. "The monthly cost of owning the unit will be about the same as the $1,600 I was paying in rent," said Ms. Gal-Ghelber, who will use the apartment while in Manhattan. "The apartment also will appreciate in value, and the rental income will provide a higher return than a similar investment in Israel."
Brazilians, the most active buyers from South America, followed by Argentines, have tempered their activity in the last two months due to the devaluation of their nation's currency. Mr. Cohen said he expected the slowdown to be temporary. Meanwhile, he added, Brazilians who work in Manhattan for international companies are buying apartments to live in with the view that they can rent or sell them if they are transferred back to Brazil.
Daniela Cafe, who works in the Manhattan office of a Brazilian bank, is buying a two-bedroom condo at 45 West 67th Street with her husband. She declined to disclose the price, but similar apartments in the area sell for around $700,000.
Ms. Cafe said that although homes were less expensive in Brazil, it was difficult to get a mortgage in her own country, where interest rates are as high as 44 percent. "We want to live in our own apartment and see it as a good investment," she said, "because there's a lot of liquidity in the Manhattan market."

HEADLINE: Illegal Immigrant Workers Being Fired in I.N.S. Tactic

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: YAKIMA, Wash.

 BODY:
When Federal immigration agents came to the fruit-packing warehouses here in central Washington, there were no sudden raids, no emergency deportation hearings, no buses waiting to take hundreds of illegal immigrant workers back to the Mexican border, more than a thousand miles away.
When the investigators left, though, there was chaos in the Yakima Valley. More than 560 people were dismissed, under orders from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, because they possessed forged or otherwise improper work documents. 
 The dismissals, which began in February, are part of a stepped-up enforcement strategy against illegal immigration that expands on what the agency calls its "interior enforcement program."
As it has done in some places on a much smaller scale, the agency is auditing workers' documentation in industries across the country, from the farmlands and fruit-packing plants here in the Northwest to beef-packing plants in the Midwest to hotels of South Florida. Less expensive and less cumbersome than deportation of illegal immigrants found in the workplace, the auditing approach is an effort to cut them off from the goal that brought them to this country: work.
"We are trying to send a message," said Doris M. Meissner, the immigration commissioner. "The intent is to really change the dynamics, change the climate, and change the decision-making process of these migrants."
But with 5.5 million people living illegally in the country, it may take a long time to send that message. And even the immigration agency concedes that the policy is creating wrenching dilemmas for the immigrants, many of whom have quietly held their jobs for years, settled in homes and have children who were born in the United States and thus are American citizens. In many cases, the children have never even been to Mexico, from which most of the workers come.
"This is a nightmare for so many of us," said Mireya Chavez, who was recently dismissed after working for nine years in the Yakima Valley, cutting asparagus, picking apples and packing in the warehouses -- all the time as an illegal resident -- though her two sons, 7 and 5 years old, are American citizens.
"I'm not looking for help from anyone," Ms. Chavez said. "I just want a job."
The dismissals have created widespread resentment in Yakima -- not just among the workers but also among the warehouse owners and local officials, who are wondering how to deal with the effects of a Federal action that has thrown hundreds of people out of work. Though the workers are entitled to few government benefits, they can seek them for their children.
"They're still here, and they still have basic needs," said Steve Hill, the director of community services for Yakima County. "How do they pay their rent? Where do they get their food?"
Pat Brown, a program manager for the local office of the State Department of Social and Health Services, said: "People don't seem to be saying, 'Well, if it isn't O.K. for me to work here, then I'm going back home.' They seem to be saying, as a group, 'We're staying here. This is home.' "
Coming in the off-season for growing and picking, the dismissals have not had a major impact on production. Besides, the growers and warehouse owners said that there had been no shortage of applicants for the jobs. Many did say they were bothered at being told to let go of good workers.
"The whole thing is an extremely frustrating situation," said Dick Keller, president of Northwestern Fruit and Produce, who was recently told to dismiss 87 workers from his warehouse. "From the standpoint of the immigration agents I guess they get it all the way from D.C., from the President on down. They're told to get out and get something done. Now they've done something, but it's not curing the problem, and it's creating a lot of disruption for a lot of people."
The audits and firings in nonborder states are not new, but under the policy shift, they will occur on a much broader basis than ever before, said Mrs. Meissner, the immigration commissioner. While the intent of the expanded strategy is clear, the impact remains to be seen. Some of the dismissed workers here say they will simply look for a new job and take their chances on being caught again.
Agricultural work has long been readily available to just about any migrant in Yakima, and the huge pool of willing workers has kept wages low. Employers are required to check documents, but forged employment or Social Security cards are readily available. In one raid on a warehouse last November in Los Angeles, the immigration service found boxes with two million fake identification documents.
"If they ever really go after the farm workers, then the whole agricultural industry is in deep trouble," said David Carlson, who owns 2,200 acres of orchards in Wapato, outside Yakima, and a small packing house that was recently told to fire 9 of its 45 workers.
"A lot of people say the industry shouldn't be employing people who aren't legal," Mr. Carlson added. "On the other hand, everybody sure seems to like inexpensive food at the grocery store."
And in many ways, the continued prevalence of illegal workers demonstrates what immigration experts say has been the colossal failure of the landmark immigration law passed by Congress in 1986. That measure granted amnesty to about three million illegal workers, but was intended to stem illegal immigration with tough new sanctions against employers, including fines and prison terms.
But the number of people living illegally in the country is growing by about 275,000 a year, according to the immigration service. Employers rarely face sanctions, as long as they can show that they checked the documents presented to them.
"It is something you cannot stop, because the conditions that we come from are so difficult," said Teresa Mendoza, 26, who recently was fired from her packing job and who has two children, one 5 years old and another 9 months, who are American citizens. "I am fighting for my dream for them, and I want to work. I don't want welfare. I have two hands and two legs, and I want to work. What kind of bad crime am I committing?"
Ms. Mendoza's crime is that she is here illegally, having overstayed her tourist visa. But immigrants' advocates insist that people like her are really the victims of a system that almost seems to beg them to come here seeking jobs.
"The number of undocumented workers in this region has been common knowledge to all for many, many years," said Hector Franco, executive director of Asociacion de Barrios Hispanos, a Yakima group. "It's totally inhuman to come in now and treat them like this."
Nearly 1,500 people attended a rally here a few weeks ago, demanding amnesty for the fired workers, and many political leaders, including Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat, have spoken up at least partly in their defense.
"I'm very concerned about the actions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in terms of disruption of people, the families who have been depending on these jobs," Mr. Locke said recently at a news conference in Olympia.
He also said there must be some better system of screening applicants.
The agency has been developing such procedures, it said, and has created a much more more forgery-resistant version of the "green card," which authorizes noncitizens to work. But with the agency already contending with record numbers of citizenship applications, there appears to be little political will for any new amnesty program; and many immigration officials say such an approach would send the wrong message to people who are trying to legally obtain citizenship.
Russ Bergeron, a spokesman for the immigration service, said it was mindful of the suffering caused by the firings, was simply trying to fulfill its obligation.
"One of the reasons why there is so much controversy when something like this occurs is that over the past decades, there has been a significant erosion of respect for Federal immigration law," Mr. Bergeron said. "It is to the point where individuals and certain business interests and other special interests have adopted an attitude that it is their right to violate these laws, and that the Federal Government is conducting some sort of persecution for simply now enforcing what is the law of the land."
The agency says its "interior enforcement strategy" is aimed at industries that often are nowhere near the Mexico border, where the ranks of Border Patrol have been sharply increased as part of the more traditional approach toward stopping illegal immigration. But even effective border actions can not stop all illegal immigration: nearly half of all illegal immigrants enter the country legally, then overstay their visas.
In the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, the immigration service said the audits forced the firing of 44,474 illegal workers. That is only a fraction of the 1.5 million apprehensions at the border.
Here in Yakima, there is considerable skepticism that the audits will put any serious dent in the numbers of illegal workers, who remain in such large supply because not employing them would simply drive up the cost of food.
"They have to pay a lot more for the American people," said a dismissed worker named Olga, who would not give her last name because she was afraid that she and her husband, also recently fired, could be subjected to further action. "They can pay $5.50 an hour to us, while they would have to pay maybe $10 to the others."

HEADLINE: There's a Catch on Social Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The Republican proposal for Social Security presented by Martin Feldstein (Op-Ed, March 31) would guarantee full benefits and offers the probability of even higher benefits, plus increased personal savings that would fuel national economic growth. This commercial should invoke the folk wisdom that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. 
 Mr. Feldstein does not mention the cost of establishing and administering the 150 million accounts with which the program would start. But Robert Reischauer, a former Congressional Budget Office director, and the economist Henry Aaron, former vice president of the American Economic Association, warn that administrative costs could consume 20 percent of an individual's account. Millions of accounts would be so small that costs would be even more disproportionate.
Mr. Feldstein omits other major drawbacks. For example, the supposed savings would be canceled out by the prodigious Treasury borrowing that the proposal would require.

NATO Widens Bombing; Danube Bridge Is Attacked
NATO has expanded the scope of its raids on Yugoslavia, attacking a military unit whose armored personnel carriers were involved in the killing of ethnic Albanians in central Kosovo, Pentagon officials said. American warplanes also destroyed a bridge over the Danube River, the first target that could disrupt the lives of ordinary Serbs. A1
 
Western officials are discussing a plan under which NATO troops would escort ethnic Albanians back into Kosovo after Serbian forces there have been routed by bombing; a self-governing enclave would be set up under allied protection, a senior NATO diplomat said. A1 

Three American soldiers captured along the border with Macedonia will appear before a Yugoslav military court, according to the Yugoslav state news agency. The United States said any sort of trial would violate international law. A1
 
President Clinton, denouncing the capture of the American soldiers, vowed to pursue the Balkan bombing campaign and appealed to the nation for "determination and resolve." A11
 
Serb gunmen are systematically emptying Kosovo's capital city, Pristina, marching its ethnic Albanians out through gantlets of masked, armed Serbs, refugees said. A1
 
Jakub Krasniqi, a spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army, said that guerrillas in Kosovo were aiding NATO forces in their bombing campaign of Serbian targets in the province. But he gave no specifics. A10
 
President Boris N. Yeltsin called for another attempt at peace, as a Russian military reconnaissance ship headed into the Mediterranean in an open demonstration of Moscow's anti-NATO stance in the Yugoslavia conflict. A12
 
Chinese Leader's Visit Still On
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China was still expected to come to the United States next week, after it was said that Chinese officials had considered canceling the visit because of displeasure over the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia and renewed criticism of China's human rights policies. A3

HEADLINE: Mortgage Costs Could Ambush the U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Charles Gradante and his wife, Lee, were on the verge of refinancing their co-op on Sutton Place in Manhattan late last year, but a big remodeling project so consumed them that they failed to get around to it.
"I just let the thing slide, and before I knew it, interest rates started to run up," said Mr. Gradante, a 52-year-old consultant to hedge funds. "I didn't pull the trigger." 
 So the Gradantes have shelved their refinancing, one of many early casualties of a bounce in interest rates this year.
Late last year, the couple could lock in a 7 percent rate for 30 years on their superjumbo $700,000 mortgage. Today, they would have to pay 7.25 percent to 7.5 percent. Instead, they are sticking with their current loan, which carries a fixed 7 percent rate for seven years but can then adjust annually for 23 years. If they refinanced at 7.25 percent now, they would have to pay an extra $146 a month.
Since October 1998, mortgage rates have been crawling upward -- now an average of about half a percentage point higher nationally. The first effect has been a decline in home refinancings, which has put extra dollars in the pockets of consumers and helped fuel a torrid consumer spending spree. But if mortgage rates continue to rise from their current levels -- still quite low in historical terms -- sales of homes will drop off as well, as fewer people can make the monthly payments. Furthermore, a significant increase in interest rates would weigh on stocks and could provide some drag on the overall economy.
By the second week of March, the average commitment rate on 30-year mortgages had climbed to its highest point in nine months -- 7.11 percent plus 1 percent of the sales price for loans up to $227,150 -- according to Freddie Mac, the Government-chartered company that buys loans from lenders and packages them as securities for investors. Bigger loans, like the Gradantes' mortgage, tend to run about a quarter-point higher.
Rates have since receded a bit, to 6.98 percent this week, but the possibility of a resurgence hangs over not just the real estate market but the stock market and the booming American economy. Today's report on job creation in March could prove crucial because each sign of robust economic growth revives fears of inflation and the possibility of higher interest rates in the financial markets.
If interest rates were to jump significantly, by perhaps a percentage point, "it would be a disaster, the worst thing that could happen," said Robert J. Froehlich, vice chairman and stock strategist at Kemper Funds in Chicago. "You could see the stock market easily give back 15 to 20 percent of its value." He remains optimistic, however, that rates will remain largely in check.
Rising interest rates make the bond market a relatively more appealing place for investors to put their money instead of the stock market. Higher rates also raise companies' costs both in conducting everyday business and investing in operations, putting pressure on corporate profits.
Tumbling stock prices could in turn chill consumers who have been driving an economy that grew at a blistering 6 percent pace in the final three months of 1998 and shows only modest signs of a long-anticipated slowing.
"To a significant extent, the highflying stock market is responsible for the consumer spending spree and the lowest savings rate since 1933," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Wells Fargo & Company in Minneapolis.
Dr. Sung noted that 48 percent of families now have some kind of stake in the stock market, compared with 32 percent a decade ago -- a fact "amplifying the impact of the sizzling stock market" on household spending.
While higher rates would certainly take some of the steam out of the housing market and, therefore, the economy, said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, much would depend on what caused the rise.
It they rose because of a global economic recovery, corporate profits would also benefit, and the net effect might be a wash, he said. On the other hand, if rates rose because of intensified upward pressure on American wages, that would imply a return to inflation and would be more problematic, he said.
Although rates on long-term Treasury bonds plunged as low as 4.7 percent last October as foreign turmoil prompted many investors to scurry for safety, average mortgage rates did not fall as sharply, bottoming at about 6.5 percent. Similarly, this year's upturn in Treasury rates has had a more modest impact on mortgage rates.
Rates on many other forms of consumer borrowing, including automobile and education loans, have been virtually unaffected so far but would be swept upward by a sharp rise in interest rates. Credit card rates tend to be less sensitive to rate fluctuations because administrative costs account for the bulk of their relatively high rates.
The mortgage rate increase of late, though, is starting to bite. Applications to refinance home loans, fell 11.7 percent the week ended March 26, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America reported on Wednesday, and stood 22.2 percent below the level four weeks earlier.
"The refi business has definitely slowed up," said Melissa Cohn, president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, a leading broker in the New York City area, even as the rise pushes fence-sitters into action for fear rates could move out of reach.
Refinancings accounted for just more than half all new mortgages in 1998 and are projected to slip to 40 percent of the total this year, according to Paul S. Reid, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. Total lending is expected to decline 18 percent to a still-robust $1.2 trillion.
Borrowers are also shifting to adjustable-rate mortgages, which means lower payments for now. The rates on one-year adjustable mortgages are running about 1.2 percentage points lower than the rates on a fixed 30-year loan, according to The Bank Rate Monitor. At the latest tabulation, the number of applications for adjustable mortgages was 54.5 percent more than it was a year earlier.
Still, many financial analysts are far from convinced that rates are headed much higher.
James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, sees no reason to believe that current economic growth must lead to inflation. Actually, low inflation is fueling economic growth, he said. "And what inflation indicator has moved up to make you think that we should have a 6 percent interest rate?" he asked. The 30-year bond now yields about 5.7 percent; the Treasury's 10-year note that is the main benchmark for pricing mortgages, yields 5.3 percent.
Despite the tightest labor market since the 1970's, inflation has remained tame. Consumer prices have risen just 1.6 percent the last 12 months.
And most people think it would take some pickup in inflation to spur the Federal Reserve Board to push rates higher. The Fed took no action at its meeting on Tuesday, not even announcing a tilt toward higher rates in the future.
"We still expect the 30-year Treasury bond yield to retreat to around 5 percent in coming months," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber.
David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said that even if rates rose further, his industry and its suppliers were likely to be spared a direct hit.
"If people decide they don't want to lock into the higher yield, they'll go for adjustable-rate mortgages," he said. "It would soften the blow."

HEADLINE: The Silent Peaceniks

BYLINE: By Josef Joffe; Josef Joffe, the editorial page editor of Suddeutsche Zeitung, is an associate of the Olin Center for Strategic Studies at Harvard.

DATELINE: MUNICH

 BODY:
Last time, they hung white sheets from their windows. That was in 1991 when the United States started lobbing cruise missiles into Baghdad. But it was not Iraqis who were waving the traditional flag of surrender -- it was peace-minded Germans. Never mind that they were not the targets. They wanted to demonstrate their moral superiority in the face of American "cowboy imperialism."
These last few days, we have seen no such displays of righteousness in Europe. Indeed, as the pounding of Yugoslavia goes into its second week, the most intriguing news from Europe is that the dogs of peace have not been barking in the night. 
 To be sure, there have been protests -- in Vienna and in Bucharest, Romania, in Stockholm and The Hague. Even in Melbourne, Australia, demonstrators burned the American flag. But these were not the usual suspects -- Greens, pacifists, assorted anti-Americans -- but Serb nationals or, as in Bucharest, Orthodox priests inveighing against Muslim infidels.
So what makes this fight so different from all other fights? To begin with, this is a battle not even pacifists can resist: a war of conscience, not of interest. The attack on Yugoslavia is aimed at saving lives, and for purely moral reasons.
This makes all the difference to the postmodern liberal mind, which reflexively recoils from force when it is employed for strategic purposes -- say, oil, economic advantage or the balance of power. Europeans (of all stripes) like such force even less when applied by the United States, the "last remaining superpower."
When the Air Force went after Saddam Hussein, using its ultrasophisticated World War III hardware, Europeans were reminded that they are all alone in the world with an overwhelming giant. And so, the instincts of the weak whisper (against their better judgment), "Let's not restrain Saddam but Uncle Sam."
This time, balancing against Mr. Big was not an issue. Though the United States is doing most of the military work, the NATO campaign is seen as selfless by most Europeans.
There is also, however, an element of Realpolitik in this rare instance of trans-Atlantic harmony. When pacifist-neutralist Europeans turned out by the hundreds of thousands to protest the deployment of American nuclear missiles in the early 1980's, they were driven in large part by the fear that their countries would become a "shooting gallery of the superpowers." Even in 1991, visions of a wider war struck angst into the hearts of those who hung out the white sheets.
But now the Soviet Union is no more, and even the faint of heart do not believe that Russia will rush to the aid of its Serb-Orthodox brethren. Unlike the czar's divisions in 1914, the Russian Army today is not capable of projecting power abroad. Though President Boris Yeltsin condemned the NATO strikes, he pointedly told his Parliament on Tuesday that Russia "will not allow itself to be drawn into military conflict." It is always easier to heed the call of obligation when the risks are low.
The final explanation for the widespread support of the air strikes is the changing of the political guard in Europe. Those who hurled rocks against American cultural centers in the 1970's and staged sit-ins in front of American missile bases in the 1980's are now in government themselves.
Nowhere is this shift more dramatic than in Germany. Gerhard Schroder, a radical leftist in his youth, is now Chancellor, and Joschka Fischer, the former peace advocate and street fighter, serves as Foreign Minister. Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democratic Defense Minister, was once suspended from his party for overzealous agitation against the armed forces.
It seems these men have discovered that when you are in power and there is a fire next door, pacifism becomes a perilous luxury. There is nobody else to take care of business. Mr. Milosevic should listen closely to the sounds of silence and not count on discord in the ranks of NATO. At least not soon.

BRITAIN: SCOTTISH POLL FAVORS LABOR -- A new poll shows that the Labor Party would beat the Scottish National Party if the election for the new Scottish Parliament were held today. In a survey of 880 Scots, 45 percent supported Labor, 32 percent backed the Scottish National Party, 12 percent supported the Liberal Democrats and 10 percent backed the Conservatives. The election is to be held May 6. Sarah Lyall (NYT)
 
AUSTRIA: 'CARLOS' EXTRADITION SOUGHT -- Austria has asked France to extradite the man known as Carlos the Jackal, who is serving a life sentence for slaying three people in 1975, the Austria Press Agency reported. Carlos, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, is being sought to provide testimony in the trial of another suspect Austria wants France to extradite. (AP)
 
TURKEY: AN OCALAN REUNION -- The brother and sister of the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan traveled to his prison island for their first family reunion in more than 20 years, the Anatolia news agency reported. Mehmet Ocalan and Havva Keser went to Imrali Island in the Sea of Marmara accompanied by two members of Mr. Ocalan's legal team. Mr. Ocalan is awaiting trial on charges of treason and could face the death penalty if convicted. (AP)
 
FRANCE: MONT BLANC DELAY -- Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot indicated that it could be "several months, maybe a year" before the Mont Blanc Tunnel, where 40 people died after a truck fire engulfed 30 vehicles, is open to traffic again. The results of a preliminary inquiry will be made available to the Government next Friday. Prime Minister Jacques Chirac pledged a "detailed, scientific inquiry." (Agence France-Presse)

PARAGUAY: SEEKING TRADE BREAKS -- The newly installed President, Luis Gonzalez Macchi, proposed that the Mercosur trade union rewrite its rules to give Paraguay and Uruguay new trade concessions. There was no immediate response from Brazil and Argentina, the leaders of the union. Mr. Macchi's statement was viewed as an expression of anger toward Argentina for granting asylum to a retired general accused of ordering the assassination of Vice President Luis Maria Argana. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
MEXICO: LEFTIST VOTE ANNULLED -- The main leftist party, Democratic Revolution, has annulled the results of its March 14 internal elections, acknowledging the vote was marred by the balloting abuses it has often accused the ruling party of committing. The two candidates for party president who finished in a virtual tie both criticized the annulment, but Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the outgoing president, said, "We'll do it over: free, clean and democratic elections."
 Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
MEXICO: 5 HELD IN MURDERS -- Five men, including several drivers of buses that carry women to factory jobs, have been arrested in connection with sexual murders in Ciudad Juarez. Authorities accused an Egyptian-born chemist in a Juarez prison for rape and murder of hiring the men to commit the murders in hopes that new sexual crimes after his arrest would persuade a judge he was not responsible for dozens of previous killings. He was convicted on March 3.

CHILE: PORT STRIKE ENDS -- A two-day strike by workers at ports across Chile ended when leaders of the walkout agreed to talks with high-level Government officials. The strike, coming at the height of Chile's fruit-export season and threatening to halt copper shipments -- the country's No. 1 export earner -- generated multimillion dollar losses for exporters, shippers and maritime agencies.

UGANDA: GORILLA PARKS REOPEN -- Tourists returned for the first time in a month to a gorilla reserve where Rwandan rebels killed eight foreigners. Under tight security, a dozen tourists, including three Americans, visited the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in southwest Uganda. Bwindi and Mgahinga National Park, which also reopened, are entry points into the mountains that straddle the borders of Uganda, Congo and Rwanda, the only habitat of the world's remaining 620 mountain gorillas. (AP)
 
BENIN: OPPOSITION WINS -- The opposition led by former President Nicephore Soglo's Renaissance of Benin has won a majority in the 83-seat National Assembly in Benin's third legislative vote since the introduction of multiparty politics in 1990. The vote was seen as a test of popularity for the head of state, Gen. Mathieu Kerekou, three years after he was voted into office.

All the King's Horses and All the King's Men Were Still Optimistic

 BODY:
Wall Street cheered this week as the Dow Jones industrial average finally closed above 10,000. Many analysts are counting on a continuing bull market. Who knows? They may be right. And then again, they may not. Stock market predictions are a tricky business, as you can see from a look back at what was said 70 years ago, before and right after the Oct. 29 crash. Joyce Jensen compiled these quotations from "The Great Crash, 1929," by John Kenneth Galbraith (Houghton Mifflin, 1997); "The Stock Market Crash of 1929," by James Crane Kellogg 3d and William E. Downey (J. C. Kellogg Foundation, 1954); "The Experts Speak," by Christopher Cerf and Victor Navasky (Villard Books, 1998); "The Day the Market Crashed," by Donald I. Rogers (Arlington House, 1971), and "The Big Board: A History of the New York Stock Market," by Robert Sobel (The Free Press, 1965).
"The poorhouse is vanishing from among us. We have not yet reached the goal, but given a chance to go forward with the policies of the last eight years, we shall soon . . . be in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this nation." Herbert Hoover, the Republican candidate for President, June 1928. 
 "The market is following natural laws of economics and there is no reason why both prosperity and the market should not continue for years at this high level or even higher." Thomas C. Shotwell, "Wall Street Analysis," The World Almanac for 1929.
"We seem only to have touched the fringe of our potentialities. . . . As long as the appetite for goods and services is practically insatiable, as it appears to be, and as long as productivity can be consistently increased, it would seem that we can go on with increasing activity. But we can do this only if we develop a technique of balance." From a report by a Presidential committee, "Recent Economic Changes in the United States," early 1929.
"The economic condition of the world seems on the verge of a great forward movement." Bernard Baruch, financier and Presidential adviser, June 1929.
"The outlook for the fall months seems brighter than at any time." The Wall Street Journal, Aug. 23, 1929.
"The consensus of judgment of the millions whose valuations function on that admirable market, the Stock Exchange, is that stocks are not at present overvalued." Joseph Lawrence, professor at Princeton University, 1929.
"I see no reason for the end-of-the-year slump which some people are predicting." Charles Mitchell, head of the National City Bank and director of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Oct. 15, 1929.
The market should go "a good deal higher than it is today within a few months," Irving Fisher, professor of economics at Yale University, Oct. 15, 1929.
"This crash is not going to have much effect on business," Arthur Reynolds, chairman of Continental Illinois Bank of Chicago, Oct. 24, 1929.
"The worst has passed," Joint Statement by representatives of 35 of the largest retail brokerage houses on Wall Street at the close of trading, Oct. 24, 1929.
"This is the time to buy stocks. This is the time to recall the words of the late J. P. Morgan that any man who is bearish on the United States will go broke. Within a few days there is likely to be a bear panic rather than a bull panic. Many of the low prices as a result of this hysterical selling are not likely to be reached again in many years." R. W. McNeel, director of McNeel Financial Service, quoted in The New York Herald Tribune, Oct. 30, 1929.
"A severe depression like that of 1920-21 is outside the range of probability. We are not facing protracted liquidation." The Harvard Economic Society, November 1929.
"Financial storm definitely passed." Bernard Baruch, cablegram to Winston Churchill, Nov. 15, 1929.

HEADLINE: North Korea's Food Near End, Aid Workers Say

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 2

 BODY:
The food scarcity engulfing North Korea will worsen in the next two months because Government rations, on which a majority of the population depends, are running out and will not be restocked until the summer harvest, a senior aid official said today.
"We're now entering the most difficult months of the year," said David Morton, the United Nations aid coordinator for North Korea, at a briefing in Beijing. 
 For the next two months, Mr. Morton said, much of the population will have to depend on so-called substitute foods -- cakes or noodles made from corn stalks, cabbage stalks or grass ground with grain -- or on wild roots and grasses they scrounge themselves.
The most acute scarcity will ease in June and July when potato and vegetable crops are harvested, officials say, although the country will remain chronically short of food.
People in North Korea's cities and towns have tended to be the worst off, aid workers have found, especially if they rely for income on industries that are now nearly idle for lack of fuel or raw materials. Fewer than one-third of North Korea's people work on farms, where there is often access to more food.
Food aid from abroad, supplied mostly by the United States and channeled through the United Nations World Food Program, is mainly directed to young children in nursery schools and kindergartens, with some going to hospitals. In a new push, aid agencies are trying to feed more pregnant and nursing mothers and the elderly.
But the aid can help only a fraction of the population and offers no long-term answer, Mr. Morton said.
"We're keeping alive a generation of children," he said. "But this is only a holding action."
As other foreign visitors to North Korea have, Mr. Morton described a country where malnutrition has stunted most children and weakened many adults, where hospitals and schools have no heat and little food and where water supplies are unsanitary because there is no chlorine for treatment. "Famine, defined as an extreme scarcity of food, remains a reality for much of the population," a United Nations strategy paper concluded last month.
An unknown number of people, by some evidence in the millions, have died as a result.
Mr. Morton took issue with charges that have made by some refugees that much of the aid is being diverted to the army and political elites. Those groups vastly prefer rice to the corn and wheat in the aid program, he said, and national supplies meet their needs.
While United Nations monitors must travel with escorts and usually must declare their destinations in advance, they visit all regions where aid is given to see if schools and hospitals have received their allotments. "We believe, from what we see, that they are getting the food," Mr. Morton said.
Though the country's agricultural production has been hurt by floods and droughts, the famine's roots lie in the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, most experts now believe, when North Korea lost its major supplier of fuel, fertilizer, industrial inputs and farm equipment. It has been unable to replace those supplies through foreign exchange.
Per capita income fell to less than $500 by 1996 from more than $1,000 in 1992, according to international estimates. Fertilizer plants went idle, tractors had little fuel, irrigation pumps lacked electricity and food production plummeted.
Last fall, fuel was so scarce that 90 percent of the country's rice fields were not plowed after the harvest, the usual practice to suppress weeds and pests. That factor alone will reduce the next harvest by 12 percent, a North Korean official has said.
Simply rebuilding agriculture will not solve the problem, Mr. Morton said, because North Korea has limited arable land.
"This is an industrial country," he said. "What it needs is an economic revival."
But for both political and economic reasons, other countries are reluctant to provide large-scale economic aid. So long as North Korea refuses to make major reforms in its closed, Communist economy, many experts say, such aid may only prop up the system that helped cause the current famine.

HEADLINE: BRIDGE;
Deceptive Leads on the Way To a Cavendish Teams Title

BYLINE: By Alan Truscott 

 BODY:
One of America's finest players, Edward Manfield of Philadelphia, died of a heart attack at 55 on Monday, shortly after returning from the Spring National Championships in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Eddie Manfield was born in the Bronx, graduated from Harvard University and received a master's degree in economics. He worked for the Federal Trade Commission and then was successful as an options trader, heading his own company. 
 He won one world bridge title and 11 national ones, including the Vanderbilt Teams. In 1979 he captured the Cavendish Invitational Teams with his regular partner, Kit Woolsey.
They were aided by the diagramed deal, on which Woolsey as West opened with a weak two-bid in spades. This suggested six spades, but the modern tendency is to take this action with a strong five-card suit.
Against three no-trump, he led the spade four, an imaginative choice to provide for the possibility that his partner held a doubleton or singleton honor. The right play for South was the ten from dummy, but that was not obvious, and he played low, winning in his hand with the king.
Preparing for the end position, he led a diamond to the ten. Manfield as East won with the jack and returned the suit. South won with the ace in dummy, cashed four club winners and reached this ending:
The declarer gave himself the best chance by leading the diamond two. Manfield took his three diamond winners and had to break the hearts. If he had led low, South would have played low and finessed the ten successfully. But he led the queen, and South fell into the trap. After winning with the ace he finessed the ten, going down two. Perhaps he should have reasoned that Manfield would have led low with queen-jack-six.

HEADLINE: Way Paved for Philadelphia To Develop Naval Shipyard

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
Agreements signed this week by the United States Navy and the City of Philadelphia have cleared the way for the city to develop the huge shipyard that was shut down four years ago in a round of military base closings.
The city can now begin to market the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard as a commercial site, an endeavor that is expected to result in up to 3,000 new jobs. 
 The first major business interested in the shipyard, Kvaener ASA of Norway, the largest shipbuilding company in Europe, agreed more than a year ago to build there but needed title to its site by April 2000 to proceed. The agreements, in effect, pass ownership of the shipyard to the city, allowing it to sign contracts with individual buyers and tenants.
Kvaener, which is planning to lease 115 acres for about $345,000 a year for 99 years, could create 1,000 jobs or more.
"This is a very important milestone in a difficult process," said Julie K. Van Nostern, director of Philadelphia's Office of Defense Conversion, an arm of the city's industrial development agency. "For economic development, it's very significant."
Opened in 1801, the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard operated as one of the country's largest shipbuilding sites until it was included among 26 military bases in 1991 recommended to be closed in the aftermath of the cold war. Over the years, more than 100 ships were built there, and thousands were repaired.
In the peak years, from World War II through the mid-1980's, as many as 12,000 people worked at the shipyard, but when it closed, in September 1995, the work force was down to 1,600. The aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy was the last naval craft to be overhauled there.
Once the shipyard closed, city and state officials began planning a development strategy, leading to a $429 million commitment by the city, state and Federal governments to upgrade the site and offer job training programs.
City officials negotiated with the Navy to obtain the rights to the property, and on Wednesday officials signed three contracts that passed control of 1,100 acres to the city for $2 million. The Navy is retaining 130 acres for its own use.
The agreements allow the city to sign long-term deals with tenants, some of whom will require major construction projects to accommodate their businesses. Ms. Van Nostern said that before the city's deal with the Navy was completed, some prospective tenants had been reluctant to sign leases with no guarantees that the Navy would allow them to remain beyond a few years.
The site has two major components, the former shipbuilding yard, which Kvaener will occupy, and a former naval station, which officials hope to market as a gated, mixed-use site for commercial and light industrial businesses.
Major selling points, they said, are the property's location, a suburban setting about halfway between downtown and Philadelphia International Airport, and a light-rail line that runs onto the site.
Dee Kaplan, director of Mayor Edward G. Rendell's Business Action Team, said the city's agreement with the Navy "gives us more freedom and flexibility to deal with companies who want to buy or lease" at the former naval yard.
"A lot of companies have expressed interest," Ms. Kaplan said. "We also have a lot of existing companies in the area who love the ambiance of the place."

Japanese Stock Prices Mixed; Export Companies Fare the Best

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 2

 BODY:
Japanese stock prices closed mixed today, with the shares of export-dependent companies benefiting from the dollar's gains against the yen.
Major financial markets elsewhere in the world were closed for Good Friday. 
 In Tokyo, investors were encouraged by indications on Thursday that Japanese pension funds had begun the new fiscal year by buying stocks. That raised expectations that domestic investors would join global fund managers, who already had been buying shares on the Tokyo market, one of the world's best-performing markets so far this year.
The Nikkei average of 225 stocks, which jumped 3.1 percent Thursday, fell 37.37 points today, to 16,290.19. The index rose 1.7 percent in the week and is up almost 18 percent this year.
The broader Topix index, which comprises all the companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section, rose 3.73 points today, to 1,304.17.
The Sony Corporation, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company and other exporters rose again today. The dollar, which increased more than 1 percent against the yen on Thursday, rose slightly in Tokyo today, to 120.52 yen from 120.43 yen in New York Thursday afternoon. A stronger dollar increases the amount of yen produced by sales overseas.
In the economic background, the central bank's quarterly survey of Japanese business confidence, to be released Monday morning, is expected to show the first increase in seven quarters, thanks in part to the Government's efforts to support the construction and banking industries.
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said on March 23 that the economy had bottomed out. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said a week before that he expected an economic recovery to have taken hold by early May.

HEADLINE: International Business: Retooling Fortress Wallenberg;
Swedish Empire, Under Siege, Scrambles to Adapt

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM

 BODY:
What's in a name? If the country is Sweden, and the name is Wallenberg, then the answer is just about everything.
Since the mid-19th century, Swedish industry has been largely synonymous with the Wallenberg family. The dynasty's tentacles reach everywhere, from heavy trucks and mobile phones at home to construction sites in Asia and board rooms in the United States. As one measure of the Wallenbergs' power in Sweden, their holding company, Investor A.B., controls companies that account for an estimated 40 percent of shares traded on the Stockholm stock exchange. 
 But like Sweden itself, the Wallenberg business empire is under siege these days by the forces of the global economy.
"We were suddenly subject to all the competitive powers in the world," said Jacob Wallenberg, 43, the chairman of Investor's SEB bank, who, along with his cousin Marcus Wallenberg, also 43, represents the family's newest generation of top managers.
In an unyielding global economy of free-flowing money, international megamergers and an intense focus on "core competencies" and shareholder value, the Wallenberg family conglomerate, with its disparate and far-flung interests, has been looking increasingly like an anachronism.
"Investor's traditional strategy -- as a long-term dominant and active owner across a range of sectors based on a slowly changing or unchanging portfolio -- is untenable," wrote Sweden's leading weekly business magazine, Affarsvarlden.
But the Wallenbergs are hardly sitting idle while the economic ground shifts under their feet. Rather, they are reorganizing crucial parts of their empire, particularly in forestry and pharmaceuticals, to make it more international, all in an effort to improve returns. And in a change from tradition, the family business is being run by a nonfamily member, Percy N. Barnevik.
In 1997, the family patriarch, Peter Wallenberg, stepped down as chairman of Investor A.B., though not as head of a Wallenberg family foundation that controls 35.6 percent of Investor's voting rights. The top jobs of chairman and chief executive of Investor went to Mr. Barnevik, 58, and Claes Dahlback, 52. In February, the company said that Mr. Dahlback, who has been the Wallenberg family's top nonfamily manager for years, would retire in April and be replaced by Marcus Wallenberg as chief executive.
Peter Wallenberg's departure opened the way for the beginnings of a rapid transformation under Mr. Barnevik, who had made a name for himself with the success of the 1987 Swedish-Swiss merger that created ABB Asea Brown Boveri. Mr. Barnevik, who remains chairman of ABB but is no longer chief executive there, seemed perfect for the job of running Investor. Indeed, ABB, the engineering behemoth based in Zurich, was acclaimed as one of the world's first truly borderless companies.
In his short period at the helm of Investor, Mr. Barnevik has instilled tighter corporate governance in clubby Sweden and loosened the Wallenbergs' grip on Swedish industry.
For years, the Wallenbergs had solidified their power at many Swedish companies not so much by acquiring majority equity stakes but by creating special voting rights for themselves that in some cases were as much as 1,000 times their actual holdings.
"More and more players in the capital market would say that peculiar capital structures make for peculiar decisions," Jacob Wallenberg said in an interview here.
At some companies, Investor reduced its voting-power advantage to tenfold, a more defensible level that nonetheless left the Wallenbergs in effective control even with a minority interest. The balance between stock and voting rights is a tricky one. Without the voting power to dominate management teams, the holding company finds its ability to run the companies in its portfolio greatly diminished. Investor's low equity stakes mean, though, that the company does not necessarily benefit as much from successful investments.
Meantime, with dizzying speed over the last two years, Investor has made deals in forestry, pharmaceuticals and aerospace that produced waves far beyond Sweden.
In December, Zeneca Group P.L.C. of Britain announced a $34.6 billion stock-only agreement to acquire the Astra A.B. unit of Investor to create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with its corporate headquarters in London, its research and development unit in Sweden and Mr. Barnevik as its chairman.
Investor's Saab Aircraft sold a 35 percent stake in its aerospace division to British Aerospace P.L.C. for $454 million. Saab also announced plans to close a civilian regional aircraft unit at the end of this year. Late last year, Stora A.B., Investor's forest products group, announced a $6.9 billion merger with its Finnish rival, Enso Oy, to produce a giant based in Helsinki, not Stockholm.
Those deals were intended to give the company a competitive edge in increasingly global businesses. And Investor insiders say the wave of revamping is far from over. At the same time, Investor's ramparts no longer seem as immune to assault as they once did.
In January, Volvo A.B. -- which is not a Wallenberg company but is run by a former Wallenberg manager, Leif Johansson -- bought a 12.85 percent chunk of stock in Scania A.B., the Wallenberg-controlled truck company. Such a challenge to the Wallenbergs, once unthinkable, could only have been undertaken with the help of leading institutional investors.
But the once improbable has become commonplace all across the corporate landscape as the barriers that once kept Swedish businesses in Swedish hands crumble. For most of the century, entrepreneurs have ventured out from Stockholm in search of profitable opportunities to enhance their sheltered home base. That business energy enabled Sweden to become one of the world's richest countries and to afford a costly cradle-to-grave social safety net.
Now, the trend has been reversed. Sweden's per capita income has plummeted to No. 17 in the world from No. 3 over the last two decades, and its welfare state cocoon has slowly unraveled under assault from outside forces and internal stresses. Corporate executives and college graduates have been seeking jobs in Britain and the United States, fleeing in record numbers from Sweden's punishing personal tax rates, which go up to 60 percent.
Ericsson, the Swedish mobile-phone maker that is under severe competitive pressure from Nokia of Finland, has joined the exodus. A big element in the Investor portfolio, Ericsson will move its European headquarters and corporate finance department to London in August. There, the argument runs, executives prefer to pay lower taxes and live in closer proximity to Europe's biggest capital markets.
As Ericsson departs, corporate giants from elsewhere are moving in, underscoring Sweden's grudging absorption into the nearly universal capitalist world order. The Ford Motor Company bought the car division of Volvo, the quintessential emblem of Swedishness, for $6.5 billion in January. The General Motors Corporation, which acquired a 50 percent stake in Saab Automobile A.B. from Investor in 1990, is widely expected to acquire the other half soon.
In the past, the very breadth of Investor's holdings underpinned the Wallenberg dominance in Swedish business. But as it confronts pressure for revamping, its stakes in the companies in its stable, and thus its control of them, stand to be reduced.
Moreover, the structure of the family fortune, which is held in a tax-exempt trust, leaves Investor few options but to shed its equity stake in some companies to concentrate on those it regards as essential businesses, Swedish analysts say. Its further challenge will be to catch the wave of new, high-technology businesses that younger Swedes see as the future.
Mr. Barnevik, once viewed as a corporate magician, now faces unaccustomed criticism from Swedish commentators questioning his touch ever since Investor took a big hit from the economic tailspin in Asia and Russia last year. Investor shares closed on Thursday in Stockholm at 362 kroner, or $43.93, down from a high of 479.5 kroner, or $58.19, last July 2.
The erosion of the Wallenberg empire has led to speculation that other Investor interests -- including parts of its original 19th-century base, SEB bank -- may be on the block. "It is increasingly difficult to play the part of an active owner once control of commercial enterprises is diluted," Mr. Dahlback, Investor's outgoing chief executive, told Affarsvarlden earlier this year. "And if we cannot perform as active owners, we would prefer to get out."
Others argue that the future of the Wallenberg dynasty depends on a broader alchemy that permits Investor to exercise control through the appointment of key managers and directors and draws on the readiness of institutional investors to follow the holding company's lead.
"It's not just a numbers game," Mr. Barnevik, the company chairman, said. "It's a game of confidence from the institutions that you are a good owner whether you own X percent or two times X percent. It's a question of how well you do the job."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Browns Rushing Into Existence

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

DATELINE: BEREA, Ohio

 BODY:
Al Lerner recently watched his first indoor practice and nearly got trampled. Lerner, the billionaire owner of the expansion Cleveland Browns, lingered on a sideline, his hands in his pants pockets, when halfback Malcolm Thomas raced full speed toward him.
Carmen Policy, the team's president and part owner, pushed Lerner to safety. "Al was reluctant to go," Policy said later, "and I dragged him there. I said it would be fun. All I could think of was visiting him at the Cleveland Clinic, his leg up in traction, and he says, 'For this, I paid $530 million?' " 
 What Lerner saw of his huge investment were 73 men -- expansion draftees, free agents and trade acquisitions -- in brown, white and orange, scrimmaging with unusual ardor as cameras above one end zone and at midfield recorded every movement of the team-in-progress.
In his first National Football League head coaching job, Chris Palmer prowled the artificial turf, windmilling his right arm, urging the players to move faster, then faster. Running back Terry Kirby wondered about the raw intensity of this first practice, in shorts and no pads.
"It was shocking," said Kirby, a free-agent acquisition. "This is March. Isn't March Madness supposed to be about basketball? No, obviously this March Madness is football madness."
That is what Lerner, a 65-year-old banker, got for his $530 million on the first day of minicamp. "Being involved in football, sitting at the edge of my seat waiting for the first game, is all good stuff," he said. Lerner is poker-faced; Policy, garrulous. Lerner needed Policy's football acumen. Policy is enamored of Lerner's desire to spend lavishly. They frequently set up each other's sentences and thoughts.
"People are learning very quickly," Policy said, "that you have to know what you're talking about with him, and there's no shame in saying, 'I don't know.' "
Once Lerner entered the Browns sweepstakes, he became the prohibitive favorite. The wealthiest of the bidders, Lerner is a friend of Commissioner Paul Tagliabue of the N.F.L. As a limited partner in the old Browns, he counseled Art Modell to take them to Baltimore as the Ravens in 1996. After a period of public reproval for aiding Modell, he is adapting to the type of public role he has never led as the chairman of the MBNA Corporation, the nation's third-largest credit card lender.
"It's hard to walk in and out of restaurants or go to public places," he said at a conference room table in Policy's office. "Would I like to go back to my life of quiet desperation? I'd like to, but it's O.K."
"He isn't comfortable with it," Policy said.
"But I do the drill," Lerner said.
For a city that mourned and raged when Modell fled to Baltimore, this team-in-formation will do quite fine. And Lou Groza likes what he sees. Groza, the legendary kicker for the original Browns who is now 75, watched the practice from a chair far from the sideline.
"This is like a relative coming home," Groza said.
Coincidentally, the new Browns and the Browns-turned-Ravens are division rivals and will play each other twice a year. Their first meeting is Sept. 26 in Baltimore.
The return of the Browns is an N.F.L. success story in the modern era of stadium-driven sports economics.
It began with Modell's secret talks with Maryland officials, escalated into angry protests that forced Modell's permanent exile from Cleveland and provoked Capitol Hill hearings about franchise relocation and concern that the N.F.L. could do nothing to prevent carpetbagging by teams.
The saga ended with an agreement to reseed the Browns as an expansion team, build a publicly financed stadium for $283 million (with nearly all revenue going to the team) and orchestrate a high-profile auction, which led to Lerner's buying the team for what was then a record sum. (The $800 million sale of the Washington Redskins to a group led by the New York real estate magnate Howard Milstein is pending.)
"If you gave me a team for free in any other city, I wouldn't take it," Lerner said. "This is the only team I have any intention to own."
Without a game played, every seat, luxury box and club seat in the stadium is sold out. Combine the stadium cash with $58.1 million in network television money this year (and steadily more in each year thereafter), and profitability looks imminent.
"We'll make a profit," Lerner said. "But do you produce a return as good as a Government bond? Not for a long time. But you can't watch your T-bills play. This is a business, but it's not a business. You have to win. It wouldn't be a success if it only made money."
The rebirth of the Browns introduces high expectations, which Lerner is underwriting with his desire to spend what is necessary for talent; to rebuild five outdoor practice fields and redo the Berea headquarters for $2 million, and to restock a weight room left empty when Modell left.
But the hopes are fueled by the near-instant prosperity of the previous expansion teams, the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Carolina Panthers. After coming to life in 1994, they played in their conferences' championship games the next season. Never mind that Jacksonville and Carolina had nearly two years to prepare for their first college draft and the Browns barely six months. Never mind that the Browns are not guaranteed top draft picks in their second season, as their expansion predecessors did. And never mind that Lerner, Policy and Dwight Clark, the vice president for football operations, have never built an expansion team.
"This is more difficult than I thought," said Policy, the former San Francisco 49ers president, who has a 10 percent stake in the team. "Managing the 49ers during the 90's is entirely different from what we're experiencing now. We had a structure in place. We had to maintain, fine-tune and improve it. But it's daunting to start from nothing."
For the Browns, the future is virtually now.
"We need to be competitive in Year 2 or 3," said Clark, whom Policy brought from San Francisco and who has imported 12 former 49ers. "We have higher expectations than the people outside this building."
"The 1999 win-loss record is of low priority, at least to the architects," Policy said. "We want to compete for the A.F.C. Central championship in 2000."
Said Lerner: "They have to be realistic. I don't. I want to win every game."
Palmer, 49, who was hired for his teaching skills, started his quest to become a head coach a year ago. He was a head coach at Boston University and the University of New Haven, but an assistant since then with the Houston Oilers, the New England Patriots and Jacksonville.
"When you're close to 50, your options start to dry up," he said, sitting in a rented black chair in his office. His work with the Patriots and Jaguars, especially with young quarterbacks, was known to other teams, but he was not on the top rung of Cleveland's coaching candidates. Still, his "token" interview with Policy and Lerner went unexpectedly well, and he was hired for five years.
Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin, Palmer's boss from 1997 to 1998, advised him, "Get going, you're already behind."
Palmer knows about high expectations. He is reminded of them when he sees how little time he has to invest the team with chemistry and discipline and satisfy fans who have waited three years to see their Browns. He knows it from the task of dealing with his assistant coaches, most of whom he has never worked with. He knows it from the bus driver who shouted at him, "Take the quarterback, it's what you know," regarding the April 17 college draft.
"This is not the real world," Palmer said. "I go to lunch in a place near here and you see a sign that says, '154 days until Browns football,' and I can't enjoy lunch very much. We have two years to win."
How quickly the Browns win may depend on whom they choose with the expected No. 1 pick in the draft. It could be a quarterback, like Tim Couch of Kentucky or Akili Smith of Oregon, or it could be the Heisman Trophy-winning running back Ricky Williams of Texas.
That top choice -- and others -- would add to to the core built through the expansion draft (with onetime Browns cornerback Antonio Langham the main pickup), free agency (Kirby, free safety Marquez Pope, offensive tackle Lomas Brown and defensive tackle John Jurkovic) and trades (quarterback Ty Detmer, defensive lineman Roy Barker and tight end Irv Smith, all from the 49ers, who were clearing salary-cap room, center Dave Wohlabaugh and linebacker Chris Spielman).
"If one of those quarterbacks can take us all the way, we have to take him," said Clark, "even if he goes through what Peyton Manning did." But Clark remembers how Joe Montana broke in with the 49ers under Coach Bill Walsh: "Bill had Joe watch until he started for the first time in the middle of the second season."
Couch seemed like the Browns' certain choice until Smith's workout with the team raised his profile. The Browns could deal their top pick; New Orleans Saints Coach Mike Ditka has offered all his draft picks to leap into the first or second slot and take Williams.
"The decision on the first pick will affect me more than anyone else," Palmer said. "If it's a good pick, I get to stay a while. If it's not, I don't. I just want to be the first Browns coach to get a contract extension."
All he need do is mold Couch (or Smith) into a Lake Erie version of Montana, take the Browns to the American Football Conference championship game in 2001, and turn Al Lerner's $530 million gamble into a sure thing.

HEADLINE: Low Prices Have Sapped Little Oil Producers

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Even after a 30 percent jump in crude oil prices last month, Terry Smith, the general manager of the Tidelands Oil Production Company, is not sure it is time to begin reopening oil wells.
Tidelands has 834 wells off the coast of Long Beach, Calif., but it has shut 327 of them in the last year as oil prices plunged. 
 Prices had been so low for so long that Mr. Smith is reluctant to spend the $30,000 it takes to bring a well back and rehire workers, even though he says he makes a profit when prices are $10 a barrel. West Texas intermediate crude oil traded at above $17 a barrel this week for the first time in more than a year, largely on the strength of cutbacks announced by big oil producers last month.
But Mr. Smith's cash has been depleted, he has laid off a third of his workers and, as with thousands of other small independent producers, he is worried that prices might collapse again. "I want to see if this thing is going to stabilize," he said in a telephone interview.
Independent oil companies like Tidelands account for 40 percent of the oil produced in the United States. Many are facing the same kinds of hard choices that Mr. Smith confronts. While they have seen many downturns, the last year has hit them particularly hard, with crude prices at a low of $10.35 a barrel in December. Their problems make it unlikely that domestic production, which hit a 50-year low of about six million barrels a day last month, will recover soon.
Those that have suffered most and will have the hardest time recovering are the very small producers. They typically own about 10 so-called stripper wells. Many motorists glimpse wells of this type from the highways in states like California, Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas, the pumps slowly bobbing up and down, extracting about 2.2 barrels a day at each unit from old and often declining fields.
Even though they produce very small amounts individually, together they account for 1.3 million barrels a day. That is about 20 percent of domestic output and roughly the amount the United States imports daily from Saudi Arabia.
While lower crude oil prices have enabled consumers to enjoy some of the lowest gasoline prices in decades, and cheap oil has contributed to low inflation, those working in the domestic oil industry have paid a heavy price for these benefits.
About 52,000 jobs have been lost since October 1997 in oil and natural gas production, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many of these will not be replaced.
There are 574,000 oil wells in the nation capable of producing an average total of 6.4 million barrels a day, but about 136,000 of them have been shut temporarily. Of those wells, which are capable of producing about 550,000 barrels a day, some oil economists and industry experts predict that up to half could be abandoned.
The loss of production could turn out to be as high as 400,000 barrels a day. Some experts say many wells that will be restarted are likely to produce at lower rates because of equipment and technical problems.
Such a large loss of output means that domestic oil production is expected to continue to decline even if prices maintain their current levels. Last month, imported oil made up more than 55 percent of the United States supply, one of the highest levels ever, and increasing dependence on imported oil is likely to continue.
"It not just like turning the tap back on and we recover the production that has been lost," said Scott Espenshade, the senior economist at the Independent Petroleum Association of America.
Of particular concern is the loss of the skills and knowledge of experienced workers who have been laid off and moved on to other fields. The losses range from crews that can handle the tough job of drilling and keeping wells producing to the extensive web of thousands of small and large companies that provide services and equipment that enable many small producers to operate.
Mr. Smith of Tidelands, for example, said most of the 65 workers he had laid off had found other jobs in the strong California economy and would not return to the volatile oil industry. Thus, he will face the expense and strain of training new people. And once he decides to bring the wells back he will have problems finding contractors to help with the work because some have gone out of business or cut back severely themselves.
And many among those who have been laid off have been struggling, especially in places where the local economy is not strong, like the area around Great Bend, Kan., a city of about 15,500 in the central part of the state some 90 miles northwest of Wichita.
After spending 32 years in the oil industry, Dan Murta, who lives in Great Bend, lost his job as vice president with Tomkat Ltd. a small independent oil company based in Wichita. From a salary of $45,000 a year, he said, he was now reduced to earning little more than minimum wage as a telemarketer.
In past downturns, Mr. Murta recalled, he was able to fall back on being a consultant to the industry for $200 to $300 a day. But so many producers have shut down that even that has dried up.
"There's no opportunity out here," he said. "I just couldn't find anything."
At 56, he says he should be at the height of his career, with skills and knowledge that the industry has increasingly found difficult to replace once a recovery is under way.
Mr. Murta recalled that the Halliburton Company, the Dallas-based company that is one of the world's biggest providers of oilfield services, once had seven centers in Kansas where those in the business could get equipment and workers to maintain and drill wells. But because of cutbacks by the company, which merged with Dresser Industries, the only office left is in Liberty, Kan.
When he began working for Texaco in 1973, Mr. Murta recalled, eight big oil companies had operations in Great Bend. "They've all gone," he added, and some of their buildings stand empty.
Danny Biggs is the general field superintendent of the Pickrell Drilling Company of Great Bend, which has about 300 wells in the area, of which 50 are shut. He is worried that even if prices are high, he may have trouble gearing up again. As wells sit idle, all kinds of problems can develop, including water seeping into fields and cracking in pipes.
"It's like letting a car sit around for six months," Mr. Biggs said. "You don't know what might go wrong." His company, however, has the financial strength to recover because the wells that have kept pumping have provided enough cash flow.
Others are not as fortunate.
Virginia Banks Lazenby, the chairwoman of the Bretagne Corporation, a 600-well independent based in Nashville, said that while her company was able to conserve enough cash to rebuild, many people did not have the capital. "It's going to be an extended time before they can begin reinvesting," she said.
Even the smaller producers might have to invest $10,000 to $15,000 to get a well pumping again. That is a substantial sum when, in a good year, with crude oil prices in the range of $17 to $18 a barrel, a producer with 10 wells might net about $10,000.
"It's going to be harder for the small producer to find the capital," Ms. Lazenby said. "That's why not everyone is going to get back in."
She was also pessimistic about the long-term future for small operators. "There are few young people coming in," she said. "They're just tired of fighting it."

HEADLINE: Statehouse Journal;
School Crisis Chips Away at New Hampshire's Anti-Tax Stance

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
Does this sound like the New Hampshire known for its ferocious aversion to taxes?
Polls have found that when New Hampshire residents are asked how the state should respond to a court decision requiring it to end its heavy reliance on local property taxes to pay for schools, hefty proportions favor an income tax. 
 The school financial crisis is now in overtime. Despite marathon sessions, lawmakers missed their court-imposed April 1 deadline to come up with a new system, and no one here is predicting confidently when or how it will end.
The Republican-controlled state House of Representatives passed a bill three weeks ago that would have established a 3.5 percent income tax. The state Senate, which turned majority-Democrat last November for the first time since 1912, passed its own version late last month, but the House backtracked last Tuesday and rejected the Senate version.
The Democratic Governor, Jeanne Shaheen, true to her pledge to resist sweeping new taxes, has vowed to veto any income tax -- a veto that is not likely to be overridden. And teachers are beginning to receive warning slips that their jobs may be in question next fall.
But one fact has emerged clearly from the muddle: New Hampshire no longer seems such a granite monolith of anti-tax sentiment.
It is one of only two states without an income or sales tax. (The other is Alaska, which is considering an income tax proposal of its own.) But the school-financing issue has brought out signs that the "Live Free or Die" sentiment that is emblazoned on New Hampshire's license plates, and that has long influenced the state's first-in-the-nation Presidential primary, may be mellowing.
"I don't want to exaggerate the changes," said John Camobreco, an assistant professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire who specializes in state politics. "But there are significantly more people, I think, who sort of see that whole 'pledge' and the whole anti-income tax thing as sort of antiquated."
The "pledge" embodies the essence of New Hampshire's anti-tax sentiment. For state politicians, it is the pledge to oppose any sales or income tax, and most candidates have taken the pledge since the state's largest newspaper, the conservative Manchester Union Leader, began insisting on it in 1972.
Presidential contenders here are prodded to make a parallel Federal commitment to low taxes, and New Hampshire's tax phobia thus translates into a national advantage for anti-tax candidates.
But the pledge has come under such a heavy attack as the Statehouse strives to solve its school-financing conundrum that even a Republican State Senator, James Squires, was quoted in The Union Leader today as saying that the pledge "stifles our thinking and diminishes our capacity for logic."
A Democratic State Senator, Katherine Wells Wheeler, said New Hampshire's tax structure "for a long time was set by one newspaper," referring to The Union Leader. "All evidence indicates that newspaper is losing its influence," she added, and that "is helping to allow people to think more independently."
The tax question has also brought to the fore the voices of income tax supporters who normally kept quiet, said Fran Chapman, chairman of the Granite State Taxpayers Inc., a taxpayers' organization.
"What's happened is some people were scared to talk about it, and now they're saying, 'Let's get out there and do it,' " Mr. Chapman said.
What happened to spur this debate is a decision by the state Supreme Court in 1997 that the system of paying for public schools almost entirely local, with spending-per-pupil varying significantly from town to town, was unconstitutional.
The decision threw this state of 1.2 million people into the kind of dilemma that about 30 other states have faced. New Hampshire is very much like the rest of the country, said Clark Hubbard, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, in that "everybody wants good services and nobody wants to pay for them."
But in a way, everything matters a bit more here, because this is the staging ground for future Presidents.
Professor Hubbard said that in next year's primaries, "I wouldn't predict a major backing away from the tax pledge just because it's almost a cultural part of the primary now and so it has kind of a traditional ring to it." But he added, "It may be, over the next couple of election cycles, that New Hampshire will no longer be able to claim that special tax-exempt status, and will begin to put less emphasis on taxes as a Presidential issue."
The national candidates who are now starting to campaign here will be stepping into the school-financing crisis at their own risk.
Bill Shaheen, the state chairman for Vice President Al Gore's campaign, said that Mr. Gore "basically asked me what he should say, and I said, 'What do you think you should say?' And his response was absolutely correct, that this was a local issue and should be decided by the local people of New Hampshire."
A yet unanswered question is whether the candidates will conclude that New Hampshire is not as libertarian-leaning as they had thought, and tailor their campaigns accordingly.
The basis for such a conclusion is the idea that the income tax sentiment is a sign of demographic change. For a generation, New Hampshire has been the fastest-growing state in New England; its population nearly doubled in the last 30 years as it transformed itself from a farm-and-mill backwater to a high-tech powerhouse.
Well over half the state's residents came from elsewhere, many from places where they had become used to much heavier and broader-based taxes. So the prospect of an income tax, the theory goes, holds little terror for them.
But a countertheory holds that the newer residents sought to escape high taxes elsewhere, and so they are more likely to oppose an income tax. State Senator Beverly A. Hollingworth, a Democrat, said, "When you talk to the native New Hampshire people, they are the ones in general who support making change and providing for education."
Senator Wells Wheeler puts it this way: "We're maturing. We're realizing our social obligations. We're realizing we can't live independently with just a barn-raising to help our neighbors."
Also influencing the discussion, some say, is the growing emphasis on education, as demonstrated in polls showing it is the No. 1 issue.
The Legislature has been examining dozens of plans for raising the $1 billion or so to pay for public schools. Some have included a statewide property tax; others have involved gambling taxes, business taxes and entertainment taxes. New Hampshire already has one of the highest property tax burdens in the nation, and much of the discussion has focused on how best to shift that load.
Political analysts expect the Legislature to find some solution in the next few weeks, even if it is only a provisional plan for the year.
Though the court decision carried no explicit penalty for missing the deadline, as of Thursday, the start of the new financial year, it became illegal for towns to collect local property taxes for schools. That means all kinds of possible complications for the next school year, from hiring teachers to sending out tax bills. School administrators look with dread toward July 1, when money will run out unless the Legislature comes up with a workable plan.
The state's consideration of tax plans has frazzled lawmakers but has provided a fabulous civics lesson at meetings and debates throughout New Hampshire, said Mr. Chapman of the Granite State Taxpayers. One forum was so lively it reminded him of a revival meeting, he said.
Mr. Camobreco, at the University of New Hampshire, said that in the end new light may be cast on the nature of New Hampshire, but it is important to be wary of ascribing major change to the state's politics.
"Yes, there are people who voted for an income tax," he said. "But they never would've gotten a chance to cast that vote without the Supreme Court -- never in a million years."

HEADLINE: Bond Market Rises Sharply On Jobs Data

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
A smaller-than-expected increase in nonfarm payroll jobs last month, in part a result of a decline in manufacturing jobs, set off the bond market's best rally in four weeks yesterday.
The bond market is normally closed on Good Friday, but trading yesterday occurred until noon. But in a special shortened session, held to allow trading after the 8:30 A.M. release of the March employment data, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond jumped 1 2/32, to 95 1/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.59 percent from 5.67 percent on Thursday. 
 The rally came after a two-day selloff that started with the report of data from National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago and continued with the report of the National Association of Purchasing Management. Both reports indicated that manufacturing was rebounding strongly.
The signs of an additional lift to economic growth, given the already strong consumer spending, raised concerns among many traders about a possible interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve later this year.
But the employment data showed that manufacturing payrolls fell by 35,000 jobs last month and were down by 374,000 since March 1998. "The employment report does tend to alleviate some of the anxieties from the purchasing managers reports," said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the March jobs data showed that "at best, manufacturing has just flattened out."
In addition to calming fears about a surge in manufacturing, the jobs report showed once again that the economy seems to be able to grow strongly without generating inflationary pressures. One of the key measures of wage inflation, hourly earnings, rose just two-tenths of 1 percent last month, the same pace as in February.
"Here we get another report saying the economy is strong and labor is tight," said James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. "But there is no inflationary imbalance." The reason, he said, is that with the rest of the world's economy growing sluggishly or worse, competition is preventing American companies from making price increases stick.
But analysts agreed that the low March job growth, which was clearly held back by bad weather and was well below Wall Street forecasts of 140,000, did not confirm that the economy was slowing significantly from the torrid 6 percent pace of growth in the fourth quarter of last year.
Because of this uncertainty, interest rates are likely to remain in their recent trading range, with long-term rates centered around 5.5 percent. Interest rates first jumped to this level in February after it became clear that the economy had entered 1999 at a much stronger pace than expected and would not slow down quickly, as many Wall street economists had forecast at the end of last year.
"There are elements of moderation coming through, but it is not very compelling yet," said Mr. Glassman, whose forecast for the year is one of the slower on Wall Street.
Mr. Fine said that consumer spending was still so strong that barring a sudden collapse in the stock market, it would take some time for the economy to slow significantly. He is forecasting 3 percent to 3.5 percent growth for the first quarter.
He said such a pace would normally be "a little too rapid for the Fed." But given that inflation remains in check and that the pace of growth would be slowing, he said the Fed should be happy. "If the Fed was on hold before, this would give them more breathing room," he said.
Mr. Fine said that the Fed could not cut interest rates because the economy was still too strong. But it cannot raise rates either, he argued, because inflation is not a threat now and because of the fragility of the global economy, with both Latin America and Asia struggling to turn themselves around.
Based on the performance of the futures contracts on the Federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve's target short-term interest rate, some investors still think that the next move by the central bank will be up. The yield on the contract for October has risen in the last two days to 4.93 percent, which is almost a quarter-percentage-point above the Fed's current 4.75 percent target, which it left unchanged at its policy-making meeting Tuesday.

Halcyon Days for Airlines, If Not for Many Passengers

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
These are truly boom times for the nation's airlines: their earnings are stronger than ever and they flew a record 611 million passengers last year without a single fatality. And they did so while maintaining their on-time performance and without a significant increase in officially registered complaints.
So successful, and yet, by many accounts, they have never been so unloved. 
 "The more you fly, the more aware you are that there's a pattern of indifferent service," said Carl Hughes, the president of Fahey Bank in Marion, Ohio. Although he has experienced exemplary service on flights, the bad has lately outnumbered the good, he said. For example, it took him 23 hours to fly from Columbus, Ohio, to Belfast, Northern Ireland, last spring, rather than the usual nine hours, because of a series of delays, cancellations and what he said was a lack of concern from most of the six airlines he dealt with on the trip.
Many other travelers have tales of woe. The complaints, of course, are not new: poor service, scant leg room, lost or mishandled baggage, incomplete or misleading information about delayed flights, overbooking and frustration with frequent-flier miles that are easy to accumulate but next to impossible to use. But recent air-travel fiascos -- the January snowstorm in Detroit that trapped people on Northwest Airlines planes for hours and the sickout by pilots in February that at times caused more than half of AMR's American Airlines' flights to be canceled -- have swung a spotlight on passenger complaints.
Now, Congress and Vice President Al Gore have seized on the issue. They have proposed doubling the maximum compensation for being bumped from a flight, requiring that all tickets be refundable within 48 hours of purchase and that airlines disclose their cancellation and flight delay policies and tell how many seats on flights are available for frequent fliers.
They are pushing for changes even though few want a return to full-blown airline regulation, abolished in 1978, and even though Transportation Department statistics show that the number of consumer complaints filed has remained steady in recent years and was just 9,606 last year. (Critics, especially travel agents, say few travelers bother to file complaints with the agency, which does little more than categorize the complaints.)
"When I look at all the numbers, I have to conclude the system is working pretty well, considering its complexity," said Dean Headley, an assistant professor of marketing at Wichita State University in Kansas, who has analyzed the complaints filed last year with the Transportation Department. "The airlines do what they promised, getting people from A to B. But passengers seem to be saying, 'We like what you do, we just don't like the way you're doing it.' "
In a University of Michigan nationwide survey of 2,000 adults released in February, airlines were ranked 31st (tied with network broadcasters) among 34 industries in terms of customer satisfaction.
In many ways, airlines are victims of their own success. More people flying more places has taxed the air traffic control system and jammed airports, causing bad tempers and frayed nerves.
Carol Hallet, president of the Air Transport Association, the trade group for 23 United States airlines, contends that about two-thirds of all delays are the fault of weather and inefficiencies in the Government's air traffic control system, which handles, on average, 21,000 flights a day. The system, she said, is inadequate to handle the existing traffic, much less the air traffic in the next decade, when the number of passengers is expected to rise to a billion from 611 million.
Still, the industry's image continues to take a battering. At Congressional hearings last month, passengers caught by the snowstorm in Detroit told of being forced to endure more than seven hours trapped in a plane without food, water or usable lavatories. Travel agents at the hearings criticized airlines for selling tickets for flights that were already overbooked.
Some influential lawmakers are sympathetic. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is chairman of the Commerce Committee, has sponsored, along with Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, the Airline Passenger Fairness Act, which would enable air travelers to find out whether the flights they are booked on have been oversold.
"Every American traveler has the right to the same kinds of basic protections when they buy an airline ticket that they do at the corner grocery store," Mr. McCain said.
The airline industry contends that overbooking is a response to no-show passengers. The number of extra seats sold is not determined arbitrarily, industry officials say, but by tracking historical data to determine how many passengers are expected to show up for the flight. And the number of passengers bumped from flights has declined over the last five years, according to the Transportation Department -- to 44,797 passengers last year (or 0.87 for every 10,000 passengers) from 60,636 in 1994 (1.27 per 10,000).
There is similar legislation being pushed in the House by Representative Bud Shuster, a Pennsylvania Republican and chairman of the House Transportation Committee. Mr. Gore has also proposed "passenger rights" legislation. Among other things, the proposals would require airlines to tell passengers when and why flights are delayed, canceled or diverted to another airport and to provide information about all fares, including fares offered through E-mail and on Web sites.
The Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based research group, estimated that the proposed measure could cost airlines $6 billion in lost revenues and would result in higher fares, lower industry efficiency and customer service. The industry earned $5.1 billion last year.
Privately, airlines executives contend that the measures are in large part a product of political posturing, as officials seek to gain exposure and win votes from disgruntled air travelers.
Nonetheless, the airlines' trade group, the Air Transport Association, acknowledges that the industry needs to burnish its image. It recently pledged to make efforts to see that passengers get timely and accurate information about flight delays and cancellations, and that travelers be quoted the lowest fare available for which they qualify.
"We're definitely responding," said David Fuscus, a spokesman for the trade group, "as you tend to do when you have the Vice President and the head of the Senate and House committees that oversee your industry making suggestions."
Pledges and statistics, however, may not be enough to assuage some passengers.
"Regardless of what airlines or what time I fly between New York and Los Angeles," said Leslie Goldman, a book editor in Manhattan who flies regularly, "there's always a long, long wait to get to the terminal after we land."
Ihor Chyzowycg, a soccer coach in Cincinnati, was with other coaches on a plane set to fly to Florida when the flight was canceled. "People at the gate told us the weather there was too bad to land, but didn't say why we were boarded and taxied out to the runway in the first place," he said. "And after we sat in the airport an hour, they reboarded us on another plane, and off we went without any more talk about the weather."
Those kinds of experiences have fueled suspicion that the weather and mechanical trouble are often excuses to cancel lightly filled flights, or to double up on later flights. Airlines vehemently deny they do that, saying even a single cancellation ripples throughout the system and is therefore more costly than flying a nearly empty plane.
Such suspicions are likely to linger, as long as airports are crowded and airplanes are cramped, some experts say. "There seems to be a new level of expectations," noted Professor Headley of Wichita State, "and it isn't sinking in to the airline industry."
"For as good as air service is, the airlines have to understand that perception is reality."

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate In U.S. Hits 29-Year Low

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
The nation's jobless rate dropped in March to its lowest level in 29 years, the Labor Department reported yesterday, falling from 4.4 percent in February to 4.2 percent in the latest of many signs that the labor market in the United States remains remarkably robust.
But in a break from the feverish hiring of the last three years, American companies added far fewer new workers to their payrolls last month than had been typical lately. 
 After creating nearly 300,000 additional jobs in February, employers expanded payrolls by a mere 46,000 in March when a burst of cold weather held down the usual seasonal upswing in hiring in industries from construction and landscaping to fast food. Still, hiring was nearly as strong as ever in most of the vast service economy.
Indeed, for workers, particularly those at the bottom of the economic ladder, the recent experience with sustained low unemployment -- the jobless rate has been at or below 4.5 percent for nearly a year -- has clearly started to deliver some solid benefits. The 30-year trend that has depressed pay and job opportunities the most for the least educated and the least skilled seems to have been stopped dead in its tracks, at least for now.
"What's really exciting about this report is that our policies are working well for the people who need it the most," said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. "We haven't just touched them, we've literally propelled them into the new economy."
In a striking turnaround, the jobless rate among high school dropouts fell to 6.1 percent in March, from 7.5 percent in February. A one-month change is not necessarily reliable, but that is now half the jobless rate that dropouts faced in 1992.
The unemployment rate for those with only a high school degree -- 3.4 percent -- now resembles what used to be typical for college graduates.
"A lot of people who used to be hiring college grads are setting their sights lower," said David Wyss, chief economist at DRI McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. "Or if they were hiring high school grads, they're saying, 'I can get by with a high school dropout.' "
Minorities are benefiting enormously from the heavy demand for workers. Last month, for example, joblessness among Hispanic workers fell to 5.8 percent, the lowest level since the Labor Department began compiling statistics separately on the group in the early 1970's. "The fastest-growing population is taking real advantage of this fast-growing economy," Ms. Herman said.
The rate for blacks was 8.1 percent, close to the historic lows reached a couple of months ago. By comparison, the jobless rate for whites was 3.6 percent.
To be sure, the unemployment rate fell in March largely because of a sharp contraction in the labor force. (The unemployment rate is calculated from data gathered from a survey of households, different from the payroll statistics collected from employers.) But the labor force had been growing about 50 percent faster than its long-term trend of about 1 percent a year and seemed simply to have fallen back in line with the long-term pattern in March.
For investors, the pause in job creation came as a reassuring hint that economic growth was cooling from the superhot 6 percent rate at the end of last year to a more sustainable pace. That makes it less likely that inflation might speed up or that the Federal Reserve would be tempted to raise interest rates.
The stock market was closed yesterday for Good Friday, but the bond market, in abbreviated trading, registered its relief by pushing the rate on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond down to 5.59 percent from 5.67 percent on Thursday.
Still, signs abound that the labor market continues to be extraordinarily tight. New jobless claims are at unusually low levels, help-wanted advertising remains near its highs and a record proportion of consumers are reporting that jobs are plentiful.
One telling detail in yesterday's jobs report: the number of people who quit their jobs voluntarily jumped to 13.5 percent, the highest rate in a year and a half and evidence that American workers are feeling confident about their prospects of finding good jobs.
Job opportunities varied widely from industry to industry. A spring cold snap following unusually mild weather this winter accounted for a drop of 47,000 jobs in the booming construction business.
The weather may also have been responsible for the failure of fast-food chains to hire as many workers as they usually do at this time of the year; that trimmed 48,000 jobs from the eating and drinking industry. Landscaping and other agricultural services were down 8,000 jobs.
But Tom Nardone, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that the seasonal quirks should not be allowed to obscure the broader picture. "Outside the sectors that were affected by the weather," he said, "you had the same pattern of hiring that you've been seeing for months."
As hundreds of layoff announcements over the last few months foreshadowed, manufacturers are still tightening their belts. In March, they trimmed another 35,000 workers from their payrolls, bringing the total number of jobs lost to 391,000 over the last year. That weakness seems, on the face of it, to contradict recent reports from purchasing managers suggesting a broad recovery in manufacturing.
More likely, however, the dichotomy reflects ferocious price competition, which is forcing manufacturers to clamp down on costs to sustain reasonable production.
Service companies, on the other hand, added 95,000 new positions, close to the average of 112,000 a month over the last year. Management consultants and engineers were in as much demand as ever. Banks, brokerage firms, insurers and other companies involved in financial services added workers by the thousands.
Health care companies, schools and universities, and movie chains, amusement parks and other entertainment businesses did lots of hiring, too.
For those wondering whether the good times can continue, one of the most reassuring bits of news in the report was the absence of any speed- up in wage gains. "The wage gains are surprisingly tame," said Paul Kasriel, chief United States economist at Northern Trust Bank in Chicago. "If anything we've seen a slight deceleration."
The hourly pay of nonsupervisory workers -- admittedly a smaller and smaller slice of the work force -- rose by 3 cents, to $13.09, in March, 3.6 percent higher than a year earlier. In April 1998, hourly pay had risen 4.4 percent over the previous 12 months.
Still, with the change in the Consumer Price Index running at around 1.6 percent a year and other gauges showing even lower levels of inflation, that represents a solid gain in the standard of living of average workers.

NATO Attacks Belgrade, Hitting Military Sites
Cruise missile explosions shook downtown Belgrade, devastating the Yugoslav and Serbian Interior Ministry buildings and sending flames at least 12 stories high. The strikes made good on NATO's pledge to bring the war in Kosovo to the Serbian and Yugoslav power structure of President Slobodan Milosevic. A1
 
The attack was described by officials as the start of an intensified campaign to wreck Mr. Milosevic's military hierarchy. It was the first time in 10 days of attacks that NATO struck the center of Belgrade. A1
 
Officials said the exodus of ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo was creating a humanitarian crisis. Of the 1.8 million ethnic Albanians who lived in Kosovo, more than 300,000 have gone to other countries in the last 10 days. A1
 
Senior Administration officials said the United States would have to consider accepting some of the refugees, if only to encourage reluctant European nations to do the same. A6
 
President Clinton said that despite the continued campaign of repression by Slobodan Milosevic and the mass exodus of refugees from Kosovo, the military and political objectives of the Western allies were still attainable with an air campaign. A7
 
Serbia said it had begun collecting evidence for criminal proceedings against three American soldiers seized on Wednesday. It was not clear where the servicemen were being held or whether they had appeared in court or given any statement. A6
 
Daily briefings to journalists from around the world by NATO civilian and military spokesmen are very different from those that journalists got in Vietnam, the Persian Gulf or Bosnia. The NATO briefing officers tell almost nothing about what allied warplanes are doing in Kosovo. The spokesmen have been putting out reports, often in polemical terms, about what the Serbian forces have been doing to Albanian civilians in Kosovo. A6
 
Air Raids in Southern Iraq
Allied aircraft bombed southern Iraq. A United States military official said communications stations were hit. The Iraqi news agency said two houses were destroyed. A8

Unemployment Falls Farther
The Labor Department said the nation's jobless rate dropped in March to its lowest level in 29 years, falling to 4.2 percent, from 4.4 percent in February, in the latest of many signs that the labor market in the United States remains remarkably robust. But in a break from the feverish hiring of the last three years, American companies added only 46,000 jobs to their payrolls, far fewer new workers than had lately been typical. C1
 
The smaller-than-expected increase in nonfarm payroll jobs last month, in part a result of a decline in manufacturing jobs, set off the bond market's best rally in four weeks. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond jumped 12/32, to 95 1/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.59 percent from 5.67. C1
 
Inquiry Into Steel Imports
The United States International Trade Commission found that a surge in imports of low-priced carbon steel plate from Japan, South Korea and four other countries might have injured American steelmakers enough to warrant consideration of punitive tariffs. The commission unanimously voted to conduct an investigation. The Government and American steelmakers and unions blame imports for low prices and profits and thousands of layoffs. C3

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: OVERVIEW;
NATO HITS BELGRADE CENTER FOR FIRST TIME, RAZING COMMAND SITES FOR KOSOVO FIGHTING

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
After nine days of hesitation, NATO attacked the center of Yugoslavia's capital, destroying the headquarters of the security forces carrying out President Slobodan Milosevic's offensive against the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
A barrage of seven cruise missiles -- fired from American warships in the Adriatic -- struck just before 1 A.M. Saturday in Belgrade, the officials said. A British submarine, the Splendid, fired an eighth cruise missile at another target outside Belgrade, they said, declining to specify where. 
 The Pentagon refused tonight to disclose the targets hit, but flames raged from two buildings near the Sava River in Belgrade's core, the Federal Ministry for Internal Affairs and the Serbian Ministry of the Interior. The buildings house the headquarters of the paramilitary police forces that have carried out Mr. Milosevic's yearlong crackdown against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
It was the first time in 10 days of attacks that NATO had struck the center of Belgrade, a once-thriving capital that has slowly withered under years of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation caused by Mr. Milosevic's policies.
Although previous attacks battered military targets on Belgrade's edges, the missiles tonight struck with a thunderous clap that shook the entire capital. Within minutes of the first explosion, an enormous arc of flames soared hundreds of feet into the air.
The extent of casualties from the strikes was not immediately clear, but the attack occurred in the middle of the night, at a time when the buildings would presumably have few people in them.
The two buildings are close to other government buildings, including a hospital. But it appeared that the cruise missiles -- each with a 1,000-pound warhead -- struck their targets with pinpoint precision, leaving other buildings nearby still standing.
But Yugoslavia's Deputy Prime Minister, Vuk Draskovic, said there were "many, many victims."
Militarily and psychologically, the strikes were the first firm evidence that NATO was carrying out the warning by its commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, that there would be "no sanctuary" for Yugoslavia's political and military leaders.
Earlier this week NATO gave General Clark the authority to expand the raids beyond strictly military targets in or near Kosovo. On Thursday American F-15's destroyed a bridge over the Danube River in the city of Novi Sad, and Pentagon and NATO officials have vowed that more bridges and other targets in cities would be pounded as long as Mr. Milosevic continued his repression in Kosovo.
The targets of this phase of NATO's campaign -- first the bridge, then the two Ministry buildings -- are being deliberately chosen and timed to maximize their psychological impact and to leave the Yugoslav authorities uncertain of when and where the next strike will be, a senior Administration official said. The official said other buildings, like the Ministry of Defense, were on the target list.
Tonight's strikes came after nine days of bombing had made little progress in slowing Mr. Milosevic's onslaught against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Refugees continued to pour into Albania and Macedonia, telling of killings and forced expulsions from villages, towns and cities throughout the province.
The mushrooming refugee crisis along Kosovo's border -- where hundreds of thousands of refugees have gathered, short of food and shelter -- has put new pressure on the United States and NATO to step up the campaign, even if that means considering the use of ground troops. While NATO officials have discussed the possibility of NATO troops' escorting ethnic Albanians back to Kosovo and protecting a self-governing enclave there, those plans are preliminary, and senior officials here in Washington said the Administration continued to adamantly oppose any proposal to use ground troops in combat in the Balkans.
President Clinton, facing sharp questions at a White House news briefing, appealed for patience and expressed confidence that an air campaign alone would be able to achieve NATO's military and political objectives in Yugoslavia.
"We must be determined," Mr. Clinton said. "We must be persistent. We must be patient if we expect to see this mission through. And I am absolutely determined to do that. We have to make sure that Mr. Milosevic pays a heavy price for this policy of repression. We have to seriously diminish his capacity to maintain that policy."
The NATO air campaign has been severely hampered by the Balkan weather, with rain, low clouds and fog forcing many warplanes to abandon their targets. Through the first nine nights, alliance aircraft flew about 2,700 missions over or near Yugoslavia, 405 of them combat strikes. The Pentagon estimated that 20 percent of the missions had been scrubbed because of foul weather, but other officials have said the number was much higher.
Earlier today, a number of NATO warplanes -- including F-16's and F-15's -- took advantage of a brief break in the rainy weather to launch the first daylight air raids against Yugoslav forces. The jets attacked ground forces operating near the center of Kosovo, NATO and Pentagon officials said, declining to identify what was struck.
By nightfall, however, clouds and rain once again blanketed the region, forcing frustrated NATO commanders to limit their attacks to weapons unaffected by weather, including the Tomahawk cruise missiles that struck Belgrade tonight. Forecasts predict that the weather will clear over the weekend, and when it does, officials at NATO and the Pentagon said, the raids will increase in scope and intensity.
At NATO's headquarters in Brussels, officials said the brunt of the raids is now falling on ground forces directly involved in the campaign against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. A military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby of Britain, described a series of strikes against military targets on Thursday night.
One strike hit what he described as a support base for Yugoslavia's 243d Mechanized Brigade, which is now operating in the Pagarusa Valley, where thousands of Albanians have reportedly been surrounded by Yugoslav forces and repeatedly shelled. The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said American B-1 bombers, joining the attacks for the first time, had also bombed a staging area for armored forces in Yugoslavia.
Despite those attacks, the Yugoslav forces have continued to press their offensive in the Pagarusa Valley and near Malisevo, a city west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, that is the last stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
Intelligence reports collected here suggest that Mr. Milosevic's forces have largely routed the rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army, but Commodore Wilby said today that the rebels remained a viable force.
He and other officials also said the Yugoslav forces were being slowed, if not stopped, by the cumulative effects of NATO's raids, particularly the destruction of fuel and ammunition depots. Commodore Wilby said one Yugoslav unit, the 549th Motorized Brigade, had been "immobilized" near Djakovica while waiting for more fuel.
He said that "therefore, NATO air-to-ground operations against fielded forces in Kosovo are already degrading and disrupting" the Yugoslav military's ability to use tanks.
Cruise missile strikes against fuel storage sites in Prokuplje on Wednesday and at Leskovac and Pristina on Thursday destroyed an estimated 35 percent of Yugoslavia's entire supply of fuel, a senior Pentagon official said today.
At the Pentagon, Mr. Bacon said the attacks were taking a toll on Yugoslav morale, too, though he offered little evidence to back that up.
"We clearly are having some impact on command and control," he said. "We're seeing some morale problems in the army. The forces are clearly more wary of being hit. They've had to disperse more and are having a harder time operating in large, coherent units."
But he also acknowledged the limits of the success. "We have not seen tanks stopped in their tracks, if that's what you mean," he said.
Despite signs of some progress, officials have pressed for new weapons that would allow NATO to intensify the attacks on the ground forces. General Clark has asked Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen to approve the use of Apache helicopter gunships -- used to attack tanks -- and long-range rocket batteries to support them.
Mr. Bacon said Mr. Cohen had not yet made a decision on the request. The helicopters would require large numbers of Army troops to move into the region --300 soldiers for a battalion of 18 helicopters -- and that has raised fears that it would amount to an introduction of American ground forces into the Balkans.
The sensitivity of bombing Belgrade was so great that Mr. Clinton himself approved the target list earlier this week and authorized the attack itself within the last 24 hours, an aide said. General Clark and other NATO planners chose the targets each day, but because of the possibility of substantial civilian loss of life, aides sought Mr. Clinton's specific approval for the attack on the two Ministries tonight.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE PRESIDENT;
Attack Has 'Barely Begun,' Clinton Warns Milosevic

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
As allied forces prepared their attack on downtown Belgrade today, the White House warned President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia that he had "barely begun" to feel NATO's bombers and cruise missiles attack.
Trying to halt any public doubts after 10 days of on-again, off-again bombing of Yugoslavia, President Clinton sought to assure Americans that the campaign against Mr. Milosevic would succeed. The bombing has so far done nothing to halt the Serbian advance through Kosovo province and the flood of refugees into neighboring countries. 
 And the White House sent a clear signal that it was turning the attack more directly on the Yugoslav leader and his high command.
"Milosevic has barely begun to incur the damage he will feel to his military and police and the security apparatus by which he keeps his dictatorship in power," Vice President Al Gore told reporters.
Earlier in the day, President Clinton, too, warned that Mr. Milosevic would pay a heavy price for continuing his policy of "ethnic cleansing."
The President said that despite the exodus of refugees from Kosovo, the military and political objectives of the Western allies were still attainable with an air campaign.
"I believe we have quite a good chance of achieving our objectives of the return of the Kosovars to live in security with a measure of self-government," Mr. Clinton told reporters today as he made a hastily announced appearance in the White House briefing room.
Mr. Gore described Mr. Milosevic's activity as so "morally unacceptable," and suggested that the bombing would be so extensive that a political settlement might be moot. "Whether or not a negotiation with Milosevic is ever again possible," he said, "that's an open question, frankly, because he has perpetrated these horrible crimes against humanity."
Expressing confidence that the bombing would succeed, Mr. Gore added of Mr. Milosevic: "He has forced many of those people from their homes before, and they have returned. These, too, will return."
The President spoke before the announcement tonight that NATO missiles had hit downtown Belgrade. Earlier this week he had approved a target list for the NATO strikes that included ministerial buildings and headquarters in Belgrade.
But this afternoon Mr. Clinton suggested that the framework of the failed peace talks in France would still serve as the basis for any settlement, and that NATO -- and the United States -- would help the refugees return to Kosovo and provide for their protection. For the Kosovars to live with some degree of autonomy, he said, "will require, clearly, for some period of time, some sort of international force that will be able to protect their security."
He added: "I think there will have to be some sort of security arrangement in order for them to live safely. And then there will have to be some sort of agreement that entails the autonomy to which they are entitled."
In Washington, the Administration has been considering a plan under which NATO troops would escort Albanians back into Kosovo after Serbian forces there had been routed by bombing, and would set up a self-governing enclave under allied protection, NATO officials have said.
But today Mr. Clinton still seemed frustrated by the difficulty in explaining the mission, its objectives and its ramifications. "Everyone is trying to get their hands around a very complex problem," he said.
Clinton aides said the President showed up in the briefing room today partly in response to television networks' requests for fresh footage of the President.
The President is measuring his responses to the Balkan war and also publicly engaging in other matters. He talked at the briefing today about the new unemployment figures, the lowest since 1970. He is planning a trip to Philadelphia next week to discuss health care. And he will be welcoming the Chinese Prime Minister to Washington next week as critical talks continue on China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
Mr. Clinton insisted today that Kosovo was not lost, but he also focused on the aid efforts that have been under way there for a year. With television images of Kosovo refugees streaming into Albania and Macedonia, Mr. Clinton continued to try to dispel the notion that the NATO bombing had aggravated Mr. Milosevic's violence and prompted the exodus.
Julia Taft, Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration, said the Government had been working with relief agencies for more than a year to respond to the refugee problem. The United States has sent $91 million to the region since last year, and Mr. Clinton authorized $50 million more on Wednesday, officials said.

HEADLINE: An Environmentalist on a Different Path;
A Fresh View of the Supposed 'Wilderness' and Even the Indians' Place in It

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis.

 BODY:
On the short flight from Chicago on a clear cold day, the descent into Madison is not a bad way to begin to understand William Cronon and the ideas that have made him a pivotal and provocative figure in the growing field of environmental history.
Spread out below is the landscape of Mr. Cronon's childhood, where he hiked and camped and spent summers at his grandparents' lake-front cottage -- the fields and farms, woodlands and subdivisions, the city intertwined with its lakes, where he sees humans inextricably entangled with nature. 
 "I like a landscape that reminds one of those connections," he said in an interview. "Much as I love wilderness and much as I love Manhattan, I'm conscious when I'm in those places that it's hard to see how Manhattan is implicated in Yosemite or how Yosemite is implicated in Manhattan."
Which, he said, they very much are.
At 44, Mr. Cronon is one of the most influential figures in environmental history, the study of what Americans have done to and thought about the natural world, a field founded on the belief that human history cannot be understood without its natural context.
A Rhodes scholar and former MacArthur fellow who gave up tenure at Yale to return home in 1992 and teach at the University of Wisconsin, he is a generator of ideas that have repeatedly shaken up the ways people think about nature.
In a field that grew out of the environmental movement, he defies easy political labeling. He is on the board of governors of the Wilderness Society, but several years back he alienated many environmentalists by publishing an essay critiquing the very idea of wilderness.
He is also a slightly unorthodox member of the group of new Western historians who have rewritten the history of the American West, a mentor to many younger scholars and the author of several prize-winning and strikingly literary books that have become staples of history reading lists.
"Bill's real influence is that his work often gets translated into a larger American history," said Richard White, a Western and environmental historian at Stanford. "He has taken what is a subfield of American history and made it part of the basic literature of American history itself."
Mr. Cronon's first book, "Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists and the Ecology of New England" (Hill & Wang, 1983), looked at the way plant and animal communities in colonial New England changed in the shift from Indian to European dominance. It revealed not only that people's ideas about property shape their environment but also that even the Indians had not lived passively on a pristine landscape.
His second book, "Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West" (W. W. Norton, 1991), a history of the relationship between 19th-century Chicago and its hinterland, is credited with having radically widened many environmental historians' gaze beyond such things as forests and public lands to include cities and what Mr. Cronon calls the "elaborate and intimate linkages" between city and country.
Then in 1995, he published the essay called "The Trouble With Wilderness," which appeared in The New York Times Magazine and the next year in a book he edited. In it he challenged the environmental movement's focus on wilderness as an ideal. He called the dream of an untouched landscape a fantasy of people who had never had to work the land for a living and suggested it posed "a serious threat to responsible environmentalism at the end of the century."
He wrote, "The flight from history that is very nearly the core of wilderness represents the false hope of an escape from responsibility, the illusion that if we can somehow wipe clean the slate of our past and return to the tabula rasa that supposedly existed before we began to leave our marks on the world." That leaves little room, he continued, for figuring out "what an ethical, sustainable, honorable human place in nature might actually look like."
Many environmentalists remain infuriated by the essay. They accuse Mr. Cronon of misunderstanding the conservation movement, ignoring biology and caring too little about the political consequences of his critique. They accuse him of such sins as relativism and anthropocentrism, ceding to human beings too prominent a place in the hierarchy of life.
"I must confess I'm getting a bit grumpy about the dumb arguments being put forth by high-paid intellectual types in which they are trying to knock Nature, knock the people who value Nature and still come out smelling smart and progressive," Gary Snyder, the poet and environmentalist, wrote in Wild Earth in an issue of the wilderness-protection quarterly that was devoted to answering Mr. Cronon.
Yet after Mr. Cronon's essay appeared, he was invited to join the Wilderness Society's governing council, in part because its chairman at the time, Christopher Elliman, thought Mr. Cronon could carry on the society's tradition of fostering original thinking about wilderness while also nudging the environmental movement forward.
"The point is, we're so implicated in nature that you can't just stop now," said Michael Pollan, an author who writes frequently on environmental topics and who admires Mr. Cronon's work. "Once you've changed the world, you have a responsibility to stay involved. Then the issues get much harder: How do you weed a wilderness? Do you encourage fire? Do you set fire?
"You get into all these gray areas where Bill is happy to go and that I find very exciting to think about. But most environmentalists, who may be shrewder politically than we are, know that it's a very hard place to go, and you're going to get into all sorts of trouble. It's so much easier to say, 'Lock it up and throw away the key' with a piece of land."
"We're very invested in a stark opposition between nature and culture," he added. "And Bill is interested in breaking that down. That breaks a lot of china, too; it goes to the heart of Americans' ideas about nature."
Environmental history first took shape in American universities in the late 1960's and early 70's as younger historians interested in environmentalism began emerging from graduate school dissatisfied with what their elders were calling history.
Donald Worster, a 57-year-old historian at the University of Kansas whom many see as the dean of the field, recalled in an interview that when he was a graduate student at Yale, every American historian in the department seemed to be working on one of two topics, Puritanism or slavery. He picked Puritanism, then got sick of it.
"I had grown up on the Great Plains," said Mr. Worster, the author of books on the Dust Bowl and water supply in the American West, among others. "For me, things like climate and grasses and the memory of bison didn't seem to have much to do with the imaginations of my mentors. They didn't seem to be aware that those things had any significance."
But the field's relationship with the movement has grown strained, some historians say, as scientists have realized that natural systems are not as predictable as popular notions about the "balance of nature" once implied, and as historians have shown that human beings were manipulating ecosystems as far back as any record or evidence extends.
"Virtually all early environmental historians considered themselves environmentalists," Mr. White said. "Most still do. But precisely because so much environmental history is pointing out the problems with naive ideas about nature and untouched pristine lands, there has come to be a sense that we're not fully to be trusted. And I guess in some sense we aren't."
A tall man with a youthful lope, angular face and preference for well-worn flannel shirts, William Cronon grew up mostly in Madison. From his father, E. David Cronon, a political historian and former dean at the university, he inherited his historian's predilection for asking, upon encountering almost anything, how it got to be the way it is.
From his mother, Jean Cronon, he says he acquired a passion for nature. He remembers an endless series of nature activities, like rock collecting, instigated by her, and a fifth-grade vacation in the family station wagon, circumnavigating the West from the Grand Canyon to the Black Hills, that was one of the formative experiences of his life.
"My father's library is full of biographical books, which is typical of scholars of his generation," Mr. Cronon said one afternoon, his legs dangling over the arm of a chair in a campus office. "Whereas the dominant thing that operates in my mind is landscape. I think in maps, actually. I tend to ask how these places came to be the way they are."
One of his earliest research projects occurred in his junior year in high school. Using original land records from the 1830's, he reconstructed the presettlement vegetation of a Wisconsin county. "I was just endlessly fascinated by the notion that a landscape is a palimpsest, these layers that can be peeled off," he said.
He entered the University of Wisconsin as an undergraduate thinking he might be a quantitative plant ecologist or a novelist; drifted toward geology; alighted in medieval studies; won a Rhodes scholarship to study Old English and Old Norse, and then, in his senior year at Wisconsin, walked into a course on the history of the American West, taught with an environmental focus, that convinced him that would be his field.
He spent his two years at Oxford doing a research project on Coventry and how shifts in energy consumption affected this English town's social life and political economy. His paper earned him a Ph.D. Then he headed off to Yale to study with Howard Lamar, at that time the best-known graduate teacher of Western history.
For his dissertation topic, he chose Chicago. Feeling he had failed in Coventry to look at the coal fields that had given the town its economic life, he decided to study the interaction between Chicago and its hinterland over a long sweep of time, and the environmental and economic links that arose.
Then Mr. Lamar became the dean of Yale College, creating an opening on the faculty for a Western historian. Though only a graduate student, Mr. Cronon got the job. He was 27. He received tenure in 1988 before completing his dissertation, having already published "Changes in the Land," which had begun as a paper for a seminar during his first year at Yale.
In 1992, a year after the publication of the ground-breaking "Nature's Metropolis," Mr. Cronon accepted his current job as a professor of history, geography and environmental studies. He and his wife, Nancy Fey, returned home to raise their two children near their grandparents and to settle in the part of the world that has so profoundly shaped Mr. Cronon's thinking.
Passing through O'Hare Airport around the same time, Richard White, the Stanford historian, recalls having noticed a businessman beside a baggage-claim carousel reading "Nature's Metropolis." He remembers thinking, "What I would give to have a guy like that reading one of my books."

The first quarter was not a period of substantial turmoil in world markets, with one notable exception. Brazil's devaluation of its currency touched off a panic in emerging markets. Unlike the 1998 Russian debt crisis and the 1997 Asian currency crisis, Brazil's crisis was shorter lived. It quickly bounced back, spurred largely by the naming of Arminio Fraga as its new central banker and the Government's adoption of a credible economic restructuring program.
 Mexico, after an initial dip caused by Brazil's problems, ended up strongly as investors increasingly tied its long-term prospects to those of the United States economy. 
 In Europe, many markets had good, if unspectacular results, but Germany suffered the lingering effects of Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine's tax-reform program, which was passed by the German legislature after the embattled minister resigned in mid-March.
 In Asia, markets continued their slow recoveries from the problems of 1997, with Japan posting some of the best results. Analysts said that announcements of several high-profile corporate revampings, and the greatest willingness of the Government to take active steps to fix some of the country's economic problems, convinced foreign investors that Japan may be on the verge of a turnaround.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property /New Jersey;
In Piscataway, a Central Laundry for Region Hiltons

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY

 BODY:
THE squat, yellowish green building looks much the same as any of its neighbors at the Rutgers Industrial Park in this Middlesex County township. But the 100,000-square-foot building's interior is distinct from all others.
The 25-foot-high ceiling is covered with a maze of tracks from which big blue canvas bags filled with laundry hang. And lining the floor are seven washing machines -- three of them giant stainless steel tubes called tunnel washers -- dryers, conveyor belts and an army of gadgets that sort, pick, iron and fold 90,000 pounds of towels, sheets and pillow cases during the plant's 10-hour day. 
 Meritex L.L.C., a Piscataway-based commercial laundry operator, in partnership with Hilton Hotels, transformed 73,000 square feet of the building into a computerized central laundry. It runs its operation exclusively for Hilton, servicing eight of its lodgings totaling 6,400 rooms in New York and New Jersey.
The plant, which opened last September and is a first for Hilton, will handle 30 million pounds of laundry this year. Eventually, it could be expanded to fill the entire building and handle 50 million pounds of laundry a year, servicing 3,000 additional rooms for four to eight more Hilton hotels in Pennsylvania and Connecticut, as well as some hotels in all four states that have franchise agreements with Hilton.
"It's a simple concept," said Dan Oberlander, a partner at Meritex with Don Pertl, a laundry consultant. "Take a cluster of hotels in a concentrated geographical area, determine their needs and meet them through a centralized laundry that on a collective basis could significantly lower costs."
Equipped with $10 million in the latest technology and machinery -- including the giant washers, each of which does 110 pounds of laundry every 2.5 minutes, the laundry is believed to be one of the most automated in the nation. The plant's general manager, Peter J. Botbyl, sits at a computer in his glass-walled office high above the laundry, controlling the entire operation and its staff of 135.
George Nesson, Hilton's vice president of engineering and housekeeping, said the central laundry would save his company about $1 million a year. The space left behind by the on-site laundries has been or will be converted to alternative uses to generate additional revenue, he said.
For example, Mr. Nesson said, at the 2,041-room New York Hilton, on the Avenue of Americas between 53d and 54th Streets in Manhattan, the company, as part of renovating the hotel, is relocating its administrative offices to the former laundry space in the basement. In turn, he said, it is reconfiguring its current administrative offices to create more meeting rooms and converting existing meeting rooms to additional guest rooms. Mr. Nesson added that Hilton was considering replicating the concept elsewhere in the country where it has a large number of rooms in one location.
Capturing space to create "additional rooms at a reasonable cost is an advantage in today's hotel market," especially in areas where construction and real estate costs are high, said John A. Fox, senior vice president at PKF, a Manhattan-based hotel and real estate consulting firm. In Manhattan, for example, renovating existing space costs $25,000 to $50,000 a room, compared with $250,000 to $300,000 for building a room in a new hotel, he said.
Off-site laundries have gained in appeal in recent years as hotels search for ways to maximize space and minimize costs.
Arthur B. Adler, managing director of the lodging and leisure group at Sonnenblick-Goldman, a real estate investment bank in Manhattan, said in-house laundries could be inefficient and costly to many hotels. "Most hotels are outsourcing their laundry to commercial operators because of the economy of scale that provides," he said. "But creating an off-site laundry is another step in the evolution."
Also stoking the trend are technological advances that have made such laundries more efficient. Moreover, large hotel chains, buoyed by the strong lodging market in the nation in general -- and in New York City in particular -- are on a growth spree.
AT the end of 1998 the occupancy rate for hotels in the nation was 64 percent, virtually unchanged from the year before, while the rate for New York City rose by 1.5 percent to 81.3 percent, according to Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn., which tracks the market for hotel companies nationwide. At the same time, average daily room rates increased by 4.4 percent to $78.62 in the nation, and by 9.1 percent to $180.01 in New York City.
Against that backdrop large hotel chains must find "creative ways" to enhance their profits, said Daniel H. Lesser, senior director of the hospitality group at the Manhattan office of Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage. Consolidating laundry operations to reduce redundancy in employment and services is one way to do that, he said
Next year Hilton, as part of its overall expansion, plans to open or have in construction 200 of its "mid-market," 90- to 250-room Garden Inns nationwide, including some in the New York region.
And Marriott plans to open nine hotels this year with a total of 1,500 rooms in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In anticipation of its growth the company is doubling to 100,000 square feet the space in the laundry it has operated since 1985 in an industrial building in Edison, N.J.
When the expansion is completed in July the Edison plant -- which now does 35 million pounds of laundry a year, servicing 9,000 guest rooms in 17 of the Washington-based chain's hotels in those three states -- will handle 50 million pounds of laundry annually from a total of 14,000 guest rooms. Marriott also operates two central laundries on the West Coast.
Steven J. Samson, director of operating supplies and standards at Marriott, said his company was considering opening other off-site laundries in major markets where it has a substantial presence. "We get increased productivity and quality at less cost," he said, adding that those benefits were enhanced in markets where "the cost of real estate is an issue."
Starwood Hotels and Resorts in White Plains, which last year acquired the Sheraton and Westin chains, among others, is exploring ways to either centralize its laundry operations in one hotel or create an off-site laundry. The acquisitions pushed the number of hotels Starwood owns and manages nationally to 430 from 100.
"It's absolutely clear that in areas where we have six or seven hotels it pays to centralize our laundry because with the higher volume we can reduce costs," said James Gallagher, a company spokesman. "In this business scale matters."
Mr. Oberlander of Meritex said the Piscataway laundry would not work as effectively with fewer than 5,000 rooms. He added that the "plant is more efficient than the sum total of the previous laundry operations" at the eight Hilton hotels, which either sent out laundry or did it in house.
Off-site laundries are not without problems, warned Andrienne Grizzell, chief executive officer of the National Association of Institutional Linen Management, a nonprofit trade group in Richmond, Ky. "Late deliveries can be costly and quality control problems are more difficult to monitor and control," she said, adding that "we see the beginning of a trend back to in-house laundries for these very reasons."
Mr. Nesson of Hilton feels differently. He said his company had explored several options, including rebuilding in-house laundries and contracting with outside vendors. But joining with Meritex was the best option, he said, because Meritex provides the technical and laundry expertise while Hilton retains control and gets to recycle the former in-house laundry space.
Meritex has a 10-year agreement to run the Piscataway laundry solely for Hilton and not to build a plant for another chain for three years, said Mr. Oberlander. "We also have a unique business deal with Hilton in that profits are shared between the user hotels and ourselves," he said. At a cost of 29 cents per pound of laundry, including expenses such as the $427,000 in annual rent for the plant, "we expect to break even" the first year, Mr. Oberlander said.
The laundry, which now turns out 9,000 pounds of laundry an hour, expects to increase its production to 10,000 pounds an hour by September, he said. "The more efficient we can make the process," Mr. Oberlander said, "the less we charge and the more profit we make."

HEADLINE: L.I. Team to Orioles: In Cuba, We're No. 1

BYLINE: By RICK MURPHY 

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON

 BODY:
WHEN the Baltimore Orioles played the Cuban national baseball team in Havana last Sunday, broadcasters and headlines across the country noted that it was the first such visit by a Major League Baseball team in 40 years.
Well, yes. But you could forgive the Maidstoners, a motley band of East Hampton beer league softball players, for feeling as though they had beaten the major leaguers to the punch by several weeks. 
 The team managed to sneak past the American embargo in early March, played an eight-game schedule on the Communist island and hoisted Old Glory -- and quite a few glasses -- along the way.
The seeds of the story were planted last summer, when Peter Honerkamp, the proprietor of the Stephen Talkhouse in Amagansett, assembled a modified slow-pitch team to raise money for the Child Development Center of the Hamptons. He issued a challenge -- the team would play any opponent who would match a $300 donation to the cause.
The Maidstoners were a little surprised at the response. For 25 of 26 consecutive nights (with one rainout), the team was in action at Maidstone Park in Springs, their home field. Even more surprising was that this makeshift band of carpenters, landscapers, artists and bartenders, ranging in age from the early 20's to the late 50's, won 21 of the 25 games.
To celebrate, the team held a party at the end of the season. "Everyone wrote jokes about each other," recalled Steve Day, the team's center fielder. "I was always the guy who said, 'let's play another," so the joke on me was I was going to go down to Cuba to play winter baseball."
Everyone laughed, but the joke set Mr. Honerkamp to thinking. The Federal Government forbids trade with Cuba, but recently has begun encouraging cultural exchanges.
"We were more of a cultural exchange program, the way I figured it," he said of a good will softball tour.
Besides, Mr. Honerkamp said, he did some research and found that thousands of Americans visit Cuba each year. About 400 or so get in trouble with the Federal Government, but usually only those who try to set up business deals there.
"I called the State Department, but I quickly became convinced I'd never get anywhere" seeking official endorsement, Mr. Honerkamp said. Instead, he called a friend at CNN, asked for the name of a Cuban who could serve as a guide, flew to Jamaica in November and from there to Cuba. He held discussions with several softball teams in the Havana area, then flew down again a couple of months later, in January, to firm up some dates.
The Cubans were reluctant to make any commitments, but Mr. Honerkamp convinced them it was to be a fun affair with no political overtones.
When he returned to East Hampton, Mr. Honerkamp told his team of his plan. "We had to worry about our families, money and the repercussions," he said. Nevertheless, most of the players enthusiastically endorsed the idea.
A fund-raiser at the Talkhouse raised some seed money. Players who could afford their own way paid, and others chipped in for those who couldn't. "It was a socialistic approach to financing," Mr. Honerkamp said.
On March 1, 28 ballplayers flew from Kennedy Airport to Kingston to Havana. The Cuban customs officials agreed not to stamp their passports.
Booked into the Ambos Mundos Hotel, where Hemingway wrote most of "For Whom the Bell Tolls," the Maidstoners comported themselves in a way to make Papa proud.
"It was pretty wild," said Randall Rosenthal, who pitches, catches, sculpts and plays second base. "The other tourists would go up to the rooftop cafe for breakfast and some of our guys would still be up there partying from the night before."
The Maidstoners, who hadn't played a game since October, spent a day practicing at the ramshackle field at Havana University before their first game, on a different dilapidated field bordering a railroad station and army barracks against a team of perfume factory workers. Both teams were nervous at first, and the language barrier was a further obstacle, but things loosened up after three innings or so, Mr. Rosenthal said. The keg of beer the Americans took along didn't hurt.
"They understood we were just like them," Mr. Rosenthal said. "We love to play and take it seriously, but we have fun, too."
The Americans played poorly and lost, but the beer flowed freely and the two teams intermingled players for another game. It became a tradition to play doubleheaders at each stop, with the second game a mixed-team event. At the end of the day players from both sides embraced.
When some of the Americans took pictures after the games, military police intervened and would not allow photos with the barracks or railroad station in the background. Otherwise the Americans were pretty much ignored by the authorities.
The next day the team played a group of electronics technicians, many from the local Casio plant. The oceanside field had been spruced up by the "computer guys," with base lines neatly chalked, the grass cut and manicured, even a "USA" stenciled onto the field. The Americans sang their national anthem, and the Cubans sang theirs. Flags of both countries were raised. The Maidstoners lost again.
"We were out of shape," said Eric Peterson, a landscaper and left fielder. "If we had practiced for a week we would have been fine. My legs were hurting. We were all pretty rusty."
The Americans brought baseball caps and T-shirts for the fans and opposing players. Some of the locals slipped them mail to deliver to their relatives in the United States.
The Americans said they found Havana a mix of police state and Wild West cow town. Though there were military police on every corner, prostitutes and even drug dealers went about their business.
The American dollar was the currency of choice. Mr. Rosenthal ordered a pastry at a Cuban national baseball game they attended and gave the hawker $3. The hawker gave him the entire tray. Some players paid $5 -- the ticket price at the official exchange rate -- to get into the game, and found out later that at the black market rate it would have cost them one American quarter. None of them minded.
"We went down there with the intent of spending all our money and that's what we did," said Neil Hosey, an electrician and catcher.
The Americans said the Cuban people, though poor, were highly literate, well fed and friendly. "Growing up, we heard all the stories about this evil country, and like the witch who lives at the end of your block, you find out it's just an old woman eating cat food," Mr. Day said.
Perhaps the least likely ambassador for detente on the trip was Reginald Cornelia, a 55-year-old real estate broker and first baseman. His conservative views are well known in East Hampton. "The only way I ever saw myself coming to Cuba was carrying an M-16," he said. But Mr. Cornelia said he enjoyed the visit as much as any of the players.
"He made a couple anti-Castro remarks," Mr. Honerkamp said. "But then again, so did they."
The Maidstoners lost two more games, one to a group of barrio youths they had befriended. Finally, on March 7, the day before they left, the Maidstoners won. Mr. Cornelia delivered the winning hit. "I'll never forget the look on his face when he turned to face us and saw everyone chanting 'Reggie! Reggie!' " Mr. Honerkamp said.
The players exchanged jerseys, and the Americans gave their gloves and bats to their opponents. Some of the Cubans even ventured back to the hotel bar with the team for some after-game carousing.
The Americans flew back via Montego Bay. "It's like the Long Island Rail Road," Mr. Rosenthal said. "Change at Jamaica."

HEADLINE: Counting Homeless In Fairfield County

BYLINE: By JARRET LIOTTA 

 BODY:
BRYAN MCFADDEN knows the streets of Norwalk better than anyone. This was where he grew up, dealt drugs, lived in the shelters, earned jail time, eventually got sober, and finally found his way back to his life.
Mr. McFadden, now 39 years old and an outreach worker with Keystone House, a social service agency, goes back to the streets regularly to offer homeless people information. He tries to encourage people to take advantage of services including counseling and housing support, and he continues to spread the word that change is possible for everyone. 
 "Since I've changed my life, a lot of people when they see me, they say, 'Bryan, can you pray for me?' or 'Can you get me a job?'," he said. "A lot of it is a game. A lot of them don't want the help. They want to see if they can get the coffee and donuts. They want to see if they can get money from me."
But the needs are varied and not fully known, which is why Advocates to End Homelessness, a Norwalk coalition of social service agencies, recently began a second survey of homeless people, hoping to get a more accurate count of those in need. And the Norwalk coalition is sharing its expertise with Bridgeport, Danbury and Stamford agencies, who are doing their own surveys, in order to get a county-wide picture. All the municipalities will use the data in support of requests for Federal funding.
Melissa M. Leigh, housing and community development coordinator with the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency, said a 1997 survey in the Norwalk area, which she helped design, found 173 homeless people. "I'm guessing that the number will probably be in that same ballpark," she said of the latest survey (its results are still being compiled).
This year, the Federal Housing and Urban Development's grant, called Continuum of Care, will be $750 million, to be distributed throughout the United States to agencies serving the homeless.
While the state directly gives some money, Ms. Leigh said, most of that is earmarked for emergency shelters, making the H.U.D. funds highly sought after, and the application process very competitive.
"By having this information with the level of detail we collect," Ms. Leigh said, "it really helps us support our cases, support our needs, and make a good argument for why we need resources."
The short survey, which requires participants to use their initials only, their birth date and several identifying characteristics, asks questions about previous housing, current housing and needs including those for drug and alcohol abuse, mental health and domestic violence. Conducted the week of March 15, volunteers from various agencies did the legwork for the survey, seeking out homeless people not only at shelters but also on the streets.
Few people could have been better qualified to conduct the survey than Mr. McFadden, a small, stocky man with glasses and a Kansas City Chiefs baseball cap.
"I know everybody," he said. "The people that I don't know, I know of them, or they know of me."
As he rounded a corner, he rolled down his window and yelled out a greeting to a man walking by. Then he turned to a visitor and said, "Norwalk is a nice place to live if you've got your head on straight and know what's going on." For the purposes of the survey, people who are staying temporarily with friends or family are considered homeless, even though such a designation is not formally recognized by H.U.D. Still, the agencies hope such information will help in defining needs.
Alex Berardi, executive director of Keystone House, said that with welfare reform and the cost of housing increasing, the number of homeless men, women and children is likely to increase as well.
"A lot of folks, especially people with mental illness and substance abuse, don't live in a shelter," he said. "My folks tend to be prey in the shelter, and they tend to avoid those places."
Part of the problem, he said, is the inability to keep housing, even if it can be found. Many do not qualify for Social Security benefits (which are for disabled people and surviving children as well as for elderly men and women), yet aren't necessarily able to maintain an apartment.
Some people that Mr. McFadden encountered on a recent day while conducting the survey demonstrate the dilemmas of coping with mental illness. One man at a downtown mall, who has been homeless for many months, talked incoherently about terrorist groups in the neighborhood that are planning diabolical acts against him. He smelled of alcohol and his clothes and person are ragged and dirty. Still he refused Mr. McFadden's counsel.
At another stop at a small parking lot adjacent to the emergency shelter, the problems of substance abuse hit home. A sign on a chainlink fence identifying the area as a "drug-free zone" was being mocked by several crack dealers nearby who mixed catcalls and cursing with an occasional deal done through a car window. Several people passed by, some homeless, all of whom Mr. McFadden knew by name. He told one man about the survey. "He said he didn't have time for it; he's going to get something to eat," Mr. McFadden reported afterward.
Many Spanish-speaking people think he might be an immigration officer, he said. Some flee when they see him coming.
Another man was more cooperative. He is 73 years old, African American, with a beard, gray hair and a weather-worn face. He moved slowly, his hands shoved in the pockets of his black sweatpants. He is a veteran and a grandfather who lost his home because he couldn't afford the rent. "I've been living with my daughter," he told Mr. McFadden, asking him why he wanted the information. "I'm doing it so we can get money," Mr. McFadden responded, "so we can get houses, so you don't have to be out in the streets."
Stephanie Ross, assistant director for the Human Services Council of Mid-Fairfield, also supervised training and planning for the survey.
"What's beneficial for the community is that we can actually quantify and qualify homeless demographics and service needs for the community, and it gives us a basis for planning for these needs," she said. "It also makes our plans realistic because they're based on actual facts and not supposition."
For example, she said that the last survey showed many homeless people had some source of income, yet did not have enough money to afford housing. "That was a real eye-opener," she said. "That showed that there was a real gap."
Ms. Ross said that 44 social service and government agencies were involved with this year's survey in Norwalk, which will have taken almost 100 volunteers 800 hours to complete. She said those doing the survey were trained for several hours last month, given tips on questioning, and taught the technicalities and language of the form. "I think that the volunteers have shown incredible enthusiasm and accuracy in what they're doing," she said.
As Mr. McFadden continued his search for homeless people, he talked about his results so far. He said that mostly he had found African-American men, although the homeless population in Norwalk covers all ages, both sexes and a mixture of ethnic background.
"This guy's 40 years old who just waved at me," he said. "He's been in and out of jail just as much as I have. He's given the state of Connecticut 20 years of his life; he's a nice guy but he just keeps doing the same thing."
In Norwalk's 1997 survey of homeless people 91 were African-American, 66 white and 16 Latin American. The small number of Latin Americans counted, Ms. Leigh said, reflected not only the fears felt by illegal immigrants but also a tighter network among families and friends in the immigrant groups.
Rick Starbuck, of Access, a Bridgeport agency, said he believed the survey would net good results for his city, which last year counted 1,300 homeless. "We had done our past work in this area by getting information from agencies rather than individual clients," he said. "We thought that this was an improvement." Ben Gross, director of research and development at Hall-Brooke Foundation, a psychiatric hospital in Westport, who has been assisting Danbury in this year's survey efforts, said problems involving the movement of the population can be changed through the survey.
He said that homeless people who had lived in suburban towns often end up in cities, where more resources are available. Consequently, many towns, including Danbury and the surrounding area, have not sought H.U.D. money in the past, instead forcing the urban areas to carry more of the responsibility.
"I don't mean to say they're doing that intentially," he said, "but if you have no services in your community, homeless people are forced to migrate to where there are services."
This year, Danbury, which had 146 homeless adults in 1993 when the last count was done in that community, is working with six surrounding towns to complete the survey, including Bethel, Brookfield, New Fairfield, Newtown, Redding, and Ridgefield.
He said that money was lost last year simply because some towns didn't bother to apply to H.U.D. "That's a terrible thing," he said. "We should never give money back to Washington."
During a recent day of searching, Mr. McFadden also took the opportunity to drive past his old apartment in Norwalk, where he lived with his family for most of his first 30 years.
"Building 20, right here on the third floor," he said. "All eight of us, and it was a three-bedroom apartment." His parents both died when he was 12. By the age of 16 he had been sentenced to serve six years in Somers Correctional Institute for a robbery.
"They believed in me when I didn't believe in myself," he says of Keystone. "They tried to give me an outreach job and I laughed at them. And I tried to do the job high, and it didn't work."
The offer of the responsibility helped lead him into recovery. Since then he has remarried and lives in Norwalk with his wife and daughter.
"I thank God for it, because without God we're lost," he said. "If a person don't have some spirituality in their life, they're lost. They can have all the money in the world."
Asked why there are still many homeless people in Norwalk, Mr. McFadden emphasized that he had his own opinion.
"People need exposure," he said. "People need to be educated on job skills, on how to deal with their problems, on how to get apartments, on how to get jobs.
"People need to be educated, because if they don't know how, they're going to be homeless."

HEADLINE: Litchfield Landmark Yields to the Future

BYLINE: By SUSAN PEARSALL 

 BODY:
SINCE 1751, Litchfield has been the seat of one of Connecticut's largest judicial districts covering most of the region from Hartland to Bridgewater. For more than two centuries there has been a courthouse on the green, and the country's first law school was founded in 1775 by Tapping Reeve, just south of the green.
But for the last 20 years, there has been debate about whether to build a new courthouse in Litchfield or in nearby Torrington, the judicial district's largest city (its population is 35,000). Until last year, Litchfield's 8,700 residents felt strongly that historical precedent was on their side. The current granite courthouse, built in 1889 with a tall clock tower, is the town's fourth courthouse. 
 Then representatives of the state's Department of Public Works arrived in Litchfield with plans for a $43.5 million courthouse. It was quite a shock. The new courthouse would be a 160,000-square-foot building and require parking space for 300 cars, said a department spokesman. All court business now conducted in the 18,000-square-foot Superior Court and five leased locations would be housed under one roof.
The new building would relieve overcrowding, provide for 20-year growth projections, and meet current standards that require courthouses to have three separate traffic patterns for judicial staff members, court visitors and prisoners, officials explained. Most historic courthouses have a single internal traffic pattern for everyone.
A new courthouse for Litchfield is part of a major expansion for the state judiciary to replace old, sometimes historic courthouses and to build new ones to meet growing caseloads. Sixteen new court complexes have opened in the last 14 years. Three more are opening this year, one next year and 18 more are to be built by 2004. For Litchfield, the project took some unusual turns.
In January, public works officials chose a site from 11 offerings -- a 47-acre property less than two miles northeast of the Litchfield green on Route 202. It is zoned for residential use. Downtown Torrington is about four miles away.
On March 11, the Commissioner of the Department of Public Works, Theodore R. Anson, who lives in Bridgewater, attended a public hearing in Litchfield. More than 200 residents turned out to voice concerns about potential increased traffic and commercial development along Route 202, demands on town services, and security issues.
In an unusual action, Mr. Anson said he and Gov. John G. Rowland would abide by the results of a March 25 townwide referendum on whether a new courthouse should be built in Litchfield. Technically, state officials do not need local approval to build new centers.
There were questions, too, about the $120,000 annual payment the state would make to the town in lieu of taxes on the new building and the state's plans to renovate the old courthouse if the new building was approved.
Many residents argued such a large building belonged in an urban center like Torrington, not on wooded land in Litchfield. The only people to speak in favor of the new courthouse were two lawyers and the town's tax collector.
After the public hearing, the Board of Selectmen voted 4-0 to endorse building the new courthouse on Route 202. The Litchfield Economic Development Commission and the Litchfield County Bar Association also supported the plan, although the bar did not specify a site.
The First Selectman, Craig Miner, said in a telephone interview that building a new courthouse would substantially increase the town's income, while developing the 47-acre property for 18 houses would cost the town about $234,000 a year above the property taxes generated to educate two children in each household.
In a separate conversation, an opponent, Kent Gilyard, said he worried that residents would not understand "this is no longer the nice, little, historic courthouse in the center of Litchfield, but a processing center for all of the criminal element of Litchfield County."
Over the next two weeks, opponents and supporters alike waged spirited campaigns in radio advertisements and letters to the editors of local newspapers. Opponents mailed fliers to 4,500 homes and businesses. Yard signs appeared with slogans like "Save Our Courthouse" and "Courthouse Too Big for Litchfield."
In the end, Litchfield residents approved building a new courthouse by 213 votes, 1,399 to 1,186. More than 40 percent of the town's registered voters cast ballots, said the Town Clerk, Evelyn Goodwin. The new courthouse is expected to open in July 2002, according to judicial department documents.
While Litchfield is the only town to vote on a courthouse proposal, many towns in the state's 13 judicial districts have faced similar problems finding sites for larger courthouses and preserving historic ones in need of expensive renovations. The state's Chief Court Administrator Robert C. Leuba said 16 new courthouses had been built in the last 14 years. New court complexes opened last year in Waterbury and last month in New Britain with openings scheduled in Danielson in July and in Stamford in October, 2000.
The judicial branch's capital plan for the fiscal years 2000 to 2004 includes 18 more projects expected to cost $415.8 million. The top priority items are building new criminal courthouses in Bridgeport ($71.5 million) and New Haven ($71.5 million) and a new juvenile court in New London ($13.3 million). Building a new Litchfield courthouse is fourth on that priority list; renovating the old courthouse, estimated to cost $4 million, is the 14th priority. The list also includes renovating historic courthouses in Waterbury, Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven.
"We have an ongoing program of repairing and upgrading buildings," said Karen Berris, manager of communications for the judicial branch. The state's oldest operating courthouse is the New London Superior Court, built in 1784, Ms. Berris said. The two-story clapboard building has a modern addition.
A tour of the Litchfield courthouse offers a look at how judicial employees function in outdated buildings.
Just inside the front door, a metal detector, monitored by a sheriff's deputy, takes up half the narrow hallway. People waiting to pass through the metal detector block access to two public offices and the steep staircase that leads to the largest of the building's three courtrooms. (The juror assembly room doubles as a courtroom on Mondays.) On the first floor, five clerks share one small office where lawyers enter pleas. There is no room for visitors to sit down.
Without an elevator, the second floor is not handicapped accessible, said Scott Hartley, a trial court administrator, who conducted the tour. In the upstairs courtroom, there are large cracks running along one wall. Hanging chandeliers provide light.
The law library is down the hall in a narrow room crammed from floor to the 13-foot-high ceilings with law books. Two ladders on tracks offer access to books on the top shelves. According to a judicial department fact sheet, the library is less than 15 percent of the recommended size. Books that cannot fit are stacked on shelves in a nearby hallway and in the basement near holding cells for prisoners.
The basement cellblock area contains three holding cells. "Sometimes, we have 12 to 14 people here," said Sheriff Richard L. Zaharek. Prisoners are transported to the Litchfield courthouse in leg irons, he said, and brought in through a basement door. A secure entrance means clearing the hallways before prisoners enter, he said.
"To bring people into a building like that to conduct some of the most important business of their lives is a travesty," said Judge Leuba. People coping with divorce proceedings, or with child custody battles, for example, "have to confer with their lawyers in a cramped corridor with other people doing the same or different activities," he said.
Michael Rybak, a Litchfield lawyer and advocate for a new courthouse in town, called the old building "a disaster waiting to happen." He has attended controversial trials when the upstairs courtroom was packed with observers. "It would be difficult to evacuate that building, particularly if a fire was started in the back stairwell," he said.
At the same time the district's criminal court docket has been growing. Records show the number of pending criminal cases increased 66 percent, to 174 cases from 105 between July 1, 1996, and June 30, 1998. At the public hearing, William Conti, a Torrington lawyer who practices criminal law, said the district's caseload had quadrupled in the last 25 years.
Now that Litchfield voters have approved the courthouse, Mr. Anson said his department would purchase the $395,000 property, complete an environmental impact study and design the building. The building could have three floors, with one underground, he said.
The town's selectmen will have an opportunity to comment on the design, although final approval rests with state officials.
Already, Mr. Anson has agreed to concessions raised by selectmen. The new courthouse will not have a cafeteria, only vending machines, to avoid hurting business at nearby restaurants, he said. To allay residents' fears about future building on the site, Mr. Anson said he would be willing to dedicate unused property to open space. And there is talk about a dedicated water line for the new courthouse, which would not encourage development around it.
Mr. Miner, the First Selectman, said the hard-won vote carried a responsibility. "It's going to be a real obligation for the Board of Selectmen and the people in the community who want to work on the project to see that it is as nice a complex as possible and meets the needs of the region," he said.
By the morning after the referendum, most of the yard signs had disappeared. Mr. Gilyard had removed the large "Vote No New Courthouse" sign displayed in front of his house on Route 202. In its place was a new sign which read: "Feed Hay $3."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Watercolor and Photography, Meshing in a Single Genre

BYLINE: By FRED B. ADELSON 

DATELINE: HADDONFIELD

 BODY:
LYNN MOWRER of Magnolia and Mike Sproch of Collingswood may initially seem to be artistic worlds apart. Although Ms. Mowrer is a watercolor painter who uses accents of rich color and Mr. Sproch is a photographer who produces black-and-white gelatin-silver prints, they nicely complement each other as they exhibit together at the Markeim Art Center. Because this show is presented as separate exhibitions with works by each artist displayed in adjoining spaces, the connection may seem less obvious. However, both artists deal primarily with still-life subject matter.
Each watercolor by Ms. Mowrer is a convincing illusion of reality. Her strongest works are images of ripe fruit, fresh-cut flowers and sundry household objects gathered from around her home-based studio. In addition to these 13 still-life paintings, she is showing three family scenes based on photographs; the accessories are what really capture the attention. In the large portrait "Eddy and Rita With Kevin," her mother's suit is exquisitely painted in pink washes. 
 With the horizontal arrangement of domestic objects, Ms. Mowrer creates a well-balanced order. Vibrantly colored hydrangeas, peonies and poppies, along with cobalt blue glassware, seem to jump off the lightly washed tabletops. Her still lifes suggest relatively shallow space within arm's reach of the viewer. The illusion of three-dimensionality is strongly enhanced by a carefully foreshortened object like the cantaloupe wedge in "Hydrangea on Turquoise II" or the clothespin in "Green Scoop," a subtle image of whites on white.
Ms. Mowrer, who studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, demonstrates her familiarity with the Philadelphia school of still life. In "Listening to Story," the curled apple peel and the perforated ceramic basket immediately bring to mind paintings by the Peale family. She also directly acknowledges the Old Masters with her reproduction of a Joshua Reynolds print of a young boy (supposedly painted while listening to a story) that serves as a backdrop for the fruit.
Like Ms. Mowrer's paintings, Mr. Sproch's compositions are carefully fabricated. He is not interested in capturing an observed moment of reality, but prefers to create a subject for the camera to document. Although he has been making photographs for nearly 20 years, this is his first public exhibition. Most of the prints date from the last two years; none are before 1994.
Mr. Sproch made two cut-paper collages that serve as his pictorial vocabulary, and he photographs these patterned designs from various angles and distances. In a series of high-contrast prints, figure and ground are virtually indistinguishable because of the deep, rich black and the pure, stark white. In "High Contrast Image No. 5," one of his largest works, the artist has taken the process even further by making a collage of negatives and then printing it on two contact sheets. The result is a kaleidoscopic effect that has a decorative quality reminiscent of an Islamic mosaic.
"Kitchen With Collage" is another intriguing example of how Mr. Sproch creates a fictive image. The photograph of the artist's kitchen presents an overabundance of traditional still-life elements carefully arranged on the counters, range and microwave. Everything has been meticulously cleaned; the stove and kettle sparkle. Despite the seeming hyper-reality of what is represented, Mr. Sproch has made a checkerboard pattern from photographs of his collage and squares of black paper to create the illusion of tilework. His work has the meticulous finish of commercial photography, which makes the artificial somehow seem more believable.
L ESS than four miles away is the seventh annual juried watercolor exhibition at the Hopkins House Gallery. Artists were invited to submit one or two works completed in the last two years; mixed materials were accepted as long as watercolor dominated. The juror was James Toogood of Cherry Hill, a celebrated watercolor painter who is a member of the prestigious American Watercolor Society and the Philadelphia Water Color Club. Mr. Toogood selected 49 works by 37 artists. Except for one from Philadelphia, all live in the surrounding South Jersey counties; many are familiar names on the regional art scene.
Sponsored by the Camden County Cultural and Heritage Commission, this group show reveals the variety of approaches in using aqueous media. Most works are traditional in both subject matter and technique. Alice Steer Wilson's "Our Home Town" is a classic example of watercolor painting; she has been awarded a solo exhibition next year at Hopkins House. With washes of color, Ms. Wilson, of Merchantville, is able to suggest a bright summer day in Cape May. The dappled sunlight and color-filled shadows make this an image of seductive charm.
By contrast, Linda Casario-Malek's "Tea and Sympathy" is a realistic still life with an unusual perspective. It may seem as if the china cups, mugs and saucers defy gravity, but the viewer is actually looking down on the covered tabletop. This jumble of objects is distinctly different from the ordered arrangement of Ms. Mowrer's still-life subjects.
"Pit Lane," by Mr. Toogood, is discreetly displayed near the staircase, but it takes center stage. The juror's craftsmanship puts many of the other artists at a visual disadvantage. His meticulous handling is a superb demonstration of controlled brushwork. This scene depicts Lime Rock Park, a race track in Lakeville, Conn. The illusion of deep space is enhanced by the recession of the guardrails, and the blue color scheme gives the image an Ektachrome-like tonality that reinforces its photo-realist quality.
To his credit, Mr. Toogood recognized technical approaches and esthetics markedly different from his own. Lois Lewis Schumm of Cherry Hill received an award of merit for "Dinner on the Serengeti," an image of geometric forms and stick figures that blends elements of abstract Surrealism with pictorial motifs recalling non-Western cultures. Her fanciful work, with its deeply saturated color, commands the room's attention. On the other hand, "Make a Joyous Sound," by Ben Cohen of Cinnaminson, is a small picture of flat colors arranged in a synthetic Cubist style. It is rather puzzling why this work was awarded the single purchase prize.
Deborah Gross-Zuchman, the only artist not from New Jersey, is represented by two wonderful constructions of cut and colored papers. "Still Life on Place Mat," which received a juror's award, is an image of vegetables and fruits with a bean pot set on a place mat that is made of actual woven strips of paper. Ms. Zuchman has successfully combined the still-life arrangement of Cezanne, the decorative patterning of Matisse and the whimsy of Red Grooms.

Small Business Success

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
The results of a State Tax Department report last month show that New York's one million small businesses account for half of the state's total employment and nearly half of all business receipts.
The Small Business Report, compiled by the Tax Department from a review of tax filings, also shows that 99 percent of New York businesses employ fewer than 100 people. 
 The report also showed that nearly 90 percent of small businesses employ fewer than 10 employees, and more than one-half employ 5 or fewer; 47 percent of small businesses -- including most farms -- are sole proprietors; the average receipts of small businesses totaled $677,565, but the actual amounts varied widely, based on the type of company and number of employees.

State Backs Debated Plan For Turnpike Link With Route 1

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
State environmental experts last week announced their approval of the proposed Route 92 in Middlesex County, a $350 million project to connect the turnpike with Route 1. The decision put them at odds with Federal environmentalists, who have said the road should not be built because of its adverse effect on wetlands.
The decision on the road, which has been under consideration for years, is now in the hands of the Army Corps of Engineers, which will study traffic patterns, economic impact and environmental questions, said Peter Shugert, a spokesman for the corps's New York and New Jersey regional office. 
 The Turnpike Authority, which is in charge of the project, has said building 5.7 miles of road for Route 92 and improving another mile of existing Route 32 would take 20,000 cars a day off local roads. The proposal has been modified several times, and the area of wetlands that would be lost has been reduced from 33 acres to 14.8 acres, while 57 acres of new wetlands would be created.

HEADLINE: Curtains Up: A Razzle-Dazzle Road Show Hits New York

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS

 BODY:
THE previews are over and the glittering cast has settled in for a nine-day run. It's not exactly the Great White Way, but it's just a few long blocks from Broadway. And where else in New York can one see so many cars that aren't yellow?
 Despite New Yorkers' reputed preference for subway cars over sports cars, the New York International Auto Show draws the biggest crowds of the nation's four leading car shows. And since it is the last of these, its displays include most of the future models and design studies, known as concept cars, that were previously unveiled in Detroit, Chicago and Los Angeles.
 The new-car news at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, where the last New York auto show of the century runs through next Sunday, has been about bread-and-butter cars like a restyled Ford Taurus and the first midsize Saturn. Still, there are plenty of sexier models that made their debuts earlier but have not been seen by New Yorkers, like the future Ford Thunderbird, the Bauhaus-inspired Audi TT, the 30's-style Chrysler PT Cruiser and the Cadillac Evoq, which heralds a new direction for General Motors' luxury division. Among the other vehicles new to New York are these: 

ASTON MARTIN DB7 VANTAGE -- This car's stats could have James Bond rethinking his defection to BMW: 420 horsepower from a 6-liter V12 derived from Formula One race cars, a top speed of 180 m.p.h. and 0-to-60 acceleration in less than 5 seconds. Both a coupe and Volante convertible go on sale next year; prices have not been announced.
 
BMW 3-SERIES COUPES -- Following the introduction last year of all-new 3-Series sedans, BMW has updated its 323Ci and 328Ci, which go on sale in July as 2000 models. Though the styling is similar, the two- and four-door models share virtually no parts. BMW is also displaying a new M5, which it calls the world's fastest production sedan, and modestly restyled Z3 roadsters.
 
CHEVROLET SUBURBAN/GMC YUKON -- Last fall, General Motors introduced completely redesigned full-size pickups. Now it is showing prototypes of full-size sport utilities based on that solid new truck platform. The Yukon and its Chevy counterpart, the Tahoe, get a third-row seat -- to compete better with the Ford Expedition -- and side air bags. Styling of the bigger Suburban, like that of the Tahoe/Yukon, is a bit more rounded.
 
INFINITI I30 -- Nissan's premium division has restyled its midsize luxury car, based on a redesigned Nissan Maxima, for 2000. The interior is more roomy and horsepower from the V6 is up by 37, to 227. The I30 now offers a navigation system connected to a 24-hour response center for emergency assistance. Other new options include Xenon headlamps and a rear sunshade.
 
KIA KMS-4 -- In a demonstration that economy cars need not be dull, the South Korean auto maker showed a sharp-edged design study in the vein of the Mercury Cougar. The KMS-4 features a glass roof and a solar cell to power accessories. The four-passenger concept coupe has a four-cylinder engine, transmission-shifting paddles behind the steering wheel and a sporty suspension.
 
MAZDA MPV -- This minivan gets some much-needed improvements: front-wheel drive, sharper styling, various family-friendly features. Sliding rear doors -- with power windows, an exclusive touch -- replace hinged doors. The second-row captain's chairs slide together to form a bench; they also fold and can be removed. The third-row seat, like that of the Honda Odyssey, flips into the floor. Mazda may later add all-wheel drive.
 
MERCEDES-BENZ CL -- Mercedes-Benz is showing its next high-end coupe for the first time. Arriving in showrooms early next year, it will be offered as the CL500, with a 5-liter V8; a V12 model will probably come later. Mercedes is also displaying its flagship S-Class sedan, which is about to go on sale. Lighter and less expensive than the previous S-Class, the car is a technological wonder: There is a standard navigation system, voice-recognition features and a "smart" cruise control that maintains a set distance behind another vehicle.
 
MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE -- A new version of this sporty coupe has a low-slung front end and prominent ribs along its sides. In keeping with the "geo-mechanical" design of Mitsubishi's concept cars, the Eclipse has a machined look; the fuel filler cap, for instance, has a riveted metallic appearance. The Eclipse goes on sale this summer.
 
NISSAN Z -- Though it made its worldwide debut in Detroit in January, the Z concept car got a big lift in New York, where Nissan announced that it would indeed produce a new version of the classic Z sports car within three years. Nissan insists that the next rear-drive Z will not be retro, but will have the "design DNA" and reasonable price of the original 1970 Datsun 240Z. The powertrain has not been selected; the show car has a 200-horsepower four-cylinder engine.
 
OLDSMOBILE AURORA -- For the first time since its 1994 introduction, the car that set a new import-fighting course for Olds is being revamped. The 2001 model is styled less dramatically, in line with the less expensive Intrigue. Smaller and 300 pounds lighter, the front-drive Aurora will offer a V6 along with its highly regarded 250-horsepower V8. It will go on sale in about a year.
 
SAAB 9-3 VIGGEN -- This new offshoot of the 9-3 series derives its name and badge from an aircraft, the Saab 37 Viggen jet fighter. Its 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine has been modified to produce 225 horsepower, and the car has a new sports suspension and performance wheels. The coupe goes on sale in limited numbers in May; convertible and five-door models arrive in the fall.
 
SATURN L-SERIES -- Having survived its first decade with a single set of small cars, Saturn at last adds some new models. Based on the Opel Vectra from Germany, the midsize L-Series (for large) is available as an LS sedan, which goes head-to-head with the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, or a LW station wagon. Resembling the smaller S-Series and bearing plastic body panels like all Saturns, the L-Series offers four-cylinder or V6 engines. The new models go on sale this summer; prices were not announced.

In the Stampede to Big Stocks, Some Managers Are Left Behind

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
DESPITE some sharp ups and downs, the bull market in large-capitalization stocks plowed forward through the first quarter, confounding some money managers and rewarding others.
The story was no different for the five managers who have built hypothetical retirement portfolios for The New York Times: None of their portfolios lost money in the quarter, but only three beat the average return of 0.96 percent for diversified domestic equity funds, as tracked by Lipper Inc. In comparison, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of large companies gained 4.65 percent in the period. 
 The winner for the quarter, with a return of 4.56 percent, was Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y. Mr. Jacobs's portfolio was helped by hefty stakes in large-capitalization stocks, and he expects more strong market gains.
"I anticipate that the bull market will continue through the second quarter," Mr. Jacobs said, because the factors propelling it -- low inflation, low interest rates and a strong economy -- are still in place. "I don't think that we have seen the highs for the Dow this year," he added.
Half of Mr. Jacobs's portfolio is invested in two funds: the Vanguard 500 Index, which mimics the performance of the S.& P. 500, and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, which has much broader holdings. The portfolio also includes Vanguard Windsor II, a large-cap value fund.
Mr. Jacobs plans no changes to the portfolio, despite relatively poor showings by some of his international stock funds. "It's a long-term commitment, so for a minor drawdown it's not worth doing anything," he said.
The market bias toward large-cap stocks continues to hold back managers with more diversified portfolios, including Harold R. Evensky, a financial adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. Mr. Evensky took fourth place in the quarter, with a portfolio gain of 0.50 percent.
He remains a firm believer in asset allocation, although he said that during the quarter, a sobering market adage from John Maynard Keynes came to mind: Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.
Nonetheless, Mr. Evensky also plans no changes to his portfolio. "While value and small-cap stocks continue to buck history and significantly underperform the handful of lottery winners driving the S.& P. 500, I continue to believe in long-term investing," he said.
THE performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each quarter by Lipper, which is based in Summit, N.J. It excludes sales charges, transaction costs and taxes, because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred accounts. The five managers can choose any funds open to new investors and can shift money quarterly. At the outset of the competition, in July 1993, they were asked to pick portfolios intended to grow for 20 years.
Mr. Jacobs remains the overall leader, with a gain of 140.15 percent since the contest began. In that time, the five portfolios have risen an average 111.99 percent, compared with a 227.71 percent return for the Vanguard 500 Index fund.
Eric M. Kobren, president of Kobren Insight Group and editor of Fidelity Insight in Wellesley, Mass., took second place in the quarter, with a gain of 3.11 percent. He was hurt by a 15 percent position in Fidelity Small Cap Stock as well as a 25 percent position in Fidelity Spartan Government Income, which fell as the stock market rose to record levels.
Mr. Kobren, whose portfolio is made up entirely of Fidelity funds, said that he felt uncomfortable investing only in equities with the market at such high valuations. But given the portfolio's long-term objective, combined with the economy's surprisingly strong showing, an all-stock portfolio seems in order, he said. So he is selling his bond position and buying a 20 percent stake in Fidelity Value, which he said could be a big winner if the market broadens, reflecting a modestly stronger-than-expected economy, better prospects among industrial companies and the recovery of beaten-down value stocks.
He is also adding 5 percent to his position in Fidelity Contrafund II; he said a quarter of that growth fund was invested in technology, a modest level compared with some of its most aggressive peers.
Jack A. Brill, a San Diego investment adviser who advocates "socially responsible" investing, took third place for the first quarter, with a gain of 2.64 percent. The return was bolstered by big holdings in large-cap stock funds, including Domini Social Equity, an index fund that is considered a socially responsible proxy for the S.& P. 500.
This quarter, he is replacing Calvert Capital Accumulation, a mid-cap growth fund, with IPS Millennium, a growth-and-income fund. He described the IPS Millennium fund manager, Robert Loest, as a "New Age economist" who uses a model called "evolutionary ecosystems mechanics" to evaluate how changes in technology and society affect the stock market.
Mr. Brill said the fund was not as widely screened for socially responsible investments as others in his portfolio; its major focus is on animal rights. IPS does not invest in poultry or fertilizer companies, for example, because of environmental concerns, he said.
In last place for the quarter was Susan Dziubinski, who edits the Morningstar Fund Investor. Her portfolio gained just 0.35 percent, hurt by its very limited exposure to large-cap stocks. TIAA-CREF Growth and Income, her sole large-cap fund, which she added in the last quarter, beat the S.& P. 500 by gaining 6.18 percent. But that was more than offset by holdings in small-cap stock funds like Skyline Special Equities, which fell 11.83 percent.
Ms. Dziubinski, however, plans no changes to her portfolio, which remains mostly entrenched in funds that buy small- and mid-cap stocks. She expects the high valuation of the large caps to take its toll eventually. "I just can't justify putting money into big stocks when the S.& P. 500's trailing price-earnings ratio stands near 35," she said.

4Who Won With Technology

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
MANY mutual fund managers eked out small gains in the quarter just ended, with the average domestic diversified equity fund returning just 1.26 percent, according to Morningstar Inc.
But funds in the technology sector broke out of the pack, averaging returns of 16.35 percent. And some diversified stock funds also leaped to the top rankings because of holdings in Internet, cable and telecommunications companies. 
 The managers of four of the highest-ranked funds talked about what drove their performance and looked ahead to the rest of the year.
 
Bargains and Branches
 "Our theme is how the Internet is changing our lives," said Garrett R. Van Wagoner, who runs the $286.8 million Van Wagoner Emerging Growth fund, the top American diversified stock fund for the quarter, up 55.84 percent. (He also runs the category's No. 2 and 3 funds, Van Wagoner Micro-Cap and Van Wagoner Mid-Cap, respectively.) "People are hooking up on line, causing a tremendous amount of data traffic growth across the country, and many different technology sectors are benefiting from the explosion."
His top ranking marks a sharp turnaround from his poor returns in 1997 and early 1998. Mr. Van Wagoner said he had concentrated the portfolio into just 45 stocks, but reversed course last March, bringing the fund up to 115 stocks.
After last year's stock market selloff, Mr. Van Wagoner bought some semiconductor and communications stocks at bargain prices, including RF Micro Devices and Transwitch. They proved to be big winners in the first quarter.
He also posted strong profits from telecommunications companies that are competing with the old-line telephone companies. Among these are Metromedia Fiber Network, which lays fiber strands in metropolitan areas and sells capacity to providers of telecommunications services, and Allegiance Telecom, which sells bundled telecommunications services.
Mr. Van Wagoner has also been attracted by the content side of the Internet. His biggest holding, a top performer last quarter, is Onhealth Network, which runs a Web site that provides health and fitness information. He is not taking profits on the stock, which he says "has a long way to go." But he is trimming some of those other first-quarter winners, "not because we think something is wrong, but to be prudent," he said. "Trees don't grow to the sky."
 
Buoyed by Biotechnology
Neal P. Miller, who runs the $1.87 billion Fidelity New Millennium fund, also went on a shopping spree after last year's market slump. The fund rose 24.54 percent for the quarter, earning eighth place among domestic diversified equity funds.
Part of the performance came from biotechnology stocks. "After the honeymoon period with biotech companies eight years ago, they have languished as a category," he said. "Now, selective companies are making great advances." One favorite is the Immunex Corporation, which makes an arthritis drug recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
He also made money in semiconductor capital equipment concerns, which are recovering from the Asian economic crisis. "Now, people need more storage and faster products at the same time that fewer people are producing them," he said. One favorite is Micron Technology, which he said had tripled its market share.
On the Internet front, Mr. Miller likes CMGI Inc., a technology investment company that helped develop Lycos and Geocities. Another favorite is Real Networks, the leading maker of software that lets computer users send and receive audio, video and other multimedia services on the Web. "Anything involving entertainment on the Internet will probably use their product," he said.
 
A Cable-Cellular Mix
Cable television stocks helped propel the $526.5 million WM Trust II Growth fund into 12th place among American diversified stock funds in the first quarter, with a return of 23.25 percent. "Cable companies will be able to dramatically improve their basic cable, video and TV offerings as they move from analog to digital networks," the fund's manager, Warren B. Lammert, said, adding that they would be able to enter new businesses like voice telephony and "always on," or continuously connected, Internet services.
Among his favorite stocks are Time Warner and United International Holdings, which owns cable systems in Europe, Latin America and Australia.
Mr. Lammert's biggest bet is in technology stocks, and his biggest such holding is Nokia, an industry leader in cellular phone and network equipment, which he said "is benefiting from the growth in cellular use."
His performance was also bolstered by Internet stocks (15 percent of the portfolio), particularly the bookseller Amazon.com, as well as At Home and Excite, which are planning to merge. At Home provides Internet services in partnership with cable companies; Excite is the No. 2 Internet portal, after Yahoo.
 
Looking Beyond the Net
Despite its name, the Munder Net Net fund, which ranked third in the first quarter among technology sector funds, with a gain of 54.10 percent, is not a pure Internet fund. "We buy companies that derive revenue or strategic significance from the Internet," said Paul T. Cook, manager of the fund, which has $1.45 billion in assets.
The fund invests, for example, in Ameritrade, which has a successful on-line trading operation as well as a profitable off-line brokerage business. On-line trading, Mr. Cook said, "has a lot of momentum because people are successful."
"But if the market reverses," he added, "they might look for investment help off line."
The portfolio also includes investments in electronic commerce, which he expects to increase to 10 to 15 percent of all retailing over the next 5 to 10 years; it now accounts for less than 1 percent. He particularly likes America Online, "because the relationships and deals it has struck with other E-commerce partners make it a diversified way to get at the E-commerce trends."
He also likes Verticalnet Inc., which creates Web sites that provide information and on-line communication for various industries.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Is the U.S. Income Gap Really a Big Problem?

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
IN economics, the facts alone don't usually tell the whole story.
Consider inequality, the trendy subject of dozens of books in the last few years. The facts are uncontroversial: By any hard measure -- wages, income, wealth -- the gap between rich and poor in America has been widening for decades. And while there are indications that the gap may have stopped growing in the mid-1990's, the disparities between Americans of different means are wider today than at any time since the end of World War II. 
 Sounds like a big problem, right? The conventional wisdom says so.
Oddly, though, none of the authors who spend hundreds of pages and thousands of statistics documenting the phenomenon devote even a few paragraphs to rigorously demonstrating that greater income disparities -- as opposed to, say, the persistence of an entrenched underclass -- is a serious problem for the nation. They simply assume that it is.
So when two distinguished empirical economists take the trouble to challenge what has become an article of faith, it's intriguing -- particularly because neither is a right-wing ideologue baldly denying the facts, nor a hoary elitist insisting that inequality is necessary for innovation, saving or support of "high" culture.
The main question they must tackle is how to decide whether rising inequality is good, bad or indifferent.
One approach, taken by Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, is to ask whether the sources of increasing inequality meet a widely accepted ethical criterion first proposed by the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto. It is the economic equivalent of the Hippocratic standard in medicine: Any change is good if it makes someone better off without making anyone else worse off.
Professor Feldstein examines some of the changes that have created an explosion of riches at the very apex of America's income distribution. The most important, economists agree, is the market's increased tendency to heap most of its rewards on those with lots of education and sophisticated skills.
In addition, opportunities for entrepreneurs have burgeoned wildly; as recently as 1980, 60 percent of the Forbes 400 had inherited the bulk of their wealth; by 1997 the old money had dropped to just 20 percent.
Then there's the well-publicized phenomenon of the 70-hour work week for investment bankers, lawyers, management consultants and other top professionals, a contrast to the past when those who worked the longest were those with the lowest wages. And, finally, there's the extraordinary bull market in securities, mostly owned by the haves.
All these changes, Mr. Feldstein says, are in themselves positive, and tend to benefit some individuals without making others any worse off. By the Pareto criterion, that's a change for the better.
Finis Welch, a labor economist at Texas A & M University who gave this year's prestigious Ely Lecture at the American Economics Association annual meeting, takes a different approach, focusing on inequality's consequences rather than its causes. Mr. Welch argues that rising inequality has had important positive effects along with at least one negative.
He points out that, while the market's uneven rewards for skills have caused the wage gap between high-paid and low-paid individuals in general to widen dramatically, they have also sharply narrowed the far more disturbing wage gaps between blacks and whites and between women and men.
Under these circumstances, it is hard to believe that most Americans would prefer the more homogenous income distribution of the late 1940's, when racism and sexism severely limited occupational choice and pay.
Growing inequality could have devastating effects if it convinced those at the bottom that efforts to move up are doomed to failure. But largely the opposite has happened. Young Americans are finishing high school and going on to college in record numbers, an obvious plus.
 STILL, one clear response to increased wage inequality that Mr. Welch identifies is unambiguously troublesome. Low-skill, low-education men react to their falling earnings potential by giving up on work and relying instead on welfare and other social programs for income, an option that did not exist before the mid-1960's.
Policy makers are more conscious of the pitfalls and are more inclined than ever before to tie benefits to work. That, together with the tightest labor market in memory and a recent surge in pay among the less skilled, may be drawing some drop-outs back into the work force.
"Everybody was just wringing their hands" about income inequality, Mr. Welch said, "but I just kept thinking that people have more of a sense of control over their destinies than when I was a kid."
Mr. Welch, who overcame a devastating accident that left him a paraplegic at 18, seems in step with the mood of most ordinary Americans, who seem to feel that, whatever has happened to the income distribution, opportunities abound -- and not just for the rich.

HEADLINE: THE CULTURE OF MONEY;
Having Our Colors Done

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST 

 BODY:
WERE we filled with envy? Tinted by our obsession with money? Consumed with longing for a more natural life? Who knows why everyone seemed to like the color green so much in the 90's?
The point is, green is over. If gray is the new black, then blue is the new green. And at the turn of the century, orange will be the rage. 
 So say America's color gurus, who preside over one of the grandest intersections of money and culture. You may think that your favorite color is yours alone, an expression of your bodily humors or your inner paint chip. But when it comes to hues, no consumer is an island.
It matters who you are, where you live, and of course, what you see. We influence one another's tastes, naturally. But we're probably influenced most by the marketing messages, overt and subtle, that bombard us every waking hour like gamma rays from Planet Commerce.
In this sense, the wonderful world of color (remember Disney's TV program?) is a mysterious one, where it is never quite clear how or why a particular hue suddenly becomes popular and just as quickly disappears. Why, for instance, were harvest gold, persimmon and that scary avocado so widely embraced for so long? Was it part of a larger movement in the 1960's toward reconnecting with the natural world? Or were people just tired of the colors of the 50's?
These questions are crucial in business, because the right color can sell a product that the wrong color will kill. Much time and treasure is spent trying to identify and promulgate the next hot color. And such machinations lead naturally to questions on a higher plane: Do the color gods really permit free will, or is orange predestined somehow? The next time you buy a car, who really decides what color you end up with? What do we mean by "you?"
THE Mount Olympus of the world of color is an organization called the Color Marketing Group, in which people from various industries get together either to divine or dictate, depending on your level of cynicism, the colors that people will like and want. C.M.G. says it's blue for 1999.
"Of course you have free will," said Harold Linton, a color forecasting specialist at Bradley University in Peoria, Ill., who projects orange as the blue for the new millennium. "Yet at the same time, you're tied to this massive industrial complex."
It's a complex that's hard to shake. Japan and Europe each have a big organization analogous to the Color Marketing Group, which also has a smaller competitor in America, the Color Association.
 But where is the person so fatalistic as to suggest that color choices reflect nothing beyond orchestrated indoctrination? Wasn't Picasso on to something when he said, "Colors, like features, follow the changes of the emotions?"
The colors of the moment change in part because times change. Kenneth Charbonneau, a color consultant to Benjamin Moore & Company and former president of the Color Marketing Group, says it's the economy: During hard times, people stick to conservative colors like navy, burgundy and hunter green, but in more ebullient times, people go for brighter hues. The yellow or red power ties of the 80's were classic chromatic symptoms of a boom.
Color specialists like Mr. Charbonneau look at economic as well as other factors. Social trends like immigration and the growth of the Sun Belt and Pacific Northwest all play a role.
"The climate alone tells you you don't want green in Seattle," Mr. Charbonneau said.
Trends in business count, too. When fashion designers like Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein cross over into home furnishings, they amplify the influence of fashion on color selection throughout the consumer economy. America's car culture does the same thing for the auto industry.
And don't forget technology. On top of color television and color presses at newspapers, there are new construction materials and paint formulations that create more kinds and combinations of colors in home design and decoration. Look for more special effects, like iridescence.
YET it's hard to avoid suspecting that, at base, it's really about planned obsolescence.
Last year, The Trend Curve, a newsletter for the home furnishings industry, suggested that millions of aging baby boomers might soon be holding yard sales to get rid of stuff they are inheriting from their parents. But what if consumers conclude that yard-sale treasures are a fine way to furnish a home on a budget, and decide to buy secondhand instead of new?
"The only way to guard against it," The Trend Curve warned, "is to insure that home furnishings 10 years from now look different than they do today."

HEADLINE: PERSONAL BUSINESS;
Can Americans Give More, and Not Hurt?

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, Claude Rosenberg, a retired San Francisco investment manager, began touring the country, telling Americans that they could easily double their annual giving to churches and charities without lowering their standard of living, or their wealth, one iota.
It was a controversial message, embraced by people like Ted Turner, who pledged a billion dollars to the United Nations, and ridiculed by others, who took comfort in the oft-repeated observation by professional fund-raisers that Americans are the most generous people in the world. 
 After all, living Americans gave away either $109 billion or $115 billion in 1997, depending on whose estimate is used, or about $1 of every $40 of adjusted gross income.
Now Mr. Rosenberg has updated his figures. Because of the booming stock market, he says, Americans over all could nearly triple their annual giving without reducing the quality of their life styles.
Americans will give about $132 billion to churches and charities this year, several studies indicate. But Mr. Rosenberg said Americans have the capacity to give an additional $242 billion, for a potential total of $374 billion in gifts, money that he said would provide enormous societal gain with no individual pain.
Mr. Rosenberg's proposition: Change how you look at your capacity to give, focusing on what you have instead of what you make.
"Our main point," Mr. Rosenberg said, "is that generosity has been based too much on income. With capital for many people being so much larger than income, there is enormous untapped capacity to give."
He advises people to first figure out how much they need to maintain their life styles, get them through any imaginable turmoil and provide for their families.
But after that, he said, many Americans -- even at the $50,000 income level -- have stashed away more wealth than they need. He recommends that those people increase their giving now so that they learn to give in ways that accomplish clear goals, whether more opera in their cities or more after-school recreation for poor children. And as they learn how to make a difference with their gifts, he said, they should step up their giving.
"I am trying to convince people, especially wealthy people, that it is very much in their interest to give away much more and to create a society where they can live safer, happier, better lives," Mr. Rosenberg said. "They just need to change how they think about how much they can afford to give."
Using income tax data for 1996, the latest year for which information is available, Mr. Rosenberg calculated that a couple with $50,000 to $74,999 of income, and investment assets of $118,000 -- the average for that group -- could afford to increase donations by 21 percent. That would raise their giving to $1,600, from the $1,322 average shown in Internal Revenue Service data.
Families with earnings of $100,000 and $1 million of invested assets could give away $16,000 without changing their way of life, his economic model showed. That is about six times actual average giving.
And the roughly 111,000 families with annual incomes of more than $1 million could increase their yearly giving more than tenfold, Mr. Rosenberg said.
That group had average adjusted gross income of $2.8 million and financial assets of $21.2 million, Mr. Rosenberg estimated. Based on those figures, he said, they could give an average of $1.2 million a year, versus their actual average of $119,830. (In his calculations for that group, Mr. Rosenberg used I.R.S. data for 1996 on dividend and interest income to estimate average financial assets.)
YET financial advisers indirectly discourage people from giving as much as they could, Mr. Rosenberg said. They urge the wealthy, in particular, to hold down taxable income. Then, because their giving is based on their income, not their assets, their contributions are diminished.
Many charitable endowments operate on the theory that they can give away roughly 5 percent of assets each year, forever, and keep pace with inflation. Mr. Rosenberg's estimates for individuals are slightly higher. But, of course, individuals don't live forever.
He said that even the relatively few people who tithe, following the biblical injunction to give away 10 percent of income, are out of step with modern finance because they, too, ignore investment assets.
Mr. Rosenberg's organization has trademarked the word "newtithing" for his concept of charitable giving based on assets and surplus income. The idea was first outlined in his book "Wealthy and Wise: How You and America Can Get the Most Out of Your Giving" (Little Brown, 1994); it is also explained in detail at www.newtithing.org, his organization's Web site, which soon will include a calculator to help people determine their giving capacity.
Newtithing grew out of "my own experience soliciting donations," said Mr. Rosenberg, whose family foundation has $32 million. "I was disappointed, even angry, that people I knew were giving little compared to their estimated wealth." He came to believe that some individuals he regarded as stingy were simply listening to standard tax advice and then measuring their capacity to give largely in terms of income.
Paul G. Schervish, a Boston College social work professor who has studied the wealthy for 15 years, says assets are increasingly being counted in calculations of the capacity to give, a dramatic change that Mr. Rosenberg is helping to spur.
"He is attempting to mobilize the consciousness and the consciences of wealth holders to appreciate how much wealth they have and what good they can do with their wealth," Mr. Schervish said. "And he is right that advisers focus on income, not wealth."
Peter Lynch, the famed money manager, and former President Jimmy Carter are among those who endorse Mr. Rosenberg's approach.
"A lot of people have been waiting for some validation that it is all right to give a lot more," Mr. Rosenberg said. "I am giving it to them based on research."

On Social Security, The Good News Is Bad

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AT first blush, the news last week from the Medicare and Social Security trustees was good. The economy over the last year has been so strong, actuaries found, that even with no changes in the law, the Medicare system should be solvent until 2015, seven years longer than expected, and Social Security reserves should be sufficient to pay full retirement benefits until 2034, two years more than anticipated.
Publicly, President Clinton and Republican leaders were quick to say that the wise course would still be to resolve their differences and act this year to put Medicare and Social Security on sound footing. But the truth is that for Congress, now on recess for Passover and Easter, the news was political manna. It made the problem of the insolvency of the two largest and most popular Federal programs seem less urgent. And it provided an excuse for postponing tough decisions until after the next election. But data buried in the trustees' report illustrated why the matter cannot be put off indefinitely. The figures showed how the ratio of people of retirement age (who receive Medicare and Social Security benefits) to those of working age (who pay the taxes that finance the benefits) will rise after the baby boomers begin to retire. This almost certainly means that sooner or later taxes will have to be increased or retirement benefits reduced. 
 Next year, for example, there will be 210 people age 65 and over for every 1,000 people ages 20 through 64. By 2030, the number of Americans of retirement age will rise by 69 percent to 354 for every 1,000 people of working age. And by 2075, it is projected that the figure will nearly double. DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

HEADLINE: NATO, In A Corner

BYLINE: By Lawrence S. Eagleburger; Lawrence S. Eagleburger was Secretary of State from 1992-93 and Ambassador to Yugoslavia from 1977-81.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If the current bombing campaign in Yugoslavia fails to end the bloodshed in Kosovo soon, the United States and NATO will have suffered a very serious defeat and will face a very unpleasant choice: Do we tuck our tail between our legs or do we mount a land campaign involving several hundred thousand troops and the certainty of substantial casualties?
The chances of the bombing succeeding alone are probably no better than 50-50. The Serbs are tough and highly nationalistic, Kosovo occupies an almost holy place in their hearts, and they are led by a power-hungry opportunist who thrives in crises. 
 I first met Slobodan Milosevic when I was the United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia; he was the head of the largest bank in Belgrade. My impression was that he was one of the more promising economic reformers the country had to offer. I had no inkling of his ambition to power, nor perhaps did he, until he stumbled upon the use of Kosovo as a political tool during a trip there in 1987.
During that visit (he was by then a senior Communist bureaucrat) he gave a speech, mild by today's standards, reassuring the Serb minority that Belgrade would forever protect them from the Albanian majority. But it was the first-ever challenge to Tito's holy of holies: thou shalt not encourage nationalism in any of the republics of the Yugoslav Federation. The response to the speech in Serbia was spontaneous and overwhelming, and Mr. Milosevic was on his way to power.
Although Mr. Milosevic is the prime mover behind the murder and agony that have filled our television screens for the better part of a decade, he has not acted alone. He may plan the strategy, but the Serbian people are the willing instruments of his terror. There are, of course, many decent Serbs who decry the violence, just as there were decent Germans under Hitler, but that does not excuse the Serb nation for its part in making a killing field of so much of the former Yugoslavia. (Not that Serbia bears all the guilt -- so does, for example, Franjo Tudjman's Croatia.)
Some argue that all would be well if we removed Mr. Milosevic from the scene. Too simple by a long shot! This is not a third-world dictator like Saddam Hussein who can keep power through terror and repression. Serb nationalism is the real ruler here. Whoever would follow Mr. Milosevic would certainly be just as bad. Or he might even be worse -- a true believer in the nationalist cause, rather than a political operator like Mr. Milosevic, who simply embraces patriotism for his own purposes.
None of the region's other recent wars can teach us much about what to expect in Kosovo -- a lesson that was lost on those who felt the Serbs would quickly back down after NATO started bombing. Belgrade's aggression in Croatia and Bosnia was in furtherance of a mythical "Greater Serbia" -- an effort to add territory and unite Serbs living in the neighborhood. The purpose now is to retain a piece of old Serbia -- and one that represents the best and worst of the Serbs' history. They lost their independence there to the Turks in 1389 and did not regain it for 500 years. To give up Kosovo would be to turn back the clock.
I do not believe that Mr. Milosevic has ever been ready to grant autonomy to Kosovo (a status the province held under Tito) because he sees that so long as Albanians constitute the vast majority of the population, their desire for independence will one day bear fruit. Whether that judgment was correct in the past is an open question; it is surely the case now after the recent killings and forced departures.
Thus President Clinton's warning that, because of Serb ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, the alliance may support Kosovar autonomy rather than independence must fall on deaf ears. Mr. Milosevic already believes that any compromise on his part would inevitably lead to Kosovo's independence, and thus he would never have considered abiding by the peace agreement reached in Rambouillet, France, last month even if he had signed it.
So can he continue to withstand our air attacks? If NATO is prepared to continue its air campaign indefinitely, perhaps not. But will our allies (and the American people and world opinion) support such an effort indefinitely? Probably not. It may, therefore, be a question of who gives up first. Since our bombing has rallied the Serb nation behind Mr. Milosevic, he is playing with a strong hand.
Even if Mr. Milosevic does cave in, we would face a monumental task. The return of refugees, repair of housing and public works, and the certain Kosovar demand for independence at some early point all insure instability and suggest that NATO "peacekeepers" would not be enough to assure a tranquil atmosphere.
When the Yugoslav Federation began to break up in the late 1980's and the first signs of ethnic strife became apparent, the Bush Administration took a relatively hard look at what to do. We had no illusions about the fact that to have an effect would mean involving several hundred thousand ground troops, and for better or worse we decided that it was a swamp into which we did not want to walk. NATO may no longer feel it has that choice; if so, it is vital that those who make the decisions take just as realistic a view as we did as to what intervention would entail.
Some have suggested that we should arm the Kosovars. This would insure increased Albanian intransigence both now and in the future. The Kosovo Liberation Army earned its reputation as a terrorist group and would under the best of circumstances be a factor for instability.
In short, while we could not trust the Serbs to keep their part of any bargain, neither should we put much trust in Kosovar commitments. Serbian suspicions in recent years that the Kosovars have never had their sights on anything but independence were well justified.
And if Mr. Milosevic does not give up? Then the alliance either ends its attempts to force him to meet our demands, putting as good a face on our failure as we can, or we send in ground forces in sufficient numbers and strength to defeat almost certain resistance from the Serbs. Given the terrain and the toughness of the Serbs, it would not be an easy or cost-free enterprise.
The real question is, Can NATO and the United States afford to fail? Now that we've gone this far, probably not. If anything stands in the way of an unstable 21st century it is that very alliance. Our credibility must be preserved or all the would-be Milosevics around the world will believe that they, too, can kill and maim with impunity.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report;
What's Killing the Value Managers?

 BODY:
Think value investors have it tough these days? Just ask William J. Nasgovitz, portfolio manager of the Heartland Value fund, whose own mother recently tried to pull her money out of the fund.
 "My mom wanted to buy Walgreen at 50 times earnings and sell out of the value fund after making six times her money," Mr. Nasgovitz said. "It's a great company, but it isn't worth 50 times earnings." 
 He eventually persuaded his mother to stay put. Recently, however, his son Will admitted to buying an index fund. "Another little dagger," Mr. Nasgovitz said.
 And there are many more. "Clients, consultants and advisers are all tired of talking value," he said. "They want action."
 "Action" in this case really means one thing: big growth companies and the funds that invest in them.
 Value managers like Mr. Nasgovitz have long shunned what they view as overvalued growth stocks like Coca-Cola or Wal-Mart, trading at 40 times earnings or more. Instead, they favor stocks with lower price-to-earnings or other valuation ratios.
 But that has lately brought grief for their shareholders, as stocks relatively cheap by traditional measures continue to be clobbered by the big growth companies that have paced the enormous run-up in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
 In fact, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago researcher, large-cap growth funds beat large-cap value funds by an average of nearly 25 percentage points over the last 12 months, the widest margin this generation. The trend held in the first quarter of 1999, with large-cap growth funds turning in an average return of 6.9 percent, versus 0.9 percent for comparable value funds. Mid-caps and small caps, which have trailed the large caps over all, have shown similar disjunction, with growth funds wildly outperforming their value siblings.
 As for Mr. Nasgovitz's small-cap value fund, it lost 8.3 percent in the last quarter, slightly less than the average for its peer group.
The desperate straits of value managers have begun to alter the investing landscape. While investors in the funds are the most obvious sufferers, entire fund organizations are being disrupted.
Some experts are questioning the accepted wisdom that investors should hew closely to a specific investment style. And the plight of the value manager is not helped by the fact that no one seems sure why value stocks have underperformed so much in the last four years.
After being stalwart in their loyalty, longtime value fund shareholders have begun to bolt: So far in 1999, three-quarters of the funds with the largest investor withdrawals have been value funds, according to AMG Data Services, a company in Arcata, Calif., that tracks mutual fund sales. Investors have pulled $10.3 billion from those 15 funds this year, with the biggest net withdrawal -- $1.2 billion -- coming from the once-storied Vanguard Windsor.
Meanwhile, so far this year, a total of $9.6 billion has poured into the two most popular growth funds, the Janus 20 and the Vanguard Growth Index, together with the Vanguard 500 Index.
The role of value funds -- especially those of the large-cap variety -- as a mainstay of the individual investor's portfolio has been diminishing. Just over a year ago, investors had $2 invested in large-cap value funds for every $1 in large growth funds, according to the Financial Research Corporation, a data gatherer in Boston. But that ratio has narrowed, to $2 in the value funds for every $1.40 in the growth funds -- a result of market gains, sales of value fund shares and purchases of growth fund shares.
And the trend is accelerating. About 98 percent of new money flowing into equity mutual funds this year has gone to growth funds, according to J. P. Morgan Securities.
Fund companies with a value bent are feeling investors' pain. Shares of Franklin Resources, a big value and international mutual fund manager, dropped 47.1 percent in the last year as some of its best-known funds, including the Mutual Series funds, lagged substantially behind the market. (By comparison, shares of Kansas City Southern Industries, which owns the red-hot Janus funds, have jumped almost one-third over the last 12 months to near an all-time high, as its assets have soared 60 percent.)
BUT as Mr. Nasgovitz can attest, it is the value managers themselves who have borne the brunt of the storm.
Poor performance recently led the Vanguard Group's chief executive, John J. Brennan, to hire stock-pickers from Sanford C. Bernstein to take over part of the Windsor fund portfolio run by the value manager Charles Freeman, a longtime protege of the legendary Windsor manager John Neff.
And last month Jean-Marie Eveillard, the value manager at Societe Generale, saw the demise of a deal to sell the company's asset management unit to Liberty Financial after $2 billion in losses and investor withdrawals from his company's mutual funds. "It has been four years of basically crossing the desert," said Mr. Eveillard, who owns 20 percent of the money management unit. "If one was not in big growth stocks, one was pretty much left with the crumbs."
For all the disruption, there is no consensus on what has caused the gap between value and growth to be so wide, or on when it will close.
Some managers think that with the advent of a new, technology-driven economy -- where economic cycles are far longer than they have been in the past -- it could be many years before value stocks return to favor for an appreciable period.
But more managers cite a combination of temporary issues. Among the big factors over the last two years, many say, were the economic crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil that moved money managers to buy the big technology and stable multinational consumer-goods companies that proved, quarter after quarter, that they could sustain profit growth even in rocky times.
Growth stocks were driven up further, they say, by what is sometimes called "closet indexing" -- the purchase of the largest-capitalization stocks in, say, the S.& P. by active fund managers. Some managers moved into these big growth stocks simply because they grew tired of missing out on the market's momentum.
The rush to Internet stocks also played a role in helping growth funds, some said, while day traders -- the ultimate momentum players -- became market movers in their own right.
Low interest rates, meanwhile, allowed bullish analysts and investors to justify ever-increasing P/E multiples. Plummeting commodity prices, driven lower by waning Asian demand, socked energy and natural resources companies, core holdings of many value portfolios.
Avoiding commodity companies was the biggest reason that the $31 billion Vanguard Windsor II fund beat so many other value funds last year, said the fund's manager, James P. Barrow. "The metals and heavy chemicals and things like that, those stocks were just terrible last year," said Mr. Barrow, whose fund rose 16.4 percent in 1998 but still trailed the average large-cap growth fund by nearly 20 percentage points. Last quarter, it rose 2.1 percent.
Managers have been feeling increased pressure from fund companies and 401(k) clients to stick with an investing style, be it large-cap growth, small-cap value or whatever, no matter what the market might do. Now, some value managers have rethought the way they appraise the value-growth distinction.
Of course, some have long been flexible. "It boxes you in," said Charles M. Royce, who manages $2.3 billion in value-oriented portfolios at Royce Funds, referring to the tendency to pigeonhole managers into narrow classifications. "It's defining what kind of stocks you buy, as opposed to what you think is the most interesting opportunity."
"We buy growth stocks when they're depressed, but we're a value manager," Mr. Royce added. "If the style police were looking over our shoulder, they would probably raise that issue."
Investors are less likely to do so: His funds have generally lost less money in the last year than the average small-cap value fund.
Mr. Barrow, the Vanguard manager, does not criticize value managers who are riding high on some high-valuation stocks, like William H. Miller 3d of Legg Mason Value Trust, a large-cap fund that rose 49.9 percent in the last year on the back of high P/E stocks like Dell Computer and America Online. "I'd rather have his numbers, and try to explain away his idea of value, than have mine," Mr. Barrow said.
FEW people, of course, predict the death of value equities, which have outperformed growth stocks for long periods in the past.
Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has noted that from 1962 to 1989, stocks with the lowest P/E ratios performed far better as a group than stocks with the highest. And studies by Eugene F. Fama, a University of Chicago finance professor, have shown that over long periods, stocks with lower price-to-book ratios outperform those with higher ratios.
But this does not mean that value investors will feel better anytime soon.
The divergence between growth and value could continue, said George U. Sauter, manager of the $78 billion Vanguard 500 Index fund. "Just because valuations would point more to value stocks and small-cap stocks doesn't necessarily mean performance has to shift there," he added.
Mr. Sauter predicted that value stocks would eventually make a comeback but warned that investors should not base their decisions on when that will happen. Stock-picking "is child's play next to trying to call value and growth cycles," he said.
Value fund investors may have to swallow one last bitter pill anyway. While many investors think that the relatively low price-earnings and price-book ratios of value stocks provide a cushion during market corrections, that has not been true lately. Large-cap value and growth stocks fell about the same amount during the October 1997 selloff, while value stocks actually declined slightly more than growth stocks during the correction last summer.
Few value managers dare to predict when their turnaround might come, but they say that higher inflation or a strengthening economy would be strong catalysts. Some of them say, optimistically perhaps, that the recent 37 percent jump in oil-service stocks could be a harbinger. And others say growth stocks could underperform value stocks if the Internet bubble popped or if technology companies' growth abated after worries over the Year 2000 computer bug passed.
A turn could come soon, Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan, has argued. His research indicates that the last time stocks had such high valuations -- measured by comparing bond yields with the average P/E ratio of the S.& P. 500 -- was about seven years ago, when value stocks began a two-year period of sharp outperformance over growth stocks. Moreover, he thinks value stocks will be spurred by an upturn in global economic growth in the coming year.
And Mr. Eveillard of Societe Generale said things were so out of whack that companies might take matters into their own hands. He predicted that a wave of corporate arbitrage -- in which large growth companies buy smaller value companies by trading their own richly valued stock for the lower-valued shares -- might soon wash through the markets. The big companies could add to their per-share earnings even while paying huge premiums.
"As always, when a strong trend has been in place for a few years, there is no lack of people who rationalize why what has been true will continue to be true -- in other words, that value, and particularly small value, will never come back," Mr. Eveillard said. "If I thought so, I would retire."

HEADLINE: Volatile Issues Await China's Premeir in U.S.

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 3

 BODY:
Zhu Rongji, China's charismatic Prime Minister and the driving force behind its current ambitious economic reforms, arrives in the United States next week determined to fight the downward spiral in Chinese-American relations.
But he cannot depart from the Communist line and, in the apparent absence of any major new agreements to announce, he may have to rely on the sheer force of his personality to sway American opinion. 
 The 70-year-old Mr. Zhu, widely admired in China for his frank talk and impatience with incompetent officials, will have to confront head-on the many political disputes that have come to a boil since his trip was conceived in the afterglow of President Clinton's visit to China last year. Human rights, accusations of Chinese nuclear spying, the military balance with Taiwan and a widening trade gap are all factors that have soured a skeptical Congress on Washington's and Beijing's strategy of mutual engagement.
The Chinese, meanwhile, are outraged by the American-led bombing of Yugoslavia, which they regard as an illegal intervention in a sovereign country -- a threatening precedent as they confront possible ethnic rebellions in Tibet and the Muslim province of Xinjiang and a possible independence movement in Taiwan.
Top Chinese leaders seriously considered postponing the trip until the bombing stops. But they decided to proceed, a sign of how much China still values good relations with the United States, considered vital to its own modernization.
Mr. Zhu departs Beijing on Tuesday for a day in Los Angeles before continuing to Washington and then Denver, Chicago and New York, finishing in Boston on April 14.
Although his agenda is weightier than he had expected, Mr. Zhu still plans to spend a day discussing the environment with Vice President Al Gore -- part of his original agenda of bolstering economic ties with the United States and developing projects to fight China's severe environmental pollution.
But negotiations for entry to the World Trade Organization have stalled because China could not agree to open its markets as broadly as the United States demanded -- meaning there will be no high profile agreement to sign..
Mr. Zhu is bound to run into heavy criticism of China's human rights record, including the stiff sentences given last fall to democracy campaigners and the repression of the Dalai Lama's supporters in Tibet. Chinese and Western political analysts in Beijing say he simply cannot waver in defense of China's record, in particular now that the United States has announced it will sponsor a resolution condemning China's rights record at a United Nations meeting this month in Geneva.
Any departure from the Communist Party line would undermine the Prime Minister's power, political analysts say. Still, if any Chinese leader can carry off such a prickly trip, it is Mr. Zhu. A former Mayor of Shanghai, where he courted foreign investors, Mr. Zhu knows the West and talks with a absence of Marxist cant. His spectacular rise to power, after years as a political outcast, seemed based on competence alone and he is respected in China for his intellect.
"He's a smart leader with great personal charisma, and is very adept at using it to sell his messages," said Zhang Xiaojin, a professor of international politics at People's University in Beijing. "This trip comes at a critical time, and what he does could have an important impact on the long-term development of the Chinese-American relationship."
In his only public statements on the American visit, at a rare news conference on March 15, Mr. Zhu said, "The goal of my visit is to tell you the truth and also to let you vent your anger and voice your complaints. It is also to resume the good momentum toward building a constructive strategic partnership."
Rightly or wrongly, the Chinese feel terribly misunderstood in the United States. In the view of many Chinese, Mr. Zhu and President Jiang Zemin are bravely steering the country through a painful transition toward a market-oriented economy. Those Chinese, unlike the dissidents whose cause is important to many in the West, see China as a country where the rule of law is expanding and people have unprecedented freedom in their personal lives, if not in politics. And Taiwan, people here note, is internationally recognized as an inalienable part of China.
So why are Americans so stringent about China's entry to the World Trade Organization? Why so much fuss about the arrest of some disruptive radicals, and why the threat to create an open military alliance with Taiwan? "Zhu Rongji will try to get the American people to understand the real situation in China," said Xiong Zhiyong, dean of the Foreign Affairs College in Beijing.
However, Mr. Zhu and other Chinese leaders tend to underestimate the depth of American concerns over rights, trade and foreign policy, said David Shambaugh, a China expert at George Washington University and the Brookings Institution in Washington. Instead, they tend to attribute criticism to a small cabal of enemies.
"They don't understand that the broad masses see China through suspicious eyes," Mr. Shambaugh said, adding that a host of American interest groups, from the religious right to labor to supporters of the Dalai Lama, may all voice complaints.
Mr. Zhu is likely to be at his persuasive best when he discusses economics, an area where he has broad knowledge and unusually sweeping powers. Earlier in this decade, Mr. Zhu guided China out of rampant inflation without stifling economic growth, an achievement praised worldwide.
Still, while China is gradually opening to foreign companies and forcing its state firms to adapt to the market, Mr. Zhu is no Adam Smith. He has been a Communist since 1949, his career largely in central planning. His strategy of wringing out bloated state enterprises is intended to save the state sector, not liquidate it.
On human rights, Mr. Zhu can -- if he chooses -- assert a certain authority to debating the issue because he was a victim of persecution himself.
In 1957, as a rising official of the state planning commission, Mr. Zhu was branded a "rightist," pushed out of his job and allowed only to work as a math teacher. Then, as Mao's Great Cultural Revolution began in 1966, he was sent to the countryside in Hubei province, where he worked on a farm and taught math. Mr. Zhu was able to return to government work only in 1973, as the late Deng Xiaoping, an economic reformer, regained power.
But current leaders here make a distinction between the "excesses" of the Maoist past and their present demand for social stability as they pursue economic changes whose consequences are unpredictable. Their notion of stability means stamping out any threats to the rule of the Communist Party, which leads them to imprison advocates of democracy despite international criticism.

HEADLINE: As It Opens to Outsiders, Cuba Is Infected by Crime

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: HAVANA, April 2

 BODY:
Never mind that one robber had second thoughts and was replaced at the last minute or that another did not shoot as planned. Or that the bounty was only $6,000 instead of the expected $30,000, or that the whole gang of seven men was arrested in less than three weeks.
In the annals of crime in revolutionary Cuba, the assault on a Government armored van in daylight last December during which five people were wounded was a botched but spectacular act of boldness. 
 "I first heard the shots, then I saw the wounded people go by," said Marta Acosta, 59, who lives across the street from La Arcada, the cluster of dollar stores in the municipality of Guanabacoa here that was the scene of a shootout between one of the thieves and two armored van workers picking up the shopping center's receipts. "It was shocking."
Indeed, the high-profile caper was the kind that Government officials used to associate more with the ills of American society than with their highly policed island. But today Cuba, which for decades was immune to the high crime rates of more open societies, is itself grappling with a rising tide of common crime that has swelled in the last year.
The rise is taking place as Cubans struggle with hardship piled up by the collapse of their Soviet patron 10 years ago, Communist Party policies and more than three decades of economic embargo by the United States. Necessity now leads scores of people to steal from work places, to earn dollars as illegal drivers or prostitutes and to join a thriving black market. In rural areas, livestock theft is such a problem, Government officials said, that some people take their cows into their homes at night.
But the problem has also been fueled by the opportunity that has arrived here along with increasing numbers of foreign tourists as the Government has slowly tried to open the island to outsiders.
President Fidel Castro himself sounded the alarm about crime in a speech three months ago to the Revolutionary National Police, associating it with a creeping moral laxity and Cuba's opening to dollars, tourists and foreign investment in the mid-1990's, but noting that those were the very sectors crime now endangered. Two Italian tourists were fatally shot last September during a robbery, even though handguns are not prevalent and legal access to them is tightly restricted.
"In the fight against crime we're also defending the prestige of the country and its economy," Mr. Castro said. "The rise in crime discourages tourism, aside from the damage it causes to 11 million citizens and the uneasiness it produces."
In response to the crime wave, the Government has stationed police officers on almost every corner in Havana's tourist areas and in February stiffened penalties for crimes ranging from drug trafficking and pimping to armed robbery and the illegal trade in beef.
The deployment of special police officers distinctive for their black berets has given parts of Havana, where officials say 80 percent of the island's crime take place, the feel of a city under siege. In some areas the young officers are often seen checking the identification cards of Cubans, writing tickets for some infraction or giving instructions to drivers, cyclists and passers-by through loudspeakers.
The crackdown, which Government officials say is already working, has been welcomed by many Cubans and foreigners who have been victims of pickpockets and burglaries. But the heightened vigilance is also stifling what some Cubans say is their only way to make ends meet.
What is most notable has been the virtual disappearance of prostitutes from the streets after they have either being sent back home to the countryside or interned in "rehabilitation centers," work camps where repeat offenders receive counseling while putting in up to four years of agricultural and other labor. While not illegal here or penalized as a criminal offense, prostitution is regarded as "antisocial" and a magnet for related crime such a drug use.
In his speech, Mr. Castro, disclosing rarely published crime information, said the use of Cuba as a transshipment point for Colombian cocaine destined for the United States and Europe "persists." And he announced new, stricter penalties for drug trafficking, which this year were made to range from 15 years in prison to death. As an offshoot of the trafficking, there has also been increased drug use in Cuba, Mr. Castro said.
The Cuban leader also noted a loosening of morals. He excoriated Cubans who drive tourists around and rent out rooms illegally, police officers who accept bribes, parents and pimps who induce young women to sell their bodies and those who steal merchandise from their jobs.
"We have to fight through every legal means, including public shame," he said. "We have to inspect the inspectors, and also control the controllers."
But American and other Western officials say more controls only invite more lawbreaking because illegal activity is the only way many Cubans who do not get dollar remittances from family members in the United States can complement their meager state salaries, most of which are paid in a local currency that is no longer accepted for many transactions that now take place in dollars.
A 31-year-old driver with a wife and two young sons who said he earned 260 pesos a month, or $13, making bricks, said he could make $40 or more driving a foreigner around for the day.
Some Western officials said that the anticrime measures and policing went beyond what was warranted, serving to complement the increased anti-American statements and a law, also passed in February, to rein in the small but growing number of dissidents and independent journalists.
"There was an impetus for more opening within Cuba and from foreign countries that Castro feels went too far," a Western diplomat here said. "He's now aiming at telling us, 'No, we stay where we are.' That's rather unrealistic. The train is already moving."
Some Cubans say one reason for the rampant underground activity is that legal alternatives, like the private restaurants and other enterprises allowed since the mid-1990's as a way to deal with the economic crisis, are too strictly regulated to make them worth the effort.
A retiree who rents rooms in his house to tourists here said he had to pay 80 percent of his rental income to the Government. "You can't stand out" financially, said the man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
At a dimly lit nightclub here near El Malecon, the capital's seaside boulevard, some 40 young women in tight outfits and platform shoes milled around the bar shortly before midnight on Thursday, waiting for the "extranjeros," or foreigners, to pick them up. Despite the crackdown, many prostitutes have merely gone underground, meeting men indoors, dressing more demurely or working through pimps.
"The situation is horrible," said a 32-year-old woman and mother of two young sons, who said she is stopped almost every day by police officers but is let go after showing her identification card
"They're squeezing us too much," she said, asking a reporter three times during a short conversation whether she was a police officer. "They don't let us breathe," she said. "Look at all these youths. Do you think we'd be here if not for the need?"
But Jose Luis Toledo, president of the judicial affairs commission of Cuba's National Assembly of People's Power, which passed the tougher anticrime measures, argued in a recent interview that while economic need was "undoubtedly" a factor in illegal activity, most lawbreakers in Cuba are "individualists wanting to satisfy personal preferences."
"Those who engage in such activity are a minority," he said. "Here we have a majority identified with the revolution and willing to make sacrifices. We are trying to guarantee the safety of that majority."

HEADLINE: India Offers Rights to Attract Its Offspring's Cash

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, April 3

 BODY:
The Indian Government this week initiated a program that will make it easier for people of Indian descent sprinkled around the globe to travel to their familial homeland and to invest in it, but stopped short of giving them the right to vote, as many of them have sought.
The hope is that doctors, lawyers and bankers, as well as executives in multinational corporations and others among the millions of people of Indian descent living around the world will invest in India, or convince others with deep corporate pockets to do so, contributing to the country's economic growth, officials said. 
 "There will be a broader mass base who may be willing to invest in India," said Anin Trigunayat, an officer in the passport and visa division of the Ministry of External Affairs.
The new program came in the same week that Indian officials announced loosened import restrictions on almost 900 consumer and agricultural goods, a step aimed at encouraging foreign trade.
Indian embassies and consular offices this week began accepting applications for the so-called Persons of Indian Origin card, which will be issued for a fee of $1,000 and be good for 20 years. It will entitle people of Indian descent who are citizens of other countries to travel to India without a visa, buy and sell real estate here (except for farmland), invest in Government bonds that only Indian citizens living abroad could buy before, and apply for admission to Indian colleges.
The steps are part of a broader recognition by a growing number of countries that people who move abroad remain potentially valuable contributors in an economically interdependent world.
For the large and prosperous settlements of Indians in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean, the new card will make it easier to sustain close ties to India. Cheaper air fares and telephone rates, as well as communication by E-mail and fax, have already tightened the connections between India and its diaspora of about 15 million people.
"I have seen the hunger of Indians abroad to have their children linked to their country of origin," said Home Minister L. K. Advani, who said introduction of the card was motivated by a desire for closer ties between india and its disaspora, not for their investment dollars.
A number of nations have gone even further than India, allowing dual citizenship for emigrants. For example, Mexico, Costa Rica, Italy and the Dominican Republic permit their nationals to retain native citizenship, with full political rights, even after they become citizens of other countries.
Mr. Advani said his political party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, supports dual citizenship, but does not now have the political support to win approval for a constitutional amendment.
However, the new card is a step toward welcoming back people of Indian descent, he said. All Indians who have become citizens of other countries, as well as their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, will be eligible for the card. People from neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh, however, will not be eligible because officials say they worry that the card could become a vehicle for illegal immigration.
Since India began opening its economy in 1991 to greater foreign investment, Indian citizens living abroad and people of Indian descent have accounted for almost a quarter of the direct foreign investment, officials said.
"I hope the new card will encourage more investment," said A. R. Nanda, the chief commissioner for Investments and Non-Resident Indians at the Government's Indian Investment Center. "The main advantage is that they don't have to bother about a visa. They can come and go whenever they want. It's hassle-free."

HEADLINE: 1999 BASEBALL PREVIEW;
The Haves Have It and the Nots Don't

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Baseball people have probably spent more time this winter talking about the growing disparity in team payrolls than they have about this year's top rookies or even Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
Officials, owners, general managers and other club executives all lament the disparity and predict doom and gloom for those teams -- more than half the clubs in the majors -- whose payrolls will be under $50 million this year. The first ball has not been thrown out for tonight's season-opening game in Monterrey, Mexico, and already 16 of the 30 teams, if not more, they say, have no chance to contend for the playoffs six months from now. 
 Payroll disparity is No. 1 on management's list of problems. Commissioner Bud Selig, in fact, has named a blue-ribbon panel to try to find a solution to the problem that has the Yankees opening the season with an $85 million payroll and the Montreal Expos paying about one-fifth of that.
Players are not represented on the panel; officials have not asked them what they think. On a recent HBO "Real Sports" segment dealing with the disparity, Tom Hicks, owner of the Texas Rangers, had this to say of the union's opposition to a salary cap: "If 85 or 90 percent of their constituents are unhappy because they don't have a chance to win on the day the season opens, the union's going to change."
Nowhere near that percentage of players, however, is unhappy with their contending status. Some are, to be sure. But a growing number has reason to like the disparity because it has created jobs for them. That view became evident this spring during interviews with dozens of players and managers on teams that are the have-nots or the haves.
"If you're going to have a team in that predicament, they're going to have a lot of young guys who are glad to have a chance of playing," said Kevin Brown, whose $105 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers magnified the disparity. "They're getting a chance to get their foot in the door and start their big league careers. It's hard to damn that situation. It's produced a lot of good players."
Furthermore, players even on low-paid teams refuse to begin a season feeling beaten. "If you're a major leaguer, you shouldn't be coming into a clubhouse at the beginning of the season saying you don't have a chance," said Dustin Hermanson of Montreal. "If you do, you shouldn't be in the major leagues. I believe in Cinderella stories."
Other players do see the problem that management officials and fans see. "The disparity is definitely ridiculous," said Ed Sprague, Pittsburgh's veteran third baseman. "The number of teams with a legitimate shot every year is shrinking. Something needs to be done. I think players are starting to realize that. I don't think the playing field should be totally equal. But I think the disparity needs to shrink a little bit. I don't think you can have a team with a $90 million payroll and one with a $10 million payroll. That's not a healthy industry."
The players who expressed Sprague's view, though, generally also said they felt the owners were the ones who should devise a solution. And while they were at it, they said the owners shouldn't bother proposing any kind of a payroll cap. The last such suggestion led to a labor dispute that nearly killed the game.
In the winterlong anguish over disparity, though, no one had considered the benefits some of the players and managers discussed.
Mike Maddux, a veteran relief pitcher with the Expos, who have the major leagues' lowest payroll, has seen first-hand the point Brown made. His teammates, Maddux said, don't feel deprived of a chance to win.
"I don't think that's a factor for anyone here," he said one day in Jupiter, Fla. "You have young guys trying to establish themselves. They get their time in. In the past, Montreal has been a feeder for other clubs. A lot of guys see that here and use it as an apprenticeship."
Tom Kelly and Tony Muser, managers of two economically challenged teams, use the system as motivation for their young players.
"I told the players what an avenue that has opened up for you," said Kelly, who has 10 rookies among his 25 Minnesota players. "It's a wonderful avenue to drive down. They're not stupid. They see a chance here to play in the big leagues."
Todd Walker, the Twins' second baseman, is good enough that he would have won a job in the majors under any system, but he acknowledged the break young players get with teams like the Twins.
"We as players consider it a blessing just to be in the big leagues and have an opportunity to play," the third-year player said. "You'd like to make the playoffs and win some championship games, but we don't count ourselves out based on economics."
Muser, the Kansas City manager, said he has told his players, young and older, to take advantage of the system.
"We've got guys in here who have a chance to be major league players who wouldn't have a chance somewhere else," he said. "We have guys like Rey Sanchez and Joe Randa who have a chance to be everyday players that were said to be platoon-type players, and maybe they are. But here they're not."
Jeff King has experienced downsizing in Pittsburgh and Kansas City, making him an expert on the topic.
"We've got some young guys on this team who are going to turn out to be very good players," King, the Royals' first baseman, said. But he added a caveat that has been demonstrated vividly in Montreal.
"It's just going to be a matter of time before they won't be able to keep those guys," he said. "That's why nothing is going to change. When I was just coming up, teams were holding on to these guys until they were free agents. Now after three or four years guys are making so much money that they probably won't be able to hold onto them. That's something somebody's going to have to think about and maybe try to fix."
Although opening-day payrolls won't be set until teams name their 25-man rosters and players who open on the disabled list, it is a given that half a dozen teams will have payrolls beyond or just under $70 million. They and another six or eight with payrolls exceeding $50 million are considered the only teams with a chance for the playoffs. The other, lower-paid teams are fodder for the wealthy.
"I feel that the disparity in the payrolls is obviously creating a bad situation for a lot of teams," Mike Mordecai of Montreal said. "Looking at it from the fans' standpoint, why would they want to waste their money and go see a team that isn't going to finish in the top four in the division?"
For the most part, players said that owners have to create a more level playing field by sharing more of their revenue and requiring that clubs that receive money under the revenue-sharing plan use it for their payrolls. The Expos received $13 million under baseball's partially implemented welfare plan last year but had only an $8.3 million payroll. They acknowledge that they made money.
Players also said that if particular owners can't afford to compete, they should sell their teams, and if particular cities can't support teams, the teams should move. Tim Belcher, a veteran starter now with Anaheim after having spent the past three seasons in Kansas City, suggested that baseball created a problem by overexpanding.
Asked if the Players Association should do anything to deal with the problem, Mordecai said, "Listen to what the owners have to offer at the next bargaining session."
Jeff Montgomery of Kansas City, who has been active in union affairs, said the union should "take the pulse of the players to see how guys feel over all."
"It's the responsibility of our association," the veteran closer added, "to decide what's best, not just for the players but for baseball. Players are only going to prosper if baseball prospers and that's what worries me about baseball. I don't know how much longer it's going to go on like this before there's a problem that's beyond repair."
David Cone of the Yankees, the union's most articulate spokesman among its members, acknowledged some frustration among players on have-not teams. But he cautioned both sides to await further results of the plans in place and the opening of the half-dozen stadiums under construction.
"Let's get all the data in and re-evaluate," Cone said. "Everybody says we need a more level playing field. Everybody seems to agree, but how do you get that? How much does the luxury tax help? How much revenue-sharing is really needed? How much will all these new stadiums help solve some of these problems? They aren't the end-all answer to the problems, but you have to start there."
Does he talk to players on other teams about the situation? "Sure I do," Cone said. "A lot of them want to get traded to contenders."

HEADLINE: Board of Trade Staying Put But Gets Smaller City Deal

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Board of Trade plans to modernize its current trading complex at the World Trade Center, but it will do so with $31 million in government incentives instead of a $98.5 million deal it had won three years ago after threatening to move to New Jersey.
The Board of Trade, a combination of the Cotton Exchange and the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, plans to spend about $50 million on computerized trading equipment for its longtime home at 4 World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. 
 The plans are far less ambitious today than in 1996, when the two exchanges persuaded city and state officials to grant them the $98.5 million incentive package for a new headquarters by threatening to jump to Jersey City. But then nothing happened, either because the exchanges' officials could not afford to move at all, or because they changed their plans.
The city and state's 1996 offer expired in September. The commodity traders then scrambled to salvage some public subsidies. The new deal is expected to be formally announced this week.
"We're delighted to keep the New York Board of Trade and all their jobs in the city, especially at this reduced price," said Randy Levine, the Deputy Mayor for economic development. "The Board of Trade tells us they expect to grow in the future."
James Bowe, president of the Board of Trade, declined comment.
Under the new deal, the Board of Trade would get a rent subsidy at the World Trade Center worth about $17.5 million, a $3.5 million reduction in sales taxes on new equipment and a $5 million capital contribution from the Empire State Development Corporation. The Board of Trade would also get a low-interest loan from the state that would save the exchanges nearly $5 million.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said the deal would allow New York to retain 2,800 jobs and create an additional 3,600 jobs over 15 years. The deal would also allow the city to use a publicly owned site on Greenwich Street, between Murray and Warren Streets, for other economic development projects. It had been set aside for the Board of Trade's proposed $120 million headquarters.
"Admittedly, it's an open question whether the exchanges would have really moved to Jersey," Mr. Gargano said. "But the important thing is that they are committing to adding 3,600, fairly high-paying jobs. We have in our agreement particular penalties if they don't reach those job levels."
The Board of Trade may find it hard to meet those goals. The number of commodity brokers and dealers in New York City rose to 3,425 last year, from 3,085 in 1997. But that is still well below the peak of 4,224 in 1989.
The deal with the Board of Trade is only the latest in a long line of subsidy packages the city has provided the financial industry when companies threatened to move to New Jersey or Connecticut. Criticism of the deals has mounted in recent years as both conservative and liberal analysts have said they doubted that the companies actually intended to move. The critics regard the deals as corporate welfare that deprive the city of resources for public transportation, bridges, schools and libraries.
"It looks like there's no end to this," said James Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit research organization supported by unions, foundations and other groups. "They're content to declare victory in the battle to retain the city's status as a financial center. As a consequence, they're unable to shift their attention to other pressing economic needs."
In the last six years, the Giuliani administration has granted more than $1.6 billion in tax breaks, electricity subsidies and cash to 19 financial corporations and 4 stock or commodity exchanges.
It is often difficult to gauge the full value of the incentives. The city's Economic Development Corporation has stopped publishing a detailed list of past deals and more recently stopped announcing new ones. But even when the deals were announced, some subsidies were never mentioned in speeches or written descriptions.
In the case of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said in August 1994 that they would provide $184 million in incentives that would enable the exchange to build a new $220 million, 500,000-square-foot trading complex at Battery Park City instead of moving to New Jersey. The package included a $125 million cash grant. Exchange officials said the cash grant later grew to $129 million.
The announcement did not say that the state-controlled Battery Park City Authority would charge the Mercantile Exchange a rent of only $1 million a year, or about $16.5 million less than the market rate, real estate brokers said.
That deal became the model for the other financial exchanges. In 1996, city officials said they would provide only $34 million for the Cotton Exchange and the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, but the two exchanges held out until the city and state put a $98.5 million package on the table.
"They put so much pressure on us, saying they would leave the city because they were so crowded at the World Trade Center," Mr. Gargano said. "They got the deal and we never heard from them again. Now the story has changed and we provided new incentives for them."

HEADLINE: Fury Over Diallo Case Barely Resonates at Giuliani Events Upstate

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: TROY, N.Y., April 3

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had not yet addressed the 700 business and political leaders squeezed into a college gymnasium to eat filet mignon and hear his tips for transforming troubled cities into centers of prosperity. But as the dinner rolls were passed, Peter Goold was already exuding enthusiasm about New York City's graffiti-free subways and litter-free streets.
"The city seems to be not as harsh or dirty a place anymore," said Mr. Goold, who owns an apple orchard outside this industrial city about 150 miles north of Manhattan. "And Rudy Giuliani has provided the leadership." 
 But Mr. Goold had little to say when the conversation turned to Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West African immigrant whose fatal shooting by four white police officers has roiled that same city for eight weeks and sparked intense criticism of Mr. Giuliani. "People up here aren't as close to it, so they're not as moved by it," he explained. "It just seems distant to us."
While elected officials, movie stars and hundreds of regular citizens in New York City have assailed Mr. Giuliani's handling of the Diallo case, the fury seems not to have spread to upstate New York, where the Republican Mayor recently began testing the waters for a possible Senate race. Mr. Giuliani received standing ovations, fervent praise and even a "Citizen of the Year" award during visits to Ithaca, Syracuse and Troy last month, even as his approval ratings back home fell precipitously and throngs of protesters accused him of insensitivity to the concerns of minority residents.
In interviews over the last few weeks, about three dozen residents of four upstate cities -- including Republicans and Democrats, avid followers of Mr. Giuliani and people who could barely pronounce his name -- expressed sorrow about the shooting. But the majority of people interviewed in those predominantly white communities said they did not understand why the Mayor has been under attack since Mr. Diallo died in a hail of bullets on Feb. 4. Most also defended Mr. Giuliani, applauding his crime-fighting tactics and predicting that the Diallo incident would not hurt his chances in a Senate race.
"What happened there is an unfortunate incident, but you can't blame Rudy," said Michael Verdile, a restaurant owner who came to hear Mr. Giuliani speak last Tuesday at the Troy dinner, organized by the Rensselaer County Regional Chamber of Commerce. "With 40,000 police officers on his force, things are going to happen."
Ken Sherman, a bakery owner in Troy who did not attend the dinner but said he had followed Mr. Giuliani's career, offered a similar perspective.
"He shouldn't be blamed for something the police did," Mr. Sherman said. "If you've got the police doing all this undercover stuff to clean up the streets, some innocent people might get hurt by it. But over all, it's going to do some good."
Although Mr. Giuliani has not officially declared himself a candidate for the Senate seat that Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, will relinquish when he retires next year, the Mayor has behaved like one for months, aggressively raising money and giving speeches around the nation. The prospect of Mr. Giuliani as a Senate candidate has stirred considerable excitement upstate, where voters are mostly Republican and eager for a strong candidate to make a possible run against Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has also expressed interest in the seat.
Last fall's Senate race between Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Republican incumbent, and Charles E. Schumer was a strong reminder of upstate residents' strong Republican leanings: although Mr. Schumer, a Democrat, won the election, he carried only 6 of the 52 counties north and west of the New York City metropolitan region.
But while Mr. Giuliani has an advantage over a Democratic candidate in upstate New York, most upstate residents interviewed said they still knew little about him -- except that he had drastically reduced crime in New York City. In Schenectady, a city of 65,000 about 15 miles from Troy, Joan Grant said all she knew about Mr. Giuliani was that "the taxi drivers are more friendly and the city is better-looking since he took over."
As for the Diallo incident, Mrs. Grant said she knew from the local television news that the actress Susan Sarandon had been arrested while protesting the shooting. But Mrs. Grant, a volunteer in a thrift shop, said she knew little else about the controversy because, "I don't want to hear news if it's bad."
In his upstate appearances, Mr. Giuliani has talked mostly about his strategies for reducing the city's crime rate and its welfare rolls and for improving its economy -- strategies that he said could work just as well in other parts of the state. But toward the end of his speeches in Syracuse and Troy, he also offered a spirited defense of the Police Department, saying that the police had used less force in recent years and stressing that they deserved respect. At both dinners, his comments on the police were met with hearty applause.
"We in our little towns around here have a real respect for what law enforcement goes through," said Neil J. Kelleher, the Republican chairman of the Rensselaer County Legislature, who attended the dinner in Troy. "We tend to take things a little slower than some of the downstate folks, and we are a little more patient, and we are more willing to step back and allow an investigation to take its natural course."
Mr. Kelleher was not the only person interviewed who suggested that upstate residents had markedly different views of the Diallo controversy than some city residents. John Stevens, a lawyer in Ithaca who heard Mr. Giuliani speak at the Tompkins County Lincoln Day Dinner on March 19, said it was not the shooting itself, but the intense media coverage that followed, that had created the upheaval. "I think the view from here is that a lot of what goes on in New York is a matter of screaming 'Fire!' " Mr. Stevens said. "Every time you turn around there is a new controversy, and it always has to revolve around racism."
Several upstate residents said news of the protests that the Rev. Al Sharpton led against Mr. Giuliani and the police had intensified their support for the Mayor, because they so strongly disliked Mr. Sharpton.
"Those protests will probably add five points to Rudy's support," said William Troy, a lawyer who attended the Ithaca dinner. "Al Sharpton and his professional agitating represent something just incomprehensible up here."
But while interviews suggested strong upstate support for Mr. Giuliani and his response to the Diallo incident, they also suggested that minority residents of upstate New York are wary of the Mayor. A black businessman who attended the Troy dinner, who did not want to give his name, questioned why Mr. Giuliani had frequently left the city in the turbulent weeks following the Diallo shooting.
Phillip Bradford, a black resident of Schenectady, said the Diallo case confirmed his longstanding suspicion that Mr. Giuliani was racially insensitive.
"People are taking a second look at Giuliani after Diallo," said Mr. Bradford, a gas station attendant and part-time student. "But not up here. Upstate is out of touch with New York City, and it's too bad, because this kind of problem is like cancer. If you don't cut it down down there, it's going to spread up here."

HEADLINE: A Hotel's Immovable Women;
Residents Evoke Allerton's Glory to Defy Developers

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Past rows of vacant rooms, at the end of a corridor deep in the dust of demolition and renovation, a handwritten sign taped to the door of No. 701 is like a muffled cry: "Occupied. Please do not touch."
Here lives Suzanne Remy, one of the last residents of the Allerton Hotel for Women. In her time, Mademoiselle Remy created hats for Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich. She sold $17,000 gowns at Bergdorf Goodman on commission. When the Germans occupied her native Paris 59 years ago, she worked the switchboard at the American Embassy. 
 Now, though her tenancy is protected by law, just staying put, she said, seems like an act of defiance. In her 8-by-10-foot room, with a broken faucet and a hot plate, Ms. Remy is part of a dwindling band of 48 residents who have withstood a campaign to drive them from the Allerton, a faded grande dame of single room occupancy at East 57th Street and Lexington Avenue that its owners hope to convert into a luxury hotel.
Like the better-known Barbizon, the 448-room Allerton opened in the 1920's as a genteel residential hotel for young ladies of good breeding and professional aspiration. As recently as the 1960's, it still had a marble staircase, grand pianos in the lobby, and white-gloved elevator maids who enforced the cardinal rule: no men above the third floor. But decades of neglect took their toll.
Today the hotel is hard-fought terrain in New York City's real estate wars. Tourist demand and a booming economy are driving the biggest surge of S.R.O. conversions since the early 1980's. For tenant advocates and landlords alike, the Allerton is a new testing ground for 15-year-old local laws that try to restrict the redevelopment of single room occupancies in an effort to stem homelessness and protect longtime residents from harassment.
Between 1990 and 1997, the Allerton's management waged an illegal campaign of lockouts and verbal abuse to oust tenants, most of them elderly or frail, from rent-regulated rooms, an administrative hearing officer for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development concluded late last year.
"Hotel employees shouting at tenants, cursing at tenants, referring to them as losers or crazy, screaming at tenants about rent in the street, following a tenant into a diner daily for several weeks and asking her about moving out, and threatening placement in a nursing home if tenants did not go away are examples of harassment," the hearing officer, Frances Lippa, wrote in a decision rendered Dec. 31, after hearing testimony over a 13-month period.
"Where could I go?" asked Ms. Remy, a tiny woman with a black organdy bow in upswept hair, perched on a floral bedspread piled with doctor bills and medicine for asthma, emphysema and glaucoma. Still chic after all these years (exactly how many, she would not say), she gave a small shrug at the water-damaged ceiling and mottled walls of the room where she has lived since 1984.
 
At $153 a Week, A Relative Bargain
 She pays $153 a week, much more than the $3.27-a-day charged for the room where the longest permanent resident, a former model, has lived for five decades, but low compared to the alternatives. Studios in the neighborhood start at $1,195 a month, and at the Allerton, recently renamed the Habitat Hotel, modestly renovated rooms without private bath or toilet cost tourists $75 a night.
Executives of Property Markets Group, a real estate investment company that took control of the hotel in 1997, say that whatever harassment the tenants endured under the previous management has nothing to do with them. Continuing renovations, including a new lobby, new pipes and electrical rewiring, represent major improvements in exchange for minor inconveniences, they say, not a form of harassment, as some tenants have charged.
The company pressed city housing officials to overrule the hearing officer and grant the hotel a "certificate of no-harassment," which is legally required before vacant rooms in an S.R.O. can be reconfigured into the upscale suites of a more lucrative tourist-class hotel. But last month, after most tenants refused to go along, the city denied the application. The hotel management must now wait three years before it can reapply and then must show that tenants were not harassed during that period. For now, only renovations that do not change the number of units are allowed.
"We don't believe that justice was served," said Franklin R. Kaiman, the lawyer who opposed the city's harassment case against the hotel, on behalf of the hotel's longtime owner, Allan Goldman, and for Property Markets Group, which has agreed to lease the hotel from Mr. Goldman for 49 years at $2.5 million a year.
Most of the incidents cited by the hearing officer occurred when Mr. Goldman controlled the hotel and employed a manager to run it. Mr. Goldman said in an interview that he was unaware of any harassment, but the hearing officer concluded that it was conducted on his behalf, and that pressure to force tenants out continued to some degree after Property Markets Group took over. Technically Mr. Goldman still owns the hotel, but all business decisions, and profits or losses, fall to Property Markets.
The company, owned by Kevin P. Maloney, a former banker, and Ziel Feldman, a real estate lawyer, controls about 75 rent-regulated buildings in Manhattan, including two other S.R.O.'s where luxury hotel conversions are planned and one S.R.O. where conversion is underway even as tenants have filed harassment complaints and a lawsuit.
Around a conference table on the fifth floor of the former Allerton, the thump and whine of construction in the background, Mr. Kaiman and his frustrated clients said it was not rational for tenants to reject offers of settlement that had included better rooms, private bathrooms, and in a few cases, up to $15,000, all contingent on enough tenant support for the conversion to win city approval. Since that never happened, they said, tenants who wanted a deal lost out.
Mr. Kaiman contended that tenants who rejected the offers were manipulated by MFY Legal Services, a city-financed nonprofit agency that provides representation for S.R.O. tenants.
But lawyers for MFY counter that tenants made up their own minds, and with good reasons. Amy J. Mayer, who has handled the case since the hearing, said the company's tactics and track record alienated most of the tenants.
"This is a really strong group of women," she said. "They stood up for themselves in a very brave way."
Last year, developers filed 99 applications for certificates of no-harassment affecting 2,331 S.R.O. units in Manhattan, more than a fourfold increase since 1993, according to an analysis of city figures by the West Side S.R.O. project. The Allerton application was one of only three denied since January 1998.
As a matter of public policy, the city would have gutted the law protecting S.R.O. tenants had it disregarded its own harassment findings in the Allerton case, said Karen Stamm, a former MFY lawyer now in private practice. Already, she said, landlords with a history of tenant problems often use loopholes in the law to apply for renovation permits for routine improvements, then use the construction itself as a form of harassment.
The law was a response to terror tactics by some landlords in the real estate boom of the early 80's, including hiring thugs to displace tenants from buildings that were more valuable unoccupied or as vacant lots.

Terrace With View Littered With Debris
 The women of the Allerton seem unlikely combatants. Some, like the red-haired secretary who retired from NASA soon after Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon, say they are too fearful of management retaliation to let a newspaper print their names. Others, like the woman who worked for a New Deal think tank in the 1930's, are too proud to draw attention to their reduced circumstances.
But Mehru Ramnagar, a 74-year-old retired nurse who has been a mainstay of the revolt, said softly, "Just because they are old, it doesn't mean that they are nothing."
Leading visitors to a 17th-floor terrace scattered with construction debris, Miss Ramnagar recalled when it was a garden where women talked and watched the city lights together on summer nights.
The hotel declined rapidly in the 1980's, when many of its rooms were "warehoused," or deliberately kept vacant, according to city findings. Tenants testified that verbal abuse began in 1993, when Mr. Goldman hired Gary Greene as the hotel's manager. Mr. Greene, the tenants said, told people he had been hired to clear out the place. Mr. Greene denied the charges.
By the time the harassment hearing began late in 1997, there were fewer than 60 residents and Property Markets Group had taken charge.
At that point, men, some of them Marymount Manhattan College students, were lodged on floors where only women had lived before. The students soon left and sued, contending their rooms were uninhabitable. Then workers ripped out communal bathrooms and toilets floor by floor, and tore up the hallways, making them treacherous to navigate.
Some floors were left like that for months, and heat, hot water, electricity, telephone and elevator service were repeatedly disrupted, tenants and their lawyers said. The hotel management said the disruptions were minimal considering the scale of needed renovation.
City records show that the hotel was fined at least five times by city agencies last year for creating a fire hazard, working without permits and not supplying heat. Many tenants said they felt they had become targets of a new kind of harassment.
"We're not targeting elderly women to recapture rooms -- that's totally ridiculous," responded Ron Simoncini, whose public relations company represents Property Markets Group. "The suggestion that we've done anything but what we're supposed to do here insults us."
Last April, before the harassment hearing concluded, Mr. Kaiman, the lawyer for the hotel's owners, sent a letter offering each of the seven tenants who had testified $15,000 and a renovated room with private bath if all would recant their testimony, and an extra $10,000 each if they moved out. The five remaining tenants refused.
"It was dirty money," said one tenant witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saying she did not want old friends to know how she lives now. She testified that desk clerks ridiculed her use of a walker and called her a loser.
When the hearing officer's decision went against the hotel, a new flurry of settlement offers appeared under tenant doors: They would be moved away from construction and provided private bathrooms with no rent increase for life if they agreed to the conversion and the city approved it despite the harassment finding.
As many as 11 of the 48 tenants showed interest in the deal, according to documents supplied by both sides. One wrote the city that as a past victim of rape, she was tormented by having to share a bathroom with strange men and wanted the private bathroom offered in the deal. "Yes, construction is noisy and messy, but it is also temporary," she said, in a letter supplied by Mr. Kaiman, "and when it is completed, our standard of living will have soared."
But most of the tenants felt bullied and insulted, Ms. Mayer said, and dreaded more construction. Some already considered modernization a disappointment.
"They took the light over my bed," one lamented. "They said I could have a fax."
The divide between the real estate men and their tenants runs deep. Mr. Maloney, a 40-year-old native of Casper, Wyo., cited Internet capability and durable pipes as improvements worth the disruption.
"A year from now, 90 percent of the people will say it's so much better here," he said.
Ms. Remy does not expect to live that long. "I'm being very strong about it," she said, with a wave of her hand that released a faint whiff of Chanel No. 5. "But believe me, at night I have my weak moments."

NATO Attacks Yugoslav Capital for Second Day
 
NATO has continued bombing downtown Belgrade after allied forces wiped out a second bridge over the Danube River in Yugoslavia. 1 

"There is no answer yet" to whether the bombing of Belgrade will make Slobodan Milosevic relent, said a White House official. "We haven't turned the heat up enough. That is the heart of the matter." 1
 
The first reactions in Belgrade to NATO's overnight bombings of two Interior Ministry buildings were more defiant than defeatist. 1
 
A gruesome amateur video that the photographer said showed the bodies of ethnic Albanian victims of massacres by the Serbian forces in Kosovo was shown by the British Broadcasting Corporation. 8
 
NATO said it would send 6,000 to 8,000 troops to Albania to provide security and emergency relief for the masses of Kosovo Albanians who have been driven from neighboring Yugoslavia by Serbian forces. 6
 
Speaking from inside Kosovo, a top rebel commander described what he called massacres and continuing attacks by Yugoslav air force jets, tanks and artillery villages despite 10 days of NATO bombing. 8

Wyoming City Prepares For Gay Murder Trial
On Wednesday, six months after Matthew Shepard, a University of Wyoming freshman, was beaten and abandoned near Laramie, Wyo., the first of two defendants in his slaying is to go on trial on charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery. In death, Mr. Shepard, became an overnight symbol of violence against gay people, inspiring hundreds of vigils and rallies. 14
 
Trying to Save a Relic
A band of preservationists is battling to save the luxury liner the United States, or 'Big U,' which lies empty and dark at a pier in Philadelphia. The task facing the ship's owner and the preservationists is focused on gaining a secure future for a behemoth that is 17 stories high and 110 feet longer than the Titanic. 14
 
Rescue of Immigrants
More than 130 illegal immigrants have been rescued from a snowstorm in mountain terrain straddling the United States-Mexico border. At least nine immigrants have died, seven on the United States side and two in Mexico. 14
 
Changing Sex Education
With Federal money to create abstinence-education programs, states have come up with enormous variations. Some teach the harmful effects of sex outside marriage. Others spend money on media campaigns encouraging parents to talk to their children about sex. "Over all, the sky isn't falling, but the Federal abstinence-only program is beginning to change the landscape of sexuality education," says Debra Haffner, the president of the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States. 18

HEADLINE: Approaching the Task of Social Security Reform;
Increase Productivity

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Martin Feldstein's article starts with the assumption that the Social Security program is a form of an annuity and all we need is a clever way to finance it ("Common Ground on Social Security," Op-Ed, March 31). 
 If we consider the country as a whole and the limited opportunities to create true savings, it becomes obvious that all future benefits to retirees will be paid by those who are working.
Our children, directly or indirectly, will support and sustain us in our retirement years.
The goal should be to reduce the burden by increasing their output.
Any analysis should consider which proposed changes to Social Security are mostly likely to continue prosperity and increase productivity.

BYLINE: By Peter Applebome; Peter Applebome reports on the arts for The New York Times.

 BODY:
With his silver hair, V-neck sweater over a crisp Oxford shirt, genteel European accent and background as a conductor with orchestras from Israel to Boston, David Sonnenschein is no one's idea of a technogeek.
But after 25 years of teaching music at Northeastern University, Dr. Sonnenschein finds himself happily in the thick of things on the digital frontier. Students who sign up for his Music 1101 -- "Music: A Listening Experience" -- agree to study Mozart's minuets and Beethoven's symphonies entirely via computer. 
Dr. Sonnenschein describes his course as a "stand-alone, self-paced, computer-mediated, interactive multimedia program" designed to introduce nonmusicians to classical music. Students listen to recorded music, read text, follow programmed "listening experiences," take tests and communicate with him by computer. When they study rondos or sonatas, for example, they listen to the music on their computers and try to match it to the technical forms shown on the screen.
"This is not about technology, it's about learning how to listen and how to understand what you're listening to," Dr. Sonnenschein said as he waited for his Power Mac to boot up in his office overlooking Centennial Circle on Northeastern's campus. "I can lecture on musical forms, but to many of them I might as well be speaking Chinese. But when they learn at their own pace, they can listen over and over again until the aha! happens -- until they get it on their own. I took the technology up late, but I'm happy I did. It's a very effective way to teach this course."
A 70-year-old conductor and composer teaching Mozart through computer programs and the Internet to students who could just as well show up in class is not the stereotype of on-line education. But at a pace far exceeding what most people expected, on-line education is becoming a defiantly mainstream academic experience.
It is setting in motion an academic gold rush that is making universities think more like Amazon.com than Harvard.edu. It is exciting professors like Dr. Sonnenschein, who see it as an innovative teaching tool, and scaring the mortarboards off many others, who see the excesses of the marketplace invading the sanctuary of the academy. It is helping to create a new academic environment in which entities with names like Anheuser-Busch University, Jones International University and Western Governors University are jockeying along with Stanford, Oberlin and the University of California at Los Angeles for a share of the education market.
While some institutions want only to supplement on-campus offerings, the goal for many others is true distance learning on a scale unlike anything before, attracting students around the globe who will never set foot in a classroom -- if there is a bricks-and-mortar campus at all. That potential is attracting both traditional institutions and a wave of new ones, hoping to devise an entirely different educational model.
Despite some flamboyant predictions, almost no one expects virtual education to replace the world of ivy-edged campuses. Courses like Professor Sonnenschein's are certain to proliferate for a generation of students who are more comfortable with the Internet than the library. But traditional undergraduate education, where the social experience is as much a part of the allure as the educational one, will probably be the least affected, most experts say.
Still, growth in education is not residential campuses for 18- to 22-year-olds. Only about 15 percent of college students fall into that age group and live on campus; 45 percent are older, nonresidential students, most of whom work.
Instead, the growth is in M.B.A. programs for middle managers who cannot take two years off from their job and family; undergraduate degrees for working mothers; courses for engineers and computer technicians whose knowledge becomes outmoded every year, or French Impressionism or religion for boomers who wished they had paid better attention when they were undergraduates in 1970.
No one really knows who the most successful players will be. And there is a raging debate about whether the rise of on-line education is a welcome development. But almost everyone in education is casting glances -- nervous or covetous -- at the on-line world.
"There is great angst out there," said Andy DiPaolo, a senior associate dean at Stanford University's School of Engineering, whose distance program is a conspicuous early success. "People are not sure what this means. Universities are saying, 'I think we need to be in this, but I don't know.' There's been a tradition through the industrial age of students coming to the campus, and now we're told that in the communications age, the campus will come to the students. That's a big challenge to universities who typically don't think along those lines, but more and more, everyone is having to think about it."
Teaching outside the classroom did not start with the Internet, of course.
"We started distance education in 1892 -- before there was the Internet, there was the telegraph," said Jim Ryan, a vice president for outreach and cooperative extension at Penn State. "And it's evolved with the technology. First, there was rural-free-delivery mail, then radio, then television, then a combination of videotapes and audiotapes, then on-line education."
But, as Dr. Ryan quickly notes, there is no way to compare the old expectations with the new ones.
Penn State calls its on-line program the World Campus and views it as an autonomous 25th campus in the university system. In six months it has grown to 600 students from 70. The numbers should reach 1,200 in June, and the university and various partners expect to spend $10 million to $12 million to reach an enrollment of 10,000 students in four years. By then, university officials hope the program will begin generating revenue.
"It's the Amazon.com approach," Dr. Ryan said. "You want to expand your product and position yourself for the marketplace, so you can be a very large provider of a variety of products. You look at the range of institutions that are looking into this, and it boggles the mind. And everyone seems to think there's a four- or five-year window to really establish yourself, so there's an enormous amount of activity."
In fact, what is most striking about electronic education is how broad a universe of players is trying to get in on it.
So a reporter's query on the Internet asking to hear from institutions or individuals serving the on-line education market elicits responses from a remarkable array of providers of courses, software, hardware or information.
Ohio University has its M.B.A. Without Boundaries program. The AT&T Foundation is behind a $150 million effort to promote education via the Internet. Thierry Levy, who runs a company called Quiz Studio, touts his Web-based training programs, and Bisk Publishing its courses in business administration, accounting and computing information systems, which the company offers through partnerships with various colleges and universities.
There are responses from familiar names like the University of Minnesota and from less familiar ones like on-line corporate training programs or Jones International University, the first totally on-line institution to receive accreditation from one of the six major regional accreditation organizations.
Probably the most publicized Internet programs come from brand-name schools, Stanford and Duke. Stanford's engineering program offers 100 courses, taught on line to students around the world at 140 percent of the school's normal tuition. It has drawn 3,000 students since it began in 1997. Duke charges a hefty $85,800 for its Global Executive M.B.A. Program, which has attracted executives internationally for a 19-month program that mixes sessions on campus with intensive study on line. Tuition includes a laptop computer, printer, software, CD-ROM's and lodging and meals at five residential sessions.
But a more typical story may be that of Sheila Kaplan, the president of Metropolitan State College in Denver, with 17,600 students the largest undergraduate college in the country and the third largest school in Colorado. Metropolitan State represents the changing educational marketplace. Students' average age is 27, 80 percent work and many find taking courses at home by way of computer, in between car pooling or after work, enormously appealing. When the college began on-line courses in 1996, it began with 30 courses and 420 students. This year's enrollment is 2,100 students in 87 courses.
"It's taken off way beyond our expectations," Dr. Kaplan said. "Ten years ago, I used to give speeches in which I said the two parts of the American economy that would never change would be medical care and higher education. Obviously, medicine has changed radically, and the computer is going to change education in the same way. In a few years, the only thing you won't be able to do on line will be to drink beer at a sorority house, date the student sitting next to you and find a parking space."
That growth may not be assured. Western Governors University, the consortium of 17 states plus Guam, opened last fall after years of hype. It offers degree programs gleaned from various universities geared to establishing competency in technical and professional areas.
Officials concede enrollment has been well below expectations, saying only that "hundreds" of students have enrolled. They won't release enrollment figures until this fall, when they will presumably have a better story to tell. The slow start has led some skeptics to wonder if an on-line glut is already setting in.
To many, the real question is not whether on-line education has a future, but whether it is a positive or a malignant one.
Andrew Feenberg, a philosophy professor at San Diego State University, is qualified to see both sides. In 1981, Dr. Feenberg was part of the team that created what he says was the first on-line educational program. Designed for the School of Management and Strategic Studies at the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute, it allowed students at their computers to discuss issues like globalization, environmentalism and urban planning.
The technology was primitive -- an Apple IIE with 48K memory and 300-baud modems (multiply by 1,000 and 100 to get the current versions). Everyone figured out teaching methods and on-line protocol as they went along. But years later, Professor Feenberg is still impressed by the ability of on-line education to draw people together and interact.
"The quality of on-line discussion surpassed anything I have been able to simulate in my face-to-face classroom," he wrote recently in a paper on distance learning.
Having seen the past, he is now witnessing the future. In the California State University system, Microsoft, Hughes Aircraft, Fujitsu and M.C.I. arranged an ambitious plan to spend $300 million on a fiber-optic network that would connect California State's 22 campuses in exchange for the right to sell a projected $3.8 billion in high-tech projects over the next decade to students and to universities. Opposition from students and faculty members killed the proposal, but plans are being reworked for a different form of corporate partnership.
It is one of several corporate alliances washing over public education in California. And it leaves Professor Feenberg profoundly uneasy about where on-line education is heading.
"This has gone from what seemed like a rather impractical scheme of some faculty weirdos and their hangers-on to become suddenly a big-time push between corporations and administrators to cut costs," he said. "What I'd like to see is for the faculty to recover the initiative. Right now, the technology is being billed as doing the impossible. It's not a way to save a lot of money or replace faculty, but that's the way it's being sold. Hope is replacing serious knowledge."
Indeed, along with the institutional feeding frenzy is a significant degree of unease on the part of many professors, who think administrators see on-line education as a way to cut back on professors and new construction.
At the University of Washington, 900 faculty members signed petitions opposing state officials' ambitious plans for a virtual university. "We feel called upon to respond before quixotic ideas harden into disastrous policies," the petition said. "Education is not reducible to the downloading of information, much less to the passive and solitary activity of staring at a screen."
At U.C.L.A., only 30 percent of faculty members complied last year with a new requirement that all courses post a syllabus on the Internet. The American Association of University Professors, which represents the nation's college professors, says that courses taught on the Internet require more class time than regular ones and therefore require more, not fewer, instructors. Professors have also raised issues about what effect on-line courses will have on hiring, whether one-size-fits-all software will replace teachers and whether technology will undermine the relationships at the heart of education.
All universities are also struggling with issues of intellectual property rights -- does the university or the professor own the courses marketed on line?
Critics say on-line education is less about teaching than about cost-cutting and transforming teaching, via mass-produced software, into a commodity, which universities can profit from the same way they profit from research patents. Software can serve as text, study guide and learning exercises, providing all the materials needed for a course.
David F. Noble, a professor of history at York University in Toronto and currently a visiting professor at Harvey Mudd College, argues that because quality will be so hard to monitor, the growth projections are wildly inflated. On-line education, he says, will be no more than a very expensive fad, just like the vogue for correspondence courses, which peaked in the 1920's.
"There's really no case for pedagogical enhancement," said Dr. Noble, who has posted a series of three papers on (where else?) the Internet (communication.ucsd.edu/dl). The papers, "Digital Diploma Mills: The Automation of Higher Education," have become ground zero for professorial skepticism about a headlong rush toward the virtual university.
Dr. Noble's qualm is not about French or Japanese executives taking Duke's M.B.A. courses, or farmers taking agronomy courses via computer at the University of Wyoming. It is about the way Internet courses will be used on campus.
One report by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts a huge shift toward electronic courses as a trend toward lifelong learning swells enrollment. The report suggests that software will serve about 50 percent of the total student enrollment in community colleges and 35 percent in four-year institutions. Which raises the specter of a tiered educational system -- green quads, small classes and Gothic touches for the privileged few -- and software for the many.
At the least, the report suggests that the real issue is how to integrate the personal qualities of great teaching with the technological advantages of learning by computer.
Nancy S. Dye, the president of Oberlin College, said she keeps hearing how distance learning in one form or another will reinvent higher education. She cites, for example, the management guru Peter Drucker's prediction that "30 years from now, the big university campuses will be relics," and that the residential university is destined to give way to the virtual university.
She does not worry about that happening at elite schools like Oberlin. What she wonders is whether on-line teaching will expand access to education or whether it will provide a shriveled version to the students who can't afford the gourmet institutions.
"There is a lot of good in educational technology if we use it right," Dr. Dye said. "But education will always be a social process, and it will always include face-to-face connection. What worries me is that somehow, places like Oberlin will become more the exception than the norm. That's fairly farfetched at this point, but I'm troubled by the enthusiasm with which, say, Western Governors University seems to be embracing that kind of model."
For now, they come for many reasons.
Alyssa Cooper takes Computer-Mediated Communicationo on line at Teachers College at Columbia University because she broke her leg just before the semester started, and it would have cost a fortune in taxi fares to travel to class. Dianne Taha takes the same course while working full time in the department of instructional computing at the State University Center at Stony Brook, and Martha Luckey takes it from Japan, where she is a counselor at a school for children of American military personnel. All three women are taking these classes toward advanced degrees in instructional technology.
Paul Sikkenga, a business analyst for desktop telecommunications, is working on a degree in computer information systems at the two-year-old Florida Gulf Coast University, taking some classes on line so he does not take too much time from his job and family.
Almost all of these students see a promising but imperfect medium that will work for motivated, self-directed people, which is why on-line education is considered better for older students.
Mr. Sikkenga, like others, finds the technology both appealing and frustrating.
He could not afford the necessary software for his first Internet class, so he had to use a computer on campus. That defeated part of the purpose of taking the course on line. He is also frustrated by the plodding responses in one course's chat room -- students wait while others laboriously type in responses to instructor's questions -- and he misses the real give-and-take of a classroom.
"As this type of education matures and bandwidth on the Internet increases," he said, "integration of streaming video and other types of multimedia technology may make the distance-learning class a lively and participatory experience that may eventually compete successfully with any campus-based class. Until then, I'll be very selective."
In fact, even the biggest proponents of on-line education say that without technological advances like an increase in Web bandwidth -- transmitting more information faster -- true interactivity will be out of reach. And numerous issues, from the intellectual property rights of faculty members to monitoring test results from a distance, pose vexing problems.
But to students and teachers, on-line education offers more than convenience. For all the mythology of the classroom, many students show up and snooze rather than learn. For all the appeal of face-to-face interaction, it is hard to quarrel with the potential of M.B.A. students on three continents tackling management problems on line.
Dr. Sonnenschein said that part of the dynamic of computerized learning for him is that it forces students to focus, to be active participants in learning rather than empty vessels into which professors try to pour their knowledge.
Many students agree.
"When you sit at a computer to participate in a distance-learning class, you are there and you have already committed to participating," Ms. Taha said. "It's very easy to attend a face-to-face class, but not really be there mentally."
So if there are plenty of professors who see on-line learning as a threat, there are others drawn to something more profound than the idea of letting tired middle managers attend business school at home in their pajamas.
Mark Schroeder describes himself as an "atomic city kid" from Los Alamos, N.M. After graduate school in comparative literature at Columbia University, he eventually became a popular professor of humanities at the University of Colorado in Boulder. But he also became intrigued by the potential of the computer in learning, how databases and computer programs can spur new kinds of cognition that makes students active learners rather than spectators.
Four years ago, he started his own company, Digital Creators, which creates software and training programs for universities and businesses. He left his teaching position a year ago to work full time on it.
To Dr. Schroeder, on-line learning represents a natural evolution of education, from Socratic dialogue to written text to digital. He says on-line education never will -- and never should -- replace the classroom, especially for the traditional college-age market, but the technology's growth is inevitable.
"Students today no longer think textually; they think filmically," he said. "This is a natural evolution. William Blake talked of taking ideas and turning them into icons and worshiping them. What we've done with technology is to turn it into an icon that people worship or they fear. But the technology is merely an extension of our capabilities, a way to expand our ability to learn. I'm not going to be an idiot and say personal contact is not important. But this is something in its infancy, and it's only going to grow."

Charts: "On-Line Orientation"
 
Thinking about studying in cyberspace? Here are questions to ask the school and yourself.
 
Is the program accredited, and if so, by whom? The Department of Education keeps a list of agencies that are approved to accredit schools. It is available by calling (202) 708-7417 or through its Web site: www.ifap.ed.gov/csb_html/agency.htm.
 
How does the tuition compare with a bricks-and-mortar program, and is financial aid available?
 
How long will it take to get a degree? Can students stop and start at will?
 
Does the school provide career services or networking opportunities?
 
How many students has the program graduated?
 
Does the software or technology seem manageable? Is there a technical support line?
 
Is the content as comprehensive as that of an on-campus course?
 
How is the course structured? For instance, is there face-to-face interaction with teachers and other students, and is such interaction important to you?
 
Can students set their own class schedules?
 
Are you the kind of person who can work independently?

HEADLINE: College and Money;
And Never Lie About Your Grades

BYLINE: By Andrew Ross Sorkin; Andrew Ross Sorkin is a frequent contributor to Business Day.

 BODY:
At first glance, the letter seemed promising. "We have reviewed your background and are impressed with your accomplishments," wrote Martha Day Smalley, the recruiting coordinator for the consulting firm McKinsey & Company. "However, we are unable to offer you the opportunity to interview with us." With one sentence, the door is slammed shut, any hope of an interview dashed.
As graduation looms, seniors across the country jockeying for jobs are waking up in a cold sweat at the prospect of receiving one of those dreaded thin, white envelopes. The recurring nightmare: "We have carefully considered your application in relation to our needs and have determined that we are unable to continue employment discussions with you," as Anderson Consulting puts it. 
 But students don't need to lose that much sleep. The job market for the class of 1999 is expected to be 10 percent greater than last year's, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, a nonprofit group in Bethlehem, Pa., that tracks hiring trends. For sophomores and juniors, summer-internship opportunities are also on the rise.
Computer science graduates, who are being offered an average starting salary of $44,878, are the most sought-after job applicants, according to the association. Engineering majors, particularly mechanical ($42,543), are in demand as well, followed by accounting ($33,477) and economics and finance ($35,016) majors. Though recruiting starts early for the most competitive fields, job counselors say it is not really too late for students just beginning the hunt, especially in liberal arts (starting salary: $25,000 to $30,000).
So how do you get your foot in the door and avoid the rejection letter? How do you negotiate the on-campus recruiting frenzy? Experts suggest the following strategies to students hunting for internships or that first real job.
 
Step 1: Know Thy Field
"Research, research, research!" exclaimed Robert W. Thirsk, the director of career services at Stanford University. "I can't tell you how many people walk in the door, and you say, 'What do you really think an analyst does?' and they have no idea," said Eleni D. Henkel, the principal and head of the Global Investment Banking Analyst program at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Talk to friends or family members who work in the field. Go on the Internet; almost every company has a Web site.
If you don't know anyone in your field, career-services departments can supply a list of alumni who work in a particular industry. Today, the buzzword in college job hunting is "information interview." Contact an alumnus and ask if you can meet for half an hour.
"Explain that you're looking for information and advice and that you are not applying for a job," said Patricia Rose, the director of career services at the University of Pennsylvania. Alumni are often approachable, and a meeting may be more than informative -- it may lead to a job later.
If you have no connections but can muster the guts to make a cold call, find out who is in charge of a company's recruiting and ask for a half-hour meeting or even a brief phone conversation. More often than not, recruiters admire such persistence and agree to talk about their company.
 
Step 2: Keep It Short
Students tend to compensate for their limited experience by inflating the length of their resumes. Across the board, recruiters agree that resumes should be only one page (that doesn't mean reducing the font size to anything smaller than 10 points, though). And unless applying for a very creative position, avoid fancy fonts and loud paper.
Recruiters also recommend omitting the traditional "objective" at the top. It wastes precious space, and you may accidentally send a company a resume with the wrong objective -- that is, one meant for another kind of job. (Recruiters say it happens all the time.) The consensus is that the cover letter is the most effective place to state your objective.
"I actually don't think an objective is helpful at all," said Ms. Henkel, adding that she spends an average of five minutes reading each cover letter and resume that comes across her desk. "I prefer just to get more meat about the person."
Work or volunteer experiences should be in a sequence that makes sense to the field being pursued. If you volunteered in Tanzania for a summer and want a job in social services, that work may be more relevant than a summer job as a waitress. But if you're pursuing a career in hospitality, the waitressing job might be more important.
In most situations, it is important to include your grade point average. Obviously, a great one can be flaunted. But you can try to disguise one that isn't so hot. For example, if the G.P.A. in your major is higher than your overall G.P.A., label it and list it next to the overall one. If your junior- and senior-year grades are higher than your overall average, calculate the G.P.A. for those years and list it. The point is to show improvement, or success in a particular area. Be sure to also take the G.P.A. to two decimal places -- don't round it -- as those two points are significant when comparing averages. And never lie about your grades, as you will almost certainly get caught.
For jobs in finance or computer science, including your G.P.A. is imperative. "When I look at a resume, and I'm reviewing it, and I see no G.P.A., I'm assuming the worst," Ms. Henkel said. "You didn't put it down, which means it must be really bad." For careers in publishing or marketing, it may not be necessary to include a G.P.A., especially for graduates of top-flight schools. If there is any question -- and your G.P.A. is low -- leave it off if applying for a position that doesn't include number crunching.
Finally, resume writers often overlook hobbies and activities. "If you enjoy hiking, or you've traveled around the world, or you're a pilot, or whatever it is, put it in," Ms. Henkel said. "It's just something else that creates interesting conversation and catches your eye when you're reviewing resumes."
 
Step 3: Show Up
"There are so many firms that have chosen to come and use on-campus recruiting early in the year, and so it leaves students thinking, 'Oh, my God, it's all done by the time they stop coming,"' said Beverly Hamilton-Chandler, the director of career services at Princeton University. "But that is never the case. We see students still getting jobs over the summer, but it means making overtures to companies now."
Typically, universities invite companies to their campus in the fall, and sometimes again in the spring, for job fairs or to stage dog-and-pony shows called information sessions. Investment banks, consulting firms and technology companies put on glitzy, often overwhelming, job fairs in the fall at a few larger schools. The big companies tend to have an enormous turnover. They start courting seniors early, partly because they have a general idea how many new employees they will need that hiring season. Other industries, like advertising, publishing, social services, law services and government, tend to recruit in the spring, and some don't recruit on campus actively because of the small number of positions available.
By mid-April, if you want a job in banking or consulting, quickly make a phone call to your top choices and send a cover letter and resume by overnight mail to demonstrate your serious intentions.
For a schedule of fairs, contact your school's career-services department. An on-line virtual career fair, for instance, is being held later this month for Ivy League students. (The Web address and timing are not being disclosed to keep the fair limited to Ivy Leaguers.)
Bring several copies of your resume to the on-campus fairs, and dress in the type of attire you would expect to wear on the job. Get to the fair early, before the lines start, so you can spend some quality time with a potential employer without having 10 people breathing down your neck. By mid-afternoon, most job fairs are packed.
First introduce yourself, then ask an open-ended, prepared question that gives the recruiter a chance to create a dialogue with you. "Let them know, 'I've done my homework,' without being too obnoxious," said Greg Knowles, the vice president and manager of university and student relations of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, who advised against asking anything too specific about something in the news or, worse, the company's annual report. Such questions smack of pretension, and can embarrass the recruiter if he or she is not as up-to-date as you.
And if you're really interested in an employer, return to the company's booth to say goodbye before leaving the fair -- it leaves an impression.
A job fair is where shrinking violets must practice talking to people. Spend time watching others ask questions to see what works best. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, employers rate communication skills as the most important quality in hiring decisions involving undergraduates, followed by work experience (likely provided by a summer internship).
While most smaller schools don't have job fairs, companies often hold on-campus information sessions. "It's an opportunity to network, and an opportunity to find out more about the people who work for the company," Mr. Knowles said. "Would I enjoy working with these people every day?"
When sessions are over, most recruiters talk with one another about candidates they met at the presentation. It is crucial that you sign the guest book: companies often cross-reference these with resumes to gauge applicants' interest in them. At some competitive firms, you will be removed from the running if your name is not in the guest book.
If you can't make it to a presentation but are really interested in the company, send a note of apology. A word of caution: it has become increasingly common for students to sign in friends who never attended the presentation. Clearly, this verboten practice is not only unethical, but foolish. Unless the presentation has had hundreds of attendees, recruiters know who was there and who was not.
If you talked to a recruiter at a career fair or information session, send a thank-you note. A handwritten one is preferable, but even a typed letter will do.
 
Bingo! The Interview
Once you have dropped off or sent your resume to a company, the ball is in their court. They might invite you for an interview, or they might summarily reject you with one of those horrific thin envelopes. But even if you receive a rejection, your relationship is not necessarily over.
"There are some folks who are very persistent and really lobby," Ms. Henkel said. There have been cases where someone will squeeze someone in for 15 minutes at the end of the day."
If you win the opportunity to interview, be prepared for anything from a pleasant chat to the grueling to the utterly bizarre.
Have answers ready for the lob-ball questions: "Where do you want to be in 5, 10 years?" "Why are your grades low?" "What are your weaknesses?"
The "What's your weakness?" question often turns into a self-made trap. Never say anything too indictable, and never, never, say you don't have a weakness.
Interview styles are industry-specific. For social-service jobs, recruiters might ask you about yourself and some of the experiences listed on your resume. Publishing or public relations interviews are similar, though some companies want writing samples or may ask you to write something on the fly. Recruiters for jobs in advertising or marketing might throw out a couple of how-creative-are-you situations by giving you a product and asking you how to market it.
The hardest questions come from the most competitive fields -- investment banking, management consulting and technology firms. These recruiters love to ask impossible-to-answer "case" questions like, "How many golf balls are sold in the United States each year?" What they never tell you is that you aren't expected to come up with the right answer. They are more interested in how you approach the problem, what logic you apply and how you respond under pressure.
To answer the golf ball question, estimate the percentage of golfers in the country, then come up with a concrete number using a known quantity like the population. From there, guess at how often, on average, a golfer golfs every month or week. Then determine the average number of balls a golfer uses each outing. You might also estimate how many balls are bought by ranges and miniature-golf companies.
Again, the point is not to calculate a number that is even remotely realistic. The interviewer just wants to hear you go through the different steps of accounting.
The best way to answer such questions is to practice. Talk to friends about what they have been asked. There are also a slew of Web sites and how-to books with practice questions.
The other type of posed problem -- called a brain teaser -- is significantly harder to prepare for because there is no formula. For example, interviewers have been known to ask, "Why are manhole covers round?" There are two ways to attack such questions: fire back with a witty answer and hope the interviewer laughs, or appproach it as thoughtfully as possible. No matter what, don't give up.
(By the way, manhole covers are round because a circle is the only shape that can't be dropped into a same-shaped hole.)

GRAPHIC: Charts: "Measure Water, Get a Job"
 
This question has been used in student job interviews for ages; it has recently been posed by recruiters for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
 
Question: With one three-gallon jug and one five-gallon jug, how would you measure exactly four gallons of water?
Answer: (1) Fill the three-gallon jug. (2) Pour the water into the five-gallon jug. (3) Fill the three-gallon jug again. (4) Pour the water into the bigger jug to fill the remaining two gallons, leaving one gallon in the smaller jug. (5) Empty the five-gallon jug. (6) Pour the remaining gallon into the five-gallon jug. (7) Fill the smaller jug again. (8) Pour the water into the bigger jug. (9) That jug now contains four gallons.
 
"Weigh Balls, Get a Job"
 
Goldman, Sachs, among other companies, likes to pose this situation.
Question: You are given seven Ping-Pong balls; six are equal in weight, one is heavier. How would you find the heavy ball, using a seesaw-style scale only twice?
Answer: (1) Place three balls on each side. If the scale remains even, the ball not on it is the heavy one. (2) If one side dips, the heavy ball is on that side. (3) Place one of those three balls on each side. If both sides are even, the ball not on the scale is heavier. (4) If one side dips, it contains the heavy ball.

HEADLINE: Big Brother Is Listening

BYLINE: By Ethan Bronner; Ethan Bronner is the national education correspondent for The New York Times.

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis.

 BODY:
The issue that gray February day was one of delicate balance: how to assure the freedom to discourse on Hitler's "Mein Kampf," as one participant put it, but not to use the word "Jew" as a verb, to lecture on sexuality but not to refer to female students as "babes."
The debate -- over a faculty speech code -- filled the pale blue faculty senate room in Bascom Hall with passion. It was the latest round in a dispute that began on the lakeside campus of the University of Wisconsin nearly two years ago but had been simmering, in some fashion, for generations. A plaque on the building's entrance celebrates freedom of inquiry -- the "fearless sifting and winnowing by which alone the truth can be found" -- installed after the 1894 exoneration of an economics professor accused of teaching socialism and other "dangerous ideas." 
 The question on the floor -- and it is being mulled on hundreds of campuses across the country, from the University of California to Bowdoin College in Maine -- was how to promote such "fearless sifting" while still creating a welcoming environment for groups that have historically felt slighted at American universities. For while robust intellectual inquiry is a self-stated goal of every university, so too is creating a diverse and tolerant nation.
Student and faculty codes punish, sometimes through suspension, expulsion or firing, words or deeds that create an environment perceived as hostile. Backers say codes insure that minorities and other vulnerable groups will not be mistreated.
"There is a cost to freedom of speech and it is borne unfairly by certain members of the community," asserted Stanlie M. James, a professor of Afro-American and women's studies. "The harm is immeasurable."
Opponents see codes as the worst form of politically correct paternalism.
"We don't want Big Brother stepping in and telling us what to think," said Jason Shepard, a student member of the committee examining the Wisconsin faculty code. "They assume that all minority students, all members of the same group, have the same response to speech. That's ridiculous."
Alan Charles Kors, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvey A. Silverglate, a Boston lawyer, sought to document the effect of the codes and similar programs in their 1998 book "The Shadow University." The university today, they complained, "hands students a moral agenda upon arrival, subjects them to mandatory political re-education, sends them to sensitivity training, submerges their individuality in official group identity, intrudes upon private conscience, treats them with scandalous inequality and, when it chooses, suspends or expels them."
Between 1987 and 1992, about a third of the nation's colleges and universities enacted codes of conduct that covered offensive speech, said Jon Gould, a visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, who wrote his doctoral dissertation on codes.
Typical was the code passed in 1987 at the University of Pennsylvania that forbade "any behavior, verbal or physical, that stigmatizes or victimizes individuals on the basis of race, ethnic or national origin ... and that has the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual's academic or work performance; and/or creates an intimidating or offensive academic, living or work environment."
Most famously, the code was applied against a white Penn student named Eden Jacobowitz in 1993, when he called a group of noisy black sorority sisters outside his window "water buffalo." The university's judicial inquiry officer charged him with racial harassment. An Israeli-born Jew, Mr. Jacobowitz insisted the term -- from the Hebrew behema, slang for a rude person but literally water buffalo -- has no racial overtones. After a highly publicized hearing before an administrative board, charges were dropped. Later, the code was abandoned.
While some codes have been struck down by Federal courts as patently illegal or amended after coming under attack in the media or by students, many colleges and universities still have them, though they are rarely invoked.
That, in fact, was the situation with the faculty code at Wisconsin until last year, when First Amendment advocates decided it was time for it to be abolished. This was partly because the code, which had never led to a disciplinary act, had still been the basis of several investigations of faculty members. Its existence, opponents argued, chilled discourse. The Wisconsin student speech code had been struck down by a Federal court in 1991. Now it was the faculty's turn. But efforts to kill the code proved more complex than imagined.
The February debate began with the usual legal disquisitions from the podium -- how to interpret the First Amendment in conjunction with Federal harassment regulations -- but shifted course when Amelia Rideau from Montclair, N.J., rose to speak.
Ms. Rideau, a 20-year-old junior, recounted how in a recent Chaucer class her professor described a character as "niggardly." Ms. Rideau, a vice president of the Wisconsin Black Student Union, did not know the word, which means stingy and has no racial origins. She was unaware of the controversy in Washington the previous week over the firing (and ultimate rehiring) of a white mayoral aide for using the same word. The only black in the class of 50, Ms. Rideau said she approached the professor afterward and told him of her feelings.
Ms. Rideau thought the teacher had understood and agreed not to use the word again. But at the next class the professor brought in an article about the Washington flap and began a discussion about it.
"He used the word 'niggardly' over and over, five or six times," she said. "I ran out of the class in tears. It was as if he was saying to me, 'Your opinion has no value.' "
When her speech ended to vigorous applause from minority students in the Madison audience, most members of the faculty senate -- historians, geneticists and philosophers in worn sweaters and hiking shoes -- sat in silence. There was no doubting the depth of Ms. Rideau's pain. But there was no way any code could be enacted that would bar a professor from using the word "niggardly." And that put the faculty in a quandary.
"Her talk created a sense that there are things here that students of color want that we can't deliver," David Ward, the university chancellor, asserted later.
Two percent of the student body at the University of Wisconsin, one of the nation's premier research institutions, is black. How to increase that representation is very much a concern of administrators.
"In the early 70's, institutions like ours made promises to recruit minority groups, and by the late 1980's it was clear many had failed," said Roger W. Howard, the associate dean of students. "There built up a very significant level of frustration. We had said we wanted to be a different place, a more welcoming place. Yet we kept getting told that this was not a comfortable place for minorities. So we asked ourselves, 'What else can we do?' And that is partly where the speech codes came from."
After much debate in early March, the faculty senate decided, by a vote of 71 to 62, to narrow its speech code but not quite abolish it. Starting with the pledge that the university is "unswervingly committed to freedom of speech," the new language says that "all expression germane to the instructional setting -- including but not limited to information, the presentation or advocacy of ideas, assignment of course materials and teaching techniques -- is protected from disciplinary action." This means that even if students are offended, professors cannot be punished if they prove the words were relevant to the lesson.
Wisconsin is not alone in its concerns or its solution. Attracting and retaining minority students is a top goal of every major university in the face of the growing legal and political threat to race-conscious admissions. In fact, the movement to end the codes is often allied with efforts to end those admissions policies. But just as often, the movement is spearheaded by people who believe universities have trampled on sacred free-speech grounds.
Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., is reviewing its student and faculty speech code to support free expression more vigorously. At Southern Utah University, a computer-use policy, which bars downloading material that is "racially offensive, threatening, harassing or otherwise objectionable," has also come under attack and university review.
Yet, despite some people's belief that colleges today are Stalinist outposts where the slightest misstep into apparent intolerance is punished by the political correctness police force (also known as deans of student affairs), campuses report few bias-related incidents. While there are occurrences involving hate E-mails or posters with racial slurs and intimidation of homosexuals, university officials say campuses are not plagued with the problems of a decade ago, when the codes were drafted.
For both faculty and students, it was a difficult time of transition from a mostly homogeneous society to a more mixed culture. Before the 1980's, campuses were mostly white-guy clubs: homosexuality was less accepted, campus culture less accommodating of minority concerns, and far fewer women were found on faculties and in professional schools.
As colleges diversified, speech codes for students and faculty were seen as one buffer. Brown University ejected a student for yelling racial and religious epithets outside the dormitories one night; Sarah Lawrence College brought disciplinary action against a student using an antigay slur and engaging in "inappropriate laughter" seen as mocking a gay student.
The University of Connecticut banned "exhibiting, distributing, posting or advertising publicly offensive, indecent or abusive matter" after a 1987 incident in which eight Asian-American students were spat on and taunted by six white students. Paradoxically, it was another Asian-American, Nina Wu, a junior, who challenged the protective policy by hanging a poster listing groups she disliked, including "homos," on her dormitory door. After throwing Ms. Wu out of university housing, the university reinstated her under a judge's order and withdrew the restrictions.
In the mid-80's, when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was still heavily male (today it is nearly half female), a group of women students complained to the provost about sexual harassment on campus. The provost, John Deutch, asked one of his deputies, Samuel Jay Keyser, to devise a policy against sexual harassment.
Among the rules written by Mr. Keyser's committee was the banning of any sexually explicit film on campus without a film board's approval. The board, a mix of faculty, students and administrative staff members, was called the Ad Hoc Pornography Screening Committee, and it adopted guidelines that included an insistence that the film "reflect believable reality or normalcy in the relationships and sexuality displayed" and that the film "not unfairly reflect the viewpoint and sexual feelings of men and/or women."
The code was challenged by Adam Dershowitz, a student (and nephew of Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor), who projected the movie "Deep Throat" on the wall of an M.I.T. dormitory common room on registration day, 1987. He was prosecuted by the university under the code, but the charges were dismissed by a faculty-student committee, which found that the film rules were "an excessive restraint on freedom of expression at M.I.T." The code was quietly abandoned several years later.
Conservatives, horrified by what they saw as social engineering, soon joined forces with liberals who were worried about free speech to condemn all such codes. Critics said vigorous, sometimes hurtful debate was the point of a university. As Jonathan Rauch wrote in his 1993 book "Kindly Inquisitors," "If you insist on an unhostile or nonoffensive environment, then you belong in a monastery, not a university."
Mr. Shepard, the University of Wisconsin student, said such codes do more harm than good by offering false comfort. The better way, he says, is for vulnerable groups to face the discomfort straight on: "Pursuit of knowledge requires us to ask the tough questions," Mr. Shepard, who is gay, said. "And when we do so, people feel uneasy. There is no way around that."
Today, Mr. Keyser, who is retired, agrees. "The codes were a mistake. They were a response to a significant group in our community that was unhappy. But you can't solve the problem with a code. It was an easy solution that didn't work."
That view is not universal. Apart from black, gay and Hispanic student groups who say that they suffer from humiliation, a number of women faculty members at Madison recalled the uneasy life before codes. Theresa Duello, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Wisconsin's medical school, said that when she joined her department in 1982, she was told by the chairman that he could not believe he had to introduce a woman who was taller than he and thought he would ask her to begin by discussing her first date.
Carin A. Clauss, a law professor who campaigned to keep the code, said she was especially sensitive to the need for regulations supporting minority groups and women because she went to law school when women made up fewer than one percent of the class.
Professor Clauss's main opponent in Madison was Donald Downs, a political scientist who has come full circle. His first foray into the free-expression issue was in 1978, when he wrote a book on American Nazis seeking to march in Skokie, Ill., home to many Holocaust survivors.
"I really identified with how the survivors felt," Professor Downs recalled. "I argued that targeted racial vilification as a form of assaultive speech crosses the First Amendment line. I hadn't thought hard enough about the special place of free speech in a public forum."
Today, he says, he would favor permitting the Nazis to march in Skokie just as he favors doing away with all speech codes because they sacrifice something too significant. He draws parallels with Prohibition. He also sees an analogy with affirmative action, saying that, like codes, it gives rights to one group by taking rights away from another, something he opposes.
This is a central point made by Professor Kors and Mr. Silverglate in their book "The Shadow University."
They see the codes as part of a larger liberal orthodoxy imposed by the 60's generation that has taken over college faculties and administrations, especially the offices of student affairs, which promote sensitivity and diversity training during freshman orientation, for dormitory advisers and in classrooms.
They say the main victims of this orthodoxy are those who are not part of it, like Christians who consider homosexuality and abortion unacceptable and find themselves unable to express themselves on campuses.
There are others who say that while they oppose the codes now, they served a role when they were enacted. "There is no question that the codes did, to some unmeasurable extent, influence and help create more appropriate attitudes toward race and gender and sexual orientation," Professor Downs said. But this was at the cost of instilling fear of intellectual honesty."
Richard Delgado, a law professor at the University of Colorado and an early advocate of codes, says that social scientists increasingly favor what is called the confrontation theory, which holds that the best way to dampen racism is through clear rules that punish offenders because the rules' very existence leads people to conform to their principles. He says this has largely replaced the social-contact theory, which asserts that racism is best overcome by placing people of different creeds in constant contact with one another, and that through such contact they will see the error of racist attitudes.
Despite the codes, despite the changes campuses have made in recent years, the vulnerability felt by minorities remains raw.
Michael S. McPherson, the president of Macalester College in St. Paul, says that in October 1997, a black student found racist slurs written on the note board she had hung outside her dormitory room. The culprit was never found but students held a vigil and public meetings. Even though there has been no similar event on the campus since, black students still tell Mr. McPherson how the incident upset them.
It is that gnawing sense of vulnerability that has made the idea of removing the codes unpalatable to the people they were set up to protect. They recognize the shaky legal ground on which they sit -- no student speech code that has been challenged in court has survived -- and worry that the codes will be abused if left on the books. But they fear the signal such a change would send to minority groups.
"As we have become more integrated, I have a sense that the sorts of incidents we had 10 years ago we don't really have today," observed Professor Clauss of Wisconsin. "Now, women make up 47 percent of our law school and things are certainly easier. But we are getting Hmong and Muslim students. I am never sure that minority interests are adequately protected. There was a Muslim student in the health program here who raised religious objections to massage therapy and wanted accommodations to respect his belief. Whether we take those things seriously depends on sensitizing people. Who knows what minority will arrive tomorrow?"

HEADLINE: Streetscapes /The Grand Concourse in the Bronx;
Will It Be City's Thinnest, Longest Historic District?

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
A LECTURE, an exhibition -- and landmark designation? Supporters of the Bronx's four-mile-plus Grand Concourse are hoping to make it the city's thinnest, longest historic district.
The Concourse has a dual fame: as a destination address for successful residents of the Lower East Side and other immigrant neighborhoods from the 1920's through the 1940's, and as a collection of unusual Art Deco buildings. But is it enough for landmark designation? 
 The Grand Concourse was planned in the early 1890's for carriage access to new parkland in the northern Bronx. The planner was Louis S. Risse, an engineer and surveyor, who aligned the Concourse with what he later described as "a magnificent ridge" just east of Jerome Avenue, with fewer intersections than usual. "It would be a sacrilege against nature to disturb" this feature by designing in the usual rectangular block system, he wrote in an undated history of the street.
A few early private houses survive, but most of the Grand Concourse's extant early buildings are five- or six-story apartment houses, just under the height limit that triggered more expensive fireproofing requirements. Except for height, until 1930 the typical Grand Concourse facade was not too different from those on Park or West End Avenues in Manhattan.
In his "A History of Housing in New York City" (Columbia University Press, 1990) Richard Plunz describes the typical Grand Concourse building as a "people's palazzo."
The Depression pretty much stopped construction in Manhattan, but by the mid-1930's the new IND subway line prompted renewed development on the Grand Concourse -- with a big difference. The new Art Deco style prevailed, in part because the newest apartment marketing gimmick, corner windows, broke apart the traditional model of a building as a big box outlined by a solid frame.
A typical Art Deco building is at 1947 Grand Concourse, at the southwest corner of 178th Street, designed by H. Herbert Lilien and finished in 1939. The facade is a restless collision of horizontal, colored banding and vertical brick piers. The lobby is a neat 1930's time capsule: original embossed elevator doors, domed recessed ceiling illumination and Mondrian-style terrazzo floors.
A 1939 article promoting the building in "Buildings and Building Management" listed shower stalls, sunken living rooms, incinerators, Venetian blinds, electric refrigerators and aluminum main entrance doors as special attractions.
Perhaps the most spectacular Art Deco apartment house on the avenue is Horace Ginsbern's 1150 Grand Concourse, built in 1937 at McClellan Place, a few blocks up from the Bronx County Courthouse. The Art Moderne-style facade is a complicated pattern of curved corners and sloping balcony walls, without the zigzag decoration of other Art Deco buildings.
But what makes people stop and stare is the astounding color-mosaic fantasy of undersea life -- tendrils, fish, jellyfish and bubbles -- flanking the main doors. The parts of the main doors that remain are remarkable constructions of stainless steel and brass. The entry area is surrounded by a field of dark cast stone with inset green glass forms.
AS along most of the Grand Concourse, people have become used to astonished passers-by; the lobby attendant at 1150 recently waved a visitor inside casually -- "In the summer this happens almost every day," she said. The lobby has two large murals of fantastic nature scenes, by C. P. Graves and Rene Graves, and a terrazzo floor that inventively mixes small and large stone chips in contrasting colors. A wall of thick frosted glass screens the mail room.
Except for occasional damage, the lobby looks more like an imported period room on loan to the Museum of Modern Art than a hall in a middle-class building.
The Grand Concourse took a nose dive in the 1960's, as residents left for Co-op City and the suburbs. But if new windows are any guideline, housing economics are better -- almost every building has ripped out its original windows for aluminum replacements in the standard brown that has spread over New York.
On April 29 at 5 P.M., the photographer Carl Rosenstein will present a slide lecture, "A Bronx Tale," covering the Art Deco of the Grand Concourse and adjacent areas, at the Flom Auditorium of the Walsh Family Library at Fordham University in Bronx, near the corner of Webster Avenue and Fordham Road. (Information: (718) 817-3570).
Mr. Rosenstein's lecture is related to an exhibition of his photographs, "Bronx Art Deco and the Grand Concourse," through June 30 at the library. (Hours vary; information: (718) 817-3595).
At the same time a long-percolating plan to ask for a Grand Concourse Historic District is nearing a conclusion. Clint Roswell, press secretary for Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, says that the Bronx Landmarks Task Force is a few months away from recommending that the entire Concourse be designated.
One possible problem with such a designation is that the Art Deco buildings on the Grand Concourse are few and far between -- perhaps one in 20. In the "A.I.A. Guide to New York City" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1988), Norval White and Elliot Willensky describe the Art Deco buildings as "sprinkled between the older dour apartment blocks of the 1920's."
Regardless of the outcome of a historic-district request, Mr. Ferrer is planning a $30 million redesign of the Concourse roadway. "We want less traffic, particularly less truck traffic," Mr. Roswell said. The proposal includes more trees, streetscape improvements and roadway realignment.
Mr. Roswell says that changes in the last few years have made the Concourse much safer, in terms of traffic accidents. "But it's still a very heavily used traffic artery," he says, "and we want to make it more of a greenlink."

HEADLINE: A Broker Whose Line Is Specialty Food

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
SIX kinds of olive oil and a dozen or more different types of tea compete for shelf space in specialty markets, put there by Ron Maiorino, a food broker in Chappaqua.
Six years ago, Mr. Maiorino, who was 42 at the time, left a top job with a large food distributor to form his own company, R. J. M. Trading. "Looking back, it probably wasn't the best time to go into business for myself," he recalled. "My wife was pregnant. We had just put a new addition on our house, but I didn't need a lot of capital to get started. A phone, stationery, a fax -- that was it. And I knew sales of specialty food were growing bigger every year." 
 The robust economy, the quest for a healthier life style and more sophisticated tastes in food were reasons Mr. Maiorino cited for the growth.
"For instance, take tea," he said. "Seventeen years ago when I started in the food business, black tea in bags dominated the market. Now there are all kinds of loose teas and high-quality teas, including herbal teas, readily available. And the same is true for olive oil. Producers from Italy, Spain, Greece and most recently California are supplying a market that gets bigger and bigger."
Mr. Maiorino, who describes himself as "a manufacturer's rep whose line happens to be food," started in business with a couple of olive oil lines. "I had a good customer base in Connecticut, and they bought what I had," he said.
Although some food brokers carry 100 or more lines, Mr. Maiorino decided to limit himself to about 20. "After all, how many lines can a broker carry, give personal service and still understand each client's special market niche?" he said. "I sought out quality products, and at the Fancy Food Show in California I found several being made by small up-and-coming companies. One was making terrific biscotti. They were looking for representation in the East. I still represent the biscotti company along with a hand-picked line of quality products that I can be enthusiastic about."
Products, he said, like Tabard Farm's Route 11 Potato Chips. ("They're handmade in small batches in six flavors.") Or the Tazo line of teas and specialty coffees. ("The winner of the 1995 Specialty Coffee Association of America's Best Product Line.") And Moonstruck Chocolatier, which offers handmade truffles and seasonal delicacies in unusual packaging.
Mr. Maiorino knows a lot about food. "At one point, I wanted to be a chef," he said. "I was always interested in food, and during summers of sharing houses in the Hamptons I was the one who did the cooking with my friends encouraging me."
When he was in his mid-20's, he made his first career change. "I went back to school for a totally different career," he said. "I had a degree in psychology and was working at a diagnostic center for kids on Staten Island, but after five years I felt the world was going on while I was in a backwater. So I got a job at Brooklyn College at night and went to the New York Restaurant school, planning to become a chef."
Yet that world was too much for him when he was exposed to the noise and heat of a restaurant kitchen for the first time. "It was pretty intense," he said. "Not an environment I was comfortable in. So when -- through a friend -- I was offered a job as an assistant restaurant manager at Macy's, I took it and liked it. I learned a lot."
Mr. Maiorino was eventually transferred to the Macy's marketplace division. "The marketplace was sensational," he said. "A store within a store that carried some of the best gourmet foods around, including smoked fish, cheeses, coffees and teas. I liked the job immediately, It was so diversified. Salesmen were calling on me, and that's how I learned how the specialty food business worked. I also developed an expertise in merchandising, which has been invaluable to me."
He switched to the wholesale side, joining Belcanto Foods, a distributor of imported olive oil, pasta and Italian cheeses in Manhattan. Given only a few established accounts, he developed a following in the New York City area within six months.
His aggressiveness paid off, and he moved on to a larger specialty food distributing company, serving as its sales representative in Connecticut.
"I called on all the top-of-the-line specialty food shops, and in two years' time I doubled existing sales," he said. "Promotions followed, and I eventually became district manager of New England."
When he decided to go into business for himself, he said, his contacts made all the difference. "Initially, I was able to draw on a customer base in Connecticut that bought the lines I had," he said. "I did $200,000 the first year and doubled that amount by the end of the second year."
Mr. Maiorino estimates that he drives at least 600 miles a week, calling on customers in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. "My customers are almost every major specialty retailer in the New York tristate area," he said. "Accounts include Dean & DeLuca, Grace's Marketplace, Macy's, Balducci's, Zabar's, Bloomingdale's and the Hay Day markets in Westchester and Connecticut. The newest is ABC Carpets. They opened a sensational food hall. I also place a lot of lines with distributors who have 10 sales people selling my customers' products."
Because brokers depend entirely on commissions, Mr. Maiorino observed: "You rely on quality accounts. I don't get paid until the customer pays the vendor, so deadbeats are a problem. I shy away from taking on start-up companies that are not well financed. Early on I took on a terrific product, but the company was short on capital, so they used my commission. I lost about $2,000 but learned a lesson."
Although the demand for specialty foods is high, Mr. Maiorino said: "It's very hard to launch a new food product. You need a lot of money, great packaging and merchandising know-how. In the food business, the fight for shelf space is an eternal battle."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION/RADIO;
Giving a Guerrilla Journalist the Freedom of Cable

BYLINE: By WARREN BERGER; Warren Berger is the founding editor of One, a magazine about advertising.

 BODY:
IN the debut episode of "The Awful Truth," the new series created by the guerrilla-style documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, viewers meet Christopher Donahue, a Florida man with a life-threatening pancreatic illness. Mr. Donahue desperately needs a transplant, but his health care provider, Humana, refuses to pay for the operation.
On a conventional newsmagazine program, Mr. Donahue's plight might have inspired grave tones and earnest pleas from a well-coiffed correspondent. For Mr. Moore, it is not just a call to action but an opportunity to create mischief. With cameras rolling, he accompanies the ailing Mr. Donahue on a stroll through the corporate offices of Humana, where Mr. Moore asks a sweating, stonewalling public relations official to help him choose in advance a nice coffin for Mr. Donahue. Subsequently, Mr. Moore stages a mock funeral for Mr. Donahue on the lawn of Humana's headquarters in Louisville, Ky. Mr. Moore himself delivers a eulogy for the man standing beside him: "I remember Chris always used to say," Mr. Moore begins, then leans toward Mr. Donahue and asks, "What did you always say?" Mr. Donahue replies, "I just want a pancreas." Before long, Mr. Moore has so thoroughly embarrassed Humana that the company responds by reconsidering in Mr. Donahue's favor. 
 Those familiar with Mr. Moore's work, particularly his breakthrough documentary film in 1989, "Roger and Me," and his Emmy-winning series "'TV Nation," will recognize that the basic ingredients remain the same in "'The Awful Truth," which has its premiere next Sunday at 9 P.M. on Bravo. As in the past, Mr. Moore can be counted on to defend downtrodden "ordinary people" like Mr. Donahue while taking aim at rigid (and some might say easy) targets like bureaucratic corporations and double-talking politicians. As ever, his chief weapons are his unblinking movie camera and his wicked, offbeat sense of humor, which usually manages to keep him from seeming sanctimonious as he plays a kind of shlumpy Robin Hood.
Mr. Moore's arrival on Bravo could be viewed as a step down for someone who once occupied a prime-time slot on NBC, then one on Fox, with "TV Nation," which ran sporadically during the 1994 and 1995 television seasons. But Mr. Moore insists that he is pleased to be returning to television on cable, where, he said, he is granted more freedom to take on subjects that might be taboo on broadcast networks.
"This show is going to be everything 'TV Nation' would have been if we didn't have the heavy hand of network standards and practices on us," Mr. Moore declared on a recent evening at a Manhattan editing suite, where he was putting the finishing touches on a scene from "The Awful Truth." The segment shows Mr. Moore bringing a group of Christmas carolers to the headquarters of a tobacco company, where he leads them in song in the lobby. The catch: The carolers, all lung cancer victims, sing with croaky artificial voice boxes, as mortified tobacco executives stand by helplessly and watch. "That's something you've never seen on TV before," Mr. Moore said.
Certainly not on Bravo, whose viewers are accustomed to the more mellifluous singing of, say, Luciano Pavarotti. Some viewers of the arts network are likely to be surprised by "The Awful Truth," whose rambunctious segments include one in which Mr. Moore travels with a group of homosexual men in a recreational vehicle he calls "the sodomobile" into states where sodomy is outlawed and interviews shocked local residents.
"If the show creates a little controversy, we're comfortable with that," said Ed Carroll, the general manager at Bravo, which is producing the series with the British network Channel 4. Mr. Carroll said he believed "The Awful Truth" might help Bravo connect with "viewers who haven't sampled the network before." Although "TV Nation" was never highly rated (Mr. Moore blamed poor time slots for the ratings and the show's ultimate demise), it did attract a following of younger viewers, who responded to Mr. Moore's outrageous pranks and his willingness to challenge authority.
In "The Awful Truth," Mr. Moore's fans are with him not only in spirit but in person. Mr. Moore closes and opens the show and introduces each segment standing before and interacting with a live studio audience, filled with mostly young devotees. During the taped segments, the crowd can be heard tittering and cheering whenever Mr. Moore, camera in tow, begins to advance on the bastions where he is most unwelcome (corporate America, Capitol Hill, the Deep South).
But Mr. Moore is not just a prankster playing to the youth audience, a la Tom Green of MTV, whose idea of humor is to cover himself with food. Most of Mr. Moore's segments touch on serious issues like race, class, free trade, environmentalism or health care. Mr. Carroll of Bravo believes that the channel's sophisticated viewers will respond to that aspect of the show as well as to Mr. Moore's arch humor and cinema verite style. Meanwhile, as he is wont to do, Mr. Moore sees his presence on Bravo in terms of class struggle: an arts channel "should not be the purview of only people from the upper class," he said. He promises to bring not just college students but also working-class viewers into the Bravo fold.
"They're part of my core audience, too," he said.
Mr. Moore, who invariably wears jeans and a baseball cap, and whose slumped posture and bowed knees make it seem as if he is supporting the weight of the world, remains proud of his modest background, often bringing it up with no prompting. "I didn't go to film school, and I didn't start out at Sundance," he said during a break in his editing session. Sitting like a child -- slumped, sideways, with one leg draped over the arm of a plush chair -- Mr. Moore veered between animated political discourse (true, the murder rate in New York is down, he acknowledged, but only because "they don't count people killed by the police") and personal data.
When he began filming "Roger and Me," Mr. Moore recalled, he was collecting unemployment in Flint, Mich., where he "shopped at K Mart and lived in a $27,000 house." He made the film -- in which he doggedly pursues Roger Smith, then chairman of General Motors, to confront him about the closing of G.M. plants in Flint -- "because I was angry at what General Motors had done to my town, and I was going to do something about it," he said.
"Roger and Me," one of the most successful documentaries ever made, turned Mr. Moore into an unlikely celebrity. But he resisted changing his regular-guy image or his guerrilla-film ways. On "TV Nation," he continued to stage pranks and conduct ambush interviews, often intended to make a political or social point and to make his targets look foolish. He often succeeded, with help from willing victims. (On one "TV Nation" segment, Mr. Moore showed that with a bit of lobbying, he could coax Congressmen to propose legislation designating a national holiday in honor of his series.)
Mr. Moore has drawn criticism for his ambush tactics. The television critic Tom Shales once derided him for "dragging people in front of a camera lens and humiliating them." However, Mr. Moore contends that he doesn't trick his subjects and always allows them to speak freely. "I try to present myself in as nonthreatening a way as possible," he said. "Some people end up saying things they shouldn't say because they look at me and think, 'Well, this isn't going to end up anywhere; look at him, he hasn't even shaved in a week.' "
Mr. Moore doesn't hide his political agenda, which leans heavily toward labor and usually favors liberal positions over conservative ones (though he considers himself politically independent). In the opening episode, he ridicules Kenneth Starr by staging his own more cost-effective Capitol Hill witch hunt, complete with overwrought, finger-pointing actors in Puritan garb. But Mr. Moore makes no apologies for presenting a politically biased show. Citing Comedy Central's "Daily Show," which he considers derivative of "TV Nation" but "without the politics," Mr. Moore said that because that show lacked an underlying serious message or point of view "it ends up just making fun of stupid people."
Ten years after "Roger and Me," the real issue for Mr. Moore may not be one of politics or occasional harsh treatment of subjects but of staying power. Though he has added a few new wrinkles, he remains the same basic character who burst on the scene in his debut film: the labor-loving Everyman, shambling into corporate lobbies and asking rude questions. His schtick, if it's fair to call it that, given his obvious passion, does not seem to have evolved much. Mr. Moore is aware of this and understands the need to reinvent oneself in the fickle media landscape. He insisted that he planned to limit the number of "scenes of Mike going into the lobby and jousting with public relations people," and that he would try some new creative approaches on his show. But no one should expect a kinder, gentler or apolitical Mr. Moore anytime soon. And industry moguls who see someone with a baseball cap and a movie camera coming through the revolving doors would be well advised to hide.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT;
In the Stampede to Big Stocks, Some Managers Are Left Behind

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
DESPITE some sharp ups and downs, the bull market in large-capitalization stocks plowed forward through the first quarter, confounding some money managers and rewarding others.
The story was no different for the five managers who have built hypothetical retirement portfolios for The New York Times: None of their portfolios lost money in the quarter, but only three beat the average return of 0.96 percent for diversified domestic equity funds, as tracked by Lipper Inc. In comparison, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of large companies gained 4.65 percent in the period. 
 The winner for the quarter, with a return of 4.56 percent, was Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y. Mr. Jacobs's portfolio was helped by hefty stakes in large-capitalization stocks, and he expects more strong market gains.
"I anticipate that the bull market will continue through the second quarter," Mr. Jacobs said, because the factors propelling it -- low inflation, low interest rates and a strong economy -- are still in place. "I don't think that we have seen the highs for the Dow this year," he added.
Half of Mr. Jacobs's portfolio is invested in two funds: the Vanguard 500 Index, which mimics the performance of the S.& P. 500, and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, which has much broader holdings. The portfolio also includes Vanguard Windsor II, a large-cap value fund.
Mr. Jacobs plans no changes to the portfolio, despite relatively poor showings by some of his international stock funds. "It's a long-term commitment, so for a minor drawdown it's not worth doing anything," he said.
The market bias toward large-cap stocks continues to hold back managers with more diversified portfolios, including Harold R. Evensky, a financial adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. Mr. Evensky took fourth place in the quarter, with a portfolio gain of 0.50 percent.
He remains a firm believer in asset allocation, although he said that during the quarter, a sobering market adage from John Maynard Keynes came to mind: Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.
Nonetheless, Mr. Evensky also plans no changes to his portfolio. "While value and small-cap stocks continue to buck history and significantly underperform the handful of lottery winners driving the S.& P. 500, I continue to believe in long-term investing," he said.
THE performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each quarter by Lipper, which is based in Summit, N.J. It excludes sales charges, transaction costs and taxes, because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred accounts. The five managers can choose any funds open to new investors and can shift money quarterly. At the outset of the competition, in July 1993, they were asked to pick portfolios intended to grow for 20 years.
Mr. Jacobs remains the overall leader, with a gain of 140.15 percent since the contest began. In that time, the five portfolios have risen an average 111.99 percent, compared with a 227.71 percent return for the Vanguard 500 Index fund.
Eric M. Kobren, president of Kobren Insight Group and editor of Fidelity Insight in Wellesley, Mass., took second place in the quarter, with a gain of 3.11 percent. He was hurt by a 15 percent position in Fidelity Small Cap Stock as well as a 25 percent position in Fidelity Spartan Government Income, which fell as the stock market rose to record levels.
Mr. Kobren, whose portfolio is made up entirely of Fidelity funds, said that he felt uncomfortable investing only in equities with the market at such high valuations. But given the portfolio's long-term objective, combined with the economy's surprisingly strong showing, an all-stock portfolio seems in order, he said. So he is selling his bond position and buying a 20 percent stake in Fidelity Value, which he said could be a big winner if the market broadens, reflecting a modestly stronger-than-expected economy, better prospects among industrial companies and the recovery of beaten-down value stocks.
He is also adding 5 percent to his position in Fidelity Contrafund II; he said a quarter of that growth fund was invested in technology, a modest level compared with some of its most aggressive peers.
Jack A. Brill, a San Diego investment adviser who advocates "socially responsible" investing, took third place for the first quarter, with a gain of 2.64 percent. The return was bolstered by big holdings in large-cap stock funds, including Domini Social Equity, an index fund that is considered a socially responsible proxy for the S.& P. 500.
This quarter, he is replacing Calvert Capital Accumulation, a mid-cap growth fund, with IPS Millennium, a growth-and-income fund. He described the IPS Millennium fund manager, Robert Loest, as a "New Age economist" who uses a model called "evolutionary ecosystems mechanics" to evaluate how changes in technology and society affect the stock market.
Mr. Brill said the fund was not as widely screened for socially responsible investments as others in his portfolio; its major focus is on animal rights. IPS does not invest in poultry or fertilizer companies, for example, because of environmental concerns, he said.
In last place for the quarter was Susan Dziubinski, who edits the Morningstar Fund Investor. Her portfolio gained just 0.35 percent, hurt by its very limited exposure to large-cap stocks. TIAA-CREF Growth and Income, her sole large-cap fund, which she added in the last quarter, beat the S.& P. 500 by gaining 6.18 percent. But that was more than offset by holdings in small-cap stock funds like Skyline Special Equities, which fell 11.83 percent.
Ms. Dziubinski, however, plans no changes to her portfolio, which remains mostly entrenched in funds that buy small- and mid-cap stocks. She expects the high valuation of the large caps to take its toll eventually. "I just can't justify putting money into big stocks when the S.& P. 500's trailing price-earnings ratio stands near 35," she said.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Aftershocks

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
WHEN Dan Scheinman joined Cisco Systems in 1992, he was a neophyte in the ways of Silicon Valley. Leaving a job as an associate at a law firm, he was offered his choice at Cisco of a signing bonus or stock options in the company.
Mr. Scheinman chose the sure thing -- the bonus. And as Cisco's stock price, yoked to the growth of the Internet, soared over the years, this "goof," as he calls it, cost him roughly $700,000. 
 So Mr. Scheinman, now the company's general counsel, has become a true believer in the power of the stock options to create wealth. "The bigger risk is not getting options," he said. "Here, nobody thinks about salary any more."
Little wonder, given the huge windfalls that many technology stocks are providing employees -- and especially certain top technology executives. Though their salaries tend to be modest by corporate standards, options are moving the leaders of companies like Cisco and Yahoo rapidly up the ranks of the country's most highly compensated chief executives, according to an analysis of executive pay conducted for Money & Business.
Big grants of options -- which give the holder the right to buy shares at a set price for a specified time -- have long allowed technology companies to lure and retain employees without diverting cash from their own growth or damaging their often tenuous profitability. And by doing so, they have done what shareholders have demanded for a generation: linked management's interests to investors'.
But Silicon Valley's obsession with options -- an obsession increasingly shared by the rest of corporate America -- is approaching an unhealthy extreme, according to some pay consultants, recruiters and even investors. Like Internet bubble babies, too many executives, these critics say, are focused on stock performance and stock performance alone.
"The thing that concerns me the most is the trend toward building market capitalization rather than building companies," said Roger McNamee, the founder of Integral Capital Partners, a Menlo Park, Calif., investment company that has backed such fast-growing companies as Rambus Inc. and the Inktomi Corporation.
The combination of option-rich pay packages and an overheated market -- one where the performance of certain Internet highfliers seems to have little to do with fundamental performance -- is creating an employment environment that resembles a lottery, according to pay experts.
Critics warn that these packages, many of which let executives quickly convert their options into stock, are not creating a loyal work force focused on the long term. Instead, they may be encouraging a short-term mindset among employees hoping to strike it rich by joining companies whose stocks seem ready to soar.
Companies have responded by offering even more options to keep key workers, ratcheting the stakes higher and higher. "It's upped the ante for both executive talent and key engineering talent," said Steve Patchel, a senior consultant for Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a pay and benefits consulting firm.
That route is being taken by many technology companies, according to Graef Crystal, the editor of the crystalreport.com, an Internet newsletter on executive pay, who conducted the study of last year's executive compensation for Money & Business. When he looked at amounts being ladled out at a sampling of technology companies with ties to the Internet, he found that the average executive made more than twice as much as his counterpart in the rest of corporate America -- entirely because many packages were stuffed with options.
But Mr. Crystal's calculations take into account only the size of the options grants themselves, not the rise in the companies' stocks. "Obviously, if you combine huge grant size with huge price performance, you get the fourth movement of Beethoven's Ninth, complete with a 350-voice chorus," Mr. Crystal said.
For example, the increase in the value of his options in just the last year put Timothy A. Koogle, chief executive of Yahoo, in nearly the same pay league as John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric, even though G.E.'s $100 billion in sales is 500 times more than Yahoo's $200 million. Mr. Koogle, with total compensation of $22.7 million, ranks among the 20 highest-paid executives in Mr. Crystal's study -- and that does not count the one-year jump of nearly a half-billion dollars in the value of his options. Not bad for someone who was brought in to run the company less than four years ago.
As Mr. Koogle's case shows, it is no longer just the Bill Gateses of the world who become enormously wealthy as technology booms. Executives who played no role in starting a company are being given stakes that provide them with wealth akin to that of founders who had to stake everything on their dreams.
"We are rewarding professional executives with entrepreneurial rewards," said Pearl Meyer, the president of Pearl Meyer & Partners, a New York consulting firm.
Yahoo says Mr. Koogle was brought in to the company very early and is largely responsible for its success. "He put the first business model in place," said Diane Hunt, a company spokeswoman.
The danger for businesses driven by high-spiraling stocks comes in a market reversal -- a development that, for all technology's power, many observers consider inevitable.
The technology sector, of course, has always had its ups and downs. But now many more people -- not just founders and top executives, but workers on the corporate front lines -- hold options and shares. That ties them for better or worse to the current cycle. And many have never experienced "worse."
BEYOND that, many of the fresher faces in Silicon Valley "have begun to believe that they are worth the number" they are now earning, said Barry Obrand, who heads Silicon Area activities for Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive search firm. If stocks drop, he worries that many employees and executives will vanish as quickly as the paper profits on their holdings. Companies could have a hard time rebounding if key people depart.
Closer to home, the issue is what will happen to employees who have changed their life styles based on visions of a future bonanza. Anyone buying an expensive house or car, and expecting to cash in options to make the payments, could be in for a rude awakening.
To be sure, stock options are viewed as an important way to motivate employees and management. "You work differently; you work smarter," said Matt Ward, chief executive of WestWard Pay Strategies, a consulting concern in San Francisco. "Everybody's there to get the mission accomplished" -- that is, to bolster shareholder returns.
This mind-set is increasingly prevalent as companies across the country embrace a similar philosophy. "Options have become a bigger and bigger part of the pay package," said Mr. Crystal; options accounted for about half the total compensation paid to executives in his survey of 428 large companies.
But as large investors have begun to complain about how the corporate printing presses "keep running," as Mr. Crystal put it, there are signs that the huge increases in pay may be moderating. While Mr. Crystal found that the median increase in compensation was nearly 25 percent in 1997 for chief executives of the biggest companies, it climbed only 10 percent last year.
The faithful in Silicon Valley are quick to assure cynics, especially those from the other coast, that the "money culture" is not pervasive. "We are building something that we want to be around in 10 years," said Mr. Scheinman of Cisco, which makes Internet networking equipment.
As long as the executives running these companies are representative of what some describe as Old Silicon Valley -- sharing an overarching belief in the ability of technology to change the world -- executives will still work 100 hours a week to try to get their latest products out on time, say defenders of the industry's ways. And programmers will still devote hours to perfecting a piece of code.
"The reason you don't have to worry about this is that the day-to-day environment is not about the stock price," said David Peterschmidt, chief executive of Inktomi, an Internet software company that has been among the hot upstarts of late. Since going public in June, the stock has more than quadrupled.
What's more, veterans say, it is well understood in Silicon Valley that many of even the most promising companies fail. "A lot of people have a lot of worthless options as wallpaper in their garage," said Mr. Ward of WestWard Pay. At Cisco, employees joke about former colleagues who sought their fortunes at some of these failures, Mr. Scheinman said, noting that "plenty of E-commerce companies have folded their tent."
BUT oh the rewards -- if only on paper -- for workers whose companies are embraced by investors. Given the recent success of Internet-related initial public offerings, companies that are planning to go public can use options to give employees the potential for vast riches. "Most of these Internet companies can get anyone they want by dangling stock options," said Rick Gostyla, the head of the North American high-technology practice of Spencer Stuart, an executive search firm.
A decade ago, an executive recruited by a start-up might get $20 million in options, according to David B. Kixmiller, a partner at Heidrick & Struggles, another search firm. Today, the package is likely to be worth $100 million. "All the valuations are pushed up higher in every stage of the deal," Mr. Kixmiller said.
Moreover, many pay packages no longer lock employees into long-term relationships in order to collect the jackpots. Many companies are granting options that can be converted into stock relatively quickly, said Judith Fischer, the managing director of Executive Compensation Advisory Services in Springfield, Va.
Steven Westly, a vice president at Ebay, the on-line auction company whose stock has shot up 778 percent since its public offering in September, was given options on roughly 2.4 million shares at just 7 cents each when he joined the company in August 1997, according to company filings. Mr. Westly, who was free to exercise the options immediately, has done so, according to the filings. If he still holds the shares, he has a paper profit of more than $330 million. Ebay had no comment.
Even when companies offer more traditional options, which vest over several years, many allow a substantial fraction to be exercised in short order. At Silicon Graphics and Inktomi, for example, additional shares vest monthly.
That is why few consultants still argue that options are a tool to retain executives in Silicon Valleys. Companies lose as much as a fifth of their work force each year, according to the Radford division of Aon Consulting, which conducts an annual survey of high-technology companies. If a competitor wants to hire someone badly enough, it will simply offer enough new options to make up for any money left behind, pay experts say.
"Using a long-term incentive for short-term gains creates a problem," said David M. Leach, a consultant with Compensation Resource Group in New York. "It certainly sends a message of short term."
The siren call of options also penalizes companies whose stock has already been very successful, like America Online or the two-year-old Amazon.com or even corporate toddlers like Ebay. While companies point to past stock performance in recruiting prospects, a stock that has been too hot can make recruiting difficult. In such cases, executives and other candidates turn pessimistic, because "their stock has only one way to go," explained Mr. Gostyla of Spencer Stuart.
And woe to any company whose stock starts to struggle.
Silicon Graphics, which makes computer systems, has experienced an exodus since its stock started performing poorly a few years ago. To attract its new chief executive, Richard E. Belluzzo, from Hewlett-Packard, the company offered him a yearly salary of just under $1 million and 3 million stock options -- a fifth of which vest after just 10 months on the job. So he could exercise his Hewlett-Packard options, Silicon Graphics also gave Mr. Belluzo a short-term loan, which he has repaid, according to the proxy statement.
"To attract the best talent, you have to be competitive with the market," said John Cristofano, a spokesman for Silicon Graphics.
Like other technology companies with tumbling shares, Silicon Graphics has reduced its options' prices twice in the last two years. While many investors frown upon the practice, compensation experts say such companies have little choice if they hope to keep or attract key people.
Companies "feel that they cannot wait a year" for the stock to recover, Ms. Meyer said. "If they wait more than a quarter, they will have an outflow" of essential workers.
But the act of repricing options is being threatened by a change in the rules governing how companies account for options. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the nation's accounting rule maker, has proposed that repricing options result in a charge to earnings if the stock price moves up. Many experts say this would all but end the practice, because companies would be very reluctant to incur the charges.
WITHIN technology companies, few people seem to resent the enormous wealth being created in the Valley -- because that wealth is being at least partly shared. Many companies make a point of including all their employees in option plans. A survey of Internet service companies by WestWard Pay showed that half of workers making less than $30,000 were eligible for options.
While the proliferation of options is helping to keep the peace, it also means that a much larger group of people will suffer in any downturn.
When Hewlett-Packard lost significant market value more than a decade ago, employees did not head for the hills. "They didn't have stock options," said Mr. Kixmiller, the executive recruiter from Heidrick & Struggles. "Stock options were not as big a part of the landscape."
So what will happen when today's landscape is bombarded by what could be dozens of crashing stocks?
"We don't know the answer," said Mr. Kixmiller. "The valuation placed on the Internet I.P.O.'s is unprecedented."

HEADLINE: Total Recall

BYLINE: By Bruce Weber; Bruce Weber is a national correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
In a conference room in the library of Carleton College, a small liberal arts school about 40 miles south of Minneapolis, 20 or so students were sitting around a horseshoe of desks, their shoulders hunched, buzzers clenched in their fists. They were concentrating on the man in front of them, Eric Hilleman, their coach, who was flinging carefully phrased questions at them in disciplines from chemistry to history to pop culture and waiting for, encouraging even, the quickest response.
This was exercise, conditioning for the synapses between the brain and the buzzer finger. Practice for the Carleton quiz-bowl team, one of the best undergraduate groups in the country, isn't really athletic training, it's more like a tuneup for a human search engine. And on this night they were getting a workout: in two days, three four-person teams would travel to Iowa City, site of the regional championships for the National Academic Quiz Tournament circuit. 
 Mr. Hilleman began: "He noted in his inaugural address that even in ancient Rome, politicians did not keep their promises. Unlike them, he did keep his promise to serve only one term -- but not in the way he had in mind. For 10 points, name this President who got sick his first day on the job and died a month later."
A student buzzed. "William Henry Harrison."
"Yes," Mr. Hilleman said, continuing without a pause. "She is not Lara Croft, but according to a December 1998 poll she stars in 4 of the nation's 10 hottest computer games: one as a detective, another in a riding club, a third as a photo designer and a fourth as a nail designer. For 10 points, identify this blond bombshell made by Mattel."
A buzz from the far corner. "Barbie."
"Yes. Caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacterium often found in deer ticks -- "
Buzz. "Lyme disease."
"Yes. In 'Moby-Dick,' Queequeg celebrates it in his room, while Ishmael gets himself hired aboard the Pequod. Its 27th day -- "
Buzz. "Ramadan."
"Yes, that's 15 points," Mr. Hilleman said, awarding a bonus for an early correct answer.
"Nice buzz," a student offered.
Question, buzz, answer. Question, buzz, answer. The rhythm quickened; the room filled with arcana: Whitaker Chambers. "Bringing Up Baby." Halogens. Bert Blyleven. Calligraphy. Grub Street. William Cullen Bryant. "The Barber of Seville." Red Skelton.
"Nice buzz."
For a visitor with a reasonably good education but slack recall muscles, the scene was somewhat belittling. But for a visitor more then twice the age of these students, the scene was also a reminder of the days when academic quiz competition was Sunday-night television fare in the form of "G.E. College Bowl," with the hosts, first Allen Ludden and then Robert Earle, moderating contests between well-groomed teams representing universities and colleges nationwide.
Talk about retro! None of the Carleton students were alive when the show, first broadcast in 1959, went off the air in 1970. They are, nonetheless, part of a resurgence of the sport (game? activity? enterprise?) on American campuses, with thousands of students participating in hundreds of tournaments every year, both intramural and intercollegiate. High schools compete as well, as do adults who continue to crave the rush of a contest that tests wits and reflexes.
The revival has been led by the College Bowl Company, the very same organization that produced the television show, which now provides, for a fee, questions and game equipment to about 300 colleges and hundreds of high schools. It was College Bowl that established the structure of the game. A question, known as a tossup, is asked to both teams simultaneously; the first player to buzz gets to answer, and a correct answer earns the team a bonus question.
The revival has also been fueled by the emergence of competing organizations, like the National Tournament, which have modified the game with different kinds of questions, scoring and time elements to suit the varying preferences of its ardent devotees.
Three distinct national championship tournaments are scheduled this month, and many teams will play in more than one. The National Tournament, with 48 teams, will be held in Ann Arbor, Mich., April 9 and 10. The College Bowl championship, featuring 16 teams, will be held in Gainesville, Fla., April 16 to 18. And a third group, the Academic Competitions Federation, has scheduled a 27-team event in Chicago on April 23 and 24.
Like any subculture, the quiz-bowl world has its peculiarities, legends, heroes, habits, intense debates and internal feuds. The Carleton team, which will appear in both the National Tournament and Academic Federation championships, eschews all College Bowl events because, the players say, the questions are too easy, the entry fees too high, the tournament rules too regimented. Players make reputations as cautious or quick on the buzzer, anticipating a question almost before it is asked. And though penalties are assessed for wrong answers, it is thought that being too aggressive is better than being too careful.
The most famous buzz was that of Robert Hentzel, now the president of the National Tournament, who in a practice session as a player at Iowa State University buzzed after hearing "Its pretext was. ... " with the correct answer: "The Crimean War." And everyone acknowledges that Andrew Yaphe (pronounced YAH-fay), a literature grad student at the University of Chicago, is the nation's leading player, but is he the best ever? Mr. Hilleman said that honor belonged to Tom Waters, now a history teacher, who played for Emory University and Armstrong State College between 1979 and 1986 and was a champion on the television show "Jeopardy." Mr. Hilleman added that Mr. Waters never lost a game; Mr. Yaphe, however, said he beat him in one.
"He's deified more than he should be," Mr. Yaphe noted. "But I don't like to make pronouncements about where I stand in the history of the game."
Mr. Yaphe said he doesn't prepare for tournaments because the game itself teaches you how to play. Questions in certain subjects echo one another.
"It's a heuristic process, " he said. "It's mimetic to a certain extent. Peter the Great is more important, than, say, Ivan II, so there will be more questions about him." If you know the answer is a Russian czar, therefore you can make a reasonable wager that it's Peter the Great, he said.
Quiz bowl is, for whatever reason, largely a male domain populated by the kind of person who doesn't mind calling himself a geek. The boys are wont to complain that they spend so many weekends at quiz-bowl events that they don't have a chance to meet girls. Carleton is unusual in that two members of its A team, Emily Pike, a senior biochemistry major, and Cheryl Klein, a junior English major, are women. At tournaments, Ms. Pike said, "I get a lot of offers for dates." As far as anyone knows, Andrew Ulland, a 21-year-old economics senior who was captain of the Carleton football team and is the B team's quiz-bowl captain, is the only varsity athlete who also competes at quiz bowl.
"I've been playing football since I could walk," Mr. Ulland said. "It's what I do. Saturday afternoons in the fall, it's life and death for me. You have to be a little more restrained to play quiz bowl. It's a different kind of excitement, but I do tend to pound the table a lot." Asked if his football teammates tease him for playing quiz bowl, he laughed. "Actually, I get more comments from quiz-bowl players about my football playing than I do from football players about quiz bowl."
Each week, results of tournaments and collegiate rankings are sped around the country on the Internet; the quality of the tournament questions are discussed in fervid E-mail postings: "Too many hockey questions!" Serious competitors spend much of their free time "taking questions," as they say. They're kids who know the composer, the characters and the plot of every important opera written in the past three centuries but who have never been to see one. On the other hand, "When I came here, I didn't know anything about music and art," Andy Felton, a junior English major, said. "I started studying them because of quiz bowl and I'm grateful I did, because I like them. Now I study them because I want to." They're proud of their talents, their wide familiarity with factoids and their ability to recall them instantaneously, but they also see the humor in it.
"An obsession?" asked Ms. Klein, who was engaged in the memorization of all United States Senators. "Yeah. Sad but true." Like many other quiz-bowl teams, Carleton receives modest financial support from the college. (The team travels in its own van, for one.) Beyond that, it has the advantage of being coached by Mr. Hilleman, the college archivist by occupation and a fierce quiz bowler by predilection. Mr. Hilleman, who plays in masters tournaments and is known, by his gift for high-speed articulation, as perhaps the finest quiz-bowl moderator in the country, maintains in his office what he says is the largest library of quiz-bowl questions in the world --- thousands of them, gleaned from tournaments.
"What does skill in quiz bowl measure?" said Mr. Hilleman, who studied religion and history at Brown University and the University of Wisconsin. "Skill at quiz bowl." He laughed. "To some degree, it measures knowledge, memory, some elements of reflex. Intelligence apart from knowledge doesn't come into it much, except in terms of decoding the language of questions and anticipating where a question is going." Still, he pointed out that knowledge is not such a bad thing. True enough. In an age when intellectualism is often demonized and Forrest Gump is a hero, "formal knowledge tends to be undervalued," he said, "and it's not like it exists at the expense of thinking. You don't do one without the other."
For the uninitiated, a primer is probably necessary, because apprehending the quiz-bowl landscape is an arcane intelligence test all its own. The National Tournament and the Academic Federation are newcomers started by quiz-bowl players whose habits were not being sufficiently fed.
The Academic Federation was founded in 1990 by players from the Universities of Maryland and Tennessee who wanted to redefine the College Bowl format. The games are played without a time clock. Instead, they are based on a specific number of questions, which are longer than other formats', yielding their clues in tinier increments. The Federation shuns sports and popular culture, concentrating instead on academic subjects, with the questions considered more difficult than other formats. And though the original organization disbanded in 1997, it has since been revived. Tournaments are organized by a host team, which edits questions that are supplied, as part of an entry requirement, by competing teams.
The National Tournament, which has commercial aspirations and is seeking corporate sponsors, was founded in 1995 by a group of 10 players, including the legendary Mr. Waters, from a variety of schools. It is led by David Frazee, who was a University of Michigan law student and is now a lawyer in San Francisco. The core group is 13 players who write about 12,000 questions annually for tournament kits, which they peddle for $225. (In a standard kit, there are 20 packets, or one packet per game, each with 28 tossup questions and 28 bonuses.) All tournaments take different forms, but the most popular is a round-robin event with every team playing every other team, the top finishers playing off head-to-head.
The National Tournament is administered from a home office by Mr. Hentzel, a computer consultant in Kansas City, Mo., and former quiz-bowl player at Iowa State University who said he writes about 2,000 questions a year. The questions are distributed among academic subjects, sports, pop culture and current events and steer clear of the giveaways, even at the ends of questions, that the College Bowl often indulges in, infuriating purists.
"There was a famous one in 1988," said Michael Zarren, the captain of the University of Chicago team, which is considered the nation's strongest. "It began with some obscure description of a tropical plant, and then finished with, 'For 10 points, name this curved yellow fruit.' "
Still, there are disputes about questions that begin cleverly, trying to mislead competitors, like the one beginning with a reference to Hester Prynne in Hawthorne's "Scarlet Letter" but whose answer is an animal substance used in making buttons -- "mother of pearl." Disdainful players call that "a hose question."
Mr. Hentzel says he doesn't take the fee -- the National Tournament pays 75 cents a question. "In theory, we're for-profit, but we're not doing particularly well at that," he said. "Principally, we do this because we love it."
About 55 colleges and 200 high schools, he said, competed in National Tournament events last year. These are usually timed games divided into nine-minute halves -- which is why the moderator is so important. Someone who can read aloud and be understood at high speed gets through more questions -- why accomplished moderators like Mr. Hilleman and Mr. Hentzel are so valued. "Bob takes pride in finishing a packet before time expires," said Andy Felton, an English major on the Carleton team.
The granddaddy of the quiz-bowl groups is, of course, the College Bowl Company, a small, privately held business in Los Angeles managed by Richard Reid, a television producer whose father, Donald, invented the game in the 1940's. The company, which employs two full-time question-writers, does its own research, writing and editing of questions for its game packets; these are sold to colleges and high schools for $60.
College Bowl's questions are considered the easiest of three formats, with ample pop culture and current events to make it more marketable, a game more people can play. The company administers college tournaments, including the Honda Campus All-Star Challenge for historically black colleges, at one time televised on the Black Entertainment Television cable network. A version of the game is currently played on television in Britain, and the younger Mr. Reid -- his father died in 1996 -- has been trying to get it back on television in this country.
"This isn't sex, drugs and rock-and-roll, and that's what people really want to buy," Mr. Reid said. "So you look for ways to make it sexy, so the new design is different, you have the players competing for money, for themselves and their schools. The object for a new version of College Bowl is to make it a game of today rather than yesterday."
The animosity between College Bowl and the National Tournament boils down to the former believing the latter to be a usurper of intellectual property, and the latter snorting at the idea that questions and answers can be copyrighted.
"They're not threatening the franchise, so long as they're doing it as a hobby," said Mr. Reid, who said he has decided against suing for the time being. "But if I read in the paper that I.B.M. is doing a TV show with National, I'll sue them."
The College Bowl surfaced on the airwaves between 1953 and 1957, when it began a four-year run on the radio, sponsored by Good Housekeeping magazine. In 1959, the game was licensed to General Electric. With such a powerful sponsor, it became a staple of network television, broadcast live for most of its life at 5:30 Sundays on CBS.
When it went dark in 1970, a casualty of the expanded Sunday reach of pro football and G.E.'s consequent withdrawal as a sponsor, the company more or less became moribund.
"We were basically a TV company, and as with everybody else in the universe, when you do something you love, the notion that it has gone away dies hard," said Mr. Reid, who at that point was producing television shows in Canada. "My father still had offices, and in 1975, he got ill, and I came back to help him, though I didn't know what helping him really meant."
A fortuitous phone call from Michael Decker, who was running a quiz-bowl tournament for fun at Emory University in Atlanta, sparked the proverbial light bulb of an idea. Mr. Decker, who has since become College Bowl's head question-writer, invited Mr. Reid to the tournament and persuaded him that running tournaments on college campuses -- syndicating the game -- could revive the business. In 1976, Mr. Reid and his father struck a partnership with the Association of College Unions International, a nonprofit group that coordinates activities on college campuses. Within a year, College Bowl was on 250 American campuses.
The phenomenon has been growing ever since.
The National Tournament regional championships took place on seven campuses on Feb. 12 and 13. The Midwest regional, held at the University of Iowa, was typical: For two days, the teams shuttled from one classroom to another, gathering around tables, answering 18 minutes' worth of questions read by volunteer moderators, most of them students themselves, performing to otherwise empty rooms.
Much of it was mundane. Teams collected in lounges between rounds for post-mortems and practice sessions. The disqualified participants attended the semifinals and finals and supplied some drama with appreciative gasps at any courageously early buzz, but there was no surprise at the outcome. It was won by the University of Chicago, with Mr. Yaphe leading.
The Carleton A team finished third, behind the University of Illinois, but first among undergraduate teams, earning a place in the national championship tournament. It lost to Chicago in the semifinal match, 405 to 170, termed "a respectable loss" by Ms. Klein but leaving Ms. Pike lamenting Chicago's sweep of questions concerning Greek and Roman mythology and muttering, "I should reread my Edith Hamilton."
Indeed, what was striking was the competitive juices and the coming to grips with winning and losing, which are, after all, a part of any rounded education.
"I consider quiz bowl a sport, the same way bridge and chess are sports," said Steve Jenkins, a junior majoring in English on the Carleton A team. "We certainly practice as much as any athlete, and we have as much dedication." And, Ms. Pike said, "It does make you sweat."
Mr. Yaphe had the victor's perspective. At 22, speaking with the weary air of an accustomed champion, he said that he had known the answers to 90 percent of the tossup questions. "And I would say, very arrogantly, that I know more than anyone else at this tournament."
Asked if he considered quiz bowl a sport, he said no, "a hobby or a game, though there's a certain willpower inherent in all sports that to a certain extent finds its parallel here." He said college-level competitions were becoming less and less challenging for him. So why does he do it? Ego? "Almost entirely," he said. "I keep playing because I like to win."

 CORRECTION:
Because of a transcription error, a sample question in the special Education Life section on Sunday, with an article about college quiz bowls, misstated Leonhard Euler's polyhedron formula and his birthplace. The formula is is V + F - E = 2 (not V + E - F = 2); the birthplace was Switzerland, not Sweden.

Chart: "Think Fast! Questions From College Quizdom"
 
From the College Bowl Company:
 
Tossup: In the original story by Collodi, this title character squashed the life out of his sidekick to silence him. The Disney version gave him a much kinder, gentler relationship with that cricket. For 10 points, who was this bad-boy marionette?
(Answer: Pinocchio)
 
Bonus: He was a gamekeeper from Derbyshire employed by Clifford, whose affair with Clifford's wife, Constance, results in her pregnancy and ends her marriage. The literary account of their story resulted in a celebrated 1960 obscenity trial. For 15 points apiece, what was Clifford and Constance's married last name?(Answer: Chatterley) What was the name of the gamekeeper, Lady Chatterley's lover? (Answer: Oliver Mellors)
 
From the National Academic Quiz Tournament (extra points given for an answer before the asterisk ):
 
Tossup: Though Archimedes and Descartes worked extensively in geometry, their work almost entirely dealt with measurement, and both missed the simple formula V plus E* minus F equals 2, which this man later discovered. Before this he began work in the field of topology in his solution to the Konigsberg Bridge Problem. For 10 points, identify this Swedish-born mathematician.
(Answer: Leonhard Euler)
 
Bonus: The element calcium is part of several of the first members of Mohs' hardness scale. For 10 points apiece, identify the anion in each of the following: gypsum (answer: sulfate); calcite (answer: carbonate); fluorite (answer: fluoride).
 
From the Academic Competitions Federation:
 
Tossup: The crocodiles on this river are the largest in the world, over 20 feet long. It is also home to a 200-pound catfish called the laulao, and to vicious piranhas. The name is from Guaran 1/4, meaning "a place to paddle," and it flows in a great arc from its source in the Guiana Highlands to its mouth on the Atlantic Ocean. For 10 points, identify this South American river, which forms part of the border between Colombia and Venezuela. (Answer: the Orinoco)
 
Bonus: Consider the consonants P, Z, K, F and T.

HEADLINE: Evil's Interrogator

BYLINE: By Isabel Hilton; Isabel Hilton is a writer and documentary filmmaker who lives in London. This is her first article for the magazine.

 BODY:
Gitta Sereny is sitting deep in an armchair. She is dressed in slacks and a simple polo-necked sweater, her hair freshly washed. She gives me a long look. "Well," she says, "do your worst." We are sitting in the living room of her apartment on an anonymous block in Kensington, in West London. It is a comfortable room in the corner of the building, and the morning light is streaming in. The pure notes of Cecilia Bartoli, playing on the stereo, float discreetly in the background, and the air is scented with the coffee that Gitta's husband, Don Honeyman, has just placed on the low table between us.
We have been acquainted for many years, but now she seems wary, bruised by what she regards as an excess of the wrong kind of attention during the row that surrounded the publication in England last year of her latest book, "Cries Unheard," the story of Mary Bell, who as a 10-year-old in 1968 killed one boy, age 4, and two months later another one, age 3, for no apparent reason. The book is soon to be published in the United States, and Sereny is anxious to avoid a repetition of the controversy. 
 The uproar began last April, shortly before the book's publication, when The Observer ran an article revealing the project. Nine days later, The Guardian reported that Sereny had paid Mary Bell 50,000 from her advance to collaborate on the book. Sereny acknowledged a payment, though both she and her publishers describe the figure as "wholly invented." ("That's not to say," says one insider, "that the true figure was necessarily less than that.") The issue, for the less than morally consistent British press, became one of whether Mary Bell should be permitted to "profit" from the killing of two little boys 30 years before.
There are few sights less edifying than a press pack on a moral cavalry charge. Sereny's apartment was under siege, and her telephone records, apparently illegally acquired, were being combed for clues as to Bell's whereabouts. Since her release from prison, Bell had changed her name and (several times) her address. Until she signed the book deal, she was living on public assistance with her partner and her daughter, then 11 years old. The child was a ward of the court, and the family was protected by an official injunction that banned the press from revealing the child's identity and, therefore, her mother's.
Nevertheless, within days, journalists were encamped outside Bell's house and were knocking on other doors on the street to inform the startled residents that they had a child killer for a neighbor. Bell and her bewildered daughter were forced to flee, and as they escaped, Bell found herself obliged to explain to her child the dreadful secret of her past. By Sereny's account, the child took it calmly. Sereny, meanwhile, was denounced by the families of Bell's victims, by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and by the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, and she was pilloried in the tabloid press.
It was the worst of results, as Sereny admits. She had wanted to explain the murders by exploring Bell's own traumatic childhood -- an appalling catalogue of neglect and physical and sexual abuse -- and to demonstrate how the English system of justice had failed her. Not only had Bell received no help from social welfare agencies before the killings but she also had received little after her conviction. That message, though, was drowned in the clamor.
Sereny has never been afraid of controversy. In her long career as a writer and journalist, she has provoked criticism for her philosophy (people are born good and corrupted by society), her methods (helping her subjects "discover" their propensity for evil through interviews that most closely resemble psychotherapy) and her courageous refusal to demonize people who have done great wrongs. Sereny is fascinated not only by the fact of evil but also by the possibility of redemption. Each is equally mystifying. In the last analysis, it is this deep belief in the possibility of redemption that gets the critics' teeth grinding and sends the tabloid press into a fury.
The case of Mary Bell has been notorious in England ever since her trial in 1968 and is clearly still relevant today. The question of what makes children kill was raised starkly once again in England in 1993, when two 10-year-olds murdered a toddler named James Bulger, and in the United States, in 1997 and 1998, when, in a string of attacks, 6 schoolboys killed 5 adults and 12 children.
Mary Bell's co-defendant was a 13-year-old neighbor, named, coincidentally, Norma Bell. The two children behaved in markedly different ways throughout the ordeal. Norma sobbed and was patently distressed. Mary was quiet, unemotional, even in the face of a coroner's finding that one of the boys had been strangled, scratched with a razor blade and cut with a scissors. Compression marks on the strangled boy's throat were light, the report stated, as were his wounds, facts that pointed strongly to a child murderer.
Norma was acquitted and public interest in her faded. Mary was convicted of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. Her conviction, and her apparent serenity, insured her being engraved in the public mind as a monster -- that most terrifying betrayal of the adult desire for innocence in children, a child who killed and seemingly felt no remorse.
Sereny, who covered the trial for The Times of London, was profoundly disturbed at the sight of the silent, calm child being tried in an adult court for appalling crimes, which the criminal justice process had failed to explain. Sereny wrote "The Case of Mary Bell," published in 1972, in which she explored these failures.
She stuck close to the police facts, adding chilling details about Mary's childhood that were barred from the courtroom: how her mother, a prostitute, had tried to give Mary away after she was born; how, forced to keep the child, she had tried to poison her on several occasions. (Later, in "Cries Unheard," Sereny revealed that Mary's mother beat her regularly and at the slightest provocation and, most horrifically, that she forced Mary as a 4-, 5- and 6-year-old to perform sex acts for her clientele.) Mary Bell disappeared into the prison system (she was released in 1980) and Sereny moved on. But as Sereny embarked on what became her life's work, the connection with Bell returned.
Just two years after "The Case of Mary Bell," Sereny published what is, for many, the best of her books, "Into That Darkness," a biography of Franz Stangl, the commandant of the Treblinka death camp, where an estimated 870,000 were killed. It was her first major venture into the territory she has inhabited ever since -- the exploration and explanation of the origins of evil. She picked Stangl -- whom she came upon in 1967 while writing about the German war-crimes trials -- because "he seemed less primitive, more open, serious and sad" than the others. She interviewed him in his prison cell for about 100 hours. The day after she finished, he died.
"Into That Darkness" earned Sereny respect and acclaim. "Gitta hadn't got into such a habit of writing about evil things then," says Diana Athill, who edited the book for Andre Deutsch. "I think perhaps she did it best the first time." The book also raised, for some reviewers, a question about Sereny's method and the relationship she established with her subject, which was to be posed more forcefully in later works. Sereny believes that by exploring the personality and early life -- an exercise drawn from psychotherapy, which can be properly undertaken only with the cooperation of the subject -- later actions become explicable. She admits that there is a relationship between her work and therapy but is careful to maintain her distance.
Sereny has not written about psychotherapy, and she claims no expertise. She acknowledges that a therapist wants to help the patient while she engages in the exercise for herself, because "I want to know the reasons for human or inhuman actions -- and write about them."
One therapist familiar with her work questioned Sereny's perception of what she does. "The point of training in psychotherapy is to understand how, as a therapist, you use your patients to explore your own story," says James Pollard, the chairman of the Center for Attachment-Based Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in London. "The training helps you to see how you do it, and through that you learn to see beyond it, to the person. It must be an open question how much Gitta is doing that and how aware she is of what she is doing." Most critics thought she had achieved her stated purpose in "Into That Darkness" -- to penetrate the personality of at least one of the people who had been intimately associated with this total evil," as she wrote in the preface to the 1991 edition. A few, however, disagreed.
Lucy Dawidowicz, in a hostile review in The Times Literary Supplement, accused Sereny of providing only "the naked raw material of Stangl's conversation -- lies interwoven with truth -- without the corrective depth of historical perspective, without the unsentimental focus of psychiatric analysis." In the book, Sereny claims that Stangl's admission of guilt to her was so painful that it killed him. Dawidowicz regarded this claim as "a triumph of sentimentality over reality."
Sereny's approach is based on her own fundamental belief that a child is born good and made evil. Understand the mechanism, therefore, and you understand the person. It borrows the assumptions of therapy without, of course, the confidentiality -- or the healing -- that therapy involves. As Pollard observes: "The therapist tries to help the patient to integrate ethics and judgment into his or her own life. Gitta is reserving the ethics and judgment for herself." Dawidowicz accused Sereny of failing on this point too -- of allowing Stangl a humanity he did not have, of befriending him, in effect. Sereny absolutely rejects the charge. "I loathed Stangl," she says, her face stern with the memory. "I was glad he died. He needed to be dead."
There followed a book on child prostitution, but it was with "Albert Speer: His Battle With Truth," a 700-plus-page psychobiography of Hitler's favorite architect, that Sereny established herself as one of the most interesting writers on the Nazi period. It was a project that lasted more than 12 years and remains her major achievement. Still, some critics feel her portrait of Speer was too sympathetic.
Albert Speer ran the munitions factories in which tens of thousands of slave workers died. Tried at Nuremberg, where he professed ignorance of the Holocaust, Speer spent 20 years in Spandau prison, then lived in retirement in Heidelberg until his death in 1981. Sereny concluded that Speer, despite a lifetime of denial, had known of, and consented to, the final solution. It did not prevent her from admiring and liking him, not least for what she saw as his struggle with his own tortured conscience.
As Sereny has admitted, she became very close to Speer. "I think Gitta does tend to fall in love with her subject," Diana Athill says. "It's part of her success. She brings to bear this very intense interest, and she can make people talk about anything. I think she was incredibly in love with Speer while she was doing it, though she did get through that phase eventually."
Sereny, while balking at the notion that she literally falls in love with her subjects, doesn't deny that the relationships become very close. In fact, that is the essence of her method. "There are people who write that I become too emotionally involved," she says. "But how on earth could you not be? I have experience of detachment, but you must give when giving is right. If not, you are not human. Speer was easy because it was an intellectual battle. I really enjoyed challenging and helping him to come to more of the truth. He was interested in me because here was this woman who was on intellectual terms with him. He was not interested in me as a woman -- he preferred totally nonintellectual women."
Sereny defends her methods on the basis of her moral purpose and her pursuit of the truth. And she never doubts that the truth is finally what she achieves. "Gitta always thinks she'll find the motive," says Ian Jack, editor of the literary magazine Granta. "I'm not sure there always is one. But Gitta is someone who becomes more certain, rather than less, that she knows the absolute truth."
That certainty became even more important to Sereny with "Cries Unheard," the first book to embroil her in a major public scandal. Sereny is unrepentant about the immediate excuse for the scandal -- the payment to Bell. She points out that the newspapers that accused her the loudest had themselves offered Bell cash for her story. But there are other layers to the debate that are less easily dismissed and that touch on the sensitive issue of purpose.
Bell wanted to sell her story to buy a house and escape from her dependency on public assistance. Sereny, for her part, wanted to explore and publish an account of Bell's internal world. To what extent did her action benefit or further damage a woman who had, acccording to Sereny, already suffered too much? To what extent, in other words, was Sereny exploiting her?
When they first discussed the book, Sereny told Bell that the book would do her harm and that Bell would be better served by talking to a psychiatrist. Few would disagree, but Bell -- who had been schooled by her mother to distrust psychiatrists -- refused to consider therapy. Bell shares with Stangl and Speer, no doubt unfairly, the status of notorious public figure, but unlike them she is still alive. Revealing her internal world was to have painful consequences for her, her daughter and the families of her victims. Nevertheless, Sereny insists, her aim in writing the book was to right a systematic wrong.
"What's important to me," Sereny says, "is that the true purpose of the book is recognized -- to change the system of having children tried in adult courts. We have never before had a former child killer tell us what it means. The system is crazy: no treatment is offered, and the British and Canadian systems don't even allow for a child to have psychological help. In this tabloid, popular culture, we have the idea that these people are evil forever -- whatever they try." As to why more and more children kill -- or why one traumatized child kills and not another -- Sereny acknowledges that she does not know.
Sereny believes strongly in redemption, not as a religious concept but as a psychological process -- as she puts it to me, "the personal battle to become different." In both the Stangl and the Speer books, it is important to her that, in her view, both men came closer to acknowledging their responsibility than they would have done had she not intervened. In Stangl's case, she contends, the insight killed him.
Sereny herself is clearly bruised by the Bell affair. Now she is seeking her own redemption in the justification of the book's purpose. She has thrown herself into campaigning for a change in the judicial approach to children who commit major crimes, addressing audiences of lawyers, child psychiatrists -- anyone who might help to bring about reform. And there's little question that changes are needed. Last month, the European Commission of Human Rights ruled that the defendants in the 1993 case of James Bulger had been unfairly tried as adults and referred their case to the European Court of Human Rights. If the court agrees, England will be obliged to change its system.
Getting results is important to her, to exorcise both the scandal and the charge that she exploits her subjects. "I do not lie to them," she says of her subjects. "I have to tell them where I am with them and where I am not. I tell them at the outset how I feel. I cannot do what I do with people who are not looking for something in themselves. I am not interested in monsters." Sereny says she has refused to write about two other notorious British murderers, Rosemary West (currently serving a life sentence for a gruesome series of sex killings committed with her husband, Frederick West) and Myra Hindley (who, with her lover, Ian Brady, was convicted in the 60's of a series of sadistic child murders on the Yorkshire moors). Neither, Sereny feels, has shown sufficient remorse to be of interest to her. Without that remorse, the attempt to explain evil -- Sereny's consuming passion -- is impossible.
There is no particular mystery, Sereny contends, in her desire to understand evil. Her own early life, after all, was shaped by one of the century's greatest evils, the Third Reich, and by the Second World War. She was born in Vienna in 1923, the daughter of a beautiful Austrian actress and a Hungarian landowner who died of cancer when Sereny was 2. At 11, between trains in Nuremberg, she attended Hitler's Nuremberg rally and was overwhelmed by the beauty and majesty of the display. She was moved, too, when she heard Hitler speak in Vienna after the Anschluss and found herself affected by the excitement of the crowd. But soon there were other sights: the Jewish doctor who had saved her life forced to scrub pavements with a toothbrush, the swastikas that some of her classmates wore.
Then, abruptly, the comfort and privilege of her own life was threatened. By the time of the Anschluss, her mother was engaged to the economist Ludwig von Mises. One day, her mother received a tip from a German friend that she was to be arrested and held to force von Mises, who was both Jewish and a prominent critic of the Nazi regime, to return to Austria from Switzerland. Sereny's mother fled with her daughter from Vienna to Switzerland. There, Sereny was put in a finishing school but promptly ran away, first to London, then to Paris. Her mother and von Mises moved, prudently, to the United States shortly after the war broke out, but Sereny remained in France and worked with orphans.
Soon it was her turn to be warned, by a friendly German officer, that arrest was imminent, and she fled across the Pyrenees to Spain, then on to the States. Four months before the war ended, she returned to Europe to join the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration as a child-welfare officer. This early biography provides an explanation of sorts: why should an intelligent and independent-minded young woman who has experienced the horrors of the Third Reich at close quarters not feel the need of an explanation?
"If you accept that an individual reveals more of him- or herself than anyone else can do, the progression of Gitta's work is interesting," James Pollard says. "The villains have got softer, more deserving of understanding, closer perhaps to her own experience as a girl."
That experience, Sereny insisted to the radio psychiatrist Antony Clare in a recent BBC interview, is private, though it affords a glimpse of tantalizing material for Sereny's own psychobiography and her all-consuming interest in large moral questions. Her vain and difficult mother, a woman she described as being "without moral opinions," the elder brother who left home at 18 and whom she scarcely knew, the early death of her father and Sereny's own acknowledged search for figures who could provide her with a moral or emotional compass -- all this is, in Sereny's words, territory about which she is uncurious.
That does not, of course, invalidate her achievement, but it does raise the tempting question of Sereny's own extraordinary personal history and its relationship to her work. For Sereny, that is off-limits. Asked when she will write her autobiography, her answer is characteristically forthright. "Never," she says.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 4-4-99;
Crashing the Academy

BYLINE: By Mark Edmundson; Mark Edmundson is a professor of English at the University of Virginia.

 BODY:
When it comes to mechanics and technology, I have always fit the cliched bill of the longtime professor of English, the sort of person capable of fracturing a light bulb's innocent neck during installation. But there has been one exception to my losing war against all tech, high and low: computers, which, through word processing and info-tracking, place the powers of Prospero at one's fingertips. And I'm not alone: purportedly technophobic humanities teachers, English professors in particular, have led the way in bringing computers into class. Amazon.com, course Web sites and on-line student discussion groups are now mainstays of humanities teaching. But it seems the tables are turning. Prospero's Ariel seems to be morphing into Caliban: as technological and market pressures outpace our humble efforts to digitize, it becomes increasingly possible that our precious computers will consign us to early retirement.
It's a very real threat, both to the foundations of higher learning and to the professors who dedicate their life to the cause. It's also the best thing to happen to us in ages. 
 The auguries are hard to miss. An entity called Jones International University has just become the first accredited college to offer courses exclusively over the Internet. Its 12 undergraduates and 64 master's students (more are sure to follow) can choose from 37 communications courses -- all for about $4,000 a year. At more traditional universities, by contrast, the rate of increase for tuitions this year was more than twice that of inflation. Legitimate students might well begin to wonder, Why blow all that money on a private, campus-bound university when a credible education is available for a fraction of the cost on line?
In turn, even first-rank schools will soon be positioning themselves to compete with Jones U. U.C.L.A. already recommends to its faculty that every course in the College of Letters and Science have a Web site. The next big step will probably be posting course material on the Net. And after that, universities could sell courses on the open market, delivering the product at reduced rates to anyone with a modem. Once that happens, they might as well sell off the campuses and replace the professors with Web-maintenance crews.
It's not so hard to make a case for that plan, actually. The move to on-line higher education would seem on the face of it to be highly democratizing. Regardless of where they live or what their life circumstances are, students could have access to the best courses, call forth lectures by the best professors and do what all students need eventually learn to do: educate themselves. And my colleagues in almost every discipline are already turning away from subjective, messy interpretation and speculative theory, instead focusing on quantitative, fact-based research. In other words, professors themselves are teaching precisely the kind of material that computers are made to deliver. So why not let the computers run the show altogether?
Nevertheless, on-line education's greatest contribution to the academy won't be its efficiency or its accessibility. More important by far, if all goes well, it will provoke the crisis that we humanities professors have been waiting for -- and which we desperately need. It will force us to decide whether we are going to continue our current evolution into mere conveyors of knowledge, or become seekers after something akin to wisdom. For if students come to us in the future cyber-dominated world, it will be not because we know things (the machines will know more), but for precisely those qualities that computers can never have: our ability to pose crucial questions, and also to venture answers to them.
I see it in my own work. The presence of computers has pushed me to be interested not only in facts and interpretations, but also in truth. I ask students now not just what Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey" means (difficult question though that surely is), but if it conveys a knowledge that they can use. The poem, which is about deep despondency -- a condition not unknown to my students in the age of Prozac -- prescribes a highly disciplined, subtle form of recollection as a way to spiritual equanimity. Should you do it, follow Wordsworth's path in times of trial? Can it work? If not for everyone in the room, then for some?
What I'm describing may sound like standard old-hat humanism. But in fact, it's a radical project that has never really got under way. Critics like Leslie Fiedler and Northrop Frye (in their very different ways the descendants of the now unfashionable Matthew Arnold, who predicted that literature would replace religious faith as a source of spiritual sustenance) came closest. In the 1950's and 1960's, they uncovered complexes of myth, culled from a wide span of literature, and forcefully argued that those myths provided a key to general human desires, hopes, hatreds and anxieties. But their stunningly complex (and flawed) project died, cut off by the rise of skeptical theory and the knee-jerk reaction against all hopes for literary knowledge.
The advent of computers, and the rise of places like Jones University, have put higher education at a crossroads. Professors can become more interested in knowledge without regard to wisdom, becoming more computerlike, and thus irrelevant, or we can take a few more steps down the road that Frye and Fiedler -- and Socrates -- opened up for us. If we do that with conviction and due modesty, we'll have no trouble keeping up with the Joneses, and achieving a good deal more besides.

FALLING
 The Story of One Marriage.
 By John Taylor.
 225 pp. New York:
 Random House. $22.95. 
 It may be hazardous to take sides when a marriage breaks apart, but it's irresistible. John Taylor is a former senior writer for Esquire magazine and the author of "Storming the Magic Kingdom," and "Falling" is his ironic account, written from a "male perspective," of just how distressing it can be to get divorced. The book, a specimen of an emerging genre -- caricature of the illogic of misalliance or satire about the painful experience of marital demise -- is discordant and unsettling, and the results are mixed.
The author opines, philosophically and ambivalently, about the fragility, even pointlessness, of old-fashioned Victorian ideals like duty, sacrifice and commitment. He tells his story and hers too. And he derides or burlesques almost everything in sight: liberated women, marriage counselors, trial separations, mediated settlements, even the various women with whom he had extramarital affairs. Consider Jill, for example, the impulsive artist from Oregon who was always being overtaken by some terribly important "new enthusiasm," like building a meditation pyramid for the homeless, and who treated him as one of her "new projects." There is probably nothing Taylor could have done about the failure of his marriage. But let us at least hold him responsible for the failure of his irony, which all too often evolves into sarcasm, leaving the reader with the impression that a bitter lampooner might be far more difficult to live with than a resentful wife.
The resentful wife is Maureen, an older woman (she was 34 when they married; he was 28), an Englishwoman (he is American), a Jewish woman (he is Unitarian). Before the marriage she was liberated, cosmopolitan, self-confident and employed. By the time their union dissolved, 11 years later, she had become a lapsed writer, a frustrated, unemployed parent trapped by her own opinion that work is unfulfilling and motherhood unchic. Taylor, always the ironist at heart, represents Maureen as a byproduct of our times. There he is, ready to bail out. There she is, metamorphosed into a dependent spouse whose only remaining ideal of liberation is her sense of entitlement to lifetime maintenance.
Taylor can be effective with his quips and retorts: "Failure can be gratifying, even liberating; it relieves you of the need to aspire"; "I'd had an affair to escape the burden of marriage, and the affair had become as burdensome as the marriage." There are times when his one-liners make you smile: "Ed and Meg had four children, a family so unusually large by the standards of the neighborhood that it was as if they practiced some archaic religion." Some of his descriptions ring all too true. Here is his Darwinian stockbroker's advice on the survival of the fittest: "You know what's the object in a divorce? . . . Pre-emptive retaliation. Here's what I want you to do. Clean out your bank account before she does it for you. Hide your assets." If you ever wondered whether Plato was right that a society designed by the wise would prohibit divorce, you may find yourself pondering the question again.
Perhaps Taylor will even succeed in getting you not to like him. He is an author who describes himself as "constitutionally ambivalent," as someone who "never developed the habit of honesty," as violent, as oppositional, as a man in search of a moral compass. And he employs a method of provocation that is not only aggressively ironic but also disorienting, almost by design, or perhaps by nature. The more he intermingles mordacious taunts with apparently earnest reflections on the feelings and choices of a man suffocated by a less than satisfying matrimony, the harder it is to take him seriously or to distinguish what's satirical from what's sincere. He composes a tribute to the glories of returning home to the atmosphere of a Victorian household. "I . . . kissed first my wife," he tells us, "and then my daughter, and as they returned to their tasks and I fixed myself a Scotch I was overtaken with a feeling of pure, exultant harmony." Feigned? Who's to know? His daughter, he's just noted, is sitting at "the old upright piano we bought for $100 and spent $500 to have moved and to whose yellowed ivory keys she had affixed animal stickers." Or he writes, seemingly straight-faced, "My wife had wanted to have a child, and now I thought she was doing what she wanted to do, staying home and looking after the baby while I worked to pay the bills, which was what I wanted to do." One begins to wonder, who is this masked man who seems so intent on forcing the reader to have doubts about even his sober voice?
A prominent Manhattan family lawyer, a friend of mine, once told me: "Men are weak; men are wrong. But if they stay in a failed marriage, it is usually for the kids, the money or out of a sense of duty." Taylor has many things to say about the kids, the money and the sense of duty -- for example, that if you invoke duty, perhaps "you hadn't thought the matter through." As for who's right and who's wrong. . . .

The pressure comes from National Public Radio, the network programmer on which many of the 700 public stations rely for a significant portion of their daily broadcasts. 
 Two weeks ago NPR, which itself relies on its member stations to finance its operations, struck an Internet deal with its largest affiliate, Minnesota Public Radio. The two organizations, which already operate individual Web sites (www.npr.org and www.mpr.org), intend to develop a collaborative on-line network that would open this summer.
The effort is meant to strengthen local stations' own Web sites, many of which now offer little more than a weekly programming chart. The planners say they will not compete with local stations by creating a public radio supersite or by transmitting Webcasts of radio programs (although local stations would have the option of Webcasting NPR programs from their own sites). Instead, the Web service would help stations around the country supplement over-the-air fare by offering on-line chats with program hosts, selling merchandise electronically and providing access to on-line audio archives.
The stated strategy is to convert on-line visitors into local listeners. Currently, half the visits to NPR's site are by individuals who are seeking information and are not yet regular listeners, according to NPR.
But many of the nation's public stations, which together are heard by some 28 million listeners weekly, see the NPR-Minnesota pact as a potential revenue-sapping threat that could siphon listeners from their broadcasts. Stations are increasingly reliant on listeners, who support public stations by paying to become members and are the basis of ratings to attract corporate underwriting.
"I'm really concerned about what happens to our members when they disappear into a national site," Marita Rivero, general manager of WGBH-FM in Boston, said during a recent telephone conference call in which managers of public stations discussed the planned venture.
In an attempt to reassure skeptics, Kevin Klose, NPR's president, said later in an interview, "Nothing we do will do anything but strengthen that relationship."
Compounding the stations' worries is an impending Oct. 1 deadline. That is when NPR, which dominates public radio's morning and evening drive-time with its news shows "Morning Edition" and "All Things Considered," will begin charging stations for its programming based on a station's audience size -- ending the network's time-honored, not-for-profit practice of assessing fees based on a station's operating budget.
The consequences will be felt in both small and large cities. For example, WNYC-FM in New York is the nation's largest public station, listened to by one million people each week. Though it ranks but No. 22 in the market, with only a 2.8 percent share in February, the station is able to attract corporate underwriters interested in appealing to a well-educated audience. And in populous New York, even a No. 22 ranking means a million listeners a week; on that basis, come October, the station's NPR fees, now $1.6 million a year, are certain to rise.
"We can't assume this kind of burden at this time," said Laura R. Walker, president and chief executive of the station, which is still struggling to pay off the license it bought for $20 million in 1997 from New York City. Ms. Walker also said the ratings-based fee model "doesn't recognize the value of the audience we bring to NPR, which they sell to their own underwriters."
The beneficiaries of the new programming payment system will probably be stations in rural areas, whose smaller audiences should mean that their payments to NPR will decline.
All of this is coming in a fiscal year in which the industry is forecasting that for the first time in public radio's three-decade history, at least half the $500 million annual cost of operating the nation's noncommercial stations will come from listener donations and corporate sponsors, instead of from public subsidies.
Abandoning the old egalitarian, pay-what-you-can system for a more market-driven fee structure is intended to create more accountability. And it should also mean that stations should be able to keep more of the proceeds when they create successful home-grown programming, rather than having to pay more to NPR simply because they have more money.
Ruth Seymour, general manager of KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, Calif., which has its own popular daily new music showcase, "Morning Becomes Eclectic," each day after NPR's "Morning Edition," said the incentives of the new network fee structure would probably cut both ways. Under the old payment system, she said, "NPR was being insulated from the success or failure of their product."
But in many cases, the changing economics of public radio are likely to speed up the industry's consolidation. Weak college-licensed stations, which are losing academic subsidies and in many cases are unable to build their audiences, are ceding independence and teaming up -- just as many commercial stations did when Federal station-ownership limits were lifted several years ago.
At Pasadena City College in California, for example, trustees are considering such a partnership for station KPCC, which lost money last year and is facing a 59 percent increase, to $236,000, for NPR news fees. A decision is possible as early as this month.
Minnesota Public Radio is bidding for management and licensing control of the Pasadena station. The Minnesota organization, which is public radio's largest member, is best known for producing Garrison Keillor's "Prairie Home Companion." Begun in 1966 by William H. Kling at a small, troubled college station, the St. Paul-based organization is now a $32 million, six-state media empire of 30 stations with a $110 million endowment.
"We feel we can copy that success in L.A.," Will Haddeland, a Minnesota Public Radio spokesman said, referring to the Pasadena station. The plan would be to remake KPCC into a news-talk station with a local news-gathering staff. In addition, MPR would help underwrite the establishment of a digital broadcast academy at the two-year college, with KPCC at its center.
The Minnesotans also see KPCC as a tap into a highly skilled Southern California broadcasting talent pool. "We have a difficult time recruiting qualified people to downtown St. Paul," Mr. Haddeland said.
The new pragmatism also explains the NPR-Minnesota Public Radio on-line alliance. The mouse-wielding multitudes from hundreds of public radio sites could be an alluring audience for on-line corporate underwriters.
Still, some NPR member stations fear the power of Minnesota Public Radio and its founder, Mr. Kling, who also runs a for-profit company, Greenspring. One of Greenspring's ventures was a catalogue, which sells public radio tie-in products and is distributed to listeners around the nation -- a business the company sold last year to the Dayton-Hudson Corporation for an estimated $120 million.
Public radio stations, which reaped no financial benefit from the deal, are worried that Mr. Kling may replicate that experience on line, said one station manager, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Mr. Kling, who also took part in the recent conference call, was asked how electronic-commerce revenue would be apportioned among stations. "It's not how we divide it up," he responded, "but build it up." More details about the plan are to be outlined in May at a public radio conference in Washington.
In any event, airwave rivalries are likely to carry over to the virtual world of the Web. One of NPR's prime programming challengers is Minneapolis-based Public Radio International, which distributes the daily business show "Marketplace" and a weekly narrative by Ira Glass, "This American Life," to many of the same stations that carry NPR programs.
Public Radio International does not yet have a Web presence. But it is developing on-line tools to allow searches of its own programming archives and also to let affiliate stations create indexed listings of their own self-produced programs. Public Radio International's partner in this effort is New Market Network, the Boston-based creator of for-profit, on-line sites for the producers of four public radio shows, including PRI's "Savvy Traveler."
"Stations can take as much or as little as they want," Mr. Salyer said. "Our goal is to provide the richest array of choices to the listening community."

HEADLINE: Mapping Out Silicon Valley East;
Asian Nations Build Hopes for Revival on Technology

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 2

 BODY:
Why would Richard Li live anywhere but this capitalist Klondike on the South China Sea?
After all, he was born here 32 years ago. His father, Li Ka-shing, is the biggest tycoon in town -- a rags-to-riches billionaire who just put up a monumental, 62-story headquarters in the heart of Hong Kong.
But his father's empire is tied to the mercantile moorings of trade and real estate. And the younger Mr. Li wants to build something else -- a technology venture that will deliver Internet access and other services to television sets and personal computers across Asia. Since announcing that grand plan a little more than a year ago, though, Mr. Li is finding that a good place to make money is not always a good place to nurture high-technology dreams. 
 Mr. Li has been unable to persuade the best young local software designers to live here while they develop the new service. One by one, they have fled the high-rise canyons of Hong Kong for the low-rise sprawl of Silicon Valley, where Mr. Li's venture partner, the Intel Corporation, is based.
"Have we caught our last one, or has he gone back to California as well?" Mr. Li asked a colleague sardonically, while discussing his plight last week. "We keep five apartments here, but they're empty because people keep going back."
For Mr. Li, the experience has brought home a bitter truth: Hong Kong is seen by many as a technology backwater. Expensive and lacking a critical mass of hardware or software manufacturers, it seems destined to be a bit player in the digital revolution.
Rather than leave for Silicon Valley himself, however, Mr. Li wants to haul Hong Kong into the information-technology mainstream. Last month, his company, Pacific Century Group, and the Hong Kong government announced a plan to build a $1.7 billion technology complex called Cyberport.
Cyberport is one of several futuristic technology parks that are rising from Taiwan to Singapore. With Asia mired in recession and the United States enjoying a high-technology boom, governments in this region have seized on technology as a way to recapture their growth. They regard these parks as potent marketing tools -- showcase projects that can help vault them into the digital age and perhaps even reverse a brain drain among their technology-minded youth.
"The crisis has forced countries to reassess their economic models," said Alexander A. Arena, the chief executive of Pacific Century's technology arm. "I see these projects as laying the foundation for the next spurt of growth."
The unanswered question, of course, is whether creating the architectural trappings of a high-technology settlement will induce creative software engineers and Web designers to occupy those gleaming new buildings.
Cyberport is typical of the concept. Designed as a pocket-size Silicon Valley, the office and residential park will sit on 64 acres on the southwest coast of Hong Kong island. Its mix of buildings and leafy parks will be an oasis in this densely populated city of 6.8 million.
With the government subsidizing the project by donating the land, office rents will be equal to those in the East Bay area of San Francisco. That is a 70 percent discount to market rates in Hong Kong's business district, where commercial rents are among the highest in the world.
So far, Mr. Li has signed I.B.M., Microsoft, Oracle and six other foreign companies as tenants. Eventually, he hopes that Cyberport will be home to 100 smaller companies -- many of them home-grown -- which he said should make Hong Kong a stimulating environment for even his own company's restless techies.
"The culture has to change," Mr. Li said. "If you don't attract people from outside and have some sort of leadership, it will never happen."
Other Asian technology parks have an uneven track record. Some, like the Hsinchu Science Industrial Park in Taiwan, built nearly two decades ago, are well-established mini-cities with hundreds of companies and thousands of residents. Others, like the Multimedia Super Corridor in Malaysia, are still construction sites.
In Hong Kong's case, Cyberport was conceived only after the Asian financial crisis laid bare the dangers of the territory's overdependence on real estate and financial services. Mr. Li broached the idea to Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, last year after Mr. Tung said in his policy address that he wanted to diversify the economy and make technology a new engine of growth.
"Hong Kong's claim to prosperity is through trade and financial services," said Otto Lin, the vice president for research at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. "All these advantages are gradually eroding, so Hong Kong has to find another road to prosperity."
Mr. Lin, a Taiwan-born academic who has advised the Governments of Taiwan and Singapore on technology policy, said Cyberport would "accentuate the need for technology."
But if Hong Kong is determined to catch up with its neighbors, he said it would have to change its business culture. Hong Kong's emphasis on short-term speculation has made local companies reluctant to invest in research and development because it does not generate a quick return.
Mr. Lin noted that spending on research and development in Hong Kong, for example, is only three-tenths of a percent of gross domestic product, compared with 1.4 percent in Singapore, 1.7 percent in Taiwan, and 2.8 percent in the United States.
Describing the attitude of Hong Kong business people, H. K. Chang, is president of City University of Hong Kong, said: "I have noticed a change from deep skepticism to open-mindedness. But I don't think any of them have become true, avid advocates of technology."
That is in sharp contrast to Taiwan, which has been pouring public funds into technology for about two decades. Focusing first on serving multinational companies, Taipei has concentrated in recent years on developing smaller, indigenous companies. Today, native companies like Acer Inc. have turned Taiwan into one of the world's biggest producers of computer components.
To jump-start the industry, Taiwan opened the Hsinchu science park in late 1980 in a rural area north of Taipei. After four expansions, it is now a 1,485-acre complex with 68,400 employees and 245 companies. In 1997, the combined revenue of the park's companies was $13 billion.
Technology experts note that Taiwan emphasizes more than bricks and mortar. It has also placed a lot of emphasis on teaching technology in its schools, colleges and universities. That has helped entice Taiwan researchers, many of whom had left for the United States, to return home.
Experts say Hong Kong must retool its educational system not only to play up technology but also to promote more creative thinking.
"Education in Hong Kong is based on rote learning," said Wilson Tang, a civil engineering professor at the University of Science and Technology here. "Students believe that everything has a single answer," he said. "When something comes up that they haven't encountered before, they tremble."
For his part, the aspiring Mr. Li, who majored in computer engineering at Stanford University, likens the typical Hong Kong college graduate to a "violinist who is technically very good, but there's no inspiration."
Yet it is not just a matter of training young people to be more innovative. Hong Kong has five major universities, which turn out 5,000 to 6,000 technology graduates a year. But it provides scant job opportunities for them. Although I.B.M., Dell Computer and other major computer companies have offices here, they tend to focus on sales and marketing.
Partly that is due to Hong Kong's high costs. Intel and Dell have both built manufacturing plants in Malaysia, where labor costs are much lower, while I.B.M. is setting up a chip-design center in Singapore. Singapore may also land Dell's Internet sales operation for Asia, which Dell is intent on moving from Japan to a more central location in the region.
"Singapore is very aggressive in terms of grants and tax incentives," said Mark Stevens, the corporate vice president of Dell's Asia-Pacific group. "With Singapore, we are pulled to put things here."
Last fall, the Singapore Government announced plans to build its own high-technology Xanadu -- a $2.9 billion complex called Science Hub, which will encompass two existing science parks and two universities. The project, scheduled to take 15 years to complete, will have 20,000 employees.
Cyberport is more modest. It is designed to accommodate 12,000 employees by 2003 and will not expand beyond its patch of land. But Mr. Arena, who is directing the project for Mr. Li, said the more intimate scale could work to its advantage.
"If it's small, it's like a pocket," he said. "If you fill it up, you will immediately create demand, and you can build a second one, a third one and a fourth one. You can actually make it hard to get into."
Mr. Arena argues that Hong Kong's future as a technology center should follow a similar blueprint. Rather than vying for large-scale factories, the city should focus on the software end of the business: luring designers and multimedia experts, who want to work in a cosmopolitan metropolis. New York City has adopted that strategy in its multimedia neighborhood, Silicon Alley.
Consider Mr. Li's own venture. Pacific Century is working with Intel to create an information service that would be transmitted by satellite to cable operators throughout Asia. The cable systems would then deliver the service over upgraded wires to subscribers, whose homes would be outfitted with modems -- allowing them to receive the service either over their television sets or computers.
Intel is devising the technology that would enable Mr. Li to deliver information at high speeds over this network of satellites and cable. But Pacific Century is responsible for designing the "content" -- the information and entertainment that will flow through the system. Mr. Li is drawing on his experience with Star TV, Asia's first satellite-delivered cable television service, which he began in the early 1990's; he sold a controlling stake to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation for $525 million in 1993.
He has also recruited roughly 60 software designers to create and package news, information and entertainment. Right now, this mostly Asian group works in Sunnyvale, Calif., a 15-minute drive from Intel's Santa Clara headquarters. But Mr. Li intends to move them back to Hong Kong -- where they will design services tailored for markets like China, India and Southeast Asia.
Before Mr. Li can realize his vision of a Silicon Valley East, however, he has to actually build Cyberport. This being property-crazed Hong Kong, his project has provoked noisy protests from other developers. They say the government, by donating the land rather than auctioning it, made a sweetheart deal with the son of Hong Kong's most influential tycoon.
The criticism seems to be getting to Mr. Li, who has spent much of his precocious career trying to outrun the shadow of Li Ka-shing.
"For the same amount of money, we could make more in pure technology," he said bitterly. "I thought this was for the good of everybody -- for the government, for us, for the industry, and so on."
In mercantile Hong Kong, it seems, high-technology dreams still pale next to the stone-cold reality of a real estate deal.

HEADLINE: A Visit by China's Prime Minister

 BODY:
Too often in the past six years, the Clinton Administration has let its pursuit of diplomatic engagement with China take precedence over other important American interests, like defending human rights and protecting sensitive military secrets. The visit this week of China's Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji, should be used to encourage a more exacting approach.
The timing of Mr. Zhu's visit, which begins tomorrow in Los Angeles and moves on to Washington later in the week, should be conducive to a sober exchange of views. China strongly opposes NATO's air strikes on Serbia. Washington is challenging Beijing's human rights record at United Nations meetings in Geneva. Meanwhile, efforts to finalize agreement on China's admission to the World Trade Organization, once planned as the visit's centerpiece, have hit a snag over Beijing's reluctance to open some of its markets. 
 The Clinton Administration should use the Washington segment of the trip for a candid discussion of current differences. The White House ought to make clear that its actions in Geneva come in response to Beijing's crackdown on dissent, which began after President Clinton visited China last summer.
The Administration should explain American policy on Kosovo and dispel Chinese fears that a precedent is being set for future international military intervention in Tibet or other Chinese regions troubled by ethnic strife. Mr. Zhu, as China's most powerful economic official, might be able to help bridge the remaining differences over Chinese membership in the W.T.O.
Mr. Zhu has established himself as China's most powerful economic reformer, guiding programs to sell off or close down money-losing state companies, shrink government ministries and divest the army of its business empire. These reforms have been slowed by the Asian economic crisis, but Mr. Zhu seems determined to see them through. He has also been a relatively moderate voice on political issues, though his interest and his influence in this area are not as great.
But whatever his personal inclinations, Mr. Zhu is part of a Chinese leadership that suppresses peaceful political expression and worries some of its neighbors with its belligerent rhetoric and provocative military activities. China's Government is also suspected of stealing America's nuclear weapons secrets and illegally funneling money into the 1996 Democratic Presidential campaign. The Administration must clearly convey strong American concerns about all of these issues.
Mr. Zhu is a lively and articulate personality, far more at ease with Western audiences than other Chinese leaders. He has a well-earned reputation for speaking clearly, without diplomatic evasion. Administration officials who meet with him should be equally direct.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: IN MONTENEGRO;
Trying to Balance Friendship With the West and Loyalty to Serbia

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: PODGORICA, Montenegro, April 4

 BODY:
At the bus station this morning, nervous people with suitcases were skipping out on Montenegro, convinced that soon there will be bloodshed in this mountainous Yugoslav republic.
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia, which consists of Montenegro and the far larger republic of Serbia, has blasted open a chasm of suspicion and resentment in this tiny republic of about 640,000 people. They are split between supporters of an elected Government that wants to embrace Western Europe and supporters of Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic, who is defiantly waging war against NATO. 
 The bombing of military targets inside Montenegro, which NATO halted four days ago as it accelerated the pace of strikes inside Serbia, has handed Mr. Milosevic's supporters a resonant battle cry. At the same time, it has badly undermined the arguments of Montenegro's moderate leadership that good things come when you cozy up to the West.
"There is hate here now and I think there will be civil war. There are two sides that disagree about everything," said Samira Sukolica, a Muslim woman who with her children and grandchildren was voting with her feet, abandoning Montenegro by bus for neighboring Bosnia.
Like Bosnia, which was convulsed by war between 1992 and 1995, this republic is a soup of different ethnic groups -- Montenegrin, Serb, Muslim, Albanian and Croat. Once started, as everywhere in the Balkans, ethnic violence in this republic could spin out of control.
The fear voiced by people packing out-bound buses this morning has been echoed by the State Department. It said last week that Washington was "highly concerned" that Mr. Milosevic would provoke violence in Montenegro to give the estimated 12,000 Yugoslav troops based here an excuse to take over an elected Government that has declared itself neutral in the conflict over Kosovo.
Late last week, Mr. Milosevic replaced the commander of those troops with Gen. Milorad Obradovic, who is believed to be a nationalist hard-liner.
Any such takeover, however, would likely provoke a fight from the estimated 8,000 police in Montenegro who are loyal to Milo Djukanovic, the young Montenegrin president who has been trying for a year and a half to ease this republic out of the crushing embrace of Mr. Milosevic -- whom Mr. Djukanovic knows well as his erstwhile political patron.
His Government is walking a dangerous tightrope, trying to prove to the West that it is opposed to dictatorship in Serbia but also trying to avoid a direct challenge to the Yugoslav Army. That army has heavy weapons; the local police do not.
In an interview tonight, Mr. Djukanovic, who has told friends in Belgrade that he was not alerted by the West that NATO would bomb military facilities in his republic the first night of the air campaign, said that NATO's actions have made his position "much more difficult."
"It is hard, very hard to speak and work for a democratic and pro-European policy," said Mr. Djukanovic. "NATO bombs have allowed Mr. Milosevic to create a new division in the Yugoslav political scene. Patriots are those who support his policies and anyone who criticizes him is a traitor. In Montenegro, pro-Milosevic forces are becoming much more aggressive."
The police loyal to Mr. Djukanovic were out in force tonight as Mr. Milosevic's supporters put on a huge rock concert in the capitol's central square. It was an event that mimicked regime-staged concerts in Belgrade, where Serbs have gathered to sneer at the United States and the NATO bombing and to support Mr. Milosevic's war in Kosovo.
"We must help our Serbian brothers against the NATO attack," said one of the placards at the largest gathering in this republic since bombs started to fall 12 days ago.
The bombings in Montenegro stopped after what Mr. Djukanovic said tonight were his furious complaints to Western diplomats that NATO was destabilizing its best friend in Yugoslavia. He said that the absence of falling bombs and cruise missiles in the past four days has eased tensions only slightly.
"The bombing has really made a horrible mess for this republic," observed Milka Tadic, general manager of Monitor, an independent weekly. "Djukanovic was put in this horrible political situation of being bombed by his allies. It gave the nationalists and the regular people of this country who are very confused a perfect reason to say that this Government does not want to defend itself from outside attacks."
At the concert, Mr. Milosevic's men did their best to make political hay out of Mr. Djukanovic's woes.
Girls in skin-tight pants writhed on stage as a singer named Dejan Peresic led a crowd of more than 20,000 in chants about how Montenegro and Serbia must be united against NATO.
The two republics have been allied since 1918, when Montenegro joined Yugoslavia. Serbs and Montenegrins share the Eastern Orthodox religion and an aggrieved history of underdog fights against the Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman empires.
Vlado Asanin, editor of the pro-Milosevic newspaper Dan, warned obliquely that violence may lie ahead.
"One of the most terrible sins is to give up the brotherhood of Montenegrins and Serbs," the editor said. "In coming days, we will have a chance to clear up all our mistakes."
While the concert's pro-Serb message resonated with much of the crowd, it was not overwhelmingly persuasive, particularly with young people who attended perhaps more out of boredom than political conviction.
"I want Montenegro to make contact with Europe," said Lidja Mejlevic, 25, a graduate student in economics. "If that means saying goodbye to Serbia and to Mr. Milosevic, then I say goodbye."
Until the past two years, Montenegro hardly seemed interested in making contact with Europe. Paramilitary forces from this republic participated in wars in Croatia and Bosnia and have been linked to war crimes. But Mr. Djukanovic, 37, a one-time disciple of Milosevic, has defiantly broken that military link.
Besides refusing to take sides in the Kosovo conflict, Montenegro has taken in an estimated 35,000 ethnic Albanian refugees for the next-door province of Serbia. The refugees say they are nervous to be in this republic but so far there are no reports of their widespread mistreatment.
The Djukanovic Government has also refused to honor Mr. Milosevic's decree of martial law in Yugoslavia.
Mr. Djukanovic said that his police force, whose elite troopers were stationed around his office tonight, is capable of dealing with the Yugoslav Army. But he said he hoped that it would not come to that.
"I hope that the Army is sensible enough not to fall for Mr. Milosevic's manipulation," he said. "But I have no illusions as long as he is in the political life of Yugoslavia."

HEADLINE: Get Tough With China

BYLINE: By Paul Wellstone; Paul Wellstone is a Democratic Senator from Minnesota.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In 1994, when President Clinton formally separated China's "most favored nation" trading status from its human rights record, he insisted that this did not diminish our commitment to pursuing a vigorous human rights policy. The Administration even went so far as to claim that economic growth and liberalization in China, fueled by increased trade with the United States, would actually promote political liberalization.
Five years down the road these assurances have proved to be empty rhetoric. Last fall the Chinese authorities undertook the toughest crackdown on dissidents since the Tiananmen Square massacre a decade ago. The State Department's own human rights report, released in February, acknowledged that "China's human rights record has deteriorated sharply over the past year." As that record has worsened, though, the 1994 "de-linkage" has turned into complete disassociation. Human rights and trade are no longer parts of the same overall policy package but are proceeding on completely separate tracks. 
 Two recent pronouncements dramatically demonstrate the contradictions -- if not downright schizophrenia -- of the current American approach. On the same day that Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said she would travel to China to try to close the deal on China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, the State Department announced that the United States would sponsor a United Nations resolution condemning China's terrible human rights record.
While I welcome the decision on the resolution, having been co-author of a Senate resolution calling for just this approach, I am dismayed that momentum toward W.T.O. membership for China builds as if the human rights situation there is irrelevant.
A return to a formal link between trade and human rights policy is not in the cards under this President. But we should insure that the Chinese understand that commercial concerns alone will not determine our policy.
As the Administration and Congress consider China's request for W.T.O. admission, we should insist that China, at a minimum, take concrete steps to establish an independent judiciary, a free press and respect for the rule of law. A government that routinely violates its own laws to crack down on dissent is equally likely to cheat on market access agreements, fail to honor contracts or restrict the free flow of business information from abroad. Congress should insist on voting on whether the President should support China's entry into the World Trade Organization before the Administration signs off on a W.T.O. deal.
This week Prime Minister Zhu Rongji will pay an official visit to Washington, the first by a Chinese Premier in 15 years. This is an opportunity for the President to tell the Chinese leader just why we are calling for United Nations condemnation of China's human rights abuses and signal to him that these abuses could jeopardize any W.T.O. decision.
Since President Clinton's visit to China last June, the Chinese Government has continued to commit abuses and has taken actions that flagrantly violate the commitments it has made to respect internationally recognized human rights. Restrictions on free expression have been tightened, including the adoption of strict regulations on the formation of nongovernmental political and social organizations and the imposition of tough regulations aimed at film directors, computer software developers, artists and journalists who "endanger social order."
Based on this deplorable record, the resolution we are sponsoring at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is clearly justified. But simply introducing it is not enough. The Administration must commit to pushing for adoption, an effort that must including having the President, Vice President and members of the Cabinet lobby other countries, particularly those in the European Union. This will be an uphill battle because China has a big head start in its own lobbying, but it is preferable to sponsoring a resolution and then sitting on our hands to watch it fail.
Even if the resolution is not adopted, simply having a debate on human rights in China (and the related issue of human rights in Tibet) will make a difference. It is essential for the Administration to make clear that at this moment in history the United States stands with the courageous Chinese who are struggling to achieve the rights they deserve.

HEADLINE: Sikhs Celebrate Faith and Numbers

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
While Christians celebrated the ancient holiday of Easter this weekend and Jews the even older Passover, Sikhs gathered by the thousands in New Jersey to begin a commemoration of the relatively new anniversary -- only 300 years -- of Khalsa, the concept at the core of their faith.
About 6,000 people poured into the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus, N.J., on Saturday for what was billed as the first international Sikh convention. The daylong event was part academic convocation, part political rally and part performance with songs, skits and a tae kwon do demonstration. 
 It was the prelude to a month of Khalsa events with parades and religious ceremonies in Manhattan, Washington, San Francisco and Los Angeles. On April 14, Vaisakhi, the beginning of the Sikh new year, will be observed with prayer services in gudwaras, or Sikh churches, everywhere.
Khalsa marks the establishment of formal structure in the religion. On March 30, 1699, in Punjab, India, Guru Gobind, the 10th and last in a line of holy gurus, ended the concentration of leadership in one human and established the order of Khalsa, baptized Sikhs, who were to be guided by the holy scripture, known as the Adi Granth, and who were to follow precepts of belief, behavior and dress.
"There has never been anything like this before," Rajnarind Kaur, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, declared about the convention as she sold T-shirts bearing Sikh symbols. "To get highly distinguished speakers all together at one time like this is amazing, and this is a once in a lifetime chance for all these people to come together."
Dr. I.J. Singh, a professor of dentistry at New York University, marveled at the crowd. "When I came to the United States in 1960, there were two Sikhs in Manhattan and one was me," he said. "Then I went to Oregon, where I was the only one. Now, I am seeing so many familiar faces that I can't find my friends here."
Indeed the denomination, the world's fifth largest, has grown in the West, with 175,000 adherents in the United States and 225,000 in Canada. According to the American region of the World Sikh Council, co-sponsor of the convention with a Sikh congregation in Glen Rock, N.J., there are about 75,000 Sikhs in the New York metropolitan area.
Still there is a yearning, reflected from the podium and from the audience, for the homeland, Punjab, which became part of India at the end of British rule in 1947. Since then, animosity and violence have prevailed between Hindus and Sikhs there, coming to a head when the Government raided Sikhism's most sacred site, the Golden Temple at Amritsar, in 1984. In retaliation, Sikh bodyguards assassinated Prime Minister Indira Ghandi, and in retribution, Sikhs say, thousands of them were massacred.
Much of the discussion centered on what Sikhs maintain is their right to establish their own nation there. It was in Punjab in 1469 that the first guru, Nanak, who had rejected the Hinduism of his family and then his adopted Islam, disappeared while bathing in a river. Three days later he returned, claiming to have encountered God and received guidance to start a new tradition. In contrast to Hinduism, Sikhism has no caste system and insists that everyone is equal, no matter what their gender or economic status.
Harjit Singh, a lawyer from London, told the audience: "Sikhism is no longer purely a religion. It is a distinctive community. The Jews finally returned to their promised land, and we will, too. But it won't take one-tenth as long."
While some American Sikhs have returned to Punjab to celebrate the anniversary of Khalsa, Amanyit Singh Buttar, one of two Sikhs in Vernon, Conn., and a member of its Board of Education, said: "I am a hard-liner. I will only go when my people have their own home."
Supinder Singh of Lodi, N.J., who owns a gas station, said he and his wife, Jasbir Kaur, fled Punjab in 1985 after bloodshed there. "We had to go underground, the police raided our homes and our temple," he said.
Pointing proudly to his children, Jagdeep, 6, Harsharan, 5 and Jujjhar, 3, Mr. Singh said, "I want them to know what country we came from, what our religion is, and how Khalsa was created. I worry about what they are teaching them in school and about TV they watch. They must know both cultures."
Most Sikh men adopt the surname Singh, meaning lion, and most women Kaur, which means princess.
Dr. Gurmit Singh Chilana, a gynecologist at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Paterson, N.J., and his wife, Dr. Bhupinber Kaur Chilana, a dentist, were also at the convention to teach their four children, who range in age from 4 to 14, about Khalsa.
"I want them to see how many people like them there are," Dr. Chilana said, looking at the crowds dressed in the distinctive tunic and pants worn by women and the turbans worn by men. "In the whole school where they go, there are only two Sikh families."
Among his obligations, he said, is the education of his neighbors. His 7-year-old son, Jagjot, was teased in school and called a girl because of his turban and the length of his hair, which his religion forbids him to cut. "So I went to his class and told them about our identity," Dr. Chilana said. "Since then there has been no problem."
With the first generation of Sikhs firmly entrenched on the economic ladder here -- dominant professions range from academicians, physicians and lawyers to taxicab drivers and security guards -- new imperatives are being felt.
"Like any immigrant community, the time has come to pass the torch," said Ramandeep Kaur Grewal, a 25-year-old lawyer from Toronto, who was identified from the podium as a "rising star" mainly for her involvement working with young people.
"The Sikh community is at a point where it needs to become part of American and Canadian society socially and politically," Ms. Grewal, whose parents immigrated to Canada from Punjab because "they wanted freedom of conscience," said. "It is economically stable and has the resources to become politically involved. We must put our resources into being elected to office. There is only one Sikh member of the Canadian Parliament out of 300, and like any other minority, the glass ceiling is still there for us."
Ms. Grewal was particularly pleased when the Prime Minister of Canada, Jean Chretien, dropped in on a Khalsa celebration dinner she attended last week. "He spoke about the founding of a Sikh nation, and he knew the subject in great detail," she said. "That shows a measure of success."

HEADLINE: Once Burned, Now Shy About Florio;
Some Democratic Leaders Are Wary of Former Governor's Senate Bid

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: BELLMAWR, N.J., March 30

 BODY:
"Here he is," bellowed the local party chairman above the raucous crowd of nearly 400 Democratic Party regulars packed into the fire hall. "Here is New Jersey's pride -- New Jersey's next United States senator."
With that, Jim Florio and his wife, Lucinda, barreled through white frosted-glass doors, as the crowd erupted. The former Governor made his way to the stage, grabbing outstretched hands, blowing kisses to old friends and embracing supporters from 16 past campaigns. 
 Six years after voters threw him out of the New Jersey State House and elected Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, Jim Florio is trying to make a political comeback. He is running for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate seat to be vacated next year by Frank R. Lautenberg.
But as popular as he is here in his base, the southern part of the state, Mr. Florio is having difficulty building support elsewhere for his candidacy. And the biggest threat comes not from Mrs. Whitman, who is also considering making a bid for the Senate seat, but from leaders within his own party.
Many party leaders from northern and central New Jersey shudder at the prospect of seeing his name on a ballot next year and a possible rematch with Mrs. Whitman. Some are even courting other potential candidates.
"The reality is that he has a certain amount of baggage," said Joseph C. Spicuzzo, Middlesex County's sheriff and Democratic Party chairman. "He is very popular down south, but the majority of Democratic leaders in the state have not come out and endorsed anyone yet."
The problem for Mr. Florio is that party leaders are worried that voters may have lingering memories of his tax increase. Almost a decade ago, Mr. Florio inspired a statewide tax revolt after ramming a $2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature to meet a court order demanding more state money for urban schools.
Within two years, Democrats lost control of the Legislature, and in 1993 Mr. Florio became the first Governor in modern history to lose a second term in a general election. As a result, many Democrats worry that a Florio campaign could reignite voter anger over the tax increase and damage the chances of other Democrats, including the candidate for President on the ticket next year.
State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, an Elizabeth Democrat, said that while he did not belong to the "stop-Jim-Florio-at-any-cost school," the party needed to consider other candidates.
"I think we have better candidates, and I am not ready to hand over the nomination to Jim Florio," said Mr. Lesniak, the Democratic leader in Union County. "The tax issue is a real concern."
Mr. Florio, who has been practicing law since he left office, insists that he is in the race to stay, whether or not he wins the backing of the party leaders elsewhere around the state. He has moved quickly to demonstrate his strength in recent weeks, lining up two major Democratic fund-raisers and endorsements from nine county chairmen, mostly from southern New Jersey, where he represented Camden County in the State Legislature and Congress for 16 years.
Although he says that the last few years have softened him a bit and made him more empathetic to voter concerns, Mr. Florio remains very much the former Navy boxer. Even his opponents acknowledge that he would be tough to beat in a primary.
"If I'm not troubled entering the contest, why should they be?" he asked as he sipped tea over breakfast. "Anybody who wants to run in the Democratic primary should be out there. Tell us what you think. Tell us what you stand for. And then let the people in the state -- north, south, central, by area codes, whatever -- decide. I don't have any problem with that."
Mr. Florio, 61, has spent all but the last five years of his working life in politics. He has run for governor four times, winning once, losing one primary battle and losing two of the closest general elections in the state's history, including his 1993 re-election campaign. Mrs. Whitman's last-minute pledge to cut taxes helped her come from behind and beat Mr. Florio by 26,000 votes out of 2.5 million cast.
Mr. Florio dismisses talk that his 1990 tax increase would hurt his prospects or the chances of any other Democratic candidates on the ballot. He defends the tax increase but acknowledges that he did not properly reach out to voters and explain why it was necessary at the time.
He also said that he did not view a possible matchup with Mrs. Whitman as a replay of the 1993 gubernatorial campaign, because Mrs. Whitman did not have a record then. Now, he said, she does.
"I don't have any difficulties with the idea that we had to fund our schools," he said. "You have to balance the budget. I think it is interesting that people are bragging now about a $700 million surplus. I came into office with a $600 million deficit, went through the worst recession since the Great Depression, and finished my administration with a $400 million surplus. And now, after these six or seven years of unprecedented prosperity, you're only talking about a $700 million surplus?"
"If it comes to pass," he said, "it will almost become an ideal opportunity for people in this state to contrast dramatically different individuals, styles, philosophies, backgrounds."
Asked if he is seeking vindication or redemption, as some of his critics have suggested, he replied: "Redemption is going to heaven. I'm talking about the Senate. I am very confident. Maybe too confident. I have a sufficient amount of self-esteem so that I don't have to prove anything to anybody."
When he learned in February that Mr. Lautenberg would not seek re-election, he said he jumped at the chance to get back into the arena because he believes he can address the public's concerns over health care, Social Security and education.
From his one term as Governor, he said that he learned the importance of engaging voters and reaching them more effectively. He said he now understands why his tax plan made him seem arrogant and indifferent. "It may have been presumptuous of me to think that everybody out there was listening to my profound rhetoric and policy explanations," he said.
Mr. Florio said he was not troubled by the efforts of some fellow Democrats to derail his candidacy or the possibility that he might face a serious challenge for the nomination.
"I will compete with anybody," he said. "I think the power of the ideas that I have and the ability to present them in a meaningful way is something that will stand me competitively with anybody."
Because Mr. Lautenberg's decision caught state Democratic leaders by surprise, there was not one candidate whom party leaders were prepared to unite behind. Representative Robert E. Menendez, a rising star in the party, was widely expected to receive the party's backing, but he decided against making a bid. It was then that Mr. Florio emerged in front of the pack.
Some Democratic leaders have been trying to persuade Jon S. Corzine, who is stepping down as co-chairman and chief executive of Goldman, Sachs & Company, to enter the race, knowing that he has the money to mount an expensive primary fight. Others are courting Michael Murphy, the former Morris County Prosecutor, who made a surprisingly strong showing in the 1997 Democratic gubernatorial primary.
So far, county leaders have not formally backed any of the people who have expressed interest in the race. The list includes B. Thomas Byrne Jr., the former chairman of the state party; Susan Bass Levin, the Mayor of Cherry Hill, and Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a Congressman from Long Branch.
Mr. Pallone has been trying to position himself as the "other" Democrat whom party leaders from the north and central parts of the state should get behind.
"Most of the party leaders do not want Florio to be the candidate," Mr. Pallone said. "They would rather have somebody new run who could take the party into the next century, and not have a replay of the old issues in a Whitman-Florio race. I think the Democrats have an agenda in Washington that works, and that people support. That is the agenda that we should be running on, not a replay of the sales tax and income tax issues."
Mrs. Whitman, who is expected to decide soon about the campaign, cannot count on an easy race against Mr. Florio, analysts say. They note that the state has been leaning more Democratic in the last two years, and voter turnout among Democrats is traditionally high in Presidential election years.
"I think it would be a very competitive election," said Cliff Zukin, director of Rutgers University's Eagleton Poll. "She has run three times, and she has gotten 49 percent. She has not run a strong statewide race in New Jersey. She has always been more popular out of the state than in it."
Thomas P. Giblin, the state Democratic Party chairman, said the party can ill afford an expensive and ugly primary fight, particularly if Mrs. Whitman enters the race and clears the Republican field.
Mr. Giblin also said that the party could not survive a rift between the north and south. To help heal any wounded feelings, he accompanied Mr. Florio to the rally here and assured the party regulars there that the entire party organization would rally around the best candidate. And he has urged his fellow party leaders to tone down their criticism of Mr. Florio.
"I don't want to make light of the tax increase that was enacted," said Mr. Giblin, who is also the leader in voter-rich Essex County. "Some Democrats are not happy with that, and they feel that it affected their political future. But that was then. This is now. We have to judge who is the best candidate for this race based on who is able to articulate the message and who can raise the money."

HEADLINE: A Project Aims to Unhitch Computing From Its PC Harness

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 31

 BODY:
For David Clark, an M.I.T. computer scientist, research is like "an expedition into the future."
With the faculty and students at the Laboratory of Computer Science here at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Clark, one of the lab's top managers, is about to embark on just such a journey -- one meant to liberate computing from the PC-centric world it has occupied for the last two decades. 
 On Monday, April 12, scientists here plan to introduce Oxygen, an ambitious $40 million, five-year research project that is being financed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, the Pentagon's research arm. The objective is as broad as it is audacious: to reinvent all facets of information technology, from chips and software to computers and networks. And in the Oxygenated future, a desktop computer would be largely beside the point.
In this digital new world, a person could know if a colleague working elsewhere was reachable at her desk because sensory-based computers in the wall would know. A hand-held point-and-click pointing device could be used to remotely command every household appliance to do its bidding. And instead of typing on keyboards or stabbing at a screen with a stylus, a person would simply tell any computer what to do.
Or at least such concepts are the vision. In reality, the Oxygen project, Mr. Clark said, must walk the exceedingly thin line between an unrealistically futuristic "Star Trek" notion of computing and an overly timid short-armed reach for the easily attainable.
"You have to quantum tunnel from 'It's too soon' to 'It's too late,' " he said. "You've got to have guts."
It might be easy to dismiss such talk, were it not for the Laboratory of Computer Science's track record over the last three and a half decades. True, it has simmered at a lower publicity temperature than its bubbly academic sister, the M.I.T. Media Laboratory. But since its creation in 1964, the L.C.S., as it is known, has been associated with many of the most important developments in computing.
The lab's many historic fruits include word-processing and spreadsheet software. And though it was invented elsewhere by Robert Metcalfe, Ethernet, the standard architecture of today's PC networks, was subsequently refined during the 1970's as Mr. Metcalfe wrote his Ph.D. dissertation at the lab.
It may be an M.I.T. effort that predates the lab by a year -- Project MAC, set in motion by a $2 million Darpa grant in 1963 -- that offers the best model for a project like Oxygen and the impact it could conceivably have on the next generation of computing.
It was Project MAC, after all, that redefined the computing world by making it possible for many users to simultaneously share a single computer. From Project MAC sprang innovations like an early E-mail system and the concept of shared information utilities, the forerunners of today's on-line communities and even the World Wide Web.
Project Oxygen, which will be formally kicked off at the laboratory's 35th anniversary next week, is the brainchild of the lab's director, Michael Dertouzous, a computer scientist whose own career traces to his days working on Project MAC as an M.I.T. student. Intent on putting people first, Mr. Dertouzous is determined to chart an information technology future in which computers recede into the background.
"We want to liberate ourselves from the tyranny of 'going to the computer,' " he said.
Oxygen, seen as a proof-of-concept testbed for technologies that others might turn into actual products, will be based on several components that the lab is already developing. The first will be called Handy 21, a portable device with a small screen, a video camera, a Global Positioning System receiver and a powerful computer. Combining the functions of a cellular telephone, two-way data radio, television set, beeper, handheld computer and an intelligent remote-control pointing device, the Handy 21 will rely heavily on advanced voice recognition technologies that have been developed at the lab.
Speech recognition -- the ability for machines to understand spoken instructions -- is a vital part of the Oxygen project. A group led by the M.I.T. speech researcher Victor Zue has developed an approach significantly different from that now being pursued by most others in the speech recognition field.
Mr. Zue's Spoken Language Systems group has developed systems with powerful speech-recognition capabilities -- in large part because they focus on relatively narrow subject areas, like the weather, airline reservations or local traffic.
"I have to confess that I don't know how to build HAL," Mr. Zue said, referring to the computer in "2001: A Space Odyssey" with the complete conversational repertory of an eerily dispassionate human being.
The aim of the Spoken Language Systems research group is to achieve a limited, though seemingly conversational, voice input system by stitching together many different recognition systems with vocabularies based on narrowly defined subjects.
Mr. Zue cites three factors making voice recognition more important as a computer interface: computers are becoming increasingly mobile; people love to talk, and the shrinking size of computers is making the conventional keyboard a large and ungainly component.
Much of the design effort will revolve around the idea of delegating tasks to machines. For example, Mr. Zue said that instead of merely inquiring of the Oxygen system when a plane is scheduled to arrive at the airport, the user, planning to meet the flight, might also give this command: "Call me half an hour before Flight 116 lands."
Besides the Handy 21, the Oxygen system will be based on another building-block computer that the researchers call Enviro 21. These devices, which would be powerful versions of the Handy 21 system, would be embedded in office walls, car trunks or basements at home. The systems would have extensive sensor networks meant to enable them to monitor the state of the environment -- knowing whether an office door is open, for example, or if the car trunk is unlocked or the basement sump pump is operating.
And besides merely sensing a situation, the Enviro 21 would have the intelligence to instruct mechanical systems to close the door, lock the trunk or reset the pump. Or by the same token, if an office door is open, a distant colleague might infer that the occupant would not mind being interrupted with a phone call.
Both the Handy 21 and the Enviro 21 will be based on a processor chip design developed by Anant Agarwal, a computer architect at the lab. Working with I.B.M., Mr. Agarwal's group is now designing a processor architecture known as Raw. Unlike earlier chip designs which are based on predetermined instruction sets, Raw processors subject even the most minute, or "raw," circuitry of the processor to customization by software designers.
Raw is a gamble, because it would be harder to program than conventional processors. But it may have a huge payoff if the design proves workable, by offering markedly faster data processing and the potential for large numbers of the chips to be custom programmed to work in powerful concert.
"A lot of our experiments will be high risk, and they will fail," Mr. Dertouzous conceded. "But there is also low-hanging fruit."
Project Oxygen is the clearest example yet in a new direction in Federal financing of information technology research patterned after previous research projects that upset the dominant computing assumptions of their day. A notable example from the past is Xerox's legendary Palo Alto Research Center during the 1970's.
"This is all about investing in long-term, high-risk research," Tom Kalil, President Clinton's special assistant on economic policy, said of Oxygen. "What's motivating this is our understanding of the impact of government investment in information technology research in the 1960's and 1970's. Innovations from that investment are driving the economy today.
"The Administration," he said, "really wants the research community to invest in the future and swing for the fences."
Besides speech recognition and Handy 21 and Enviro 21, the other basic technology component of Oxygen would be a computer network capable of linking the other systems together and also connecting to the Internet.
With these, as well the underlying software that supports the basic technologies, Mr. Dertouzous hopes that Project Oxygen can lead to computing systems that bring a meaningful increase in human productivity.
"Our overarching goal," he said, "is to enable people to do more by doing less."

HEADLINE: When No One Read, Who Started to Write?

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
The Sumerians had a story to explain their invention of writing more than 5,000 years ago. It seems a messenger of the king of Uruk arrived at the court of a distant ruler so exhausted from the journey that he was unable to deliver the oral message. So the king, being clever, came up with a solution. He patted some clay and set down the words of his next messages on a tablet.
A Sumerian epic celebrates the achievement: 
 Before that time writing on clay had not yet existed,
But now, as the sun rose, so it was!
The king of Kullaba Uruk had set words on a tablet, so it was!
A charming just-so, or so-it-was, story, its retelling at a recent symposium on the origins or writing, held here at the University of Pennsylvania, both amused and frustrated scholars. It reminded them that they could expect little help -- only a myth -- from the Sumerians themselves, presumably the first writing people, in understanding how and why the invention responsible for the great divide in human culture between prehistory and history had come about.
The archeologists, historians and other scholars at the meeting smiled at the absurdity of a king's writing a letter that its recipient could not read. They also doubted that the earliest writing was a direct rendering of speech. Writing more than likely began as a separate and distinct symbolic system of communication, like painting, sculpture and oral storytelling, and only later merged with spoken language.
Yet in the story, the Sumerians, who lived in Mesopotamia, the lower valley of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in what is now southern Iraq, seemed to understand writing's transforming function. As Dr. Holly Pittman, director of the university's Center for Ancient Studies and organizer of the symposium, observed, writing "arose out of the need to store information and transmit information outside of human memory and over time and over space."
In exchanging interpretations and new information, the scholars acknowledged that they still had no fully satisfying answers to the most important questions of exactly how and why writing was developed. Many of them favored a broad explanation of writing's origins in the visual arts, pictograms of things being transformed into increasingly abstract symbols for things, names and eventually words in speech. Their views clashed with a widely held theory among archeologists that writing grew out of the pieces of clay in assorted sizes and shapes that Sumerian accountants had used as tokens to keep track of livestock and stores of grain.
The scholars at the meeting also conceded that they had no definitive answer to the question of whether writing was invented only once and spread elsewhere or arose independently several times in several places, like Egypt, the Indus Valley, China and among the Olmecs and Maya of Mexico and Central America. But they criticized recent findings suggesting that writing might have developed earlier in Egypt than in Mesopotamia.
In December, Dr. Gunter Dreyer, director of the German Archeological Institute in Egypt, announced new radiocarbon dates for tombs at Abydos, on the Nile about 250 miles south of Cairo. The dates indicated that some hieroglyphic inscriptions on pots, bone and ivory in the tombs were made at least as early as 3200 B.C., possibly 3400. It was now an "open question," Dr. Dreyer said, whether writing appeared first in Egypt or Mesopotamia.
At the symposium, Dr. John Baines, an Oxford University Egyptologist who had just visited Dr. Dreyer, expressed skepticism in polite terms. "I'm suspicious of the dates," he said in an interview. "I think he's being very bold in his readings of these things."
The preponderance of archeological evidence has shown that the urbanizing Sumerians were the first to develop writing, in 3200 or 3300 B.C. These are the dates for many clay tablets with a proto-cuneiform script found at the site of the ancient city of Uruk. The tablets bore pictorial symbols for the names of people, places and things for governing and commerce. The Sumerian script gradually evolved from the pictorial to the abstract, but it was probably at least five centuries before the writing came to represent recorded spoken language.
Egyptian hieroglyphics are so different from Sumerian cuneiform, Dr. Baines said, that they were probably invented independently not long after Sumerian writing. If anything, the Egyptians may have gotten the idea of writing from the Sumerians, with whom they had contacts in Syria, but nothing more.
In any event, the writing idea became more widespread at the beginning of the third millennium B.C. The Elamites of southern Iran developed a proto-writing system then, perhaps influenced by the proto-cuneiform of their Sumerian neighbors, and before the millennium was out, writing appeared in the Indus River Valley of what is now Pakistan and western India, then in Syria and Crete and parts of Turkey. Writing in China dates back to the Shang period toward the end of the second millennium B.C., and it dates to the first millennium B.C. in Mesoamerica.
Archeologists have thought that the undeciphered Indus script, which seemed to appear first around 2500 B.C., may have been inspired in part from trade contacts with Mesopotamia. But new excavations in the ruins of the ancient city of Harappa suggest an earlier and presumably independent origin of Indus writing.
In a report from the field, distributed on the Internet, Dr. Jonathan Mark Kenoyer of the University of Wisconsin and Dr. Richard H. Meadow of Harvard University showed pictures of marks incised on potshards that they interpreted as evidence for the use of writing signs by Indus people as early as 3300 B.C. If these are indeed proto-writing examples, the discovery indicates an independent origin of Indus writing contemporary with the Sumerian and Egyptian inventions.
Dr. Meadow, using E-mail, the electronic age's version of the king of Uruk's clay tablet, confirmed that the inscribed marks were "similar in some respects to those later used in the Indus script." The current excavations, he added, were uncovering "very significant findings at Harappa with respect to the Indus script."
At the symposium, though, Dr. Gregory L. Possehl, a Pennsylvania archeologist who specializes in the Indus civilization and had examined the pictures, cautioned against jumping to such conclusions. One had to be careful, he said, not to confuse potter's marks, graffiti and fingernail marks with symbols of nascent writing.
Of the earliest writing systems, scholars said, only the Sumerian, Chinese and Mesoamerican ones seemed clearly to be independent inventions. Reviewing the relationship between early Chinese bronze art, "oracle bones" and writing, Dr. Louisa Huber, a researcher at Harvard's Fairbanks Center for East Asian Research, concluded, "Chinese writing looks to be pristine."
But few pronouncements about early writing go undisputed. Dr. Victor Mair, a professor of Chinese language at Penn, offered evidence indicating, he said, that "the Chinese writing system may well have received vital inputs from West Asian and European systems of writing and proto-writing."
Dr. Mair cited an intriguing correspondence between the Chinese script and 22 Phoenician letters and also Western-like symbols on pottery and the bodies of mummies found in the western desert of China. The recent discoveries of the mummies, wearing garments of Western weaves and having Caucasoid facial features, have prompted theories of foreign influences on Chinese culture in the first and second millennia B.C. It had already been established that the chariot and bronze metallurgy reached China from the West.
Though no one seemed ready to endorse his thesis, Dr. Mair said, "We simply do not know for certain whether the Chinese script was or was not independently created."
Dr. Peter Damerow, a specialist in Sumerian cuneiform at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, said, "Whatever the mutual influences of writing systems of different cultures may be, their great variety shows, at least, that the development of writing, once it is initiated, attains a considerable degree of independence and flexibility to adapt a coding system to specific characteristics of the language to be represented."
Not that he accepted the conventional view that writing necessarily started as some kind of representation of words by pictures. New studies of Sumerian proto-cuneiform, he said, challenge this intepretation. The structures of this earliest writing, for example, did not match the syntax of a language. Proto-cuneiform seemed severely restricted, compared with spoken language, dealing mainly in lists and categories, not in sentences and narrative.
This presumably reflects writing's origins and first applications in economic administration in a growing, increasingly complex society, scholars said. Most of the Uruk tablets were documents about property, inventory and, even then, taxes. The only texts that do not concern administrative activities, Dr. Damerow said, were cuneiform lexicons that were apparently written as school exercises by scribes in training.
For at least two decades, in fact, Dr. Denise Schmandt-Besserat, a University of Texas archeologist, has argued that the first writing grew directly out of a counting system practiced by Sumerian accountants. They used molded clay "tokens," each one specially shaped to represent a jar of oil, a large or small container of grain, or a particular kind of livestock. When the tokens were placed inside hollow clay spheres, the number and type of tokens inside were recorded on the ball with impressions resembling the tokens. Finally, simplifying matters, the token impressions were replaced with inscribed signs, and writing was invented.
Though Dr. Schmandt-Besserat has won wide support, some linguists question her thesis and other scholars, like Dr. Pittman of Penn, think it too narrow an interpretation. They emphasized that pictorial representation and writing evolved together, part of the same cultural context that fostered experimentation in communication through symbols.
"There's no question that the token system is a forerunner of writing, and really important," Dr. Pittman said in an interview. "But I have an argument with her evidence for a link between tokens and signs, and she doesn't open up the process to include picture-making and all other kinds of information-storage practices that are as important as the tokens."
Dr. Schmandt-Besserat, who did not attend the symposium, vigorously defended herself in a telephone interview. "My colleagues say the signs on seals were a beginning of writing, but show me a single sign on a seal that becomes a sign in writing," she said. "They say that designs on pottery were a beginning of writing, but show me a single sign of writing you can trace back to a pot -- it doesn't exist."
In its first 500 years, she asserted, cuneiform writing was used almost solely for recording economic information. "The first information that writing gives you is only the same information the tokens were dealing with," she said. "When you start putting more on the tablets, products plus the name of who has delivered and received them, that is where art would enter the picture. Then writing is out of the box, in all directions."
Dr. Damerow agreed that cuneiform writing appeared to have developed in two stages, first as a new but limited means of recording economic information, later as a broader encoding of spoken language for stories, arguments, descriptions or messages from one ruler to another.
Even so, it was a long way from the origin of writing to truly literate societies. At the symposium, scholars noted that the early rulers could not write or read; they relied on scribes for their messages, record keeping and storytelling. In Egypt, most early hieroglyphics were inscribed in places beyond the public eye, high on monuments or deep in tombs.
In this case, said Dr. Pascal Vernus of the University of Paris, early writing was less administrative than sacred and ideological, "a way of creating and describing the world as a dominating elite wants it to be."
Dr. Piotr Michalowski, professor of Near East civilizations at the University of Michigan, said the Uruk proto-cuneiform writing, whatever its antecedents, was "so radically different as to be a complete break with the past, a system different from anything else." It no doubt served to store, preserve and communicate information, but also was a new instrument of power.
"Perhaps it's because I grew up in Stalinist Poland," Dr. Michalowski said, "but I say coercion and control were early writing's first important purpose, a new way to control how people live."

Chart: "Early Writing: Cultures Make Their First Marks"
Representing spoken language in writing grew out of the transformation of pictures and random marks into images with consistent meaning. Among the earliest cultures to do this were:
 
INDUS VALLEY
2,500 B.C.
Ceramic seals like the one shown above were used by the inhabitants of what is now Pakistanto indicate ownership or destinations for bundles of goods. The scripts in the upper right corner are individual characters.
 
MESOAMERICA
250 - 300 B.C.
The Olmecs, Mayansand Zapotecs arethought to be the first of many cultures in this region to develop writing. Shown above is an early Zapotec example that is still untranslated.
 
SUMERIA
3,200 B.C.
This Mesopotamian culture is generally thought to be the first culture to produce written texts. In the example above the Sumerians used a stylus and wet clay to record the ingredients for beer.
 
EGYPT
3,200 - 3,000 B.C.
Early Egyptians used a system of pictorial hiero-glyphics as a written language. The earliest examples (above) were phonetically arranged symbols on small clay tablets used to indicate payments for commodities. It reads Mountain of Light.
 
CHINA
1,500 - 1,200 B.C.
During the Shang Dynasty the Chinese began to inscribedivinations on the underside of turtle shells and ox bones. These artifacts are now referred to as oracle bone inscriptions.

HEADLINE: Of Life, Death and the Rules of Liver Transplants

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE 

 BODY:
Ralph Benedetto is dying in his mobile home in Clearwater, Fla.
Swirling around him is a debate over whether he and patients like him should be denied liver transplants that might save their lives -- specifically, whether the nation's health care system denies transplants out of failure to keep abreast of medical and technical advances or out of eagerness to save money. 
 Mr. Benedetto, 44, a disabled Medicaid patient, contracted hepatitis B 10 years ago from a blood transfusion he received after he was struck by a drunken driver. Two years ago, his doctors said his disease had progressed to the point where he could die at any moment without a liver transplant. But his health maintenance organization refused to pay for the treatment.
The H.M.O., Staywell Health Care in Tampa, Fla., cited guidelines issued by the state of Florida recommending against liver transplants to hepatitis B patients on the ground that the virus would destroy a replacement liver just as it did the original, leaving the patient just as sick and wasting a scarce organ in a transplant doomed to fail. The Federal guidelines that apply to 39 million Medicare recipients say the same.
But medical researchers and liver transplant surgeons said advances in the treatment of hepatitis B had left the guidelines outdated. Since the early 1990's, drugs started to become available to better treat the disease and now, the researchers say, the drugs appear to have blocked liver damage in more than 80 percent of the thousands of hepatitis B patients who have received transplants in states that allow them.
Experts say there is now wide agreement that hepatitis B, in and of itself, is no longer a valid reason to deny someone a liver transplant.
A spokeswoman at the Florida Agency for Health-Care Administration said it was the agency's policy not to discuss guidelines in detail. Mr. Benedetto's condition changes from day to day, making it difficult for him to be interviewed. But his former wife, who is caring for him, said she was furious when the transplant doctors had recommended was denied.
"I could not believe Ralph would simply be allowed to die when everybody knew successful treatments were available," Theresa Benedetto said.
Both Dr. David R. Nelson, a professor of medicine and an expert in hepatology at the Shands Hospital of the University of Florida in Gainesville, and Dr. Scott E. Hallgren of the Florida Center for Gastroenterology at Pinellas Park, had determined in June 1998 that Mr. Benedetto was in danger of dying at any moment, but that he had an excellent chance of regaining his health with a transplant.
The H.M.O. insisted that the sole reason for its denial was that hepatitis B patients did not meet the state criteria for transplants. Costs for the procedure are high, the company acknowledged, with the average hospital bill for the operation in Florida at $117,000, plus the costs of finding a suitable organ and the subsequent costs of preventing rejection of the organ or recurrence of viral infection, said Nancy Gareau, Staywell's vice president for operations.
The company, under contract with Florida to manage Medicaid patient care, covers five or six transplants a month, Ms. Gareau said.
Once the H.M.O. refused to authorize a transplant, Mrs. Benedetto said, Mr. Benedetto was turned away by three hospitals. Jackson Memorial Medical Center, affiliated with the University of Miami School of Medicine, said it would not do the transplant unless Mr. Benedetto produced a $150,000 down payment, Mrs. Benedetto said. Shands Hospital required $136,000 down.
Both hospitals confirmed Mrs. Benedetto's account and said the total bills could run much higher. Mr. Benedetto, unemployed because of his disability, could not begin to pay that cost. Tampa General Hospital also turned him away, because it said its doctors were not convinced that Mr. Benedetto would survive a transplant.
Administrators at several American medical centers, health care experts and doctors do not fault hospitals that seek assurance they will be reimbursed for transplants, whose high cost, if uncompensated, would quickly drive them out of business. "And if it did one transplant free, wouldn't it be unjust to deny one to someone else who also needed one," said Dr. John M. Vierling, chairman of the American Liver Foundation.
And while some doctors characterized Mr. Benedetto's experience as yet another example of how tight-fisted H.M.O.'s harm patients, others said that in their experience most H.M.O.'s were fully cooperative in covering transplants where they were warranted.
In any event, Dr. Vierling said, the original decision in the 1980's to exclude patients with hepatitis B from transplant rosters was legitimate. The problem now, he said, is adapting the rules to changing medical conditions. Once a procedure is excluded, he said, it is often a long and tortuous process to get the rule changed. That is true in the case of hepatitis B, he said, even though new treatments have produced long-term success rates equal to overall rates for liver transplants.
Dr. Donald A. Young, a senior vice president for policy and clinical services of the American Association of Health Plans, the nation's largest trade and lobbying association for private managed care companies, said health care providers had an obligation to treat their patients.
"The first rule -- the principle of beneficence -- says you have the responsibility to provide the care needed to the individual without regard to your own interest," including financial interests, he said. But, he added, "Second, the principle of stewardship provides that justice must be done for all where you have to allocate resources." He said it would be unethical to spend so much time and money or resources in saving one patient that it became impossible to save a group of others. Although the two principles may be contradictory, Dr. Young said, the goal is to try not to violate either.
What does this mean for Ralph Benedetto? In the past, it might have meant that it would not be right to give him a liver in a transplant doomed to fail, if the organ might save someone else's life. But today, Dr. Young said, "It seems to me the doctors and hospitals and the State of Florida and the H.M.O.'s should all get together and find a way to work something out."
Later in the day on which the American Association of Health Plans discussed the ethical considerations in the Benedetto case, March 4, its spokesman said it had pondered the question further. "We found the question highly disturbing," the spokesman said. "We will do something."
In the end, on March 5, after probing questions had been raised about Mr. Benedetto's case, Kate C. Morgan, chief of the Florida Agency for Health-Care Administration's Bureau of Managed Health Care, said the case had prompted senior agency officials to make an immediate change in the agency's rule on hepatitis B. "We have relayed that information to the H.M.O.'s, and Staywell is going to move forward with the transplant" as long as Mr. Benedetto is still a candidate, Ms. Morgan said. Staywell confirmed that this was the case, she said.
But now Mr. Benedetto may no longer be a viable candidate.
When he was tested in June in an effort to appeal Staywell's denial, he was found to have responded well to various medications. But now, Dr. Enrique J. Martinez, his hepatologist, said, the virus is renewing its attack.
If events had been conspiring against Ralph Benedetto, now they seemed to be mobilized on his behalf. On the afternoon of March 5, Dr. Martinez's transplant center, Lifelink, a nonprofit institute affiliated with Tampa General, was notified that it had just received approval to use an experimental drug, adefovir, that was not yet approved for general use but could be prescribed by selected research centers on a compassionate-use basis. Preliminary trials have found it to be 90 percent successful in controlling the recurrence of hepatitis B viral attacks.
Dr. Martinez said he believed the chances were excellent now that the adefovir would enable Mr. Benedetto to be put on the list to await a transplant within weeks.
Several health care professionals said it was heartening to see senior state health officials act so quickly in this case, but also expressed concern. Dr. Vierling of the American Liver Foundation said: "Those recent developments are, of course, good news for the Benedettos. But it is still disturbing that it took the fight and persistence of a person like Theresa Benedetto and the action of a few key people in the system before it could be spurred into action. And it disturbs me that many dying patients with hepatitis B still cannot get transplants."

ASIA
 
INDIA: NEW THREAT TO COALITION -- The conflict deepened between the Hindu-nationalist-led Government and its largest coalition partner, as Jayalitha Jayaram announced that two ministers from the party she leads would resign. Prime Minister Vajpayee won the backing of the other Government members in rejecting her demands that Defense Minister George Fernandes be dismissed, the ousted naval chief be reinstated and a parliamentary committee be set up to investigate charges of corruption against Mr. Fernandes.

INDONESIA: BALLOT REGISTRATION BEGINS -- Voter registration began for Indonesia's general election, which is scheduled to be held on June 7. A total of 48 parties will seek parliamentary seats, the first step toward electing a new President. The United Nations is coordinating the distribution of $80 million in foreign aid for the balloting, in which 125 million people are eligible to vote.

MALAYSIA: ANWAR'S WIFE FORMS PARTY -- The wife of Anwar Ibrahim, the former Deputy Prime Minister who is on trial for corruption and illegal sex acts, has announced the formation of a new political party. Mr. Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, said she would challenge the leadership of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad.

VIETNAM: WORKING WITH PHILIPPINES -- Vietnamese and Philippine troops will stage joint exercises in order to east tensions over the two nations' competing claims to the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. Disputes have grown in recent months over sovereignty of the islands, which are also claimed by Malaysia and China. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
NORTH KOREA: DENIAL OVER SHIPS -- North Korea denied any involvement in an incident in which two ships sneaked into Japanese waters and then fled toward North Korea, setting off Japan's first naval pursuit in more than 40 years. "The ultra-rightist reactionaries of Japan invented such a shocking incident," North Korea's official news agency said.

MIDDLE EAST -- IRAQ: OIL PIPELINE ATTACKED -- Western warplanes destroyed a control station on a pipeline used by Iraq to export oil through its southern terminal of Mina-al-Bakr, the Iraqi News Agency said, but a shipping official in London said loading of oil was uninterrupted at the terminal. The agency said the raid took place at the Bazrkan oilfields near the southern city of Al Amarah, 220 miles southeast of Baghdad. (Reuters)
 
IRAN: U.S. CONCERN OVER OIL DEAL -- The U.S. voiced concern and disappointment over a $300 million contract with Iran by two Western companies, one French and the other Canadian, to exploit an oil deposit in the Persian Gulf. "The United States remains strongly opposed to investment in Iran's petroleum sector," the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said. "We've repeatedly urged the Governments of France and Canada at the most senior level to discourage this investment." (Agence France-Presse)
 
ISRAEL: STRIKE HITS NAZARETH -- The center of Nazareth was deserted as shopkeepers complied with a call by Muslim leaders for a commercial strike after clashes broke out with Christians over a planned millennium pilgrimage site at the Church of the Annunciation, where Muslims want to build a mosque. Muslims demanded the resignation of the town's Christian mayor. (AP)
 
THE PALESTINIANS: ARAFAT IN MOSCOW -- Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov urged the visiting Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat to put off declaring Palestinian independence next month, and called for reviving the Mideast peace effort. Mr. Arafat, who has been holding a series of discussions with world leaders about his stated intention to declare an independent state on May 4, arrived in Moscow after talks with President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey. (AP)
 
EGYPT: A RAPE DEFENSE DOOMED -- President Hosni Mubarak has decreed an end to a law allowing rapists to go free if they marry their victims. Parents of victims have used the law, which dates to 1904, as a way to regain family honor. Rapists have used it to escape punishment. Mr. Mubarak intervened after a heated debate in Parliament, which is now expected to give the Mubarak decision unanimous approval. (AP)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
PARAGUAY: SEEKING GENERAL'S EXTRADITION -- Foreign Minister Miguel Andon Saquier said his Government is preparing to make a formal request to Argentina for the extradition of Gen. Lino Oviedo in the next few weeks. General Oviedo, the former army commander, fled to Argentina after he was accused of masterminding the assassination of Vice President Luis Maria Argana. Argentina granted General Oviedo political asylum, but officials said they would consider any formal extradition request.

AFRICA
 
NIGERIA: ELECTION CHALLENGE DISMISSED -- The Court of Appeal dismissed a challenge to the Feb. 27 presidential election victory of Olusegun Obasanjo brought by his defeated rival, Olu Falae, who said widespread vote rigging took place. "This petition lacks merit and ought to be disqualified and I hereby dismiss it in its entirety," Presiding Justice Dahiru Musdapher said. Mr. Falae has said he would take his petition to the Supreme Court if he was not satisfied with the Court of Appeal proceedings. (Reuters)
 
SUDAN: CEASE-FIRE DECLARED -- President Omar al Beshir declared a comprehensive cease-fire in southern Sudan starting April 15, when a partial truce is scheduled to expire. In a speech to the National Assembly in Khartoum he appealed to the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army to respond positively. Since 1983 the conflict between the Arab-Muslim north and the majority Christian and animist south has left up to 1.5 million people dead, mostly from war-related famine and disease.
 (Agence France-Presse)
 
ALGERIA: REBELS SLAY 22 SOLDIERS -- Twenty-two Algerian Government soldiers were killed when Muslim rebels ambushed a military convoy in Melaha hamlet, near the garrison town of Blida, 30 miles south of Algiers, according to El Watan, an Algiers daily. A total of 12 guerrillas were killed in the clash, it said, adding that gangs of rebels were still besieged by army units rushed to the area. (Reuters)
 
EUROPE
 
GERMANY: LUFTHANSA JOINS FUND -- Lufthansa German Airlines, which has been sued for using slave laborers at its factories under the Nazis, has agreed to join a new German Holocaust Memorial fund, the World Jewish Congress said. "Symbolically, the participation of Lufthansa is a major development and one that augurs well for the success of the fund," said Elan Steinberg, executive director of the Jewish group. (Reuters)
 
BELARUS: BETTER U.S. TIES SOUGHT -- Aleksandr Lukashenko, the Communist President who evicted foreign diplomats last year, said it is time for Belarus and the U.S. to mend fences. According to a Government statement, Mr. Lukashenko told Foreign Ministry officials that American pique over Belarus's proposed economic union with Russia, combined with the U.S. desire to act as a "world gendarme," had curdled ties to the U.S. and European Union. He did not say how relations might be improved. Michael Wines (NYT)
 
GEORGIA: PESSIMISM ON TREATY -- President Eduard Shevardnadze said he might end Georgia's security cooperation with the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose grouping of ex-Soviet states, if the treaty is "not adjusted to our conditions and demands." He said Georgia was demanding payment for Soviet weapons, estimated to cost about $8 billion, taken from Georgia by Russia in the early 1990's, and said the treaty had brought his country no benefit so far. (Reuters)
 
TURKEY: GOVERNOR ESCAPES BOMBING -- The governor of Bingol Province, in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast, escaped a suicide bomb attack that killed a suspected Kurdish guerrilla and a 13-year-old girl. Security officials said the governor, Suleyman Kamci, was walking from his car to his offices when the bomber ran up and detonated explosives strapped to his body.

HEADLINE: European Oil Companies Plan Expansions in Libya

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya, April 5

 BODY:
European oil companies are preparing for an investment boom in Libya after the nation turned over two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner, clearing the way for the United Nations to lift sanctions.
ENI S.p.A. of Italy, already Libya's biggest foreign oil producer, and Lasmo P.L.C. of Britain are among the companies planning to expand investments. Their activities will further strain sanctions that the United States imposed independently on Libya two years before the bombing in response to terrorist incidents that forced American oil companies to leave the nation. 
 Libya has lost $24 billion in potential revenue since the sanctions were imposed in 1992 and is desperate for investment. Oil income, accounting for 95 percent of the nation's hard-currency earnings, fell more than a third last year as prices for crude touched 12-year lows. That forced Libya to devalue its currency by 18 percent in December.
"Oil companies will now feel more comfortable in talking with the Libyan Government about potential projects," said Mohammed Abduljabbar, a consultant with the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington. "It will allow Libya to rehabilitate its oil production."
The lifting of United Nations sanctions means international flights to Tripoli could resume and the nation could buy supplies to refurbish oil-export equipment. The European Union has no ban on oil drilling in Libya, but the six-hour drive from Tunisia to Tripoli is a strain that wards off many investors.
Already, Libya has taken steps to welcome back oil companies that left through the 1980's, a result of the sanctions and threats against foreigners by the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Later this month at a conference in Geneva, the Libyan Oil Minister, Abdallah Salim al-Badri, is expected to conduct the first major round of bidding for oil exploration rights in four years.
The Oil Minister said last month in Vienna that he had already held talks with United States oil companies about returning.
"As far as Libya is concerned, they are welcome back," he said. "We already have been in contact with some of our previous partners. We have been contacted by the American oil companies, and we want them to come back to Libya."
With proven reserves of about 30 billion barrels -- almost as much as has been found in the North Sea -- Libya is a prize for the world's oil industry. Lasmo pumps Libyan oil for $5 or so a barrel, about half the cost in Britain.
The two-year drop in oil prices has made Libya's cheap oil even more attractive. Benchmark Brent crude oil prices, now $14.72 a barrel, are little more than half their 1997 peak price of almost $25. Libyan projects, however, are profitable even if prices slip to less than $10 a barrel.
"We're looking for more exploration acreage in Libya," said Roy Beadle, a spokesman for Lasmo, Britain's second-biggest oil exploration company. "Our guys have no problem working there, even with the sanctions."
ENI produces about 16 percent of Libya's oil and found the nation's biggest offshore field. The company is seeking clients to support a $3.5 billion investment in new gas production from the Wafa field on Libya's Mediterranean coast and a pipeline under the sea to Italy.
Others, such as Total S.A. of France, OMV A.G. of Austria, Repsol S.A. of Spain and Lundin Oil A.B. of Sweden, are also active in Libya.
"Doing business in Libya would be easier" without sanctions, said Terance Taylor, assistant director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a policy adviser in London. "Financing for new projects will be easier to obtain."
Still, the United States companies that withdrew in the early 1980's after sanctions tightened probably will not be back soon. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan told the Occidental Petroleum Corporation and a consortium including USX-Marathon Group, Conoco Inc. and the Amerada Hess Corporation to pull out after Libyans were linked to the bombing of an Egyptian airliner and a German nightclub.
The Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation withdrew even earlier, in 1982, a year after a United States trade embargo began. And in 1996, Congress tightened sanctions against Iran and Libya, accusing both of financing terrorism.
If United States sanctions are lifted, Conoco, Hess and Marathon could have a head start on their rivals because about $2 billion of assets -- including seven major oilfields -- has been held in trust by the Libyan Government until sanctions are removed. The group was part of the Oasis Oil Corporation.
Since 1986, Conoco's share of output from Oasis, about 300 million barrels of oil valued at about $5 billion, has gone to the Libyan Government, said Carlton Adams, a Conoco spokesman. "We hope to return and resume our operations there once all the sanctions are lifted," he said.
Hess and Marathon did not comment on the issue.

HEADLINE: William J. De Lancy, 82; Headed Republic Steel

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
William J. De Lancy, who ran the Republic Steel Corporation during some of its toughest times, died from complications of Parkinson's disease Friday at his home in Shaker Heights, Ohio, his family said.
He was 82. 
 Born in Chicago in 1916, Mr. De Lancy earned both bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Michigan. After graduation in 1940, he was hired by the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. He served as a Naval intelligence officer on the aircraft carrier Bennington in World War II, and returned to the firm after the war.
In 1952, he joined Republic Steel in Cleveland as assistant counsel. He rose through several positions including general counsel, and became the company's president in 1973 and its chief executive in 1974. He added the title of chairman in 1979.
Republic, then the fifth-largest steelmaker, suffered, as did the entire steel industry, from heightened competition from more efficient producers abroad at a time of weak demand induced by the recession and high interest rates in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
By 1980, for example, the industry was operating at little more than half of capacity, and shipped only 84 million tons of steel, down from 100 million tons the year before. Steel industry employment was at its lowest level since 1933.
In 1980, Mr. De Lancy became president of the industry's trade group, the American Iron and Steel Institute, and he led a lobbying effort aimed at strengthening the existing government restrictions on imports of steel.
The industry contended that European and Asian steelmakers were "dumping" steel in the United States; that is they were selling the steel at artificially low prices, possibly for less than their cost of production.
In 1982, Mr. De Lancy turned 65, and he retired both from Republic and the steel institute.
The company and industry continued to suffer. Steel production hit a postwar low of 75 million tons in 1982, and production did not return to 1980 levels until 1994. In 1984, Republic merged with Jones & Laughlin Steel to form the LTV Corporation.
Mr. De Lancy is survived by his wife, the former Sally Roe, and his children, Ann of Seattle and Mark of Chicago.

HEADLINE: Russia's Role in Kosovo

 BODY:
The road to peace in Kosovo may yet run through Moscow. Despite Russia's rhetorical belligerence about the NATO air campaign and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's failed diplomatic mission to Belgrade last week, Russia has the credentials and motivation to play a constructive role in ending the conflict. Doing so will require some straight talking by the Russians to their Serbian cousins, and a degree of cooperation with Washington that may be awkward for the Kremlin, but Russia could greatly enhance its international stature by brokering a political settlement.
For now, Slobodan Milosevic may think he has little reason to consider a diplomatic solution, and he did not seriously entertain one in his talks with Mr. Primakov. The Serbian assault on Kosovo has driven a million ethnic Albanians from their homes, and NATO air attacks have so far done little to impede the Serbian brutality in Kosovo or diminish Mr. Milosevic's military forces. 
 But this conflict, as President Clinton declared yesterday, must not end with Kosovo permanently emptied of its citizens. With improving weather and additional aircraft, NATO air power will eventually begin to hobble the Serbian military and weaken Mr. Milosevic's stranglehold on Kosovo. If Mr. Milosevic concludes that the balance of power is shifting in NATO's favor, he will doubtless start looking for a deal that allows him to remain in power. If Mr. Clinton and NATO stick with their wise decision not to commit troops to a potentially costly ground war in Kosovo, they too will be looking for a negotiated resolution.
Because of Russia's longstanding friendship with Serbia, Mr. Primakov is among the few world leaders who has the standing in Belgrade to tell Mr. Milosevic he must end his subjugation of Kosovo, withdraw all his forces and permit the repatriation of the ethnic Albanians. Kosovo must also be granted at least the same degree of political autonomy it enjoyed until 1989. All this would be easier for Mr. Milosevic to accept if it were endorsed by the Russian Government, and came with a promise that Russian troops would participate in an international peacekeeping force that would assure the safe return of the refugees.
Moscow favored most of the elements of this plan before the NATO air offensive commenced, and ought to overcome its resistance to the peacekeeping force now that Serbia has demonstrated such savagery in Kosovo. The NATO air strikes have stirred anti-Western sentiment in Russia, limiting Mr. Primakov's latitude as he looks ahead to parliamentary elections in December and a possible presidential race next year. But both Mr. Primakov and his patron, President Boris Yeltsin, well understand that Russia's long-term economic and diplomatic interests are better served by working with the United States and Europe rather than by cultivating Slobodan Milosevic. The White House should be working behind the scenes to encourage a constructive Russian role.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Scholar's Stormy Life With Morgan's Ghost

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
THEY are not a perfect couple: J. Pierpont Morgan, the inarticulate, unreflective and unofficial central banker of the United States before there was a Federal Reserve, and Jean Strouse, a former Radcliffe English major whose analytic gifts were previously focused on a biography of Alice James, a powerless invalid.
But for the last 15 years, Ms. Strouse has lived nearly full time, on paper and in her head, with Morgan, the titan who gave birth to industrial America and many of New York's most important cultural institutions. She has pored over Morgan's ledger books, investigated his mistresses and found pressed violets in the diary of his first wife. Even now, she has yet to move the Morganalia out of her one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side. "Morgan takes up more space than I do," she said. 
 In short, no one alive knows him as well. Evidence: her 796-page "Morgan: American Financier," published this month by Random House, in which Ms. Strouse is part detective, part novelist, part psychologist. Reviewers are in awe that Ms. Strouse has found a human being underneath the rapacious robber baron (the view of the left) or the financial Moses (the right). For her part, Ms. Strouse spent her first five years with Morgan eyeing him with a prosecutor's disgust. "It was as if I had my hands on my hips saying, 'Oh, sure,' " she said.
In the end, Ms. Strouse liked Morgan but didn't excuse him -- and felt she had forged an intimate connection. "But it took years to feel that," she said in an interview at the Morgan Library, the same place where Morgan famously locked up the nation's bankers during the financial panic of 1907 and ordered them to sign a bailout package, at 4 A.M. "Because he's such an alien character to me. He didn't want to know any of the things I wanted to know."
And what, if Morgan were alive and down the hall (he died in 1913), would she ask him?
Ms. Strouse hesitated. She is a journalist-turned-scholar, with a serious reputation. "I don't think I want to say," she said. Which makes it all the more interesting.
Well, she relented, there was the matter of his first wife, Amelia -- Memie -- his true love, who was already so sick with a serious cough when he married her in 1861 that Morgan had to hold her up at the altar. He then insisted on taking Memie to the Mediterranean for a cure, only to be told in Europe that Memie had tuberculosis. Morgan nursed her obsessively and carried her up and down seven flights of stairs in Paris. But Memie died four months after the wedding, when Morgan was 24.
"I don't know whether that marriage was ever consummated," Ms. Strouse said, a little embarrassed by her admission. It is not, she admitted, a historically important question, just the human curiosity of someone who knows Morgan, and cares. "Because he really loved her," Ms. Strouse said. "I don't know if he ever got over her death."
THESE days Ms. Strouse, 53, is enjoying that moment when the private life of a scholar becomes the public life, however fleeting, of just-published biographer. There will be a party for her at the Morgan Library next week, a book tour, plus her re-entry into the 20th century. (Ms. Strouse knew it was time to move on from Alice James, the sister of Henry and William, when she began writing "Dec. 12, 1878" on her own correspondence.)
"I don't think I want to do this again," she said of big biography. "It was too long and hard. A friend of mine says that biography is a little like marriage -- you only have room in your life for one or two. Well, I've had two."
Ms. Strouse has never married, was involved with a man until recently and travels in the gossipy intellectual world of what people sometimes call The New York Review of Each Other's Books. Ms. Strouse grew up in Los Angeles, where her father was an internist, came to New York after graduating from Radcliffe in 1967 to work as an assistant to Robert B. Silvers, the co-editor of The New York Review of Books, left in 1975 to write her 1980 Alice James book (which won the Bancroft Prize), spent four years as a book critic at Newsweek, then started working on Morgan in 1983. She plays squash and dresses well, but otherwise lives a very un-Morganesque life.
When her 1983 advance payment from Random House ran out -- she describes it as "in the low six figures" -- Ms. Strouse put together academic grants, teaching jobs, money from her mother and additional payments from Random House. "I've been living like a graduate student, and I've had it," she said. "Especially writing about somebody who lived the way Morgan did -- it was comical."
Halfway through, she nearly gave up when she began waking up at 4 A.M., convinced she would would never understand the 19th century financial data. "But I couldn't pay back the advance, and I also couldn't admit failure," she said. A friend who runs a hedge fund, Roger Alcaly, talked her through it, and today Ms. Strouse is a trustee, rather than her three younger brothers, of some family investments. "I've been educated," she said.
She has no idea what she'll do next, but well remembers when she finished the book -- Aug. 19, 1998. Two days later she took a break.
"I felt so light," she said. "It was the first vacation I'd taken without J.P. Morgan in 15 years."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Are Little Changed As Economy Shows Strength

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities were little changed to slightly lower yesterday, as a rise in stocks removed some demand from the debt market. Trading was light.
There was minimal reaction to a report by the National Association of Purchasing Management that its index of nonmanufacturing business rose to 62.5 in March -- the highest since May -- from a reading of 57.0 in February. 
 Jack Ablin, president of Colonial Asset Management Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla., said, "Last week's N.A.P.M. report on manufacturing activity was so strong that it overshadowed today's report."
The yield on the 30-year bond slipped to 5.58 percent, from 5.59 percent on Friday, while its price, which moves in the opposite direction, increased 4/32 to 95 5/32 .
Mr. Ablin said he thought the Fed policy makers were not likely to be swayed by yesterday's report, "especially if they have yet to be prompted into action by the 30 percent rise in oil seen over the last few weeks." Yesterday, crude oil futures moved higher after the United Nations said that one of Iraq's main pipelines, which carries oil south to the Persian Gulf port of Mina al-Bakr, had slowed to about 45 percent of its normal rate after weekend bomb damage. Iraq blamed Britain and the United States, but the United States denied the charge.
As the American economy continued to show signs of strength and little deceleration, bond yields have climbed more than half a percentage point in the first quarter of this year, as investors, fearing inflation lies ahead, have demanded a greater discount in price.
Michael Englund, chief economist for Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said the market got the employment report it was looking for last week, although there was limited room on Friday for Treasuries to rally because of the holiday-shortened session. This week he expects a bullish bias to trading, based on the employment data, a flight to Treasury securities because of the events in Kosovo, the unwinding of effects from the end of the Japanese fiscal year and the attractive level of yields available.
Corporate debt sales in the coming weeks, however, could limit gains in Treasury securities, since corporations give investors a higher yield and firms arranging these debt sales often sell Treasuries first as hedges against losses in case rates rise before the sales are completed. Some of the well-known corporate names planning sales are Conoco Inc.; Korea Development Bank; the Delphi Automotive Systems Corporation, which is a General Motors spinoff, and the Union Pacific Resources Group.
The regular weekly Treasury bill auction was somewhat mediocre. The three-month bills were awarded with a rate of 4.265 percent, a little better than expected, and the six-month maturity came in at 4.345 percent. The number of bids for the six-month issue was considered weak, with a ratio of 4.03 to 1.
Results of yesterday's auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.922	97.803	High Rate	4.26%	4.34%	Coupon Yield	4.38%	4.51%	Low Rate	4.17%	4.15%	Median Rate	4.24%	4.34%	Total applied for	$30,868,276	$27,715,826	Accepted	$10,259,876	$11,497,026	Noncompetitive	$1,335,891	$1,103,687

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Palestinians Planning to Offer Bonds on European Markets

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, April 5

 BODY:
The Palestinian Authority hopes to cover part of a $150 million budget deficit this year by selling the first Palestinian bonds, the authority's financial affairs chief said here today.
Entering the so-called sovereign debt markets would represent a breakthrough for the Palestinian Authority, which has been unable to raise money on the markets with its ambiguous status as a semiautonomous territory controlled militarily by Israel. 
 The finance official, Mohammed al-Nashashibi, said the Palestinian Authority expected to pay most of its bills with tax revenue, including income from official import monopolies that had gone unreported in previous budgets. Mr. Nashashibi spoke as he submitted his 1999 budget to the legislative council here today. But a projected 10 percent increase in tax revenue is not keeping up with a 25 percent jump in the state payroll this year, and foreign donors are no longer willing to bridge the gap.
Mr. Nashashibi said in an interview that governments, which he would not name, were prepared to provide backing for Palestinian bonds to be sold in European financial markets. He said he was now negotiating the size and pricing of a bond issue with major investment banks that are prepared to serve as underwriters. The bonds, to be denominated in either dollars or euros, could be issued as soon as June, he said.
The Palestinian Authority's leader, Yasir Arafat, is expected to postpone a long-discussed declaration of independence from May 4, which falls in the closing weeks of an unanticipated Israeli election campaign.
Routine expenses in the Palestinian region are met largely from sales taxes and customs levies collected by Israel but passed on to the Palestinian treasury under an agreement. But the authority, with no uncontested claim on sovereign property or financial assets, cannot provide collateral for a commercially viable bond issue on its own.
There is some precedent for securities from poor nations to be backed by wealthier creditors, such as the Brady bonds from Brazil and Mexico, which carried repayment guarantees from the United States Treasury. But these were bonds issued by independent countries, with their own national assets and formal standing in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The Palestinians face several hurdles to sell bonds, including getting a credit rating and ironing out all the legal complications of a bond issue. An emerging markets analyst in London, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Palestinian Authority was moving into uncharted territory. But he also that if these problems were overcome, it was possible there might be a group of Middle Eastern investors interested in buying such an issue, despite the risks involved.
He noted that Lebanon has sold small Eurobond issues at more favorable interest rates than many Latin American countries because there is a large number of Lebanese and other Middle East expatriates willing to buy such debt securities.
In addition, the way to a bond issue would presumably be eased if the United States or other countries decided to offer guarantees.
Palestinian critics, echoed by overseers from Western aid donors, have demanded a public accounting of hitherto-undisclosed revenue from state agencies with exclusive rights to import and distribute fuel, cement, tobacco and other goods. "There is a serious problem with fiscal transparency, or rather the lack of it," said an expert with an international financial institution, who also spoke in exchange for anonymity.
Mr. Nashashibi did not mention plans for a foreign bond issue in his address to legislators, who have two weeks to review the budget plan. Mr. Arafat has already approved the spending plan, he said.
With Mr. Arafat's supporters holding a solid majority on the legislative council, approval is expected.

A Relief Phone Line

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
The Agency for International Development has established a toll-free telephone number and Internet site to encourage charitable donations to private groups helping to feed and shelter the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have streamed out of Kosovo.
Callers to the telephone number (1-800-USAIDRELIEF, or 1-800-872-4373) and visitors to the site (www .info.usaid.gov) are provided with a list of charitable organizations working along Kosovo's borders. 
 The agency, the lead Government organization in the humanitarian aid effort for the refugees, is encouraging donors to offer money to the groups, rather than collecting clothing or food.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE EUROPEANS;
News Reports Bolster Support for Bombings

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 5

 BODY:
The television images of refugees staggering out of Kosovo are having a powerful effect on public opinion across Europe, turning pacifists and anti-NATO activists of decades ago and NATO critics of just a week ago into supporters of sustained bombing.
In Madrid, Francisco Sanchez, a 25-year-old office worker, has watched the coverage and felt a national kinship with the suffering. "Spaniards also have emigrated when we were in need," he said, "and we should accept them here." 
 In Italy, the images of Kosovars packed onto exile trains have brought the war home with chilling reminders of moments from "Life Is Beautiful," the Holocaust tale by the Academy Award-winning actor Roberto Benigni.
In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair said that for him the refugee pictures were "scenes that belong to Europe's darkest hour."
Newscasts and front pages are filled daily with accounts of brutality and suffering and deeply affecting pictures of people stranded in border fields, streaming across frontiers in forced marches and crowding around relief workers for food.
Roy Hattersley, a former British Labor Party deputy leader and Government minister, wrote in today's Guardian: "My own doubts about the bombing -- expressed in this column last week -- have been completely removed by seven days of pictures. A NATO victory is the only real hope of permanent relief and decent resettlement for the refugees.
"A NATO defeat would convince political psychopaths all over the world that they, like Slobodan Milosevic, could tyrannize a whole people and get away with it. Whether or not we should have started the war, we clearly have to finish it. That must be obvious to everyone who owns a television set."
Earlier horror about seeing aerial combat return to Europe for the first time in 50 years is being overwhelmed by concern for the refugees and revulsion at the way they have been forced from their homeland.
Daily now across Europe there are announcements of government and private appeals to speed aid to the refugees, and even countries like Britain and France with reluctance to admit foreigners have had to respond to public pressure to shelter the refugees.
Germany has offered to take 40,000 Kosovars; the United States and Turkey, 20,000 each; Norway, 6,000, and Canada and Greece, 5,000 each. Britain and France said at first that they worried that airlifting refugees from the Balkans, even with the understanding that they would one day return to Kosovo, would risk abetting Mr. Milosevic's own desire to rid the province of its ethnic Albanians.
Mr. Blair conceded today that his Government would accept an unspecified number of refugees, adding that the "ultimate objective" must remain repatriating them to Kosovo. The French Defense Minister, Alain Richard, said Paris did not want to be seen taking a position apart from its allies.
But Mr. Blair and Mr. Richard twinned these moves with aggressive statements about the need for NATO to persevere in the bombing. Mr. Richard announced "even more intense attacks" by France's Mirage 2000-D fighter-bombers, and Mr. Blair said, "People have to be prepared to go on, have to be prepared for the longer haul in order to make sure that our objectives are secured and successful."
In his briefing today, the NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, stressed the alliance's commitment to caring for the exiles, saying it was "fully mobilized" behind the refugee assistance effort, building campsites and ferrying aid into Albania and Macedonia.
Though there has been acknowledgment of the historic menace of Balkan instability to Europe, the coming together of a joint political will on the Continent has not been based on a perceived threat to national political and economic interests, the traditional threshold issue.
What is driving the growing support for NATO is the sense of responsibility for forestalling human rights abuses and punishing those who commit them. A Guardian editorial said approvingly that European policy was increasingly in the hands of "humanitarian hawks."
In Germany, Prime Minister Gerhard Schroder, Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who were stern critics of United States policy in Vietnam and the installation of nuclear weapons in their country in the 1980's, are now taking Germany into its first war in 50 years.
A recent German newspaper headline read, "Dictators Look Out -- the 1968'ers Are in Charge."
Not all members of Mr. Fischer's Green Party are content with the Government's unflinching backing of NATO's aerial strikes. Roland Appel, a party leader in Dusseldorf, called it the party's "most difficult test" and pleaded with members to avoid reflexive pacifism that could split the party and force it out of the country's ruling coalition.
Mr. Schroder said today that he saw no reason to change the strategy of relying primarily on military force rather than diplomacy. Gunter Verheugen, a top Social Democrat within the Foreign Ministry, was blunter. "We are dealing here with one of the most terrible criminals of this century," he said, "and he must be treated accordingly."
In Italy, where Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema has given only wavering support to the bombing and called for a return to negotiations, public opinion has been swayed toward NATO through the dramatic reports of Antonio Russo, a broadcaster for a left-wing radio station. He stayed in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, after other Western journalists had left and managed to spirit out dispatches from a hiding place that students had arranged for him.
He escaped on Friday and sent an impassioned report to the daily La Repubblica recounting his odyssey among Kosovars in a sealed train.
The detail that drew particular attention because it so closely recalled "Life Is Beautiful" was the harrowing moment when heavily armed Serbs forced women, children and the elderly, with Mr. Russo among them, onto the freight cars. As they herded them on board, the Serbs said, "Come on, you've won a free train ride -- in exchange for your homes."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Main Gauges Of Stocks Rise To Records

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The stock market's torrid affair with technology and Internet companies continued yesterday, lifting the three main gauges of stock market performance to records.
Stocks rallied in their first day of trading since the release on Friday of mixed employment data for March. The news touched off a strong rally in the bond market on Friday in an abbreviated session. Stock exchanges were closed in observance of Good Friday. 
 The employment report makes it increasingly unlikely that the Federal Reserve will feel the need to raise short-term interest rates in the near future, a positive situation for stocks. Still, traders said they had not expected yesterday's surge.
"Things were kind of quiet at the end of last week, and the positive tone during the morning was quite surprising," said Andrew M. Brooks, a vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates.
For the most part, however, the biggest gains were concentrated among the largest and best-known leaders of a select group of industries, from I.B.M. and Microsoft to Intel, Lucent and America Online. Several financial-services stocks also soared.
"The strong are getting stronger, and cash is going into those stocks that have done well recently," Mr. Brooks said. "At some point, the music is going to stop, but no one knows when that is going to happen."
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index had all set records. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was light, with just fewer than 700 million shares changing hands. On the Nasdaq, 977.8 million shares were traded.
"Things are good, but there is no volume," said one stock trader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "What trading there is is all in technology, Internet issues and some financial stocks."
The Dow, which closed above 10,000 for the first time last week, did so again yesterday. The gauge rose 174.82 points, or 1.8 percent, to 10,007.33. The S.& P. 500 gained 27.40, or 2.1 percent, to 1,321.12.
The Nasdaq composite index rose to a record for the first time in two months. Bolstered by gains in stocks like Microsoft, 2 1/4, to 94 15/16 ; Intel, 6 5/8, to 127 1/2; Yahoo, 39 3/8, to 219 1/8, and Amazon.com, 15 1/2, to 186 1/2, the index soared 66.69, to 2,560.06.
For the most part, developments in the war in Yugoslavia were seen as inconsequential for stocks.
"Right now, people think the economy will continue to expand at a 4 percent rate and that inflation is dead," said Byron R. Wien, United States equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "The market is resistant to bad news, and Kosovo is a good example of that."
The Dow was led higher by I.B.M. and American Express, which together accounted for nearly 40 percent of the rise in the gauge.
I.B.M. climbed 6 15/16 , to 183 15/16 . And American Express rose 4 7/16 , to 125 7/16 .
Other Dow components did nearly as well.
General Electric gained 3, to 114 5/8. And Hewlett-Packard, the other computer company in the Dow, rose 3 9/16 , to 71 7/16 .
America Online led the S.& P. 500 higher and was again the most actively traded stock on the Big Board. It jumped 16 15/16 , to 166 15/16 . The gain propelled the company to ninth in terms of its weighting in the S.& P. 500, ahead of companies like AT&T and Lucent Technologies.
Lucent, whose previously announced 2-for-1 stock split became effective yesterday, had a big day. It rose 3 1/16 , to 58 15/16 . Meanwhile, AT&T's stock fell 1 1/16 , to 77 7/16 .
On-line brokerage stocks soared after an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston said on-line trading rose 30 to 35 percent in the first quarter.
Charles Schwab, the biggest on-line broker, gained 9 1/8, to 103 3/8. Ameritrade Holding, the sixth-biggest on-line broker, soared 29 1/16 , to 91 5/8. And Equitable's Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, which owns a widely used Internet brokerage service, gained 4 5/16 , to 71 3/4.
But the session also had some big losers.
The stock of Aspen Technology fell 3 5/16 , to 9 15/16 , after the software manufacturer said it expected to report a significant operating loss for the quarter ended March 31.
And shares of Aspect Development fell nearly two-thirds, losing 14 15/32 , to 7 15/16 , after the software maker said it expected first-quarter revenue and earnings to be well below analysts' estimates.
The breadth of the market's advance improved a bit yesterday, a development some analysts said was encouraging. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,695 stocks rose, while 1,318 fell.
"In the last week, breadth has improved a bit, but this is a very selective market, and it has been for over a year," said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis. "The bears just can't adjust to the kind of market we have right now."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
For Giuliani, Often Maverick, Party Support Isn't Assured

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
For all the differences between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph W. Giuliani, none may be more important than this: The Democratic First Lady is assured the support of her party if she runs for Senate next year. But the Republican Mayor faces the prospect of a complicated primary, fought in front of Republican voters who have long been wary of him.
The huge interest stirred by the prospect of a Clinton-Giuliani race has clouded Mr. Giuliani's sometimes difficult history with his party and its leaders, and the ways in which he might be vulnerable, for ideological and geographical reasons, in a Republican primary. 
 A reminder that his nomination would not be a foregone conclusion came yesterday as Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Long Island Republican, prepared for a week of appearances before Republican audiences upstate, where he will discuss his own interest in the Senate seat held by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat retiring after four terms.
Mr. Giuliani, unlike Mrs. Clinton, remains an unsteady figure in his own party, notwithstanding his evident political success. An array of influential party leaders -- starting with Gov. George E. Pataki and including Alfonse M. D'Amato, the former Senator -- have battled Mr. Giuliani for years, and many Republicans say the Governor and the former Senator are tacitly backing Mr. Lazio's bid.
Mr. Giuliani's success in positioning himself for an election where Democrats have a million-vote edge -- moderate on some issues, and conservative on others -- could complicate any Republican primary. The Mayor, for example, was one of the few Republicans who defended President Clinton during impeachment proceedings, and he opposed a ban on some forms of late-term abortions.
Mr. Giuliani's position on both issues runs counter to the strong sentiments of the generally conservative Republicans who are likely to vote in a primary. By contrast, Mr. Lazio voted for Mr. Clinton's impeachment and has supported a ban on the late-term abortion procedure.
Party strategists said it was clear that voters in Mr. Giuliani's political power base of New York City would have nowhere near the dominance in a statewide Republican primary that they would in a Democratic primary or, to a lesser extent, in statewide elections. Mr. Giuliani's advisers are counting on his strong standing in the city to help him overcome a statewide Democratic edge. In a primary, however, he could find himself facing a candidate from the suburbs who could erase any geographic advantage Mr. Giuliani hoped to have.
By any measure, Mr. Giuliani has to be viewed as a dominant figure in any Republican primary. He is well known, has demonstrated an overwhelming ability to raise campaign funds and has run New York City at a time when crime has dropped while the economy has boomed.
Mr. Giuliani's advisers asserted yesterday that they were not concerned about the prospect of a tough primary race if he decides to run for the Senate, recalling that he had won two primaries for mayor. "I don't see a Republican issue against him," said Peter J. Powers, the Mayor's political adviser. "When you look at what the Republican Party stands for -- lower taxes, lower spending, fighting crime -- he has stood for all of those things."
But other supporters of Mr. Giuliani were a bit more concerned about how he might fare in a Republican primary. The main concern is that the candidacy of a rival like Mr. Lazio -- a poised and articulate 41-year-old, four-term Congressman -- could turn into a rallying point for upstate Republicans wary of some of Mr. Giuliani's more liberal positions, from supporting rent regulation to backing gay rights, as well as the Mayor's frequently gruff manner.
Further complicating the outlook is the prospect that Mr. Pataki and Mr. D'Amato might support a subterranean campaign against Mr. Giuliani, encouraging supporters or contributors to back Mr. Lazio or saying things that could undercut Mr. Giuliani's standing.
Mr. Lazio said yesterday that both Mr. Pataki and Mr. D'Amato had offered him counsel as he considered his future career.
"They have been helpful and generous with their advice and in sharing their experiences," Mr. Lazio said. "And I am comfortable running on some of the same issues that Pataki has run on, including tax relief, protecting the environment and quality of life issues."
Zenia Mucha, the Governor's senior adviser, said that as a rule, Mr. Pataki stayed out of others' primary races. "It is imperative that New York elect a Republican Senator," she said. "We will work on behalf of the Republican nominee, who we are certain will be a candidate who embraces Republican principles and will be able to win."
In recent days, a number of state Republican leaders with ties to the Governor have spoken up for Mr. Pataki, while blaming Mr. Giuliani for the off-and-on political feud between the two leaders.
"The concern I get -- and I'm getting this from the other western New York county chairman that I work with -- is this feud doesn't make sense," said Robert E. Davis, the chairman of the Erie County Republican Party. "Everybody is concerned about what's going on. George Pataki helped rebuild the Republican Party."
Many Republican leaders are quick to recall Mr. Giuliani's support of Mario M. Cuomo, the Democratic incumbent, against Mr. Pataki in the 1994 race for governor. All of which could make it easy for Mr. Pataki to complicate Mr. Giuliani's attempt to line up the support of the party's apparatus.
Mrs. Clinton is not alone among potential candidates in the Democratic field -- Representative Nita D. Lowey of Westchester is also interested in the nomination. But Ms. Lowey has said she would step aside if the First Lady ran.

HEADLINE: 2 LIBYAN SUSPECTS HANDED TO COURT IN PAN AM BOMBING

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: UTRECHT, the Netherlands, April 5

 BODY:
More than a decade after Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Scotland, killing 270 people, the two Libyans charged with planting the bomb arrived in the Netherlands today to face trial for the crime.
As a result, the United Nations immediately removed severe sanctions on the Government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya. 
 The end of those sanctions, in place since 1992, allows international air travel and the sale of vital industrial equipment to resume. The step will also release Libyan assets that had been frozen in a number of countries.
But separate sanctions imposed by the United States before the deaths over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 will not end until other conditions are fulfilled, American officials said.
The delivery of the suspects in a highly unusual arrangement of trial in the Netherlands under Scottish law followed years of international pressure and months of diplomatic negotiations with Colonel Qaddafi.
Americans relatives of the dead expressed some bitterness at the turn of events, arguing that Libya had won more than it lost. But others expressed the hope that the extraditions would mark an important turn on the road to exacting punishment for the attack. Page A14.
 The two Libyans, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima, both assumed to be government agents, were brought here under a complex arrangement that treats a former military base near here as Scottish territory so the suspects can be tried under Scottish law. It was this formula -- promoted by Britain -- of holding the trial in a third country that finally broke the deadlock and ended Libya's long refusal to cooperate with American and British prosecutors.
The Scottish judges will have to weigh the still secret evidence provided by the United States and Britain and decide whether the two Libyans are guilty of planting the suitcase bomb. The judges will then face the fundamental questions of who gave the orders to blow up the plane and why.
The British and Americans have outlined the main conclusions of their case, but have withheld the particulars.
Libya handed over the two suspects this morning in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, to Hans Corell, the United Nations Undersecretary General for Legal Affairs, in the presence of envoys from half a dozen Arab and other nations invited by Col. Qaddafi.
An Italian plane took the two Libyans, each accompanied by a relative and a lawyer, to the Dutch military air base, Valkenburg. Dutch authorities at first took the two Libyans into custody after they arrived this afternoon but hours later formally extradited them to Britain -- on paper, that is -- so the Scottish police could take over.
Dutch military helicopters then took the Libyans to Camp Zeist, a former military base a few miles outside Utrecht. Some of the camp's buildings are being converted to include a detention unit for the suspects and a room for the Scottish court that will be sitting here. More than 100 Scottish officials, including prosecutors, police and court employees have already arrived in recent days. The camp, once used by American military and then taken over by the Dutch, is kept under tight guard by Scottish police officers.
President Clinton issued a statement today saying he was "gratified" by the extraditions. "Now, at last, the road to justice has begun."
Administration officials said that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright spoke with about 20 family members of the Lockerbie victims in a conference call today and reassured them that the sanctions on Libya could be reimposed if the Libyan Government backed away from any part of the agreement.
The British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, who was deeply involved in the diplomatic maneuvering leading up to the handover, said that today ended "a 10-year diplomatic stalemate."
"We had over a year of hard diplomatic effort and tough negotiations to get here," Mr. Cook said. "There will now be a criminal trial for that act of mass murder and the relatives of all those who died will have their first opportunity to hear all the evidence that we hold in open court."
He said one of the most difficult aspects of the case was that the Government had not been able to tell relatives of the victims of the explosion "what we know and suspect happened to their loved ones."
Eleven of those who died were on the ground in the village of Lockerbie, while most of the passengers who died were Americans.
British and American investigators concluded that a bomb was put aboard the Pan Am flight on its way from Frankfurt to New York during its stopover at Heathrow Airport. Less than an hour after takeoff, the Pan Am Boeing 747 exploded in flames, killing its passengers and crew members. In 1991, Britain and the United States indicted the two Libyan Government agents in connection with the bombing.
The two countries, which have gone to great lengths to amass the evidence for the crash, have insisted for years that the suspects must face trial in either Scotland or in the United States. When Libya refused, the two countries pressed the United Nations to impose sanctions in 1992. The sanctions were toughened in 1993.
These sanctions have barred air travel to and from Libya as well as the sale of arms and spare parts for aviation and for the oil industry, which is vital to Libya. Although the sanctions were suspended today, the Security Council is to vote to lift them completely. It can do so within 90 days if the Secretary General reports that Libya has met other conditions, like cooperating with France in its investigation of a UTA flight over Niger in 1989 in which 171 people died and committing itself to pay compensation to the families of the crash victims in case its two agents are convicted. The deadlock was broken last year when Washington and London took up an old Libyan offer to have the two suspects face trial in a third country. Libya had argued the two could not get a fair trial in Britain or the United States.
Libya's handover of the two follows months of mediation by South Africa and Saudi Arabia and threats by the United States and Britain that Libya could be subjected to even tougher sanctions. President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan took part personally in the negotiations with Colonel Qaddafi.
Asked if the sanctions played a role in Libya's decision, Mr. Annan said today, "I prefer to think they played a role. No country likes to be treated as an outcast." He added, "Libya wanted to get on with its economic and society development."
No date has been set for the trial at Camp Zeist.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
George J. Borjas's warning about the fiscal consequences of large-scale immigration of both unskilled labor and "high-tech braceros" (Op-Ed, April 2) runs contrary to the experience of the United States over the last two centuries, when the large influx of immigrants contributed to America's economic growth and made it the world's major economic power. 
 Restrictive immigration laws enacted during the 1920's, along with other factors, helped precipitate the Great Depression.
Despite the lack of high levels of education among most undocumented workers, they fill jobs like short-order cook, cleaner, gardener, farm worker and nanny at wage levels that do not trigger inflationary pressures.

Re "Illegal Immigrant Workers Being Fired in I.N.S. Tactic" (front page, April 2): The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 made it a felony for employers to hire an illegal immigrant. However, employers cannot refuse employment to a worker who presents a document that appears "genuine on its face." This Catch-22 forces farmers to hire workers they suspect may be illegal immigrants, which in turn makes farms easy targets for raids and audits by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
 Farmers do not want to hire illegal immigrants, but the Federal guest worker program -- the only way that immigrants can obtain temporary visas -- is complex, time-consuming and expensive for farmers.
That program must be reformed.

 You quote a fired undocumented worker as saying: "I want to work. What kind of bad crime am I committing?" (front page, April 2). Good question. I never understood one of the main justifications for the United States immigration laws -- namely, that the American economy is hurt by having too many productive workers. How absurd. Forcing employees who don't happen to have the right papers is inhumane. It also hurts America.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: IN MACEDONIA;
Macedonian Delays Endanger Refugees, Relief Agencies Say

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: BLACE, Macedonia, April 5

 BODY:
With tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians fleeing Kosovo backed up in dismal conditions at the Macedonian border, international relief officials accused Macedonia today of endangering lives by processing the refugees too slowly.
One official said that Macedonians were deliberately delaying the processing out of fear that a vast influx of Kosovo Albanians would upset the country's ethnic balance. Albanians account for about 20 percent of this country's population, while Macedonians, who generally sympathize with Serbia in the current conflict, make up about 45 percent. 
 Paula Ghedini, press officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that Macedonian authorities were clearing only 5,000 refugees a day, while 65,000 were stuck on a muddy hillside at the border, blocked by Macedonian forces from entering the country.
"That is not enough," Ms. Ghedini said. People are now dying at a rate of 10 a day, she said, and "this will increase if we do not get people out from the open."
"We have to get them out of the mud," she said. "It is extremely cold, it has been raining quite a lot, people are weakened, fatigued and in a state of shock."
Macedonia has been flooded with 136,000 refugees, most arriving in the last few days. In addition to the 65,000 believed to be stranded at Blace, the main crossing, another 30,000 people are thought to be on the far side of the border, in Kosovo.
And, at least one more train arrived this morning from Pristina, carrying some of the 5,000 people who arrived in the last 24 hours.
The latest arrivals have come on foot from Urosevac and even from Vucitrn, in northern Kosovo, fleeing Serbian forces and police officers who have forced a mass exodus of ethnic Albanians from their homes.
One official from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who insisted on anonymity, said Macedonian officials were barely cooperating with relief operation, and said the Macedonians were intentionally halting the influx.
Foreign aid organizations, which are providing the food and supplies, and NATO and the United Nations Commissioner, which are setting up camps to take the refugees elsewhere in Macedonia, were clearly losing patience today.
"They do not want to move people into Macedonia, that is incredibly clear," the United Nations official said. "They do not like Albanians at all, and that feeling is incredibly widespread among the population in Macedonia."
Macedonia has declined to give the United Nations a full mandate to process, register and care for refugees, despite the agency's offer.
"We have the experience and ability to process 20,000 refugees in one day," the official said, "but they do not want us do it."
Government officials have said the influx of refugees threatens Macedonia's economic and political stability. They have also expressed anxiety about the security of the border, and have brought in extra forces to secure the area and guard the refugees.
The policy appeared to have widespread support among ordinary Macedonians, who did not conceal their antipathy for the Albanians.
"Why don't your countries take them," asked one young policeman, cradling an automatic weapon as he guarded the road at the camp. "We don't want them."
Residents of Skopje were even more outspoken against the refugees. "The Government should not let them in," said Niko, a 24-year-old dealer of spare car parts and an ethnic Macedonian. "As you see we have enough problems ourselves. They are closing the factories because there is no money and if the Albanians come in, things will be even worse. We will become a minority here."
The Macedonian Government's actions also seem aimed at forcing foreign countries to take a large number of the refugees. United Nations officials agreed that other countries should share the burden.
"We are one hour's flight from any European capital, and they could offer safe havens to people," Ms. Ghedini said. "They should let them in on a temporary basis because most of these people will want to go back to Kosovo when they can."
Several busloads of refugees were taken straight to the airport this evening in an apparently uncoordinated move by the local authorities, and five planes reportedly flew about 750 Kosovars to Turkey.
Other countries have pledged to take refugees, but in the meantime, Ms. Ghedini said, the refugees should be given immediate help inside Macedonia.
Only one foreign aid agency, Doctors of the World, has been allowed to set up a medical tent inside the sprawling camp at Blace. Only local aid workers are allowed into the camp, to distribute food and gather up the sick. The official reason given for preventing foreigners from working in the camp is that it is a restricted border zone.
Ms. Ghedini said she worked all day and night at a transit camp put up by NATO. "We were ready at 2 P.M. yesterday, but there were no registration officials, no buses to take the refugees," she said.
The authorities began transferring the refugees in the middle of the night. By 3 A.M. some 5,000 refugees had been moved to the transit camp. "But there was no official at the camp, and we have no information as to whether they will be processed," she said. "This is quite frustrating."

HEADLINE: Dispensing Of Drugs On Internet Stirs Debate

BYLINE: By LISA NAPOLI 

 BODY:
Dr. James De Yarman specializes in performing hair transplants at his clinic in San Diego. Last September, he took his expertise on line, setting up a site on the World Wide Web called DrPropecia.com. There, he offers information about the drug Propecia, which promotes hair growth in men. Prospective patients can fill out an on-line medical history form, which Dr. De Yarman reviews for a $50 fee. If he determines that the drug would be useful for a patient, he then prescribes it and sells it to him.
"I have to assume they're telling me the truth," he said. "I'm not a drug store. I look at this as providing a service, going on line to sell it. What would I do different if they were to come into the office?" 
 Dr. De Yarman and others, who essentially function as both physician and pharmacist on line, are just one example of the ways in which the World Wide Web is changing how prescription drugs are changing hands. In other cases, international pharmacies, which sell drugs without prescriptions that may not be regulated in this country, offer on-line signposts for their wares. And, in the freewheeling climate of the Internet, patients are exchanging information and selling leftover drugs to one another.
These activities are raising questions about how drug transactions should be regulated -- and how, with the borderless, seemingly infinite shape of the on-line medium, they can be.
The Internet has leaped ahead of the agencies that govern prescription drugs in the United States. Typically, drugs are approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration, prescribed by doctors who are licensed by state medical boards, and dispensed by pharmacies licensed by state pharmaceutical boards. But by using the Internet, people can often purchase drugs from sources not licensed by these agencies. These activities have long gone on off-line, but have been difficult to detect. Now these practices seem to be booming on-line.
One concern stems not from the well-advertised Internet drugstores like Drugstore.com or Soma.com, both of which require a patient to fax a prescription from a doctor to have it filled on line. The focus is on sites like MDpharmacy.com, Net-Dr.com and US-care.com, which, like Dr. De Yarman's site, circumvent the traditional medical relationships by allowing a patient without a prescription to fill out a consultation form on line, pay a fee for its review and, if approved, receive drugs through the mail.
While the American Medical Association said it was not a violation of its code of ethics for a doctor to sell prescription drugs, it is an ethical violation to sell drugs without a face-to-face consultation. State law in California, where Dr. De Yarman does business, prohibits the sale of drugs without an examination. But most laws and codes which govern medicine were written before the Internet, said Greg Abrams, legal counsel to the California Medical Society, and do not factor in the questions raised by the medium.
Keith Lamb, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, recently purchased oxycodone, a potentially addictive pain reliever classified as a controlled substance in the United States, from a Spanish pharmacy he found over the Internet, because no doctor he visited locally would prescribe the drug for his back pain. "Foreign pharmacies willing to ship without prescription are a growing source who has seized on this gap because their countries do not regulate drugs the way the U.S. does," he said.
Dr. Randy Wykoff, the associate commissioner for operations at the F.D.A., said the sale of illegal or unapproved products is, of all the violations made possible by the Internet, of particular concern to the agency. In recent years, he said, several staff members who would typically investigate medical fraud have been redeployed to look for fraudulent practices on line.
Besides buying from foreign-operated Web sites, some Internet users swap drugs, facilitated by bulletin boards and other Web areas that foster a flea market environment on line. One participant in an on-line infertility group, for example, offered to sell "leftover" drugs she had purchased from Israel.
Determining which actions to take and which policies to rewrite to acknowledge the vast impact of the Internet on the sale of pharmaceuticals will take time. The House Commerce Committee last month commissioned the General Accounting Office to conduct a study on the scope of the prescription drug trade on line. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, the trade group for pharmacies, announced last month that it is developing a seal of approval for on-line pharmacies to help customers determine which ones are legitimate. The first seals are expected to be issued by May.
"We are not concerned about the economics, but about patient safety," said Carmen Catizone, the executive director of the pharmacy association.
For his part, Dr. De Yarman sees more benefits than pitfalls in extending his medical practice on line. "This is the future of medicine," he said.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times last Tuesday about the dispensing of drugs on the Internet misidentified the one ordered on line from a Spanish pharmacy by Keith Lamb of Columbus, Ohio, who suffers from back pain. It was codeine, not oxycodone.

HEADLINE: At Tip Time, Restaurants Do the Math

BYLINE: By AMANDA HESSER 

 BODY:
RESTAURANTS aren't sure that customers get the idea behind tips. Diners seem to have this notion that they're voluntary, a show of appreciation, something that's done only because they feel like doing it.
In fact, the tip is just part of the game -- and a growing number of restaurants are trying to lay down rules to make it easier for diners to do what they are expected to do. 
 Some restaurants -- like the new 16-32 Coach House in New York -- have tried calculating a 15 percent tip and adding it to the bill, just like an extra appetizer or entree.
Others, like Lula in Santa Monica, Calif., are printing "gratuity guidelines" on checks, and calculating what a 15 or 20 percent tip would be.
A few, like Restaurant Daniel, are setting mandatory tips of 20 percent on groups as small as six.
And many more places, including Union Square Cafe and the Palm Court in New York, are determinedly looking for ways to provoke diners into leaving a large enough tip, while not provoking them so much that they'll never come back.
It's been a bumpy experiment so far.
"Americans don't like to be told what to tip," said Barry Wine, a New York restaurant consultant. "We, the customer, want the power to reward good service and penalize bad service."
But restaurateurs aren't giving up.
The "gratuity guideline" or a "suggested gratuity" is the most common ploy. The restaurants list a variety of tips -- usually 15, 18 and 20 percent -- calculated from the bill. The tip is not added to the total, but the implication is clear: tip within the given range.
Offering tip calculations is "quicker for the customer," said Karen Kraushaar, a spokeswoman for the National Restaurant Association.
"It's easier," she said. "It's a convenience, there's no question."
But that is not quite the reaction most diners have. "It's kind of tacky," said Jay Goswick, an anesthesiologist in Los Angeles. When he recently had dinner at Lula and the bill came with a gratuity guideline, Mr. Goswick was taken aback. You can patronize the patron only so much.
"It was funny to see that this was the tip they thought you should leave," Mr. Goswick said. "It would make me more critical, make me question, 'Do they deserve that much?' "
Z-Tejas Grill in Austin, Tex., has been telling diners how much to tip for six months. "You kind of get mixed reviews," Doug Young, the general manager at the restaurant, said. Some diners have complained, he added, saying that the restaurant is trying to force them into leaving at least 15 percent.
The servers, however, like the system. "It has 20 percent on there," Mr. Young said, "and if you give good service then you usually get 20 percent."
Some restaurants are more bullying. At the "21" Club, the diner is advised: "Suggested 20 percent gratuity is not included."
Keeping servers happy is important during a time when they are in great demand -- and short supply. Tips generally make up at least 80 percent of a server's salary, so gratuities are built into the restaurant economy.
"Tipping does vary," Ms. Kraushaar said. And calculating tips for diners "is a way of trying to establish some consistency in tipping -- that's why it could be worth trying."
Companies that make the software used to calculate guest checks and to print credit card receipts say there is a growing interest in programs that calculate tips.
American Express developed a gratuity calculation feature on its terminals last year. "Merchants wanted it," Judy Tenzer, a company spokeswoman, said. Restaurants can request the feature, and can then choose the tip levels they want printed on the check.
Micros, a maker of sales terminals with more than 1,400 restaurant clients in New York and New Jersey, has received several requests for the program over the last nine months, said Lubodar Olesnycky, its president. One of them was from Union Square Cafe, which for years has been at the forefront of service in American dining.
An employee at the restaurant saw a gratuity guideline on a check at a small Chinese restaurant in northern New Jersey, and brought it to the attention of the management. They immediately took an interest in the idea.
"The problem it's trying to solve is universal," said Paul Bolles-Beaven, a managing partner at the restaurant. "Sometimes, people leave a low tip and it's not an indication of poor service. Maybe they're having a bad math experience or they've had a little more wine than is normal."
In the past, he and his partners had considered ways of incorporating tips into the price of the meal. They discussed this new idea for several months and asked Micros to develop a way to integrate it into their current system.
"On the positive side, we felt it could feel like a service to the guest," Mr. Bolles-Beaven said. "On the negative side, we felt it could take what is currently a discretionary thing and add some arm twisting to it."
When the management asked some of its regular guests whether they thought it should proceed with the program, though, the response was a unanimous "No." And the idea was promptly buried.
But restaurateurs and consultants say that New York is unique in respect to tipping. First of all, calculating tips is made easier by New York state tax, which, if doubled, equals 16 1/2 percent. But also, said Steve Hanson, the owner of Ruby Foo's Dim Sum and Sushi Palace and several other restaurants in the city, New Yorkers consider themselves more sophisticated.
"They can calculate what 2 percentage points can be," he said. And they don't want to be told.
The one exception used to be that parties of eight or more were charged a set tip, usually 15 percent. Now, in many Manhattan restaurants, like Le Bernardin, Bolo and Gotham Bar and Grill, parties of just six are charged an automatic gratuity, often as high as 20 percent.
When the 16-32 Coach House opened recently, the restaurant, which has a fixed-price menu, tried tagging on a 15 percent service charge to all checks. "It was a way of establishing that you come in and you know this is what you're going to pay for a meal," said Kirk Reed, the general manager of the restaurant. "It was trying to simplify things, but it ended up making things less simple."
Some diners failed to notice the service charge, which was listed on the bill, along with other food and beverage charges. So, they added a second tip. A blank line below the total, marked "gratuity," didn't help matters.
But the other drawback to this policy was that in New York, when service charges are added to a bill, they must be added before tax, which means that the tip is taxed.
The restaurant has since gone back to a traditional discretionary tipping system.
For many years, Michael's restaurant, in New York City and Santa Monica, added 15 percent service charges to all checks. Michael McCarty, the owner of the restaurants, converted back to an optional tipping system last year. To his surprise, the average tip in both locations is now closer to 20 percent.
"All these years, we gave our clients a bargain at 15 percent," he said.
He remains adamant that service charges are a more civilized way of doing business but is tired of trying to win over diners. "You're really wasting your time if you're trying to dictate to people what to leave," he said. "People are independent."
The United States is one of the few countries where voluntary tipping is customary. In Europe, a service charge of 10 to 15 percent is almost always included in the bill. Many travelers visiting the United States for the first time simply do not know to tip.
In New York City, some restaurants are not shy about cluing them in. There may be a large-type line on the menu, noting that a gratuity is not included. There may even be a second reminder printed on the check.
And in some cases, the server may simply take the matter into his own hands.
At the Palm Court at the Plaza Hotel, for instance, if the guest doesn't speak English, servers may automatically add a 15 percent gratuity. The management has found that almost 50 percent of their diners fail to leave adequate -- or 15 percent -- tips. A fact that they blame on uninformed tourists.
The American Festival Cafe in Rockefeller Center tried a softer approach. The check was brought to the table with a form asking diners -- in six different languages -- if they wanted to have a 15 percent tip added to their check. Diners could check "yes" or "no" boxes. The space, leased by Restaurant Associates, is currently being renovated. But when it reopens this summer, it will provide a similar form.
For Restaurant Associates, though, this form is where it draws the line. It would not consider adding gratuity calculations to checks, said John Harding, the director of marketing.
"It seems presumptuous to tell a person this is how much to tip," he said. "Tipping is a voluntary appreciation of service."
Or at least it is for the moment -- if your party is six or less, if you speak English and if you dare to ignore the guidelines.

HEADLINE: In the Balkans, No Wars Are 'Local'

BYLINE: By Robert D. Kaplan; Robert D. Kaplan is a correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly and the author of "Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History."

DATELINE: STOCKBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
The humanitarian nightmare in Kosovo may be reason enough for NATO's involvement in the former Yugoslavia, but for the United States there are vital strategic stakes involved as well. These stakes justify the use of any NATO measures needed to defeat Serbia, including the use of ground troops, because nothing less than the future contours of Europe are now being decided.
When the East-West division of Europe was erased in 1989 with the collapse of the Berlin Wall, a new division immediately began forming: that between Central Europe and the Balkans. Even before the outbreak of fighting in Yugoslavia in 1991, the Central European states of Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia were pulling dramatically ahead of Balkan countries like Romania and Bulgaria in terms of progress toward stable, democratic rule. 
 These northerly states of the former Warsaw Pact had several advantages: they were heirs to the traditions of the Hapsburg Empire, and they had sizable middle classes prior to World War II and Communist rule. The Balkan states were burdened by centuries of Byzantine and Turkish absolutism, and even before the Communist takeovers their middle classes had been mere specks amid vast seas of peasantries.
The admission of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has formalized this dangerous historical and religious redivision of Europe: between a Roman Catholic and Protestant West and an Orthodox Christian and Muslim East.
However, Slobodan Milosevic's campaign in Kosovo has now given the West a chance to reverse this process. A real NATO victory, one that not only gives the Kosovars protection but also knocks Serbia off its perch as the region's military threat, would go a long way toward stabilizing the continent.
This is because the immediate impact of the current fighting is being felt well beyond the states of the former Yugoslavia, which all told constitute only a third of the Balkan peninsula. Three major Balkan countries -- Romania, Bulgaria and Greece -- though not directly threatened by the flood of refugees roiling Albania and Macedonia, are nevertheless at a pivotal point of political destiny.
In Romania, the largest and most populous Balkan state, there is a tenuous peace between the Orthodox Christian majority and the ethnic Hungarian minority, which is mixed Catholic and Protestant and lives in the northwestern region of Transylvania. This relative calm is a significant achievement given that in the course of this century each group has occupied the other's territory.
Yet social peace is threatened by the lack of modernization in the countryside and Cabinet chaos in Bucharest, where economic reform is in slow motion and investor confidence is eroding. In Romania only the military is well run. Though Romanians are Eastern Orthodox, the horrible memory of dark Stalinist decades makes them desperate for NATO membership, which would keep the military out of politics, stifle ethnic nationalist politicians and energize the elite in the direction of good government.
The same goes for Bulgaria, where the democratically elected Cabinet is valiantly working toward economic reform but is besieged by criminal groups with links to Russian businesses and mafias. These groups operate as a state within a state and control large parts of the economy, including banks, car insurance and energy companies, tourist businesses and agricultural exporting. They put tremendous pressure on the Government and effectively push the country into Russia's fold.
The Bulgarian elite is fighting back but is legitimately afraid of being stranded at the far end of the Balkans, spurned by NATO and severed from Central Europe by instability in Kosovo and Macedonia. If the West cannot pacify the region, Bulgarian politicians will have to survive through deals with Russophile criminals.
Greece is the most misunderstood Balkan country. The West demands that Greece behave exactly like the other members of the alliance because it is middle class and a member of NATO. But it can't, because it is in the Balkans and must adjust its foreign policy relative to its geographical position. Greeks know that they are fated to live next door to the Serbs long after any NATO troops leave.
Moreover, throughout the long centuries of Turkish occupation, Greeks were supported by their Orthodox co-religionists in Serbia and Russia -- a fact of history with effects that run deep. And, having never experienced Soviet occupation or Communism, Greeks have a romantic attachment to Russia that doesn't exist in Romania or even Bulgaria.
The Greek Government is supporting the United States as best it can, given the pressures upon it from both the political left and right. But if the Serbs humiliate NATO, Greeks will act in self-interest: their NATO ties will be reduced to an official trapping, even as they deny this very fact and quietly intensify links with their fellow Orthodox in Moscow and Belgrade. After 47 years of NATO membership, Greece could be lost.
Appeals to conscience will not keep Greece a de facto as well as a de jure member of NATO, nor will they keep Romania and Bulgaria from slipping into the sway of Russia. What is required is nothing less than a complete NATO military victory. Indeed, while the Greeks and the Macedonian Slavs despise each other, as Orthodox Christians they equally despise the Muslim Kosovars. Few in the region can be expected to feel sympathy for the Islamic refugees, who disrupt the fragile religious and ethnic balance in neighboring countries, already burdened by weak governments and high unemployment.
Thus, if the bombing campaign fails and NATO gives up at the negotiating table, it would seal Europe off according to medieval lines, with the newly expanded NATO a mere variation of the old Holy Roman Empire -- the old Christian West, that is -- and with the Near East beginning where the old Ottoman Turkish Empire once did, roughly on the border between Croatia and Serbia and somewhere in Transylvania where ethnic Hungarians meet Romanians.
In 1834, entering the autonomous Ottoman principality of Serbia from the Hapsburg Empire, the English travel writer Alexander Kinglake wrote, "I had come, as it were, to the end of this wheel-going Europe, and now my eyes would see the Splendour and Havoc of the East." That same demarcation between East and West will re-emerge unless Mr. Milosevic is crushed with air and ground troops and a NATO protectorate is established in Kosovo and Macedonia. Only Western imperialism -- though few will like calling it that -- can now unite the European continent and save the Balkans from chaos.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Storyteller Tries to Lift Up a Ravaged Land

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER 

 BODY:
THE organizers of the People's Poetry Gathering, a three-day festival going on in a half-dozen downtown locales this weekend, were proud to announce, among their poets, a West African griot, or storyteller and history-keeper, one Kewulay Kamara, who was raised in Sierra Leone.
As that job sounded like a cousin to a reporter's, it seemed worth a trip to Queens, where Mr. Kamara lives with his wife and three children in Jackson Heights, to compare notes. His apartment was sun-filled and welcoming; there was coffee and a plate of brownies. 
 But one could see early on there were cultural gaps to bridge.
"Griot," for example, is considered a somewhat offensive term, associated with French colonialism. Mr. Kamara, who will be performing at Cooper Union on Sunday afternoon, prefers the word "finah" (pronounced FEE-nah). Finahs are not simply historians; they are orators, emcees, inspirational speakers.
Do finahs, as tellers of the village tales, have the same complaints from their community if their stories are too frank as did, say, the young Philip Roth?
A perplexed look from Mr. Kamara, 45, who, while he has a computer alongside his African drums and has lived in this country since he was 18, is not familiar with early Roth.
"It's not told in a literal way, the way history in the West is told," Mr. Kamara says. "Our history is very, very didactic and it's told in the company of music."
A smile. "Multimedia."
Another cross-cultural problem, this one belonging entirely to Mr. Kamara: He is a history keeper. His country has been torn apart by war. How to tell that story?
Do you believe in an African Eden? That is the picture that comes to mind when Mr. Kamara speaks of Danka Wali, his village in the mountains of Sierra Leone.
The town had grown up about a great tree, 20 feet in width. So welcoming were the people of Danka Wali, Mr. Kamara says, that when strangers arrived they would be met with a song. Mr. Kamara sings a little, then translates.
"Tabom bari moya dudee -- come to my home you will see the epitome of hospitality, there is abundance of food in my home" -- and suddenly, in his living room, one thinks (Aha!) of the brownies -- "there is abundance of laughter."
Mr. Kamara's father was a finah and a farmer. Mr. Kamara accompanied his father to all the important ceremonies of the town. He was also the first of his family to have a Western education.
HE attended a Roman Catholic boarding school, then came to the United States and spent a year in a public high school in Massachusetts. He received a political science degree from the State University at Oneonta, and a master's degree in economics from the New School. He works for the Census Bureau.
Last year, Mr. Kamara learned that his village had been attacked. Almost all 200 homes were destroyed, two of his uncles were murdered, two brothers were missing.
"The people came out to welcome them, singing," says Mr. Kamara, in his storytelling voice, "and what did they do? They herded the children into huts and lit them up. The old were hacked and thrown into huts and lit up. The people dispersed into the forests. Three days of killing and maiming."
Mr. Kamara raised $5,000 and returned to Sierra Leone with money, clothing and medicine. He brings out what he salvaged from his father's home: two clay medicine pots.
"I was going to write about it," Mr. Kamara says. "But I wanted to write an uplifting story where the people came back to the village and began rebuilding their houses. And shortly thereafter it was attacked again and again and there were more horror stories."
Doesn't Mr. Kamara feel obligated to bear witness to a story even if it doesn't have an optimistic ending?
"What is the meaning of telling a story if it doesn't help people transcend?" Mr. Kamara says.
Then Mr. Kamara recalled another story about his village, told to him by his father:
There once was a village that had many conflicts. Then a village elder told the people to make a sacrifice to the great tree that stood over them. After that, life was harmonious.
"Then there came a time when a great conqueror walked the land," Mr. Kamara says. "Wherever he went, the vultures were never hungry and smoke covered the sky. He was told not to go to Danka Wali, but he did. And when he stood under the great tree, there was thunder and lightning. And when it was clear, the great conqueror lay dead."
Was there in fact a conqueror who was killed in Mr. Kamara's village?
"Well, I'm telling you what I was told," Mr. Kamara says. "As you can see, there is a poetry in it. Maybe he did die. I believe it. But the way I am doing it now, telling this old story with the new, gives new meaning to it: Hey, this thing continues. The village was not destroyed before. People have come with their guns. But they will not destroy the village."
Mr. Kamara reflects.
"I grew up surrounded by sacred forests where you can't cut a living tree and when the village was attacked, where did the people hide? In the sacred groves they were forbidden to cut down."
Two writers considering:
Aha!
Aha!

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The Banking System and the Sword;
A Regulator Sets His Agenda For Japan's Financial Giants

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 6

 BODY:
As a samurai, Hakuo Yanagisawa would have never bothered to sheathe his sword. He spends his time feinting and darting and backing his adversary -- Japan's banking system -- against the wall. The establishment seems ready to yield.
Not long after Mr. Yanagisawa took over as chief regulator of Japan's banking system last fall, word raced through town that two bank presidents had committed suicide. It wasn't true, but it captured the fear felt by bank executives that Mr. Yanagisawa's demands on them would be unbearably taxing and that their jobs might no longer be secure. 
 Mr. Yanagisawa has suggested that he wants fewer banks. He has bullied five banks into pulling out completely from international business. And others have caved in to his demand that they abolish the deeply ingrained practice of "sodanyaku," in which former top executives continue to draw large salaries and retain a company-paid car and driver until the day they die.
For his part, Mr. Yanagisawa, a 63-year-old member of Parliament, shrugs off the talk of suicides and undue pressure. He argues that his rule is harsh only in comparison with the Finance Ministry officials who, he says, governed the banks for years "tenderly, like a mother."
"We are absolutely not giving the Japanese financial institutions the cruel treatment or giving them an impossible or unsolvable agenda," he said. But, he added pointedly, "I am convinced that this is a time of change."
Like the Resolution Trust Corporation in the United States, which simultaneously shut down numerous savings institutions and bailed out many others, the Financial Reconstruction Commission that Mr. Yanagisawa heads will rely on a combination of carrots and sticks.
Mr. Yanagisawa and other Government officials say the banks wiped off all the bad debt from their books on March 31, the end of the fiscal year. They set aside $77 billion, enough to both cover the bad debt and provide a cushion for good debt that might go bad.
The day before, the banks buttressed their weak cushion of capital when the Government funneled in large chunks of cash in a bid to restart the recessionary economy. The Government hopes that the infusion of $64 billion will encourage banks to take more lending risks, thus easing a credit squeeze.
Mr. Yanagisawa is attaching some strings to the money. He demanded agendas for restructuring, which now include cutting one in three board directors on average.
Moreover, when banks distribute their preferred shares to the Government, in return for taxpayers' money, they will have to watch their stock prices closely. If a bank's stock slides, then the Government could increase its stake when it converts its preferred shares, which do not carry voting rights, into common stock. In some cases, such as Daiwa Bank, the Government could start stepping up its voting stake beginning as early as June.
"This is the first time in Japanese banking history that the share price is important to management," said Robert Zielinski, a banking analyst at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. "If they let the share price drop, they might be owned by the Government."
To be sure, Mr. Yanagisawa is hardly a radical. A former Finance Ministry official, he rose in the bureaucracy as an elite graduate of Tokyo University. As a politician he has defended farmers, a key constituency. He rarely drinks more than one beer at a time and he does not play golf. His idea of a good time is a walk through a modern art museum with his wife, a woodblock artist.
And though his aides leap when Mr. Yanagisawa calls, especially to nightly meetings that often end at 10 P.M., they say he takes good care of them, sometimes ordering take-out for those who work late.
Mr. Yanagisawa contends that Japan is near the end of its eight-year battle with bad debt, and an increasing number of financial experts -- while still worried about Japan's enormous economic problems -- are encouraged by the growing sense that banks will not collapse and throw the system into shock.
As a result, Mr. Yanagisawa has been winning plaudits where it counts -- in the marketplace. The stock market is up some 20 percent from its low in October and bank shares have leapt 65 percent since then. Some overseas hedge funds and other investors are betting that the worst has passed and that the potential for gains now outweighs the risk of further losses.
The changes inside the banking system may seem to come slowly, but progress is being made. Bank executives are losing their bonuses, salaries are being cut, and more and more employees are afraid of being dismissed. Banks are re-evaluating their customers, writing off loans, calling in others or demanding partial repayment. They are unloading unwanted real estate, as well as selling some bad loans.
The Financial Supervisory Agency, which Mr. Yanagisawa's commission oversees, says it plans to set up an electronic monitoring system at the banks over the summer, and it is considering sending in full-time inspectors.
Still, there has been a lot more talk than action, and Mr. Yanagisawa has critics. For one thing, no one believes that the banks' books are clean just yet. The present estimate of $77 billion in bad debt is only a tiny fraction of the various estimates that previously made the rounds -- $650 billion and higher -- although it is unclear whether previous estimates were too high or the present one too low.
Some analysts say the banks need to anticipate at least another $85 billion in bad-debt disposal next year, and even more public money, especially if the economy retreats again.
"They've put some stability under the tottering structure, but they haven't repaired it," said Alicia Ogawa, managing director at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney. "They have a lot of good policy out there. The question is: Is the Government really going to enforce it? Judging from recent history, there's not a lot of good hope."
Others complain that key decisions about the banks were based on hasty inspections. Teams of 10 inspectors from the Financial Supervisory Agency spent more than two months poring over the books of each bank, but their work may be suspect because many had previously worked in the Finance Ministry, which has been seen as too gentle on the banks.
Mr. Yanagisawa has been trying to raise the credibility of his watchdogs, and he refused to move into the same office compound as the Finance Ministry.
Japanese bankers themselves are skeptical about rapid change. One Japanese executive said real change could only come when his generation retired. Another banker said that unless senior management set a good example, it would be hard to impose changes in pay scales, eradicate lifetime employment or curb pension and other benefits.
"My worry is that by the time the F.S.A. says they will fire management, I think it will be too late," the banker said. "The problem that many banks face is that they can't make the tough decisions to invest in new businesses when their mission now is to fire and get rid of the bad loans."
Japan's banking system faces a number of obstacles before it regains its balance, much less before it becomes internationally competitive. Banks need to catch up in technology -- they are not even fully linked to the Internet -- and transform the way they perceive and perform their business.
"The problem in the Japanese banking system now is that they are not making money," said a senior official at the Financial Supervisory Agency. "The challenge they face is to look for new businesses where they can expect higher profitability.
"This time in Japan, there are new young entrepreneurs," he added, speaking on the condition he not be identified. "I hope the banks would help people take over old traditional sectors and enterprises in Japan, so that each enterprise becomes more active in taking risks."
While some analysts are encouraged by the new direction, they say Mr. Yanagisawa's commission, which is supposed to oversee the supervisory agency for another two years before its mandate expires, must keep up the pressure. Otherwise, the banks will lapse into old habits.
One worry is that the financial supervisors are stretched too thin. With banking reform on track, the agency now wants to turn to the problems at smaller, local financial institutions, as well as the billions of dollars in bad debts burdening the insurance industry. But it cannot afford to ignore the banks.
The Government demanded detailed plans from the banks on how they would refocus their businesses, but Mr. Yanagisawa was disheartened to find that almost all of them chose the same path: to strengthen their retail business. The problem, he says, is that banks still aim to protect stakeholders -- employees in particular -- rather than the shareholders who nominally are the owners.
"You can call it the Japanese character if you want, but I can definitely say that all of corporate management, not just the management at banks, is stakeholder management, not shareholder management," Mr. Yanagisawa said. "And they are inclined to all look at what other banks are doing. They want to be in a stable condition together. And considering the future of the Japanese financial industry, that is a little bit of a headache."
Everyone acknowledges that any progress will be slow. Hideichiro Hamanaka, deputy commissioner at the supervisory agency, lit some incense -- perhaps for good luck -- and likened Japanese banks to aircraft carriers, which require time to adjust to a new heading.
"The new direction for the Japanese financial companies has been set," he said. "One or two years down the road the new direction will be evident."

After years of refusing to turn to taxpayers to bail out Japan's ailing banks, the Government has finally agreed to provide at least $64 billion to help wipe out the financial system's bad debts. In return for the money, many banks are being forced to overhaul their operations. The hope is that the clean slate will encourage banks to lend again.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow and S.& P. Retreat, but Nasdaq Edges a Bit Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell from record levels as Gillette led consumer companies lower after the world's largest maker of razors said its earnings would not meet expectations because of slow Latin American sales.
Gillette joined Coca-Cola and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing in warning that business abroad was hurting profits. With stocks near record highs, "there's no room for error," said James Weiss, head of stock investments at State Street Research and Management in Boston, which oversees $54 billion. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 43.84 points, or four-tenths of a percent, to 9,963.49. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 3.23, or two-tenths of a percent, to 1,317.89. The Nasdaq composite index edged up 3.11, a tenth of a percent, to 2,563.17, a record.
Declining stocks outnumbered advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange 1,797 to 1,192. Volume was 787.5 million shares on the Big Board, in line with the three-month daily average.
Gillette slumped 7 3/4, to 50, after it said first-quarter profit would be a penny less a share than analysts had forecast because of weak sales in Latin America and for its Braun appliances. The company said it expected profit of about 24 cents a share.
Coke, which gets two-thirds of its sales and three-quarters of its profit abroad, fell 11/16 , to 59 13/16 . 3M, which gets half of its sales abroad, fell 1 1/16 , to 71 15/16 .
Intel led semiconductor shares higher with a gain of 2 15/16 , to 130 7/16 , after an analyst at Lehman Brothers said the industry's recovery from its worst recession ever was picking up steam.
"A multiyear bull market is under way in semiconductor stocks," the analyst, James Barlage, said in a report to clients. Semiconductor companies shipped $10.9 billion in goods in February, up 3.5 percent compared with sales in the month a year earlier, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.
Applied Materials rose 2 3/16 , to 67 15/16 ; LSI Logic gained 3 1/2, to 36, and Micron Technology climbed 2 1/4, to 53 3/4.
Other computer stocks also rallied. Dell Computer rose 2 3/4, to 46 13/16 . The third-largest personal computer maker is set to brief analysts tomorrow. Dell and other computer-related companies have lagged behind the gains in the broad market the last two months on concern that sales were slowing. With first-quarter earnings reports on the way, investors are encouraged that Intel and Dell have not issued warnings.
"People are waking to the fact that the fundamentals continue to be very strong for technology companies," Mr. Weiss said.
Sun Microsystems surged 10 5/8, to 140 5/8, after the maker of computers that run Internet sites introduced products that work with a rival operating system from Microsoft. Sun hopes to profit from the sales growth of Microsoft's Windows NT, analysts said.
General Motors, the world's largest auto maker, surged 3 1/2, to 91 1/16 , amid optimism about car sales. Ford Motor, the second-biggest car company, said that total car and truck sales rose 13 percent in March, beating expectations. Ford, however, slipped 1/16 , to 58 1/4.
Liberty Media Group rose 3 1/4, to 59 1/2. The cable-TV programming company will acquire an 8 percent stake in the News Corporation, the world's No. 5 media company, for about $2.1 billion, the companies said.
In the bond market, Treasury prices rose for the second time in three days after Yugoslavia declared a unilateral cease-fire in Kosovo, making investors more willing to take on risk.
James Tesone, who manages $500 million of bonds at Carret & Company, said "the proposed ending of hostilities would make people feel better" about buying long-term bonds over safer, short-term securities, even though the cease-fire was immediately dismissed by NATO.
Treasuries were already rising before the cease-fire was announced as investors took encouragement from expectations for tame inflation in the United States and lower European interest rates.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury rose 30/32 , to 96 3/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.52 percent, from 5.58 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Dividing an Office Tower to Get the Most From It

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
It's a modern marketing variation of divide and conquer -- dividing a building to better conquer the downtown real estate market. That is what the owners have done as part of a $60 million renovation at 60 Broad Street, a 39-story, million-square-foot office building that features a series of setbacks leading to a tower.
The bottom 23 floors, with separate entrances and lobbies, are for various government agencies. And the smaller, higher floors -- 24 through 39, which have windows on all four exposures and superb views of the harbor and the cityscape -- have been renamed the Tower @ 60 Broad Street and are being marketed as 205,000 square feet of high-end office space, with their own lobby and appropriately higher rents. 
 "We felt those floors would command higher rents, and we wanted to create a building within a building for the high-rise," said Richard Mandel, president of the Commercial Group of Kennedy-Wilson International, a publicly traded real estate company based in Los Angeles, which with Pioneer Holdings, a Hong Kong investment company, bought the building 14 months ago. "The views are incredible. You can see the harbor, the Statue of Liberty and the Verrazano Bridge to the south, Brooklyn to the east and the World Trade Center to the north."
The bottom 11 floors, about 450,000 square feet, are occupied by a variety of New York State agencies, with a separate entrance at 25 Beaver Street and nine years left on the leases.
Two New York City agencies have just signed up for floors 12 to 23 -- and their own separate lobby, at 33 Beaver Street. "We're fortunate that the building has a big base -- about 50,000 square feet -- that allows for a lot of entrances," Mr. Mandel said. "We removed a 1,500-square-foot retail space -- an art gallery that used to be on Beaver Street -- to create the new lobby entrance."
The administrative and planning offices -- commissioners and staff -- of the city's Department of Homeless Services and Department of Probation will occupy about 299,000 square feet, he said, with an annual rent of about $23 a square foot. The agencies, as do the state offices, will have their own elevator banks.
The tower floors start at 18,000 square feet, with most of the floors from 27 through 39 about 12,000 square feet. And Mr. Mandel has signed his first two tenants for the space. Grant Thornton, a Chicago-based accounting firm, has leased the 24th and 25th floors, 36,000 square feet. The International Securities Exchange, a new computer-based options exchange, has taken the 26th and 27th floors, 30,000 square feet. Cushman & Wakefield is the building's leasing agent.
Starting annual rents for the two new leases, Mr. Mandel said, "are in the high $20's a square foot."
"We expect to average about $30 a foot for the upper floors," he said, "which is still quite inexpensive, compared to the higher rents in other parts of Manhattan." Mr. Mandel said leases for several other floors are in various stages of negotiation.
The tower will have a new $2 million lobby, designed by Mancini Duffy, and its own six new elevators as part of the $60 million buildingwide plan.
When Kennedy-Wilson and Pioneer bought the building early last year for $62 million from Li Ka-shing, a billionaire investor from Hong Kong, only about 450,000 square feet was occupied. Now, Mr. Mandel said, about 87 percent of the million-square-foot building is spoken for.
The building, built for RCA during a real estate boom in 1961 by the developers Percy and Harold Uris, has been a barometer for the downtown real estate market. The Reichmann family's Olympia & York company bought the Uris properties during a recession in 1977, the first step in establishing itself as the largest commercial landlord in New York. The Reichmanns had a $160 million mortgage on the building in 1990, when the principal tenant, Drexel Burnham Lambert, went bankrupt.
Mr. Li bought the mortgage and a 50 percent stake in the building for $57.5 million in 1991, when Olympia & York was unable to cover the monthly mortgage payments. Olympia & York defaulted on the mortgage, and Mr. Li ultimately took control of the building.
He considered selling the top half of the building for conversion to 400 condominium apartments but eventually sold the entire building to Kennedy-Wilson and Pioneer.
After the new owners took over, they began renovations, which included asbestos abatement over 500,000 square feet, redoing the fire, electrical and sprinkler systems and completely upgrading the elevator systems, "to bring the building up to par with today's buildings," Mr. Mandel said.
Joel Wechsler, a senior managing director at Grubb & Ellis New York, the brokerage company, who specializes in downtown commercial real estate, said he thought that the building-within-a-building concept was a "terrific idea" because "it will enable small to midsize companies to acquire office space in the prestigious tower of a building rather than in the low-rise portion, where most of that competitive inventory is currently available."
Mr. Mandel said he was optimistic about finding tenants. "I expect," he said, "that 95 percent of the building will be leased by summer."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Russia Starting Key Talks With I.M.F.

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Wednesday, April 7

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund and the Russian Government will begin a critical round of negotiations later today that is aimed at completing an economic program and loan package to avert a threatened default on Russia's foreign debt.
Its Treasury and central bank reserves vastly depleted by the financial crisis that began last August, Russia hopes to get the fund to refinance about $4.8 billion in loans coming due this year, most of that in the second and third quarters. 
 The country also needs an economic program approved by the I.M.F. to successfully restructure nearly $17 billion in debt payments it owes to a group of Western lenders.
If it fails to get the fund's approval, Russia is likely to default on all its foreign debt payments. "Time is running out for Russia," said Christopher Granville, a strategist for the Russian subsidiary of Robert Fleming, a British brokerage firm.
Russia has been wrangling with the fund for months to win new loans to refinance its debts. A breakthrough of sorts came last week when Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F's managing director, and Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov issued a joint statement after a meeting in Moscow that noted that both sides had agreed to a primary budget surplus of 2 percent of the gross domestic product in 1999 "and most of the measures needed to achieve it."
It is now up to the I.M.F. delegation of economists that arrived here on Tuesday and the Russian Cabinet to work out the details of those measures, which are of a sort that is consistently among the toughest obstacles to completing aid packages.
At the heart of the problem is a budget shortage around 30 billion rubles, or $1.2 billion, Moscow economists estimate. To reach an agreement with the monetary fund, Moscow must find ways to raise enough revenue to fill the gap, including taking such unpopular steps as imposing a tax on gasoline or export tariffs on metals and other raw material.
Changes in the tax code must be approved by the Communist-controlled lower house of Parliament, which vigorously opposes legislation linked to the I.M.F.
Russia's strained relations with the West, especially the United States, over NATO attacks in Yugoslavia will make things even harder. Indeed, the Russian legislators recently undermined I.M.F. talks by voting for a cut in the value-added tax, which accounts for nearly half of budget revenue, according to the Russian-European Center for Economic Policy, a research group here.
Skittish so far about entering into a long battle with Parliament, Mr. Primakov's Cabinet has taken "a salami-slicing approach to negotiations with the I.M.F.," said a Western diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "Instead of developing a few major efforts to discuss with the I.M.F.," the envoy said, "the Russians come up with 400 nickel-and-dime measures that grind down their opponents across the table. It shows a political weakness."
Despite the Government's waffling, most economists in Moscow believe that the I.M.F. and the Russians will announce an economic program in the coming days, and that the I.M.F.'s board will approve the new credits at its meeting at the end of this month. Clearly, neither side wants a default. Russia owes the I.M.F. $19 billion, making it one of the lending agency's largest debtors.
For Moscow, default could cause another round of possibly disastrous economic and political upheaval. For the I.M.F. and its major contributing nations, a Russian default would signal the failure of their efforts to nurture market capitalism here.
But after lending Russia money for years, often on the strength of just its promises, the I.M.F. is expected to be much tougher this time. It may insist, for example, on a trial period to see if Russia can make good on the conditions of the economic program before the first installment of aid is released.
"One of the differences from the past is that the I.M.F. is demanding that certain laws be passed before the money is released," said Rudiger Ahrend, director of the Russian-European Center for Economic Policy. "The I.M.F. doesn't want to be seen as giving money to countries heading for another failure."

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Rise for a Fifth Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The index of leading economic indicators posted its fifth consecutive monthly increase in February, suggesting that the economy will keep growing well into its ninth year of expansion.
The index, which was released yesterday by the Conference Board, is intended to predict economic growth for the following six months. It rose two-tenths of a percent in February -- as expected -- after an unrevised gain of five-tenths of a percent in January. 
 Declining jobless claims and rising consumer confidence led the increase. The number of workers filing for state unemployment benefits was below 300,000 for all of February and has stayed below that level for nine consecutive weeks, the longest such stretch since an 18-month run that ended in December 1973. The University of Michigan's index of consumer expectations -- the gauge used in calculating the leading economic indicators -- rose in February to 103.6, the highest level since April.
"The economy seems to be cruising along well, shrugging off international challenges," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank in Chicago.
Of the 10 components of the index, 4 rose in February and 4 declined.
In addition to jobless claims and confidence, a rise in the money supply and a widening of the interest rate spread between the Federal funds rate and the 10-year Treasury note contributed to the index.
Declining new orders for consumer goods and nonmilitary capital goods, a drop in building permits and faster vendor deliveries had negative effects on the index.
Two components, an unchanged manufacturing workweek and a slight decline in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, had no effect on the February index.
The index "shows less breadth than usual, with only 4 of the 10 components rising in February," Michael Boldin, director of business cycle research at the Conference Board, said in the report. "Nonetheless, the overall trend continues to point to strong growth."
The index of coincident indicators, a gauge of current economic activity including industrial output, rose three-tenths of a percent in February after rising two-tenths of a percent in January. The index of lagging indicators rose two-tenths of a percent in February after rising five-tenths of a percent in January.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A China Trade Deal Is Now Up to Clinton

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
With 24 hours remaining before the arrival of China's Prime Minister, President Clinton struggled tonight to decide whether to strike the broadest trade agreement in Chinese-American history, in return for American agreement to usher China into the World Trade Organization. But his top advisers were deeply split about whether to take the deal.
In two days of furious negotiating here preceding Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's arrival on Wednesday night, American officials have been locked up with China's Trade Minister, Long Yongtu, in an effort to resolve a wide variety of outstanding differences. President Clinton had several conversations today about his bottom-line positions with his trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, but Administration officials said he might try to resolve the last issues directly with Mr. Zhu in their meetings on Thursday. 
 Officials said they had already concluded accords on a series of contentious issues involving agriculture, including a Chinese agreement to allow in American wheat that China previously insisted was tainted with disease. Rather than barring the wheat altogether, China agreed to a tolerance level that will permit most of the American-grown wheat into the country.
In Los Angeles, where Mr. Zhu started his visit today, he said his negotiator had reported "good news" on progress in the trade talks. Page A3.
But the two sides were still negotiating how large a stake American companies will be allowed to take in Chinese telecommunications companies. China has already said it is willing to sell 30 percent stakes in these companies to foreigners, but will not permit them to take controlling interests.
As of this afternoon, both sides were arguing over how much liberty American banks and brokerage firms would have to operate throughout China. At the same time, American officials have raised new issues, including a demand that the United States extend quotas limiting the import of Chinese-made textiles until 2010, an effort to win over some members of Congress whose constituencies are bound to be aroused by any deal. The Chinese have protested the effort, and -- perhaps in a last-minute negotiating ploy -- appeared to back off today on some offers to open the market in the financial sector and on tariff reductions for some American-made goods.
While negotiators argue over the details, though, President Clinton appears focused on the strategic significance of a deal -- helping to integrate China into both the global economy and a global set of legal regulations governing trade. Mr. Clinton is also intent on helping strengthen the authority of Mr. Zhu, whom he sees as an accomplished economic reformer and Washington's best hope of opening a true channel of communication with the Chinese leadership.
But Mr. Zhu, under pressure at home, cannot be seen to be giving in too much to American pressure, especially at the cost of Chinese jobs. And Mr. Clinton, as one of his advisers put it today, "is facing the likelihood of another Nafta fight in Congress" -- a reference to Mr. Clinton's defying his own party to push through the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993.
Congress had a direct vote on the wisdom of Nafta, and most Democrats opposed it, saying that it would move jobs to Mexico. The China argument, though, is far more complex. Congress does not have a direct voice in whether the Administration casts its vote to get China into the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules of trade and arbitrates disputes. But China's entry would require Congressional action to amend the law that creates an annual Congressional review of China's trading rights, which inevitably becomes enmeshed in China's human rights record, its standoff with Taiwan and now its espionage efforts.
Officials who have sat in meetings on the negotiations say the President is leaning strongly toward striking a deal. But the head of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling, has argued that anything short of a perfect deal -- and there is no such thing in trade negotiations -- would undercut the Administration's efforts to unify Democrats on Social Security, Medicare and other issues that Mr. Clinton views as central to his legacy. He has received some support from John Podesta, the White House chief of staff.
Tonight Mr. Sperling denied he was opposed to a deal, and added, "We're not raising the bar out of politics, but not lowering the bar to get a deal during the trip, either."
The strongest advocate of a deal, the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, has been almost entirely tied up managing the crisis in Kosovo, the officials say, and that has cast some doubt about how the final arguments will play out in the Oval Office. "From the start, Sandy has wanted this because he realizes it's the only thing that we can get done with the Chinese before the end of this Administration," one White House official said recently.
"But this is a case where the most important relationship we have is getting a lot less attention at a critical moment than it should because of the military action under way," the official continued, "and that raises the chances for miscalculation on our end or the Chinese end."
Still, some of the concessions that Chinese have made so far go beyond the road map that American officials gave Beijing three years ago, when negotiations over China's entry into the World Trade Organization seemed stalled. For example, China has agreed to limit its demand that American companies provide technology to China in return for a right to invest there. The demands for technology have been a major issue for American companies like Boeing, which at times have refused to provide the Chinese with proprietary technology at the cost of large deals.
Whether Mr. Clinton decides to sign a deal may depend on his calculation about how strongly American businesses will support it. Their willingness to lobby in Congress -- pointing out the benefits to individual companies in individual Congressional districts -- may well determine the strength of opposition.
But how willing they will be to press the issue depends on what they get from the deal, which will vary from industry to industry. "Any deal that doesn't have the seal of approval of the business community isn't a deal worth doing," Ms. Barshefsky said last week.

HEADLINE: Ruling Allows Tariffs by U.S. Over Bananas

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization handed the United States a significant but only partial victory in its long-running dispute over banana trade today, authorizing the Clinton Administration to impose roughly $191 million in sanctions against European-made goods.
The figure is the organization's estimate of the damage done to American companies because of Europe's elaborate quota system that favors the importing of bananas from its former colonies, instead of from Central American nations where Chiquita Brands and other American corporations are major growers. The United States had argued that the damage was far higher, amounting to $513 million, and it began collecting 100 percent tariffs on many European luxury goods early last month. 
 The trade organization's far lower estimate of damage is based on a different, more conservative formula than the one employed by the Clinton Administration. That was a victory for Europe, where officials have accused Washington of exaggerating the effects of Europe's rules. At the same time, the panel of judges determined that Europe's revised rules governing imports amounted to nothing more than a rewriting of the old rules and were an effort to avoid compliance with several past rulings.
"Time is running out" for the Europeans to comply with the organization's mandate, said Peter Scher, who directs agricultural negotiations for the United States trade representative's office.
The oddity of the United States declaring victory over Europe in a long-running economic dispute, while trying to hold the same European nations in alliance in the Kosovo crisis, was somewhat jarring today -- a dissonance that was rarely seen in the days of the cold war, when security always overrode nasty trade spats.
This argument, however, has already gone far beyond questions of banana trade, with Europe and the United States both having considerable political capital invested in their respective positions. President Clinton, who has argued about the issue for hours with European officials, has cast it as a test of the authority of the trade organization to mandate that nations change their trading practices. Unless he can show Americans that Europe is forced to drop trade barriers, he argued recently, it will be impossible to forge a consensus for Congress to comply with rulings that go against the United States.
Presumably, today's ruling paves the way for a negotiated settlement. But so far neither side has been willing to back down, and Mr. Scher said today that the United States would impose the sanctions retroactively, to March 3. Because only $191 million in imports are involved, however, the list of products subject to sanction -- everything from pecorino cheese to expensive European clothing accessories -- will have to be cut at least in half.
The European Union has accused the United States of acting arrogantly, pointing out that virtually no American jobs are at stake. The whole argument, they contend, has arisen only because the head of Chiquita, Carl H. Lindner, is a powerful contributor to both Democrats and Republicans, and has been pressing the Government to aid his company.
There is little doubt that Mr. Lindner's influence pushed the issue to the top of the American trade agenda. But the bottom line of today's decision is that the ruling favored the United States. This evening, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said in a statement that the W.T.O. decision "sends a clear message" that Europe cannot use a lengthy legal process to buy time, keeping its restrictions on imports in place.
"This is the fifth time in six years that an international trade panel has found the E.U.'s banana policies to be in violation of international trade rules," she said.

HEADLINE: Luck and the B Train Win a Race for a Yankee Fan

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
It was not Mae-Ann Gilbert's worst subway ride. That, she said, would have been the morning rush hour in 1988 when the No. 3 train struck and killed a woman and other passengers cursed the victim for making them late. Nor was it her most unpleasant experience in a contest. That came in 1984, she said, when she was the first-ever black contestant in the Miss Staten Island pageant and her appearance on stage was greeted with stony silence.
But yesterday, as her No. 4 train, allegedly an express, slowed to a walk somewhere north of 14th Street and was passed by a No. 6 train on the local track, she could feel the Great Yankee Stadium Subway Race pulling away from her. "We may be the last ones coming in on this train," she said. "Very slow." 
 For years, the Yankees have entertained fans between innings by showing an animated race on the scoreboard between the B, D and 4 trains from Brooklyn to the Yankee Stadium stop at 161st Street in the Bronx. Yesterday, three subway riders took part in a real-life race to see which train provided the quickest ride.
The three contestants in the race, organized by New York City Transit and Modell's Sporting Goods to promote a new line of Metrocards commemorating the Yankees that go on sale today, were chosen by a drawing at Modell's. Each started at a station in Brooklyn judged to be a one-hour ride from the stadium.
At 10:15 A.M., Ms. Gilbert, 36, an unemployed marketing consultant from South Ozone Park, Queens, stepped through the turnstile at the New Lots Avenue station on the 3 line (she would transfer to the 4 at Utica Avenue). David Ladd, a Hofstra University law student and die-hard Yankee fan from Plainview, N.Y., got on the B train at 50th Street and New Utrecht Avenue in Borough Park. And Dennis Bell, 45, an unemployed maintenance man from Fort Greene, Brooklyn, started at the D station at Avenue U in Sheepshead Bay.
Al O'Leary, a spokesman for New York City Transit, said the inside money was on the No. 4, which runs express in Manhattan (unlike the B) and seems to take the most direct route. Ms. Gilbert, a numerology buff, tried to improve her odds further by sitting in the fourth seat in the fourth car on the 4 train, but the train's mysterious slowdown -- an announcement by the conductor was inaudible -- did her in.
Mr. Bell's D train spent the shortest time en route, about 61 minutes, but he had to wait 10 minutes to board because he entered the station just as a train was pulling out. Even so, he arrived at 161st Street on the same train as Mr. Ladd, who had to transfer to the D at 145th Street in Harlem, the last stop on the B line.
It was here that Mr. Ladd's experience and youth served him well. Confronted with the maze of hallways in the station, Mr. Bell, who had never been to Yankee Stadium, froze in confusion. He spotted Mr. Ladd, only to see him take off like a shot. "I got out and saw the McDonald's, and I knew where I was," Mr. Ladd said. "I headed out across the traffic, and I just started running."
Mr. Ladd, who had recently come off crutches for a sprained ankle, sprinted the half-lap around the stadium to the giant bat on the home-plate side to finish in about an hour and 15 minutes. Mr. Bell, who stopped running several times to catch his breath, wheezed home a few minutes later. Ms. Gilbert, who also got lost in the subway station, finished last.
For Mr. Ladd, who won a pair of box seat tickets to the Yankees' home opener on Friday against the Detroit Tigers, the trip was a learning experience. In dozens of trips to the ballpark, he had always driven. He was circumspect when asked if he would take the Long Island Rail Road and the subway from now on. "I might start," he said. "There's no reason why I wouldn't."

HEADLINE: Reforms Punish Poor, Veteran Socialist Says

SERIES: LIFE AFTER WELFARE: Ending a Tradition

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, April 6

 BODY:
Welfare's sudden death has stunned many residents of the central city here, but few have expressed more dismay than an elderly gentleman on a poverty-pocked block who has been monitoring the neighborhood's civic affairs since the Great Depression.
At 86, Frank P. Zeidler is the last of Milwaukee's three Socialist Mayors -- no other major American city has had even one -- and a living link to a time when Wisconsin politics was synonymous with safety-net expansions, like workers' compensation and unemployment insurance. 
 Now Wisconsin is known for a seemingly opposite passion, an anti-welfare campaign that has cut the state's cash assistance rolls by more than 90 percent. And Mr. Zeidler -- learned, courteous, still sharp as a tack -- is mulling the question that may keep political scientists busy for the next generation:
What happened to the state's famously progressive traditions?
"What you're seeing in Wisconsin is a deconstruction of the progress we made in the first decades of the 20th century," Mr. Zeidler said recently at his home in Milwaukee's poverty belt. "It's a kind of neo-anarchism that says, 'Nothing the Government can do is right,' and only the profit motive is justified. This is one manifestation of it: 'Get rid of the people on welfare.' "
Then again, the welfare restrictions have the support of some of the city's leading Democrats, who say they are building on a progressive past that celebrated toil and toilers. One of the most vocal welfare critics here is the current Mayor, John Norquist, a three-term Democrat who has run each time with Mr. Zeidler's support. As Mr. Norquist puts it, progressive reforms like unemployment insurance aimed "to help workers get through a tough time and get back to work -- the idea wasn't to keep people on welfare."
Ideological disputes aside, most people here agree on one thing: Mr. Zeidler is a civic treasure. A gold mine of local lore -- he interrupted his welfare talk to help a caller trace the origins of Milwaukee fish fries (they started in taverns in the Depression) -- Mr. Zeidler observes the attack on welfare through a unique set of lenses.
As an organizer, he has been working the north side wards since 1932, when German-American factory workers formed the core of the Socialist vote. As Mayor from 1948 to 1960, he fought battles for public housing that foreshadowed the welfare wars. And as a central-city homeowner for 53 years, he has endured white flight, black riots and a rash of break-ins that left him sleeping behind a saw-horse barricade, as devoted to the neighborhood as ever.
"Moving is a terrible hassle," he said. "And you don't want to get pushed out of your own house."
Mr. Zeidler, a Socialist Mayor when Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin was busy hunting Communists, knows that political heritages are complex. In his view, the city's progressive ways have been eroding for more than 40 years, partly for racial reasons. The postwar boom brought poor Southern blacks streaming into Milwaukee, and a white backlash followed. Indeed, as an advocate of public housing, Mr. Zeidler himself was a target. "There was a feeling that benefits were attracting the poor and that cutting benefits would stop it," he said.
The City Council blocked his drive to build more subsidized apartments. (Oprah Winfrey was reared here in one, he notes with pride.) His 1956 opponent called for time limits for public-housing residents -- presaging the time limits on cash assistance that followed 40 years later. And Mr. Zeidler won that race despite wildfire rumors that he was urging blacks to move to town by posting billboards across the South.
"They said I was bringing in all the blacks and secretly moving out," said Mr. Zeidler, who is white. "And here I am, 53 years in the same house."
Yes, he is here, but control of the state has shifted to conservatives in the Milwaukee suburbs and their rural allies, like Gov. Tommy G. Thompson. Mr. Thompson, a Republican from the small town of Elroy, has ridden an anti-welfare crusade to an unprecedented fourth term.
To Mr. Zeidler's chagrin, the drive to end welfare came with early support from Milwaukee Democrats, the closest thing he has to political heirs. As early as 1990, Mayor Norquist was denouncing welfare as harmful to the poor and calling for its replacement with public jobs.
Milwaukee has a long tradition of left-wing politics, noted for its conservative quirks. The city's Socialist pioneers were so pragmatic -- obsessed with services like sanitation, not revolution -- that radicals dismissed them as "sewer Socialists."
Consider the cry of the first Socialist Mayor, Emil Seidel, at his inauguration in 1910. "The eyes of thousands of stricken cities are today directed toward our Milwaukee," he began in soaring fashion -- before promising the masses such consolations as to "place the finances of our city on a sound and sane basis." (His assistants included a Socialist newsman, Carl Sandburg, who later turned to poetry.)
In holding City Hall for 38 of the next 50 years, Milwaukee's Socialists were known for clean water, more parks, strict zoning, low debt and honest and efficient rule -- a sensibility that elsewhere might have been known more simply as "good government." Working in the State Legislature with their off-and-on allies, the rural Progressives, they also passed the nation's first programs of workers' compensation (1911) and unemployment insurance (1932).
By 1993, the Socialists were gone and a war on welfare was under way. In the view of Democrats, Governor Thompson had been denouncing the program without offering a credible alternative. One of Mayor Norquist's proteges, State Representative Antonio Riley (a former welfare recipient himself), introduced a bill that dared the Governor to abolish cash aid and create public jobs.
By passing the bill (with no Republican votes), most Democrats hoped to goad the Governor into an embarrassing veto. But instead, Governor Thompson agreed to "end welfare" three years before Congress followed suit. (He vetoed the jobs provision and fudged the issue later by creating modest community service positions for those unable to find work.) Forced now to work for welfare, most recipients have simply left, to find private jobs or rely on friends.
Recently, another of Mayor Norquist's aides paid Mr. Zeidler a visit. A left-leaning critic of welfare, the aide, David Riemer, brings a near-religious faith in work programs like those created in the Depression. Indeed, it sometimes seems that Mr. Riemer knows every building, bridge, and trail left in Milwaukee by the public works crews of the 1930's.
Though he wants real jobs for the poor -- not community service, where those left on welfare simply work off their checks -- he considers the current system a good start. The state now offers low-income workers an impressive array of benefits: wage supplements, child care subsidies and subsidized health insurance. Even welfare recipients have gotten a raise, to $673 a month from an average of about $517.
"Once people are seen as workers, it's a lot harder to say no to them," Mr. Riemer said. "That was part of 'sewer Socialism': the idea that people who could work, should work -- and society then should help."
Politely, but firmly, Mr. Zeidler disputed the parallels with the past.
Socialism was a movement of the poor, he said, while the welfare reductions have mostly come "from people who want to punish the poor." Socialists stressed education, he said, while the reductions have forced many women to leave school. The Socialists protected minors through child labor laws. They would have been distressed, he said, by a program that puts infants in day care when they are 12 weeks old.
Speaking from nearly nine decades of experience, Milwaukee's last sewer Socialist warned against simple theories of the poor. "People are poor for lots of reasons -- you have to have a net to catch the ones that don't fit your system," Mr. Zeidler said. "And I don't see that anymore. That safety net is gone."
With the nation's welfare rolls down 43 percent, President Clinton, as well as his Republican critics, count the landmark 1996 welfare law as the cornerstone of their respective legacies. That law replaced a 60-year-old cash safety net with a program of time limits and work requirements.
No place has come closer than Wisconsin to the goal of "ending welfare." A decade ago, 100,000 Wisconsin families relied on public aid. Now 9,000 do.
The changes taking place in the state, particularly in its largest city, Milwaukee, continue to reverberate in broad and unpredictable ways. Throughout the year, The New York Times is returning to Milwaukee to plot the pattern of change.

HEADLINE: First-Quarter Auto Sales Said to Be Fastest Start Ever

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 6

 BODY:
When the General Motors Corporation reports its sales of cars and trucks in March on Wednesday, the first quarter of 1999 will most likely go into the books as the best start ever to a sales year for the United States auto industry.
Virtually every auto maker closed March and the first quarter with sales higher than last year's healthy levels. Last week, DaimlerChrysler, Volvo, Honda and Infiniti reported record March sales. Kia had its best month ever, Volkswagen had its best March since 1981, and Subaru had its best March since 1988. Audi, BMW with Land Rover, Isuzu and Nissan also reported higher sales. 
 "Without even knowing G.M.'s numbers, the first quarter has closed with the fastest sales start in U.S. history," said George Pipas, manager of sales analysis for the Ford Motor Company, which reported higher-than-expected March sales today. Ford said it sold 399,908 cars and trucks through its Ford, Mercury, Lincoln and Jaguar dealers in March, up 13 percent from March and surpassing the March record set in 1978.
When G.M.'s sales are added in -- and they are predicted to be slightly higher than last year's -- the seasonally adjusted average selling rate will likely rise to more than 17 million cars and light trucks, an increase of about 12 percent compared with last year's strong March results, said David Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities in New York.
Mr. Pipas noted that the first quarter of 1999 was not a single quarter phenomenon. The annual selling rate has been running at 16 million vehicles or more every month since last March, except for July and August, when G.M.'s North American assembly plants were shut because of a strike by workers at two parts plants in Michigan. He sees no end in sight to strong car sales.
What is significant is not only the sheer volume of vehicles auto makers are selling, but what vehicles they are selling, Mr. Healy said.
"The most profitable models are showing the strongest sales and the biggest year-to-year increases," he said, noting sales of Ford's Expedition and DaimlerChrysler's Dodge Durango as well as luxury-car sales are extremely strong. "It's the best of all possible worlds for the auto makers. For a change, Detroit is profit city."
In addition, auto makers have backed off from costly incentives, and the deflation of car prices that has occurred over the last two years appears to be ending. Prices will most likely rise and incentives will continue to slow as auto makers find themselves in short supply of some vehicles because of the stronger-than-expected winter sales. March typically marks the start of the best-selling six months of the year, and auto makers build inventories through the winter to prepare for the spring selling season.
In response to strong sales, auto makers have been raising their sales forecasts for the year and increasing vehicle production. Ford said today that it would increase second-quarter production by 20,000 trucks and 10,000 cars. In March Ford raised its sales forecast for the year to between 15.5 million and 16 million vehicles, from 15 million to 15.5 million.

HEADLINE: How Suspects Were Moved, Very Discreetly, to Court

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 6

 BODY:
The operation was intricate, complex and above all secret. No one except Hans Corell, the chief legal counsel for the United Nations -- not even Secretary General Kofi Annan -- knew the details surrounding the logistics for the surrender of the two Libyan suspects charged with planting the bomb that downed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
In interviews during the last two days, Mr. Annan, Mr. Corell and other senior diplomats described eight months of intense political and logistical maneuvering that produced the breakthrough, ending a decadelong diplomatic impasse and giving the increasingly marginalized United Nations a sorely needed victory. 
 Mr. Annan disclosed, for instance, that all the legal and logistical problems had been resolved by mid-November. He and Mr. Corell had even asked Italy to lend the United Nations a Boeing 707 jet on which United Nations markings were painted.
Mr. Corell had located and interviewed trustworthy pilots, personally approved the flight plan to the Netherlands and recruited doctors and nurses to accompany the two "passengers," as he called them. He had even ordered appropriate food -- no ham, shellfish or alcohol, in light of Muslim dietary prohibitions -- and taken steps to insure that the food would not be poisoned.
Then Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya's eccentric leader, balked at the deal that he and the Arab League had originally proposed -- putting the two suspected intelligence agents on trial in a third country.
So Mr. Annan orchestrated a discreet but relentless political campaign to persuade Colonel Qaddafi, including a hitherto secret appeal by Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia. As part of this appeal, the United States assured Libya that the trial would not be used to undermine the colonel's rule.
Mr. Annan said he had realized early in his tenure as Secretary General that Libya was slowly persuading the Organization of African Unity, the Arab League and other countries that the two Libyan suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima, would never get a fair trial in Britain or the United States.
Chad, Niger and Gambia, among other African states, began flouting the United Nations sanctions by flying their leaders or senior officials into Tripoli airport. And last summer the 53 members of the Organization for African Unity voted to stop abiding by the sanctions.
"I realized that if we didn't find a way forward," Mr. Annan said, the economic sanctions would lose all legitimacy.
At the same time, he said, by rejecting "every Libyan proposal," the United States and Britain "had boxed themselves into a situation of being the stubborn negative ones."
What Mr. Annan called the "first crack" in the impasse occurred last August when first Britain then, more reluctantly, the United States agreed to the Libyan-endorsed Arab League proposal that the two men could stand trial in the Netherlands under Scottish law.
"We ultimately decided," one American official said, "that agreeing to the Libyan proposal of a trial in third country would box Libya in." If Colonel Qaddafi agreed, "the impasse would be over," the official said. "If he did not accept a version of his own proposal, he would be embarrassed and ultimately isolated."
Last October and November, United Nations lawyers led by Mr. Corell and a Libyan legal team led by Kamel Hassan Maghur, a former Foreign Minister, met quietly at the United Nations over several weeks to "clarify" the many thorny questions: Who would be authorized to defend the Libyans in a Scottish court of law in the Netherlands? Would the suspects would be considered "passengers" or "prisoners" on the flight from Libya?
Meanwhile Mr. Corell quietly began preparing for the surrender and transfer. All of the legal issues and arrangements were completed by Nov. 13, Mr. Corell said, but still there was no political decision from Colonel Qaddafi.
"It's one thing to work with the technicians and another to get a political decision," Mr. Annan said. "And we needed a political decision, which is why I went to work."
In early December, Mr. Annan flew to Libya to meet with Colonel Qaddafi. After several hours of one-on-one discussions in the leader's tent outside Sirte, his desert capital, Mr. Annan said, he left convinced that the colonel had realized that a deal "had to be done."
But the Libyan had repeatedly vowed publicly never to turn the suspects over to a foreign court. "So he had to manage his own reality," Mr. Annan said, "and reverse the dynamics he had created."
Taking no chances, Mr. Annan flew from Libya to an Arab summit meeting in the United Arab Emirates, where he enlisted promises of mediation and other support from President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and their emissaries. In the ensuing weeks, he said, he recruited dozens of leaders, including President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Prime Minister Primakov, to urge Colonel Qaddafi to accept the deal.
An American official agreed that Russia, which has opposed American policy on Iraq and Kosovo, had been "very helpful" in resolving the Libyan impasse.
Most of the diplomats interviewed said they began to believe that Colonel Qaddafi would surrender the suspects as promised only after President Mandela announced it on March 19 in a speech at Colonel Qaddafi's side in Tripoli. Even then, Mr. Corell was so secretive that not even Mr. Annan knew exactly when, where and how the Libyans would be moved.
Mr. Corell, a meticulous lawyer with a passion for bird-watching and playing bagpipes, left nothing to chance. An experienced negotiator and appellate court judge in his native Sweden, he and a Russian lawyer on his staff checked off item after item on their list, from jet fuel to devising a seating plan for the flight.
Diplomats said Mr. Corell was obsessed with security, and rightly so, given Libya's insistence on it and warnings the United Nations had received about people who wanted to insure that the two men would never stand trial in the Netherlands.
Today United Nations and American officials called the surrender a vindication of the sanctions that many complained would never work.
"For the first time, we decided to use a multilateral-sanctions approach on a terrorism issue," an American official said. "Now there will be a trial, and justice will be done."

HEADLINE: Let Immigrants Organize for Better Wages

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Immigration Boosts Our Economy" (letters, April 6): 
 The Immigration and Naturalization Service raids in several Yakima Valley warehouses in Washington State where workers were organizing violated the practice of noninterference with union campaigns. The raids occurred as agribusiness was lobbying for new guest worker laws similar to the "bracero" program that created horrifying conditions for Mexican migrant workers from the 1940's to the 60's.
Enacting a new guest worker program that lifts the requirement to recruit locally would depress wages and make it harder for farm workers to organize. Instead, we should enforce the rights of the immigrants already here to organize for better pay and working conditions.

HEADLINE: Let Immigrants Organize for Better Wages

 BODY:

To the Editor:
George J. Borjas (Op-Ed, April 2) urges immigration reform during our relatively prosperous economy. 
 But curiously muted in the discussion of such changes is the low replacement fertility rates among native-born Americans, which has been the case in the United States for 24 consecutive years, and for several decades in most developed countries. Heavy immigration has delayed or diminished some of the negative effects of below-replacement fertility rates.
Responsible demographers consider continued immigration as an imperative in order for developed countries to survive should present native-born birth rates hold.

Worker Can File Suit Charging Age Bias

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
A laid-off worker is free to pursue an age discrimination lawsuit against his former employer even though he signed a document promising not to sue in return for an $8,900 payment, a judge in Bridgeport, Conn., has ruled.
Judge Alvin W. Thompson of United States District Court, in a ruling that became public Monday, said that the worker's written promise to AlliedSignal Corporation was not binding because the company's waiver failed to comply with a 1990 Federal law. 
 The Older Workers Benefit Protection Act requires companies to disclose the ages and job titles of employees retained and laid off when they ask workers to waive their rights to sue in return for severance pay.
When the worker, Fred Suhy, was laid off from AlliedSignal's engine plant in Stratford in December 1994, the company only disclosed the age ranges of workers who lost their jobs. Judge Thompson said that was insufficient. Mr. Suhy was 52 and senior lab technician at the time.
"It's basically a 'Don't play games' decision," said Ellen J. Vargyas, legal counsel with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
AlliedSignal, which closed the Stratford plant in 1996, had asked Judge Thompson to dismiss Mr. Suhy's lawsuit, saying he waived all of his claims and rights.
But Mr. Suhy's lawyer, Gary Phelan, who is seeking to have the suit declared a class action, argued that the company did not provide enough information for Mr. Suhy to make an informed decision. If Mr. Suhy had not signed a waiver, he would have received a smaller severance package.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Two Voices From the Past That Echo in Today's Bias

BYLINE: By Walter Goodman 

 BODY:
Among the treats of "Writing New York," the new Library of America anthology edited by Phillip Lopate, are generous excerpts from a pair of remarkable 19th-century diaries that speak to us from a charmed distance in a sometimes uncharmingly immediate way.
Philip Hone (1780-1851) and George Templeton Strong (1820-75) had much in common. As well as being inveterate and invaluable diarists, both were successful businessmen and civic personages. As certified members of the city's self-designated elite they were accustomed to running things until their set, with its Colonial credentials and nativist assumptions, gave way to a flood of immigrant insurgents. 
 As Strong was in the throes of chronicling the decades in four million words, the action was moving uptown from its center around Wall Street. ("How this city marches northward!" he exults.) The diarists' accounts of social, commercial and political doings are larded with New York names: Ogden and Tappan, Schermerhorn and Olmstead, Griswold and Astor, Fish and Field. From such descendants of Olde New York were drawn the masters of the Stock Exchange, who traded tips at the Union Club, the Episcopal elders who worshiped at Trinity Church, the lords of Fifth Avenue mansions, the guest lists for brilliant fetes, the benefactors of the needy and the names of many city landmarks.
But even as they were writing, the patricians were being swamped by families of no wealth or distinction. The young profession of urban demography found its subject as one group of newcomers gave way to others and to still others in an inimitably American saga.
For the 19th-century Establishment, it was an invasion of the unwashed; that at any rate was how the best and the brightest, like Hone and Strong, greeted the Irish who sought succor in America and whose muscle built the city both horizontally and vertically. They were lumped by many Anglo-Saxon Protestants as an ignorant and superstitious mass.
Hone, not a particularly mean-spirited man, saw the early immigrants as an alarming element that was susceptible to rabble-rousing incitement against "the aristocracy," a word the patricians took unironically for themselves despite their revolutionary pretensions.
Even before the devastating potato blight of the 1840's that gave the city a Celtic cast, Hone wrote: "These Irishmen, strangers among us, without a feeling of patriotism or affection in common with American citizens, decide the elections in the city of New York." He warned that "the same brogue" in which political demagogues instructed them to shout "Hurrah for Jackson!" would in time be turned to cries of "Down with the natives!" Everything about the Irish seemed to invite terror or mockery. Strong called the tale of St. Patrick's campaign against snakes "a Popish delusion." He preferred to believe that the snakes perished of biting Irish people.
By the financial crisis of 1857, in Strong's view, the subversive contingent included German socialists, many of whom were out of work and were even more dangerous than the Irish. True Americans, after all, did not gather in alehouses to listen to one another rant their foreign-bred opinions, sometimes in a foreign tongue.
While admiring the charitable efforts of women of his class, Strong had little compassion for the rowdy unemployed: "Certainly the destitute are a thankless set and deserve little sympathy in their complaints." To counter the corruption and violence associated with the underclass, he liked the idea of a vigilante group of well-born respectables who would take the law into their own hands.
Such sentiments have been expressed, though not always so candidly, down the decades. No immigrant group has been spared. Being deemed a threat by self-advertised patriots is a rite of passage in America. And hard times or political commotion, as Strong's compelling account of the ferocious 1863 draft riots attests, brought out truly murderous passions.
The one group for which Strong found sympathy, out of opposition to slavery and perhaps because the New York Irish were among their tormentors, were blacks. Although he is given to racial epithets, he wrote after reports of beatings and lynchings: "They are the most peaceable, sober and inoffensive of our poor, and the outrages they have suffered during this last week are less excusable -- are founded on worse pretext and less provocation -- than the St. Bartholomew's or the Jew-hunting of the Middle Ages." Thus did another widely despised minority, the Jews, benefit at that hour at least from not being Irish.
But of course neither blacks nor Jews, neither Italians nor Latinos have been spared the cruel attentions of those who came before. George Templeton Strong and Philip Hone were far from vicious; by most standards they seem to have been honest dealers. Yet like so many other Americans, they made life miserable for the strangers who arrived among them with their odd and threatening ways.
So "Writing New York" is not altogether a cheering excursion. But reassurance is available in the fate of the once denigrated groups who caused the descendants of the Founders such distress and in turn were distressed by the arrival of even more foreign-seeming folks than themselves. The likes of Ralph Ellison, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Mario Puzo, Mary McCarthy and Al Smith, among the many contributors to these rich pages, evidence the unstoppable American odyssey that has been both the country's dream and its nightmare.

HEADLINE: British Outrage Heads for Brooklyn

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Visitors to the Brooklyn Museum of Art this fall may be in for a shock. Rather than sun-dappled Impressionist landscapes or forthright Rodin bronzes, its classical galleries will be filled with work by young British artists who have made a worldwide reputation creating art that disturbs and outrages. Prominently featured will be Damien Hirst's infamous dead shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde, Marc Quinn's cast of a man's head made of his own frozen blood and Ron Mueck's sculpture of his naked, dead father, reduced to the length of three feet.
These works are part of "Sensation: Young British Artists from the Saatchi Collection," a show that drew record crowds and a hailstorm of praise and criticism when it opened in late 1997 at the staid Royal Academy of Arts in London. 
 The show drew extreme reactions from both viewers and critics. Those who liked it said it captured the excitement and innovative talents of British art today. Those who damned the show felt its content was offensive, intended to shock for shock's sake, or just plain bad. Some pointed out that the show also served to increase the value of Charles Saatchi's collection.
The most extreme reaction was to the artist Marcus Harvey's depiction of Myra Hindley, who was convicted in the macabre "moors murders" of children in western England in the 1960's. Protesters splattered ink and raw eggs on the painting, saying that it trivialized her victims' suffering and glorified her crimes.
After London, the show traveled to the Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin where it was just as popular.
"This is truly a defining exhibition," said Arnold L. Lehman, director of the Brooklyn Museum. "Rarely can you get enough works to accurately capture the spirit of what's happening at a specific moment in time. Museums, especially New York museums, ought to bring to their audiences the art happening today from all parts of the world."
"Sensation" will be the largest exhibition in the museum's 102-year history, occupying more than 20,000 square feet of gallery space. Among the other artists whose works will be on view are Mona Hatoum, Sarah Lucas, Chris Ofili, Fiona Rae and Rachel Whiteread. All are well known figures in London, and most have been shown internationally, exploring themes like sexual identity, feminism and social criticism.
The collection belongs to Charles Saatchi, the advertising magnate who is London's most important contemporary art collector and one of the earliest and most passionate supporters of these artists, who are often referred to as Y.B.A's (Young British Artists). Most of the 90 works in "Sensation" were bought during the 1990's. They constitute little more than a sampling of his collection of 20th-century art, which totals about 1,500 works. He was among the first collectors to buy these artists' works and to show them publicly; he owns an exhibition space on Boundary Road in London's St. John's Wood. (Some art critics who saw the show in London said they felt it gave too much weight to the taste of one collector.)
"Sensation," which will run from Oct. 2 through Jan. 9, has been in the planning stages for well over a year. The size of some of the works and the complexity of their installation has made it a logistical and economic nightmare for the museum, with financing being the biggest problem, museum officials said. The provocative nature of the work is generally thought to be too daring for corporate sponsors and has made it difficult to raise the $1 million necessary to mount the show.
So far, Mr. Lehman said, a number of individuals have agreed to contribute to the show, as has Christie's, the auction house, which was a supporter of the Royal Academy's show. The museum is still looking for other sponsors but would not say how much had been raised so far.
The show's installation will be unusually tricky, not to mention expensive. In order to comply with New York City health and environmental ordinances, for instance, dead animals have to be hermetically sealed in cases of steel and glass with tubes connected to carbon filters eliminating the smell of decay. "Our conservation department has been in discussions with people who have been involved in installing these objects and are aware of every aspect that must be dealt with," Mr. Lehman said.
Asked if he thinks the show will cause as much of a stir as it did in London, he added, "I think New Yorkers are incredibly sophisticated and believe like I do that they should be exposed to works that are both emotionally engaging and ones that make us think."
The show is likely to bring a kind of audience to the museum that it wants to attract: young, hip people who tend to frequent its neighbor, the Brooklyn Academy of Music. "I think this show is important for people of every age," said Mr. Lehman. "Brooklyn is becoming a center for contemporary art. We have something like 4,000 artists living here. It's terrific for them to see what their colleagues have been doing across the Atlantic."

HEADLINE: Immigrants Wanted

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Immigration, the Issue-in-Waiting" (Op-Ed, April 2): 
 Suppose we wanted the economy to grow at 2.5 percent a year in real terms over the next two to three decades.
If productivity growth were to average 1.5 percent (about what it did over the last 30 years), we would have to increase our labor force by about 1 percent a year.
Estimates from the Census Bureau suggest that over the next 10 years our population growth, including current immigration, should achieve this rate. However, beginning in about 2006 we will start to fall short and the problem will grow from that point on.
Rather than worrying about the welfare costs of our current rate of immigration, we should be concerned about the lost opportunity owing to the worker shortage of the future.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Tea-leaf reader alert: Minutes of the Fed's policy-making sessions include some intriguing phrases.

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer 

 BODY:
THE minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, can be more illuminating than the cryptic utterances of the central bank's chairman, Alan Greenspan.
The release of the minutes from each meeting, though, is delayed until after the next meeting is held, usually about six weeks later. And by then the group's members -- Fed governors and some presidents of the regional reserve banks -- have often conveyed their thoughts to the financial markets in speeches and other ways. 
 Yet the minutes from the November, December and February meetings describe an important shift that has gone largely unnoticed. Changes in just a few words indicate that Fed policy makers have all but discarded hope that the economy will slow down significantly this year.
If the economy does not slow, the Fed will be more likely to raise interest rates later this year. Higher rates are used to reduce the inflationary pressures that generally build in a rapidly expanding economy but that have been nonexistent of late.
Whether an economic slowdown materializes or not, the mere expectation of one has helped persuade the Fed's policy makers to hold off raising short-term interest rates in recent years. With such expectations dashed, they might have to adjust their thinking as well, especially if inflation starts to rise moderately.
"They are beginning to recognize -- this is the process that you are seeing in the minutes -- that their forecast for any type of slowdown this year is not going to happen," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
"If they are changing their mind," he added, "then it becomes a question of when will they raise interest rates, not if they will raise interest rates."
According to the minutes of the November meeting, with the world's financial markets still in turmoil following Russia's effective debt default, the central bank staff that prepares economic forecasts for the policy makers said that the economy would slow "to a pace appreciably below the estimated growth of the economy's potential," which officials have suggested is around 2.5 percent.
That would mean a slowdown from the 6 percent pace of the fourth quarter to a pace much closer to 1 percent.
By December, when American financial markets were rallying again, the hope for such a slowdown was fading. According to that meeting's minutes, the staff was then forecasting that growth in the year ahead would slow "to a pace somewhat below the estimated growth of the economy's potential."
And in February, according to minutes released last week, any suggestion of a significant slowdown seemed to vanish.
The staff now predicted a slowdown "to a rate commensurate with the growth of the economy's potential," or about 2.5 percent growth.
But the policy makers seemed to think the economy might be even stronger than the staff suggested. Committee members, according to the minutes, expected growth to slow "to a pace close to or somewhat above that of the economy's long-term potential." And many members agreed that the biggest risk was that the economy would grow at an even faster pace.
At last week's meeting, Fed policy makers left interest rates alone. And they apparently left their policy indicator on neutral -- which means that in their view the next move on interest rates, whenever that might be, is just as likely to be up as down.
But the rising expectations for economic growth, as reflected in their subtle word changes, may herald a change in attitude.
Stand by. The minutes of the March meeting are scheduled for release the third week of May.

HEADLINE: Autos Pace a Rise in Consumer Borrowing

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
Borrowing by consumers grew at a faster-than-expected pace in February as the auto industry posted record sales.
Borrowing through credit cards, auto loans and other personal loans rose by $8.7 billion, to $1.323 trillion, after rising a revised $15.3 billion during January -- the largest increase in more than three years, the Federal Reserve said today. 
 "Growth in all major categories slowed in February, though the rise in auto loans remained quite rapid," the Fed said in the report.
Analysts had expected an increase of $6.4 billion for February. Previously, the Fed said January borrowing increased $14.7 billion.
Auto loans rose $5.2 billion in February after increasing $7.1 billion in January. Auto sales in February rose 13 percent, to a record annual rate of 17 million.
Revolving loans, which include credit cards, increased $2.3 billion in February after rising $6.2 billion in January.
The pace of consumer credit was rising at a 7.9 percent annual rate during February. That's down from the 14.1 percent pace of borrowing in January. In January, consumer credit increased a revised $15.3 billion, previously reported as an increase of $14.7 billion, according to the Federal Reserve's statistics.
Economists watch the Fed's credit report to help them gauge consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic output.

French Union Urges Appeal Of Trade Case

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 7

 BODY:
The powerful French farmers' union urged the European Union today to appeal a ruling by the World Trade Organization in a dispute with the United States over banana imports.
"Europe must not stand down," the union said in a statement. "It must appeal against this unfair decision to avoid economic sanctions whose only motivation is political and is mostly aimed at dividing Europeans." 
A World Trade Organization panel ruled on Tuesday that the European Union's system for importing and marketing bananas broke global trading rules and would have to be changed. The system favors imports of bananas from former European colonies over nations in Latin America where Chiquita Brands and other American companies are major growers.
Sir Leon Brittan, the European Trade Commissioner, said the European Union reserved the right to appeal the ruling. Peter Scher, who directs agricultural negotiations for the Office of the United States Trade Representative, said the ruling was final and could not be appealed.
The ruling, effective retroactively from March 3, clears the way for the United States to impose 100 percent tariffs on nearly $191 million worth of imports from the European Union. The United States originally sought $520 million.
The United States had said that new European Union rules, which took effect in January, did not comply with earlier World Trade Organization decisions against banana import regulations.

With Economies Soft, European Bank Considers Rate Cut

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 7

 BODY:
Hans-Joachim Becker thought he had endured the worst, until a few months ago.
As a managing director at Barmag A.G., a manufacturer of textile machinery near Dusseldorf, Mr. Becker pushed his company through a brutal restructuring that eliminated 2,000 out of 5,000 jobs in 1995. 
 It seemed to work brilliantly. Sales bounced back to a nearly record level of 1.1 billion marks last year and profit soared 49 percent, to 75 million marks.
But now his market has collapsed because of financial crises in Asia and Latin America. Orders for new machines have plunged 44 percent, and Mr. Becker predicts that sales this year will drop to 630 million marks, currently $347 million, from 1.1 billion marks, or $606 million. Two hundred people were laid off last month and another 200 may have to go before the year is over.
"There is absolutely no investment in this business," Mr. Becker said today. "We have millions if not hundreds of millions of consumers who are not able to afford a new shirt."
Though Barmag's case is extreme, it is not unique and goes to the heart of the challenge that confronts the European Central Bank when it decides on Thursday whether or not to lower interest rates.
Many analysts believe that the new central bank, which has until recently dismissed a need for rate cuts, has become sufficiently alarmed about Europe's economic growth prospects and is about to reverse course. The same is true for the Bank of England, which has already cut interest rates several times in the last few months.
A lot is at stake. As guardian of a new single currency, the European Central Bank is worried about establishing its credibility with financial markets. It must also reckon with contradictory trends: growth is stagnant in Germany but still strong in Spain, Portugal and Ireland; business confidence is low in many countries, but consumers are more optimistic than they have been in years.
The bigger question is whether a moderate cut in interest rates will make all that much of an improvement. Europe's biggest problems stem from the decline in exports to Asia, Russia and Latin America, where many countries are still in deep recession, and those problems have very little to do with European interest rates. "We already have an expansionary monetary policy," said Petra Koehler, a senior economist at Dresdner Bank here. "Monetary policy is not what is burdening the economy."
Indeed, interest rates in the 11 euro zone countries have been at 3 percent since the individual central banks, acting in coordinated fashion, lowered rates from 3.3 percent last December. Though the Europeans have cut rates less than the Federal Reserve in the United States, the benchmark short-term rate is still well below the American Federal funds rate of 4.75 percent.
Economists widely expect the Bank of England to cut its benchmark rate by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent. Those who think that the European Central Bank will reduce rates do not expect more than a quarter-point cut, which would put the rate at 2.75 percent.
Germany's economic troubles have been aggravated because exports of machinery and equipment were its major source of growth. Like Barmag, which makes machines that produce and weave synthetic fibers, scores of German engineering companies put themselves through wrenching cost-reduction programs earlier this decade.
Between 1991 and 1997, German engineering companies cut their combined work forces by more than one-third, to 925,000 from 1.49 million. But they also became shrewder about marketing and design, and persuaded unions to be more flexible about overtime or weekend work.
Those strategies bore fruit over the last two years. Aided by a decline in the value of the German mark, which made products cheaper in other markets, German exports enjoyed double-digit growth until Asian financial crises deepened early in 1998.
The problems have now sunk into many of Germany's and Europe's biggest industries. The German chemical industry, led by companies like BASF and Hoechst, saw exports decline by 9.5 percent in the last quarter of 1998 and are only limping along, with selling prices under intense downward pressure.
For people like Mr. Becker, there is little the European Central Bank can do to help. "With overcapacity so high and prices so low, there is nothing you can really do to stimulate the market," he said. "The market will come back only when the buying power of consumers, mainly in Asia, comes back."
Economists note that manufacturing is only once facet of German business and that Germany does not represent all of Europe. Consumer confidence, even in Germany, is generally higher than it has been in a long time. Although retail sales remain flat, people are warming up to the use of credit cards, spending money on travel and entertainment.
While most economists predict that Germany will grow less than 2 percent this year, down from 2.8 percent in 1998, Spain is growing by 3.4 percent, Portugal 4 percent, and even France is expected to grow by at least 2 percent.
Those differences would make the European Central Bank's decision tricky enough. But the bank is also concerned about insuring the credibility of the euro, which has dropped nearly 8 percent in value against the dollar since it was introduced on Jan. 4.
Bank executives have repeatedly said that they are not concerned about the exchange rate, viewing it merely as a result of underlying economic trends. But they are worried about being perceived as too relaxed on monetary policy or too vulnerable to political pressure.
The political pressures on the bank have in fact eased since Germany's left-wing Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine, resigned last month. In recent weeks, bank officials have dropped numerous hints that they are more receptive to a rate reduction. They have emphasized concerns about slowing economic growth and said they see no signs of resurgent inflation.
Economists are about evenly divided between those who expect a rate cut on Thursday and those who do not. But investors have been betting on a reduction -- if not on Thursday, then at the next meeting on April 22 -- and they have expressed that view by pushing down the value of the euro, which settled in New York today at 1.0772 to the dollar, down from 1.0848 on Tuesday.
"It is not a clear decision, and there are several arguments against it," said Stephan Bergheim, an economist at Merrill Lynch, who is nonetheless betting on a rate reduction.
A cut, he noted, would provide a bit of insurance against a deeper economic slowdown. But it could also lower the euro's value further and rekindle price pressures -- particularly with recent oil price increases.
What a rate cut would not do, he said, is rescue German industry from its current doldrums.
"The main reason for the slowdown is export-related," he said, "and there is not much that the E.C.B. can do about that."

HEADLINE: In America;
The Other America

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.

 BODY:
During the daylight hours the interior of Nellie Perez's home is nearly as dark as night. She lives with her disabled husband and five others in a dangerously rickety shack in Guadalupe, a tiny poverty-racked town tucked in the midst of one of the most affluent areas in America.
Guadalupe is part of Maricopa County, one of the fastest-growing counties in the country. Its neighbors, which include Phoenix, Tempe, Paradise Valley and Scottsdale, are feasting on the nation's unprecedented economic boom. Million-dollar homes and splendidly manicured golf courses abound. Some of the malls are glittering jewels. 
 But as Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said during a visit on Tuesday, Guadalupe is different. It was not invited to the economic feast. "That wealth," said Mr. Cuomo, "is not their wealth."
When night falls, Guadalupe, populated mostly by Yaqui Indians and Mexican-Americans, goes to bed hungry.
Mrs. Perez's home was built from scraps -- old doors, tarpaper, chicken wire, rotted wooden planks. It is like something from the third world in the 19th century, not the United States on the verge of the 21st. There is no bathroom, no running water, no electricity and no heat. The air is so close it is difficult to breathe. When I asked where the bathroom was, Mrs. Perez, an affable woman in her 50's, pointed across the street to a reeking outhouse.
Mr. Cuomo stopped by the Perez dwelling during his daylong tour. Mrs. Perez led him through the four dark and cluttered rooms. There was no floor, only planks, or the bare ground. "I'm sorry it's a little bit dirty," Mrs. Perez said.
Mr. Cuomo has been trying to spread the word that even with the economy booming, and the Dow hurdling the 10,000 barrier, and millionaires being created at an astonishing rate, there are still many Americans struggling with the equivalent of an economic Depression.
"Real people are suffering," said Mr. Cuomo. "And now is the time to do something about that. Now is the time to invest in the things we know how to do that would make their lives better, that would bring housing and jobs to their communities -- now, when the economy is strong and we have the largest surplus in history. If not now, when?"
Guadalupe is not an aberration. There are many pockets of extreme poverty across the country. Mr. Cuomo mentioned the Indian reservations, citing specifically the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, home of the Oglala Sioux. He spoke of the continuing poverty among African-Americans in the inner cities, and among whites in parts of Appalachia and other rural areas. He spoke of the struggles faced by poor Hispanic families in Arizona and in Texas, especially those near the Mexican border.
"The Dow at 10,000 almost makes the irony crueler," Mr. Cuomo said. "This phenomenon of terrific economic growth and yet so many people just left out. There is no reason why in 1999 Americans should be living in shacks, literally. This should be a nightmare from the past."
Mr. Cuomo said his department was attempting to bring affordable housing and economic opportunity to struggling Americans, but the need is immense and he acknowledged that the resources available from HUD were not nearly enough. He said he was trying to bring more public attention to the plight of the poor.
"This is not something you hear much about," he said. "By definition the people affected are voiceless, because they are poor. They are not on television. They are not in the newspapers. For most Americans a place like Guadalupe does not exist."
Mr. Cuomo seems to speak with more passion now than he did a few years ago, and he seems more comfortable as he travels the country, meeting with the powerful and listening to the powerless. His message is one that has not been particularly popular for many years now -- that the country as a whole has an obligation to do what it can to assist those who are in danger of being left behind economically.
Before saying goodbye to Mrs. Perez on Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo asked if she had ever heard of the Dow Jones.
"The Dow Jones?" she said. "What does that mean?"

HEADLINE: Sol Hoffman, 67, Labor Leader In Garment Industry in Northeast

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
Sol Hoffman, a longtime labor leader in the Northeast, died on March 27 at a friend's home in Jersey City after suffering a heart attack. He was 67.
Mr. Hoffman, who lived in Teaneck, N.J., was a vice president of Unite, the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees, and a director of Unite's Pennsylvania, Ohio and South Jersey joint board. 
 He was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 8, 1932. After receiving a bachelor's degree in economics from Brooklyn College and a master's in economics from the University of Michigan, he began his union career in 1954 at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union Training Institute. He spent the rest of his career with the I.L.G.W.U., which later became part of Unite.
He held various positions with the union, organizing and representing workers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. He was elected a vice president of the I.L.G.W.U. in 1974.
He was a participant in the civil rights movement in the 1950's and the protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960's.
"He was very much against the war," said Mr. Hoffman's wife, Catherine Lewis. "He was one of the leading organizers in Harrisburg."
Mr. Hoffman was also chairman of the trade union council of the Jewish Labor Committee, a trustee of William Paterson College in Wayne, N.J., and chairman of the college's board of trustees in the early 1980's. He received an honorary doctorate of human letters from the university in 1995.
Dennis L. Santillo, director of external relations at what is now William Paterson University, said Mr. Hoffman served 15 years on the board, "longer than any trustee in the history of the university."
Besides his wife, Mr. Hoffman is survived by two daughters, Florice, of Pasadena, Calif., and Simone, of Roswell, Ga., and two stepdaughters.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene: Limits of Economic Diplomacy;
Modest Goals in Push to Bring China Into Trade Group

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Trade officials from the United States and China are scrounging for a deal that would allow President Clinton and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to announce today that the two countries have come to agreement on China's application to join the World Trade Organization. If the issue were narrowly about trade and economics, the two sides would probably have little trouble shaking hands.
China, one of the world's major trading powers, wants membership in the organization that sets and adjudicates the rules. The Clinton Administration thinks that is just fine -- as long as China agrees to open its borders widely to imports and foreign investors. There is plenty of economic room for a deal. 
 But Mr. Clinton and Mr. Zhu are hemmed in by politics. The President must look over his shoulders at the Republicans who want no accord at all and the Democrats who want the deal to satisfy every one of their constituencies. Mr. Zhu faces domestic problems from those within the Communist Party who are not enthusiastic about market reforms and from managers and workers in protected sectors who risk losing their jobs. The problem is that neither side appears to know exactly where the other side's bottom line lies.
What is known is that China wants to insure that its critical textile and apparel industries are not discriminated against as global quotas are relaxed. At the same time, it is looking for enough time to conform to international trading rules so that its authoritarian leaders can minimize internal disruption and resistance. The United States wants to quickly knock down dozens of barriers that keep American goods, services and investors out of China's potentially vast markets. But beyond the generalities are layers of confusing and contradictory forces.
Take the argument by some Republicans leaders, from Gary Bauer, a Presidential hopeful, to Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, that China should not be awarded entrance into the world's trading community in the wake of human rights violations, accusations of nuclear espionage, illegal campaign contributions to President Clinton and burgeoning trade surpluses. But to many economists, this argument makes little sense.
"The big winner is the United States -- or at least American corporations. The United States has few carrots to offer the Chinese to sign a deal," says Nicholas Lardy of the Brookings Institution in Washington. "The economic benefits of W.T.O. membership for China are relatively meager."
Mr. Lardy's point is that American markets are already essentially open to China. So are every other country's. China gains little by entering the World Trade Organization. But many of China's markets are closed. High tariffs, bans on agricultural imports, rules that shut out foreign firms and restrict foreign investors, loose enforcement of copyright protections and regulations that prevent foreign companies from selling goods directly to Chinese customers combine to keep American exports low. Last year, China ran a huge trade surplus with the United States of nearly $60 billion, only slightly behind Japan's.
Though bilateral trade deficits are economically benign, economists say, they are politically incendiary. One way for Mr. Clinton to chip away at the trade deficit with China is to make China friendlier to American exports.
It is important to keep the economic argument in perspective. Extra trade with China will not do much for the average American. Even trade worth more than $85 billion a year between the United States and China is simply too small -- little more than 1 percent -- to make much of a dent in an $8 trillion American economy one way or the other. But Mr. Clinton's chief trade official, Charlene Barshefsky, has spent years negotiating on behalf of excluded insurance, pharmaceutical, farm and telecommunications interests. Hard bargaining could do wonders for specific companies, even certain sectors, but not for the economy as a whole.
The other payoff for the United States is political. The trade organization, whose fair-trade rules disproportionately help American exporters, will suffer without the cooperation of China, already one of the largest trading countries. The United States would be better off if China were inside the World Trade Organization tent rather than disrupting it from the outside.
For the United States, the main drawback would be that it could no longer easily impose unilateral sanctions for China's sins. In most instances, the United States would be obligated to first bring its complaint before an international judicial panel. But that is not much of a burden: those panels have provided effective relief so far in every case where Washington has brought valid complaints.
Some Democrats will oppose China's formal entry into the global trading regime for the same protectionist reasons they opposed a free-trade agreement with Mexico. Yet the argument that trade with low-wage countries hurts American workers was weak when applied to Mexico -- the United States' second-largest export market after Canada -- and weaker still when applied to a distant, less pervasive trade partner. The data show, Mr. Lardy says, that imports from China come largely at the expense of other Asian exporters.
China's benefits from membership are more distant. The Chinese are among the world's lowest-cost producers of textiles. But their exports are limited by quotas imposed by the United States and many other countries. These quotas will, by international agreement, be phased out within the next few years under rules that will be set by the World Trade Organization. China knows it can best protect its interest if is part of the organization that will draw up the rules.
Beyond that, the big payoff of membership may well be to consolidate China's move to the market and thereby cement Mr. Zhu's position within the Chinese political establishment. Prof. Barry Naughton of the University of California at San Diego says that it is "absolutely clear that Mr. Zhu is driving toward markets." As proof, he cites Mr. Zhu's willingness to see one of seven workers in state-owned factories thrown off his job to close worthless state-owned enterprises. Moreover, nearly all goods in China are now traded in markets free of price controls.
No one knows what economic model Mr. Zhu has in mind. It might include a heavy government hand, as in South Korea. It might include large government-run sectors in transportation and health. "Yet Mr. Zhu's overall direction is clear," Professor Naughton said. " An international accord that locks China into market-opening reforms may make it easier for Mr. Zhu to fend off attempts to slide back into government planning."
Though economists are mostly enthusiastic about China's entry into the World Trade Organization, they flag possible pitfalls. "There is danger in demanding too much from China," said Dwight Perkins, a professor at Harvard. "A country with half of its population in agriculture cannot be expected to open up its food markets entirely. A banking system loaded down with bad loans to state-owned factories may not survive vigorous competition from foreign banks."
Professor Perkins is convinced that China's membership in the trade group makes sense for both sides. But he wants the deal to give Chinese banks and agriculture time to adjust. That means, he says, phasing in market reforms over five or more years, though there ought to be strict deadlines for every market-opening measure, so that China cannot dither.
Greg Mastel of the Economic Strategy Institute, while agreeing that Beijing should be joining the trade group, worries that the China lacks the discipline of markets or legally enforced rules. He points to Chinese violations of the trade accord it struck with the Bush Administration. China, he says, did not live up to promises to open up government contracts to foreigners or abandon import licenses and other trade restrictions.
"If China does not obey the rules once it is inside the tent," Mr. Mastel warns, "the credibility of the tent is at risk."
Mr. Mastel thinks that World Trade Organization panels might be largely ineffective in monitoring economic practices in China's closed society because they lack the power to compel the presentation of documents. He wants the deal to include a safeguard provision that would allow the United States to withdraw unilaterally if it deems China out of compliance. Mr. Lardy of Brookings calls for a more limited safeguard that would allow the United States to slap tariffs on its imports from China if they soar.
The idea of safeguards is to take the risk out of the political calculations on Capitol Hill that stand in the way of Chinese entry into the trade group. And that would be a small price to pay, Mr. Mastel says, to help "make the world's largest nonmarket economy into a market economy -- the most important economic task on the global agenda."

Treasury Issues Gain, With Yields Falling to 3-Week Lows

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday, and yields fell to three-week lows as traders took heart from statements by two Federal Reserve officials that inflation is at bay.
Gary Stern, president of the Federal Reserve bank in Minneapolis, said he did not "see any signs of accelerating inflation." 
 Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Fed, said the 40 percent increase in crude oil prices this year would not lift consumer prices.
In the absence of inflation, "Treasuries offer good value," said Zane Brown, who oversees $12 billion of bonds at Lord, Abbett & Company in New York. He said he expected 30-year bond yields to fall about one-half percentage point by the end of the year to 5 percent.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 8/32, to 96 7/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.50 percent from 5.52 percent Tuesday.
Treasuries also got a lift yesterday after the Fed bought notes in two outright purchases, or "coupon passes," intended to add money permanently to the economy. At the same time the Treasury and other borrowers sold more than $10.5 billion of new debt.
Even with recent gains, bonds are within the narrow range where they have been trading in recent months.
"It doesn't look like we can burst out of this trading range," said William Sullivan, money market economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Federal Home Loan Bank System and the International Paper Company are among other borrowers that raised more than $3.5 billion.
Fannie Mae, Cargill Inc., Lyondell Chemical Company and others preparing sales of up to $15.5 billion.
Investors are eager to buy corporates and other securities yielding more than Treasuries because the economy is strong and inflation is tame.
With that backdrop, investors are less inclined to worry about bond defaults or credit rating cuts and are more willing to tolerate risk in exchange for higher yields.
Results of yesterday's auction of 30-year inflation notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price . . . 99.578
High Yield . . . 3.899%
Low Yield . . . 3.750%

U.S. Warns on Antigua Money Laundering

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
The Treasury Department warned banks today to be especially careful of financial transactions routed through Antigua and Barbuda, saying that changes in the Caribbean nation's law "threaten to create a haven for money laundering."
Even before the changes, the operations of about 50 offshore banks in the Caribbean islands had been watched with suspicion by United States officials, James E. Johnson, the Under Secretary for Enforcement, said today. 
 Last November, the islands weakened their anti-money-laundering law, to the dismay of American officials. Amendments heightened bank secrecy, hobbled investigators and put up obstacles to international cooperation, Mr. Johnson said. Supervision of the offshore banks was entrusted to a new agency, the International Financial Sector Authority, whose six-member board includes four executives from the offshore banks being regulated -- a conflict of interest that invites abuses.
Tonight, the Embassy of Antigua and Barbuda issued a statement acknowledging the Treasury Department's concerns. Prime Minister Lester Bird said his Government had set up a committee to propose changes in the law to satisfy American concerns.
Mr. Johnson said the status of money-laundering enforcement is watched by big narcotics traffickers. "If you're a narcotics trafficker, you can move your drugs and never get any powder on your fingers and profit tremendously," he said. "But money tends to stick."
Consequently, he said, banking laws that make it easier for a trafficker to do business with hard-to-trace money are the bane of law enforcement, adding that lax banking laws also increase the danger of bank frauds involving millions of dollars.
Mr. Johnson said Treasury officials hoped that Antigua and Barbuda, a former British colony of about 64,000 people situated southeast of Puerto Rico, would reverse course and toughen its law.
In the embassy statement, Prime Minister Bird said his Government did not want to antagonize the United States, "but at the same time we would like the offshore financial sector to serve our economic interest."
"We would welcome the help of the United States in achieving this objective," he added.

HEADLINE: Credit Card Solicitations Soared in 1998

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Credit card issuers mailed a record 3.45 billion offers for plastic in 1998, a 15 percent jump from 1997, according to a new study.
Consumers accepted 1.2 percent of the offers, submitting 41 million credit card applications, up from 39 million in 1997, according to BAI Global Inc., a market-research company in Tarrytown, N.Y. The jump was fueled by an increase in offers and applications for so-called platinum cards and cards that offered fixed interest rates. 
 "The growth in consumer applications shows that there's still an unmet demand in the U.S. for new credit cards," said Christopher Batenhorst, a vice president at BAI Global. "Even with wallets full of plastic, consumers continue to respond to products that offer what they want."
Direct-mail offers of credit cards reached 75 percent of households last year, up from 69 percent in 1997, according to BAI Global. It was the main way card issuers aimed at consumers, and two-thirds of consumers applying for cards used the mail. Only 2 percent of applications came over the Internet.

HEADLINE: Governing World Trade

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization, which is supposed to be the key element of an open and fair international trading system, faces major challenges just as it is on the verge of being leaderless.
The W.T.O. handed down a reasonable ruling this week allowing the United States to raise tariffs on European goods in retaliation for Europe's failure to abide by previous W.T.O. rulings that its banana regime wrongly discriminates against bananas imported by American companies. 
 Rather than promise to comply, European officials are talking about an appeal of the ruling, although it is final under the W.T.O. system. Instead, Europe should move to comply with the rules in bananas as well as in beef, where it has also failed to carry out a W.T.O. panel decision.
The prime mover in making the W.T.O. function effectively must be its director general, who needs to be able to negotiate and arrange compromises at the same time he makes clear that rules must be followed. Renato Ruggiero, who steps down at the end of this month as director general, has done a reasonable job, but as the beef and banana controversies illustrate, his successor will face a formidable task.
Either of the two candidates -- Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister, or Michael Moore, a former Prime Minister of New Zealand -- might be able to do the job. But there appears to be a deadlock in choosing a leader. The United States is backing Mr. Moore, but has said it would not block Mr. Supachai. Europe is split between the two. It is imperative that a new leader be chosen before Mr. Ruggiero leaves.

HEADLINE: Japan Beginning to Flex Its Military Muscles

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 7

 BODY:
When Japan fired warning shots at suspicious boats that ventured into its territorial waters last month, it was the clearest signal to date that this staunchly pacifist country is taking its gloves off.
There is a new willingness to assume a public role in regional defense that Japan has long shunned because of its militarist past and the fears of neighbors it once threatened. 
 Japanese legislators are openly talking about once-taboo possibilities such as building first-strike capabilities and putting Japanese troops in peacekeeping operations that would expose them to combat. There are plans to buy new weapons, and there is a heated debate about loosening restrictions on Japan's military support for the United States in the region. There is a renewed sense of vulnerability, too, about threats from North Korea and even China.
"The Government has gained the confidence and courage to speak out about the need for a strong defense, and that's a very big change," said Kenzo Yoneda, a legislator from the governing Liberal Democratic Party who has taken a leading role in pushing for Japanese forces to gain first-strike capability. "The taboo on the discussion of defense is fading."
The issues of defense and, more broadly, what defines the Japanese nation, are now being debated broadly and heatedly. "We are increasingly concerned as a nation that our basic defense system is inadequate," Mr. Yoneda said.
The Government has authorized the purchase of four sophisticated reconnaissance satellites for deployment by 2002, and despite China's strenuous objections, it has agreed to pay a significant part of the research and development expenses related to building a missile defense system for the region.
Discussions are under way about plans to buy aircraft able to refuel planes in midflight and to outfit assault ships with decks that would allow helicopters and Harrier-type aircraft to land in mid-sea.
The opposition Democratic Party, normally somewhat dovish, has established a study group to come up with a policy on North Korea that is likely to include proposals for strengthening Japan's defense.
For most of Japan's postwar years, Article 9 of the Constitution, which forbids all military activity except self-defense, was sacrosanct. Now talk about changing it has evolved from the demands of a handful of right-wing legislators to a serious give-and-take that many feel may eventually lead to amendment.
"There's been a real move away from what might be considered a pure hedgehog defense," said Richard J. Samuels, an expert on Japanese defense matters and head of the Japan program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "In full public view, there's this whole set of measures that the Japanese Government is taking -- sometimes with America's support, sometimes at its request and sometimes despite its consternation -- to shift away from a strictly defensive defense."
To be sure, there is still a great deal of traditional ambivalence surrounding the subject of the military here, where many still harbor memories of the imperialistic militarism that brought Japan into World War II and made it the scourge of its neighbors. That ambivalence is reflected in the debate under way in Parliament over revisions to the military guidelines that govern cooperation between Japanese and American forces in the region, forcing Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and others to hint that they may have to water down the proposed changes to get them passed.
As they stand, the revisions would enable the Self-Defense Forces, Japan's army, to support American troops in "areas surrounding Japan," as well as offer logistical support, search-and-rescue operations and inspections of suspect ships. In other words, if sparks fly in the Taiwan Strait or between North and South Korea, Japanese forces would be required to play a substantial supporting role.
More than 45,000 American troops are stationed in Japan, including an aircraft carrier and a Marine division, but the old guidelines are sketchy on Japan's obligations to support those troops in the event of a military crisis in the region.
Americans regard the changes as long overdue, an effort to make Japan shoulder responsibility for its own defense.
But many Japanese consider the changes a sign of the waning American interest in attending to Japan's defense concerns now that the cold war is over. If Japan becomes more militarily powerful, the argument goes, it will force the United States to stay involved in the region, if only to keep an eye on what the Japanese are doing.
"China and North Korea are not really the direct cause of the increased interest in enhancing defense capabilities," said Masanori Nishi, an official at the Defense Facilities Administration Agency. "They're a type of reasonable excuse."
"The real worry is that the American commitment or the logic behind the American participation in the maintaining regional stability is shaky, that it's necessary to encourage and support American interest in the Far East," he said.
North Korea is helping in that effort. The two ships the Japanese chased this week are believed to have been sent by North Korea, which has become increasingly bellicose.
In August, North Korea sent a projectile known as the Taepodong soaring toward Tokyo. It ultimately landed in the Pacific Ocean, but it riveted the attention of the Japanese public on the issue of defense in a way that little else has.
In that sense, the Taepodong was the biggest boon that proponents of a stronger Japanese military policy have had in years. Former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, regarded as one of the more hawkish members of Japan's political elite, has even joked privately that he is so grateful for that incident that he half considered sending Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, a present for his birthday this year.
How much of a threat the Taepodong posed to Japan remains in question. The North Koreans contend that it involved a satellite launching, a contention supported by American intelligence but countered by Japan.
Some of Japan's moves, though, have alarmed its neighbors. The Chinese Government strenuously objects to Japan's planned investment in a missile defense system, which is likely to cast its umbrella over Taiwan, and was angry about recent remarks by a senior Japanese politicians suggesting that the revised guidelines would include China and Taiwan.
South Korea, too, has misgivings, although it also shares with Japan concerns about North Korea.
Some Japanese are also concerned, pointing to the similarities between Japan's current economic woes and a depression in the early 1930's, which was brought to an end in 1935 by a rise of militarism that pulled the economy out of its slump, fueled a brutal, regional imperialism and ultimately led Japan into World War II.
The parallels are immediately dismissed by those who note that the Government would have to invest vast sums of money and overcome overwhelmingly negative public sentiment to achieve a buildup even remotely similar to that of the early Showa era.
"That's nonsense," Motoo Shina, a legislator known for his interest in defense matters, said of the comparison of eras. He said Japanese business and financial interests were too widespread now to allow the country to embark on a military adventure on anything like the scale it did in the past. "Look at our current army," he said. "Probably we'd even have trouble occupying Guam."
Nonetheless, the Government recently said the four reconnaissance satellites it intends to have in place by 2002 would be made by Japanese manufacturers from Japanese components, which suggests that there might be at least a bit of an economic element to the current hawkish noises emanating from Japan. American defense manufacturers often rely on components made abroad.
Others say Japan's military abilities are already more substantial xthan many people realize. Even though Japan has officially spent no more than 1 percent of its gross domestic product on defense since the 1960's, the sheer size of its economy means that it is the second- or third-biggest spender after the United States. Most experts contend that its real spending levels are obscured by the practice of deferring payments for weapons systems, shifts in exchange rates and the difficulty in assessing how much the private sector is investing in de facto defense production.
"If you look at Japanese defense issues from year to year, it doesn't change much; it's pretty boring," said Masashi Nishihara, a professor at the National Defense Academy. "But if you look at it over a five-year period, there's a big difference. No one has paid much attention to it until last summer, but now that people are looking, they've found out a lot has changed."

HEADLINE: Blackstone to Form a New Financing Unit

 BODY:
The Blackstone Group in New York is expected to announce today that it is starting a unit called the Blackstone Mezzanine Group. It will provide financing for middle-market leveraged buyout funds and public companies that need money to grow but are too small to secure high-yield debt.
Blackstone recently hired five people from Nomura Holding America's Leveraged Capital Group to lead the effort. Howard Gellis, who has 20 years of experience and got his start at GE Capital, will be responsible for day-to-day operations. 
 In setting up the unit, Blackstone is also forming an institutional partnership -- or buyout fund -- that will provide capital for the Mezzanine Group's financing operations. While Blackstone cannot disclose how large the fund will be, industry executives said that Blackstone could raise more than $750 million for the venture.
In addition to providing customers with capital, Blackstone might also invest its own equity in transactions with customers.
"Mezzanine" financing receives a higher interest rate than a secured bank loan but is also more risky. Often, the company providing the financing receives warrants to later buy equity in a company at a set price.

HEADLINE: U.N. Security Council Debates New Policy on Iraq

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 7

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council began today what is expected to be a lengthy debate on a new Iraq policy, despite deep divisions over lifting economic sanctions and continuing air strikes.
Highlighting the tension among council members, the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, was excluded from the council meeting at Russia's request, diplomats said. 
 United Nations efforts to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction have been stymied for the past seven months. And after the United States and Britain launched air strikes in mid-December, Iraq barred inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission from returning.
As a first modest step to break the diplomatic impasse, the Security Council established three panels in January to make recommendations on re-establishing a disarmament program, on improving the availability of food and medicine in Iraq, and on what to do about more than 600 people who disappeared after Iraq's 1990 invasion and looting of Kuwait.
Last week, Brazil's Ambassador to the United Nations, Celso Amorim, who was chairman of all three panels, issued the panels' reports. Today, Mr. Amorim made a presentation to the council.
Afterward, diplomats said Russia and France backed Iraq in demanding a lifting of sanctions -- a position vehemently opposed by the United States, which insists sanctions will end only when Iraq is disarmed.
Despite the differences, Mr. Amorim said that he was "encouraged" by the "positive spirit" in the council to consider the reports' recommendations.
In his presentation, Mr. Amorim said the disarmament panel stressed the urgency of returning inspectors to Iraq, noting that their absence "was seen as substantially increasing the risk that Iraq might try to reconstitute its proscribed weapons programs."
He stressed the panel's key recommendation -- that there are outstanding disarmament issues but these can be resolved through a reinforced system of monitoring Iraq's banned weapons programs.
But Iraq's Ambassador, Saeed Hasan, said last week that Baghdad would probably reject any plan for renewed United Nations relations that does not end the sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

HEADLINE: A Political Era Fades in Florida's Condos

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: MIAMI, April 7

 BODY:
Their accents have not faded, even after decades in the Florida sun. It has been years since they worked on the Newark docks, pressed shirts in Manhattan or argued with their delegate in a Brooklyn union hall, but passers-by can hear echoes of Flatbush in Sam's deli in Deerfield Beach, or the Bronx on a Broward County boardwalk.
It is what Democrats sound like. 
 These blue-collar workers, office workers and small business owners retired to South Florida condominiums during the booms of the 1960's and 1970's and brought their machine politics with them. They used their condo associations and social clubs the way they once used the meeting halls, synagogues and church basements back home, shifting from Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy to Carter and Clinton, becoming a steady, swelling political force. They voted religiously, and they voted Democrat.
"Let me tell you, the Republican Party never did a thing for you, me, or anybody else of our caliber," said Miriam Radow, a secretary from Brooklyn who retired here in 1976 and became part of that New Deal Democrat stronghold in northern Miami-Dade and Broward Counties.
But with all their influence, in the State Legislature, in Washington, in city hall, they never got anyone to build them the thing they needed most.
"The Fountain of Youth," Mrs. Radow said.
While their New York and New Jersey accents still buzz in the cabanas, poker rooms and shuffleboard courts, their political voice is fading. The New Deal Democrats are dying out, being replaced in the condominiums by immigrants from South America, the Caribbean, Canada, Europe, as well as American blacks and younger, working people who moved here from other parts of the country, said political experts who have studied the change.
It is more than merely a changing political and social demographic in communities like Sunrise, Hallandale, Lauderdale Lakes, Deerfield Beach and other places where most of the New York area's retirees settled, bringing their socially liberal attitudes on issues like abortion rights, gun control and taxes. It was these tens of thousands of loyal condo voters who helped the Democratic Party to keep electing governors like the late Lawton Chiles as immigration from Cuba and retirees from more conservative states made Florida increasingly Republican.
"Between now and 2010, the Democratic Party will be losing its most stable and loyal core," said Lance de Haven-Smith, a political science professor at Florida State University who is associate director of the Florida Institute of Government.
Instead of casting block votes for Democrats, the new condo residents are either less inclined to vote, cannot vote because they are not citizens or, as in the case with Cuban-Americans who have migrated north from Miami, usually vote Republican, said Jim Kane, editor of The Florida Voter, a news service that does polling and analysis of Florida politics.
In the Hawaiian Gardens condo, in Lauderdale Lakes in Broward County, more than 4,000 registered voters, mostly Democrats, filled its rooms in the boom years. In the last decade, as Canadians and younger families have moved in, that number of registered voters has fallen to 2,000, Mr. Kane said. Other condos have shown similar shifts in their makeup, all around this part of Florida, said Mr. Kane and others who have tracked the shift.
In just the past four years, the average age of voters in Broward County has fallen to 57 from 64, Mr. Kane said.
And perhaps as many as nine percent of South Florida's registered voters are dead, he said.
"It's not something that will have an overnight effect on elections in South Florida," Mr. Kane said.
But it does signal the end of an era. "These old people are primarily from the Northeast, retired postal workers, garment workers, who bought modest condominiums," Mr. Kane said. "They were primarily blue collar, people who had belonged to unions, who had good pensions. "They would rather vote for the devil himself than vote for a Republican."
In a special report by The Miami Herald in March, an analysis of voting in districts dominated by what people here call the "condo commandos" found that, although these older people still vote at a higher percentage than other groups, fewer and fewer elderly residents are voting. And, the analysis predicted, it is only a matter of time until those New Deal Democrats are no longer a significant factor in elections here.
 
A Generation Finds Its Influence Waning
Political experts in Florida, and some of the people who make up that demographic, agree.
"You reach a certain age, you grow infirm, or you go bye-bye," said Mrs. Radow, whose own age, she emphasized, is nobody's business.
"Just say I'm a senior citizen," she said, and added with pride that she still volunteers in elections, still works the phones to get out the vote.
Retirees are still coming to South Florida, but they are not the same generation, or from the same world, as the ones who came South in the 1960's and 1970's, as Mrs. Radow, or men like David Goldin.
Mr. Goldin survived three months in a German prison camp after he was captured in the Battle of the Bulge. Voting, to him, is a not just a right, but a duty. He voted for ideals, not for tax shelters.
"I don't think I've ever voted Republican," said Mr. Goldin, 88, a widower who lives in Century Village, a condo in Deerfield Beach. "I'm mad about them now, because of that impeachment. They're just so -- what's the word -- partisan."
He made his living in the garment industry, as a buyer for retail stores, worked hard and wanted to prolong his life in the warmth of the Florida sun.
It worked, he said. Mr. Goldin says he feels he has added years to his life, and years to the power of his vote, much to the dismay of Florida Republicans.
Hispanics, particularly the Cubans, have been the political force in Miami-Dade County for years. But in northeastern areas of that county and in Broward, elderly Democrats stood tall for a quarter-century. If they went to city council meetings to get a stoplight at a busy intersection, they got it. Presidential hopefuls trekked to their temples. And unlike the tax-phobic Midwesterners who retired to the Gulf Coast, they supported public spending for services like libraries.
Ironically, it was the old South Florida Republicans who held power here before the arrival of the New Deal Democrats, who ushered in this exodus of elderly, more liberal voters. They built the condos that lured them here.
But their votes were not a resource that could be replenished.
 
Age Takes a Toll On Democratic Strength
One of the crown jewels of South Florida politics has long been the massive Century Village condo in Deerfield Beach, home to as many as 15,000 people -- the number slips to 12,000 in the oppressive heat of summers. Most residents are elderly, and politically active. It has not just one Democrat club, but two.
Presiding over that bounty of votes is Amadeo Trinchitella, a retired bar and restaurant owner from New York. No one gets elected in this part of Florida, everyone here says, unless first they talk to "Trinchi." The President of the United States knows him, as have past Presidents.
"I voted Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Democrat all the way," said Mr. Trinchitella, the condo president and a Deerfield Beach commissioner who is considered a master at getting out the vote.
But he has seen that power base, once in their vibrant 60's, begin to grow older, more infirm. "We have fallen 2,500 votes in the past decade," he said. In that decade, half of the condo residents of Mr. Trinchitella's generation have died, he said, and he has worked hard to re-fill the registration rolls with new Democrats.
"I am not going to sit here and cry," he said.
Mr. Trinchitella, 81 years old and recovering from heart surgery, was too sick to make his usual hard push for votes in a countywide referendum on an issue to build new libraries.
Broward averages a 22 percent voter turnout in such elections, but the bond issue decision drew only 10 percent of voters (the bond issue was approved). Political experts see that as another small sign of the waning strength of the older Democrats.
A more significant sign was the 1998 Florida Governor's race.
Most people in Broward County still vote Democratic, but the loss of the elderly Democrats can be found in a drop in voter turnout, Mr. Kane said. In the 1994 race for Governor, Lawton Chiles carried the county with 64 percent, winning 120,000 actual votes.
In 1998, Kenneth H. MacKay Jr., who lost the election to Jeb Bush, carried Broward County with 61 percent, but with just 83,000 actual votes.
"In one time, condos made up 40 percent of the voting," said Edward Pozzuoli, chairman of the Broward County Republican Party. He said he believes that number has slipped to between 25 and 28 percent.
The majority of registered voters between the ages of 35 and 50 are Republican, but Democrats still hold an 18 percent advantage, over all, he said.
"Jeb Bush tried to target and spend time with seniors, but the impact of that effort was three or four points, not a lot," Mr. Pozzuoli said. "That takes a lot of effort, so we focused on a younger population. That's where the county is going -- the issues affecting young families."
Condos that once cost as much as $40,000, two decades ago, are selling for as little as $16,000, as older residents die out and leave them to their children, who do not want to retire in this altered South Florida.
"When those families moved here, traffic wasn't that bad, getting to the grocery store wasn't a problem," Mr. Kane said. "All of that has changed. Now they tend to go to other areas, like the west coast of Florida."
 
Neighborhoods Get a New Look
That means an abundance of cheap housing here for immigrants, who are moving in and living side by side with the older retirees.
A long drive through South Florida proves that out. Children on bicycles spin by older people propped up by walkers in northeastern Dade County. In Wolfie's deli on Miami Beach, Spanish drowns out the Yiddish still being spoken at a table here and there. From the Miami Beach condos, through Broward and up into Palm Beach County, condos that were once filled with the elderly now have the look of family apartment houses, with wheelchairs and baby strollers.
It is a different world from the one the older Democrats made for themselves here, with the power of their numbers.
"It seems as if only people my age care about the issues, and that is ridiculous," said Sam Weinstein, 83, who now lives in Deerfield Beach. "I vote in ever single election. I started the time I got back from the service in the F.D.R. days. I feel like that process is dying, and it saddens me."
People 20 years younger see the process differently. They have grown up with political scandal, with candidates who failed them in many ways.
"Many times, I don't go out and vote because I know I am not going to make a difference," said Guenter Huebschmann, 60, a real estate agent and a registered Democrat living in Boca Raton.
The Democrats are expected, in the long term, to recoup some of those lost votes, Mr. Trinchitella said, and that is something he and the other older Democrats are working on.
As their own number fade, they recruit Hispanics who disagree with the Miami Cuban-Americans' conservatism, and try to register people from other social and economic groups.
And they work hard to keep the elderly voting, even if they have to vote on walkers or in wheelchairs.
"I don't travel much, these days," Mr. Goldin said, but he can make it as far as the voting booth.
Political activists like Mr. Trinchitella refuse to give up, even as they see familiar faces fade away. "It's a slow process to catch up," he said. "I just look to the future."

HEADLINE: A VISIT FROM CHINA: THE WHITE HOUSE;
China Pact Near, Clinton Outlines Benefits for U.S.

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
With a partial trade accord with China nearly in hand, President Clinton argued today that America would benefit by helping guide the world's most-populous nation toward economic stability.
Mr. Clinton's speech on relations with China came just hours before Prime Minister Zhu Rongji arrived here for a three-day visit, which included an informal private meeting with the President tonight at the White House. 
 Administration officials said Mr. Clinton planned to announce on Thursday that the two countries had reached agreement on several issues that could help pave the way for China to join the World Trade Organization this year. They said China had made broad concessions in a wide range of areas critical to American companies, from cellular telephone providers to insurers seeking to sell policies in China, which has 20 percent of the world's population.
At a meeting this afternoon at the White House, President Clinton's top advisers debated how they could cast a partial agreement as a victory if they could not announce a final deal. They left the issue unresolved.
Today, on the eve of the planned announcement, China's Trade Minister and American negotiators were still scrambling to narrow differences in an enormously complex deal that would require China to dismantle state control of its economy and open state-owned companies to foreign competition. But several issues remained unresolved, among them how to enforce China's compliance.
China has sought entry to the World Trade Organization for 13 years, for prestige, and to guarantee it the economic protections afforded to most trading nations.
But any deal would require support in Congress, which is uncertain, given concerns over assertions that China stole nuclear secrets, its questionable campaign contributions to President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign and worsening political repression in China. This afternoon the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, announced he opposed a deal.
"Letting China into the W.T.O. at this time shows how far this Administration is willing to go in an effort to salvage its failed policy of strategic partnership with China," Mr. Lott, a Mississippi Republican, said in a statement. "This is the wrong decision at the wrong time."
Nonetheless, Mr. Clinton tried to create the basis for an announcement of some kind of agreement, saying in a speech here: "If China is willing to play by the global rules of trade, it would be an inexplicable mistake for the United States to say no.
"Getting this done and getting it done right is profoundly in our national interest. It is not a favor to China. It is the best way to level the playing field."
But a top Administration official said that unless Mr. Zhu approved additional concessions, Mr. Clinton could not announce a deal to include unconditional Administration support for China's membership in the trade group.
In any case, Congress would have to amend a cold-war law that allows it to vote each year on China's trade status, and Mr. Lott's statement suggested that Congressional concerns about other topics, from human rights to espionage, would stand in the way of any accord. He said he did not want to let Mr. Clinton reward China with entry into the organization because he was skeptical that even with a deal, China would end what he said were its "predatory" trade practices. The United States trade deficit with China was $57 billion last year.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has introduced a bill to give Congress 60 days to review any deal. But he too said today that approval seemed remote. "Republicans feel, do you want to trust China and give them a feather in their cap while they're stealing our military secrets?" he said.
Members of Congress who visited China last week and met with Mr. Zhu gave a preview of the Chinese leader as a tough negotiator. Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said the Americans raised all of the sensitive issues raging in Congress and said Mr. Zhu's response was that they were trying to politicize an economic issue.
Senator Conrad also said that unless the trade deal clearly gave American companies the same access to Chinese markets that China has to American markets, Congress would not approve it. "Even if it's perfect, it will be a tough challenge in this environment," he said.
Mindful of anti-China sentiment in Congress, Mr. Clinton, in his speech today, offered an unusually critical analysis of a country whose leader is on his doorstep. He criticized China for political repression, saying "a tight grip is actually a sign of a weak hand." He said China's backward industries were polluting its countryside. But he insisted that the United States must use its influence to coax China toward democracy.
"As we focus on the potential challenge that a strong China could present to the United States in the future," Mr. Clinton said, "let us not forget the risk of a weak China, beset by internal conflicts, social dislocation and criminal activity, becoming a vast zone of instability in Asia."
Mr. Clinton also tried to deflect the condemnation of his policy by Republican Presidential candidates, appealing to them to avoid "a campaign-driven cold war" that would give comfort only to "the most rigid, backward-looking elements" in China.
Mr. Clinton has been eyeing the vast markets that China offers and has become a strong advocate of engagement with the Chinese Government.
In negotiations on the trade accord, complete agreement had been reached by tonight in one of the most contentious areas -- removing Chinese barriers to American agricultural imports, especially wheat and meat. And there has been all but complete agreement on other issues of market access, with China agreeing to phase out many of its trading restrictions and high tariffs in three to five years. Foreigners will be allowed to invest in Chinese telecommunications companies, but not to take a controlling interest in them.
One issue still open is import quotas. China has accused the United States of trying to prolong American import restrictions on Chinese-made textiles -- quotas that were supposed to end in five years. The United States, responding to pressure from Congress, now wants to extend the quota system for 10 years.
The United States and China did agree today on a civil-aviation accord that will double passenger and cargo flights. Lael Brainard, a White House official who specializes in international economic issues, said the agreement would allow an additional United States airline, which she did not identify, to fly to China and let more American cities have direct air service to China.

HEADLINE: Don't Look to Russia for Help on Kosovo

BYLINE: By Michael McFaul; Michael McFaul, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, teaches political science at Stanford University.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration was right to reject Slobodan Milosevic's cease-fire proposal -- entering into negotiations now with Serbia, which has largely achieved its military goals in Kosovo before NATO has achieved much of anything, would be an admission of defeat.
So why, then, has Vice President Al Gore called on Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia at this moment to work on an agreement with the Serb dictator? Playing the Russian card now legitimates Mr. Milosevic's horrendous actions in Kosovo and exposes the weakness of the NATO alliance. 
 NATO and Russia should eventually cooperate in the Balkans, as they did in Bosnia, but only when it serves the interests of both. Today, such cooperation would serve only the Russians.
Let's not forget Mr. Primakov's similarly inopportune actions during the Persian Gulf war. With Iraqi troops occupying Kuwait, he traveled to Baghdad to urge Saddam Hussein to negotiate a settlement. At the time, Mr. Hussein was all too eager to talk peace since he had already achieved his military goals. We rightly rejected such a proposal.
If Mr. Primakov begins a shuttle diplomacy operation between Belgrade and the capitals of Europe today, he could create momentum for a negotiated settlement at precisely the moment when it is most convenient for Mr. Milosevic.
In raising a peace initiative now, Mr. Primakov also would strengthen Russia's hand in Eastern Europe. NATO needs time -- and probably ground troops -- to achieve success against Serbia. Beginning peace negotiations now would doom the Kosovars, make future NATO operations more difficult to muster, and impede future NATO expansion eastward. It could even help to unravel the alliance altogether. Such an outcome would be ideal for Mr. Primakov and his allies within Russia, who can gain votes by appearing to resuscitate their country's influence abroad and to diminish that of the United States.
Beyond this, Mr. Primakov will not offer his good offices without a price. At a minimum, he will probably expect more loans from the International Monetary Fund and forgiveness of Soviet and Russian debts. Linking our security interests in Serbia with I.M.F. loans would be disastrous for American foreign policy -- and for Russian reform. First, I.M.F. money cannot guarantee Mr. Primakov's lasting cooperation. As a potential presidential candidate he must be responsive to growing anti-Western sentiment among Russian voters first and Western concerns second.
More important, paying Mr. Primakov to mediate would undermine the I.M.F. as an effective agent of economic reform in Russia. If the I.M.F. cannot credibly commit to the conditions it has already laid down for loaning money, its leverage over the Russian Government would be next to nil. This is precisely what occurred in 1996 and 1997, when the Clinton Administration made an exception for Russia that it would not have made for any other country, because Russia was deemed too big to fail. It was a mistake then, and it would be a mistake now.
The United States has a strategic interest in encouraging market reforms in Russia that should be pursued independently from its strategic interests in Serbia.
Right now, NATO would bring a weak hand to the negotiating table. Only when the "facts on the ground" have changed in favor of the alliance should the Clinton Administration entertain cease-fire proposals, or think of letting Mr. Primakov act as intermediary.

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
The first Chez Louis, David Liederman's East Side homage to the Paris bistro L'Ami Louis, opened in 1985 and closed in the 1991 recession, which wiped out dozens of New York restaurants. Now Mr. Liederman, he of David's Cookies, has opened a new Chez Louis in Rockefeller Center, and it's as if the eight-year hiatus never happened.
Back is the wood-fired grill; back, too, are the herb-roasted chicken and the luscious garlic potato pie. There is foie gras, duck and goose, and that delightful French cut, the hanger steak, served au poivre. 
 The hanger steak was quite good, crusty on the outside and a beautiful pink inside. So were a duck foie gras salad, some fat lobster raviolis and, bien sur, the garlic potato pie. Snails, served in a green garlic and herb sauce, looked odd and had little taste.
The first Chez Louis was on Second Avenue near 54th Street. The new one replaces Television City, a theme restaurant also run by Mr. Liederman, a place better known for its T-shirts than its cuisine.
Neither of Mr. Liederman's Louises have emulated the artfully nurtured squalor of the original in the Rue Vertbois in Paris. His new Chez Louis is modern, with clean lines and unobtrusive lighting. Nor has he tried to replicate the prices. L'Ami Louis may be out of a grim Zola novel, but it's one of the most expensive restaurants in Paris. At Chez Louis, there's a $19.99 prix fixe lunch that is also served as a pre-theater dinner. The wine list, about half French, is being worked on. I can't see why. It looked pretty good to me.
Chez Louis, 74 West 50th Street, in Rockefeller Center, (212) 333-3388. Lunch, Mondays through Fridays; dinner, Mondays through Saturdays. Main courses: $14.95 to $29.95.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 13.
 
Now Playing
 
* "AFFLICTION," starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn (winner of the Oscar for best-supporting actor), Willem Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Mr. Coburn, terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Mr. Schrader, this pure, unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks's novel starts on a deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury. Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin). 

* "ANALYZE THIS," starring Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow and Chazz Palminteri. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title, concept and teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the lights go down, so think of this comedy as an offer you can't refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, Mr. De Niro is hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic goodfella style. His mobster finds just the right comic foil in Billy Crystal, as the psychiatrist who utters the immortal: "When I got into family therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind." There's a lot more where that came from in this breezy comic treat (Maslin).
 
"BABY GENIUSES," starring Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd and many toddlers. Directed by Bob Clark (PG, 94 minutes). One way to get through this guaranteed 100 percent laugh-free comedy is to wonder whether it really is the worst film you've even seen. Probably not, but it's pretty darn close. Woefully substandard production values give it a ghastly look, made all the worse by the grotesque computer morphing of young children into adult-style wise guys. The plotting is shrill, bordering on incomprehensible. Ms. Turner lurches through the film with a performance that just says, "Hey, it's a living" (Maslin).
 
"BLAST FROM THE PAST," starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher Walken, Alicia Silverstone and Sissy Spacek. Directed by Hugh Wilson (PG-13, 105 minutes). More amusingly than might be expected, this comedy tells the story of one very nuclear family that has been hiding in a fallout shelter since 1962 and emerges into a 90's world of grunge and attitude. In fact, it's funnier underground, with Mr. Fraser as the strapping son of a cheerfully mad scientist (Mr. Walken) and sherry-sipping housewife (Ms. Spacek), 1962 style. Once he comes above ground and meets a hard-boiled Ms. Silverstone, it's clear that Mr. Fraser is once again a film's true ingenu, doing the wide-eyed hunk thing that has become his specialty. He does it a lot better in "Gods and Monsters," but this comedy is still lighthearted fun (Maslin).
 
* "CENTRAL STATION," starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Mr. Salles's film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Mr. Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's very best (Maslin).
 
* "COOKIE'S FORTUNE," starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close, Patricia Neal, Julianne Moore and Liv Tyler. Directed by Robert Altman (PG-13, 118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet assurance and guerrilla wit of Mr. Altman's vintage ensemble films make a copacetic return with a Southern small-town black comedy. Seamlessly made and completely enveloping, it tells of the machinations set off when a wealthy old woman (Ms. Neal) outrages her diabolically genteel niece (Ms. Close) by committing suicide. As the old woman's dearest friend and the niece's unwitting nemesis, Mr. Dutton is rock-solid and appealing. The entire cast works on a single wavelength as Mr. Altman makes the most of a well-woven screenplay by Anne Rapp (Maslin).
 
"THE CORRUPTOR," starring Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg. Directed by James Foley (R, 111 minutes). A conventional but above-average police drama set in Chinatown in New York City, "The Corruptor" finds the rookie cop Danny Wallace (Mr. Wahlberg) learning the ropes from his rule-bending partner, Nick Chen (Mr. Chow), who has gotten dangerously chummy with Chinatown's mob bosses. The atmosphere is gritty, the action sequences sleek and the questions the story raises about loyalty, ethics, friendship and betrayal, although familiar, are still worth bringing up. "The Corruptor" is a more effective showcase for the brooding charisma of Mr. Chow, a Hong Kong action superstar, than "The Replacement Killers," his English-language debut (Stephen Holden).
 
* "THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS," starring Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French with English subtitles). In this very special French film about two freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she views as imminent disaster. In the process, Mr. Zonca shows astonishing acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
 
* "EDTV," starring Matthew McConaughey, Ellen DeGeneres, Woody Harrelson, Jenna Elfman and Rob Reiner. Directed by Ron Howard (PG-13, 120 minutes). In this good-humored, deceptively easygoing satire, Mr. Howard holds up a fun-house mirror to a world ruled by voyeurism and specious fame. The subject matter is familiar by now, but this film about a Trumanesque nobody as 24-hour-a-day television star has a shrewd way of drawing the audience into its web. Permeated by all the crassness and absurdity inherent in celebrity-mad culture, and by our collective obsession with snoopy trivia, it features a fine ensemble cast and a dependably jokey screenplay by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. It helps that most of the principals, in a cast that also includes Elizabeth Hurley, have played this game for real and act their roles with a comic vengeance (Maslin).
 
"ELIZABETH," the Oscar winner for best makeup. Starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124 minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Elizabeth I as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays the Queen as if her principal responsibilities were being bejeweled, selecting consorts and saying "Leave us!" with a wave of the hand. For all its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, this is historical drama for those whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene reminiscent of "Saturday Night Fever," it winds up imagining the Queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman afflicted by a super-intense case of having it all (Maslin).
 
"FOLLOWING," starring Jeremy Theobald, Alex Haw and Lucy Russell. Directed by Christopher Nolan (not rated, 70 minutes). This artfully manipulative black-and-white film noir, recently shown as part of the New Directors/New Films series, doles out its plot details in cryptic fashion. "I decided to structure my story in such a way as to emphasize the audience's incomplete understanding of each new scene as it is first presented," the filmmaker has said. And he makes that technique work in shattering a tale of James M. Cain-style conniving into several time frames. A man named Bill likes to follow strangers until he finds one named Cobb, who is curiously helpful as a mentor in crime. No-budget enough to have been shot on a year's worth of Saturdays while the principals held weekday jobs, it ties together neatly in the end (Maslin).
 
"FORCES OF NATURE," starring Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck. Directed by Bronwen Hughes (PG-13, 102 minutes). Does Ms. Bullock's loopy girl-next-door charm really make audiences want to follow her anywhere? If so, they'd better be prepared for an amusement park ride with senior citizens, a long romp through K-mart and the other equally desperate settings for a road movie that otherwise has nowhere to go. A would-be screwball romantic comedy about a man thrown together with a zany drifter en route to his own wedding, it shows off Ms. Bullock to amusing if overly frenetic advantage. Mr. Affleck fares less well with the film's wimpier role. Some of the material's many gaps are filled by special-effects hail and windstorms, which are as close as the title comes to making any sense (Maslin).
 
* "GODS AND MONSTERS," the Oscar winner for best adapted screenplay. Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser. Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a performance that well deserves to be remembered, Mr. McKellen becomes the deliciously urbane James Whale, depicting the gay "Frankenstein" director late in life. Shaken by the aftereffects of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming back to greet him just as the present offers new fascination in the Adonis-like form of the gardener (Mr. Fraser, also fine), whom Whale finds mowing his lawn. This beautifully acted, witty and heart-tugging film, from a Christopher Bram book, imagines what Whale's final days might have been like while shaping a splendid character study and a droll portrait of closeted gay Hollywood. Lynn Redgrave provides ballast and comic relief as Whale's perpetually scandalized housekeeper (Maslin).
 
* "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL" (the Oscar winner for best foreign film and best dramatic score), directed by and starring Roberto Benigni (named best actor) (PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to find humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly entertaining as its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more somber second act, Mr. Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear (Maslin).
 
* "LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS," starring Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Sting, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Nick Moran. Directed by Guy Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since "The Usual Suspects" has there been such an oversupply of cool macho schemers in a single film. And they're served up with a quick, tart economy that bespeaks the filmmaker's background making videos and commercials -- actually an advantage, for a change. There's not much beneath the surface here; what's most entertaining is Mr. Ritchie's droll, hard-boiled storytelling and the rogue's gallery of a cast that he has assembled. All the film need do is juggle assorted miscreants and four separate gangs who, figuratively speaking, can't shoot straight (Maslin).
 
"THE MATRIX," starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120 minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will be all but incomprehensible to non-technofreaks. And the film borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a big debt to "The X-Files" in the paranoia department. But the storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special effects are indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a gravity-defying gusto. And Mr. Reeves shows that you can look like a Prada model while behaving like an action hero. One of the main stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the Wachowskis provide a couch-potato epiphany: while the characters seem to be performing marvelous feats, they're often lying stock-still in the grip of virtual reality (Maslin).
 
"PAYBACK," starring Mel Gibson, James Coburn and Gregg Henry. Directed by Brian Helgeland (R, 110 minutes). In this inept, excessively sadistic film-noir spoof adapted from the same Richard Stark novel ("The Hunter") that inspired the 1967 genre classic "Point Blank," Mr. Gibson is a thief named Porter who retaliates with a vengeance after an attempt on his life. Determined to recover $70,000 that was stolen from him by a double-crossing partner in crime, he works his way up the pecking order of a crime syndicate, brutally dispatching all who stand in his way. The hard-boiled dialogue is ludicrous, the storytelling clunky, the acting fair to awful, the gore ankle deep. Credit the star with being able to keep a straight face through this loathsome mess (Holden).
 
* "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE" (the Oscar winner for best film, best original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best comedy score.) Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench (best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of "Romeo and Juliet," glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
 
* "TANGO," starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and directed by Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro (PG-13, 100 minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and virtuosity. And it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say that the dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most electrifying dance film, Mr. Saura offers transfixingly beautiful glimpses of the dance and the great range of emotions it can conjure. Mr. Storaro's dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the nuances this material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly consumed by tango fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).
 
"THE THIN RED LINE," starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick Nolte and Sean Penn. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely derived from James Jones's Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear that Mr. Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style that made "Badlands" and "Days of Heaven" the most beautiful films of the 1970's is instantly apparent here, even if the narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar. The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter editing. Bottom line: No one who admired Mr. Malick's early work should miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it here (Maslin).
 
"T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS," starring Peter Horton and Liz Stauber. Directed by Brett Leonard (not rated; 45 minutes). Passions for the prehistoric that remain unsated after the two "Jurassic Park" films are likely to be requited by this latest Imax 3-D film. Drooling and menacing, the monsters of the Mesozoic are on the march again in this brief, enjoyable dip into paleontology, teen-age adventure and parent-child relationships. Seen in 3-D and set against the lush ferns, moss and ancient trees of the Olympic rain forest in the state of Washington, these creatures seem marvelously lifelike. Better yet, "T-Rex," written by Andrew Gellis and Jeanne Rosenberg, doesn't rest on its technological splendors.Its time-tripping story takes the viewer to a paleontological dig, raises unanswered scientific questions and introduces some of the major figures in the history of the subject. To be sure, seeing "T-Rex" won't qualify anyone for a doctorate in paleontology, and an intriguing subplot that hints at a troubled family background for its teen-age heroine is left unresolved; but the film is likely to whet active young minds to learn more about the past. At Sony Theaters Lincoln Square, 1998 Broadway, at 68th Street, Manhattan (Lawrence Van Gelder).
 
* "TRUE CRIME," starring Clint Eastwood, Isaiah Washington, James Woods and Lisa Gay Hamilton. Directed by Clint Eastwood (R, 127 minutes). In his most quietly poignant film since "A Perfect World," Mr. Eastwood directs a death row thriller with redemption on its mind. Beginning almost casually, and taking on growing urgency as it moves toward an imaginatively suspenseful ending, it tells of a jaded newspaper reporter who, to his own surprise as much as anyone else's, finds himself fighting at the 11th hour to save a possibly innocent man from execution. Mr. Eastwood is older than the man he plays, but not too old to be plausible as the father of an adorable little girl in the cast; she happens to be his real daughter (Maslin).
 
* "A WALK ON THE MOON," starring Diane Lane, Viggo Mortensen, Liev Schreiber, Tovah Feldshuh and Anna Paquin. Directed by Tony Goldwyn (R, 107 minutes). This evocative 1969 period piece, set on the brink of Woodstock in a Catskills holiday camp, is as seductive as the handsome, itinerant hippie who turns its heroine's life upside down. Thoughtfully conceived and movingly acted, it sweeps a housewife and mother named Pearl Kantrowitz (Ms. Lane) into a torrid extramarital romance and then weighs the consequences. With a tenderness that's unusual for a contemporary American film, it tells an enveloping tale enhanced by artfully selected Woodstock-era music. Mr. Mortensen may strain credulity as the foxiest blouse salesman in the Catskills, but he certainly does wonders for the movie (Maslin).

HEADLINE: Shoppers Beat U.S. Retailers' Expectations

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
Retail sales surged in March, exceeding expectations for the sixth consecutive month, figures released today showed. Consumers apparently pushed the economy to grow faster in the first quarter than earlier estimated.
Consumers flush with cash from steady incomes, tax refunds and refinancing their mortgages increased sales 9 percent in March at stores open for more than a year, a key industry measurement, according to the Goldman Sachs composite index. 
 Consumers are "buying everything that's not nailed down," said Diane Swonk, deputy chief economist at the Bank One Corporation. "This is an incredible environment."
Sales rose 11.3 percent at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, topping its expectations for a 10 percent gain. The Kmart Corporation, the discount chain, said sales rose 8.1 percent, led by small appliances, home decor, toys, food and pharmaceuticals.
Because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the economy, analysts are revisiting their estimates for first-quarter growth. Ms. Swonk said gross domestic product could show an increase of 3.5 percent at an annual rate, above her current forecast of 3.3 percent.
Still, faster growth is not seen as enough to persuade Federal Reserve policy makers to increase short-term interest rates soon. "It's not the basic economy that's worrying them, it's whether the basic economy is becoming inflationary," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. "They're willing to accept another 4 percent quarter as long as inflation stays under 3 percent," he said.
In another sign of tame inflation, prices that businesses paid for imported goods rose one-tenth of a percent in March, the Labor Department reported today. Moreover, import prices excluding oil fell four-tenths of a percent last month.
Robust spending by consumers is forcing companies to restock inventories -- and fill job vacancies to keep up with demand. That is helping keep unemployment at almost 30-year lows. Last week, the number of workers filing for state unemployment benefits rose 11,000, while staying below the 300,000 mark, the Labor Department said.
March retail sales were helped by shoppers buying for the Easter holiday, which fell in early April, as opposed to last year, when the holiday was in the middle of April.
Still, consumers were choosy about where to shop. Discount chains, which offer low prices and wide selection, did better than department stores.
The Dayton Hudson Corporation, which gets at least 75 percent of its sales from its Target discount chain, posted a 12.9 percent gain, better than expectations for 8 percent.
Shoppers also sought out specialty chains. Sales rose 21 percent at Gap Inc., which operates Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic outlets. It had expected 8 percent to 10 percent.
The Ann Taylor Stores Corporation posted a 21 percent increase, which was higher than expected. Talbots Inc., which has been wooing back customers it lost in 1997 because of unpopular fashions, reported a 9.6 percent increase, far higher than its expected gain of 2 percent to 4 percent.
Among other specialty retailers, Circuit City Stores, the consumer electronics chain, said on Tuesday that its March same-store sales rose 9 percent on demand for digital videodisk players, satellite television dishes and wireless telephones.
Limited Inc., operator of the Express, Limited and Structure chains, posted a gain of 18 percent. Its results got a lift from a 21 percent gain at Intimate Brands Inc., operator of Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works chains. Limited owns 85 percent of Intimate Brands.

HEADLINE: The 75-Year Plan

BYLINE: By Robert D. Reischauer; Robert D. Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The economy is growing. Inflation is well under control. The budget is moving into surplus. And this economic strength has shrunk the Social Security deficit. Now is the time to close it completely.
President Clinton's proposal to allocate part of the projected Federal budget surpluses to Social Security reserves, and to invest about 15 percent of the reserves in private securities, would close nearly two-thirds of the projected long-term deficit. It is important for Congress to approve the President's plan because it would boost our national saving and help restore long-term financial balance to the Social Security system. 
 But additional measures are necessary to assure Social Security's solvency for the next 75 years. Along with such well-known Social Security experts as Henry J. Aaron, Robert M. Ball, Peter Diamond, Robert Greenstein and Alicia H. Munnell, I urge Congress to adopt two further changes to meet these goals.
First, Congress should raise the Social Security tax ceiling on the American wage base to cover 90 percent of total earnings, instead of the current 86 percent. Subjecting a greater portion of our wages to Social Security taxes would increase payroll-tax revenues by about 4 percent.
Second, the Social Security trustees should invest a portion of the reserves in bonds issued by Federal agencies like the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), as is permitted under current law.
These bonds are completely safe because they are guaranteed by the Federal Government, but they have higher yields than Treasury securities now held by the trust fund. It would be prudent as well to invest a small portion of reserves in high-grade corporate bonds, which are also safe and yield more than United States Government bonds.
There are some other, more politically risky reforms that Congress should consider. These measures include using a more accurate cost-of-living index (which is now being developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics), extending Social Security benefits and taxes to newly hired state and local employees in states that are currently outside the system, increasing the period used for calculating average earnings and speeding up an already scheduled cut in benefits by raising the age at which full benefits are paid.
This last provision would continue to permit workers to claim reduced benefits as early as age 62. In addition, small payroll-tax increases and benefit reductions could be enacted now to take effect well into the next century, if needed.
Still, the President and Congress should not permit possible disagreements about these additional reforms to stand in the way of the immediate priority: to close completely the projected long-term deficit in Social Security by increasing the taxable wage base, investing part of the reserves in higher-yielding Government-guaranteed and high-grade corporate bonds and implementing the program outlined by President Clinton in his State of the Union address.
The President and Congress must stand firm against fiscally rash privatization proposals, especially those that would boost administrative costs and depend on permanent transfers of general revenues to private accounts, even after budget deficits return, as projected. Instead, they should seize this opportunity to assure American workers that Social Security will continue to provide basic income support in the 21st century.

HEADLINE: Social Security Found to Save Third of Elderly From Poverty

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
Social Security benefits keep about a third of the nation's elderly from slipping into poverty and significantly help narrow the income disparities between women and men in old age, a study released today shows.
"Social Security cuts about in half the gap in poverty rates between elderly women and elderly men," said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. 
 The center is skeptical of proposals to remake the Social Security system to allow private investment and generally supports keeping the current system intact.
Over all, the study found that without income from Social Security, 47.6 percent of elderly Americans, or 15.3 million people, would have been poor in 1997. Social Security cut that poverty rate by to 11.9 percent, or 3.8 million senior citizens.
The monthly checks mean that 35.7 percent of people ages 65 and older who would live in poverty have incomes that place them above the poverty line.
Without monthly Social Security checks, 52.6 percent of women 65 and older would be poor, compared with 40.8 percent of men -- a gap of 11.8 percentage points, the study found. But with Social Security, 14.7 percent of elderly women were poor, compared with 8.2 percent of men -- cutting the gap between the sexes to 6.5 percentage points.
Women who are not married when they are elderly do not benefit as much, Mr. Greenstein said. Even with Social Security benefits, the poverty rate among elderly widows is 20.3 percent, and for single and divorced women it is 27 percent.
The nonprofit research center used 1997 census data to measure the effect of Social Security on lifting elderly Americans' incomes above the Federal poverty level.
Elderly individuals were considered to be poor in 1997 if they had income below $7,698 a year; the level for elderly couples was below $9,712.
Women get a particularly good deal from Social Security, the study found. Although women pay 38 percent of all Social Security payroll taxes, they get 53 percent of benefits.
In part, that is because women live longer than men, and Social Security benefits rise each year to keep up with inflation. Also, women make up the bulk of those who collect the special Social Security benefits that spouses, widows and widowers are entitled to receive even if they never worked themselves.
Social Security generally provides bigger retirement checks to people who earned more during their working lives, and men tend to earn more than women. But the program somewhat mitigates that by taking into account a higher percentage of low-wage workers' earnings when calculating their retirement benefits, and that helps women.
The study also found that black and Hispanic Americans draw a larger percentage of their old-age income from Social Security than whites. Elderly blacks get on average 43.4 percent of their income from the retirement program, compared with 41.4 percent for Hispanic Americans and 35.8 percent for whites.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Circular Firing Squad

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Boy, I sure hope the Clinton team loses this war in Kosovo, because if it wins, there will be no one to pick up the Nobel Peace Prize. If I read The Washington Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal correctly, everyone in this Administration has already blamed everyone else in this Administration for failure in Kosovo.
Reading the front pages, one finds that the Joint Chiefs blame Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for dragging them into a morass. The State Department blames the Pentagon and the NATO allies, the C.I.A. says it predicted the war would go badly, the Vice President is worried that it's going to sink his election chances, the Congressional Democrats want to dump the whole Clinton foreign policy team for failing to anticipate Serbian behavior, and the Republicans don't know what they want but they all agree it's Bill Clinton's fault. 
 Talk about turbo finger-pointing. You don't even have to leave this Administration and write your memoirs to betray it -- now you can do it on the job. If the Clinton team were half as good at targeting the Serbian tanks in Kosovo as it is at targeting its own members in the press, we would have won this war already.
Yo, boys and girls, can we do this later?
If this war goes badly, you're all sunk, and we're all sunk. You have to hang together, both in appearance and reality, because in this information age, everyone is watching -- most importantly our allies and Slobodan Milosevic. If the allies see everyone on the Clinton team blaming everyone else, how long do you think NATO will stick behind America?
How is one supposed to conduct a long-term campaign in such an environment? I guess one should not be surprised. It is scary how we have seamlessly moved from O. J. to Monica to Kosovo, and treat each one as just another partisan spectacle. CNN has shamelessly, and shamefully, aired a steady stream of interviews with every relative of the three captured U.S. G.I.'s -- as if their fate were the central issue of the day, as if they were not soldiers sent to fight but high schoolers abducted while on a picnic in Macedonia.
This is war, not infotainment. We're not up against JonBenet Milosevic. We're up against a ruthless dictator who has made 500,000 people homeless. It is going to require ruthless, brutal staying power to succeed here. Maybe the air war will not be enough to pressure the Serbs into accepting the minimum diplomatic outcome we need -- which is that the refugees be allowed to return to their homes in Kosovo, and run their own lives, protected by international peacekeepers. But two weeks of bombing is far too early to determine that.
This is not a perfect analogy, but I was in West Beirut during the summer of 1982 when the Israeli Army decided not to enter that city with ground troops to evict the P.L.O. but to rely instead on air, sea and artillery bombardments. For the first two months there was solidarity between the Beirut Muslims and the P.L.O., in the face of the Israeli siege. But as the summer wore on, as the economy ground to a halt, the Muslim leadership in West Beirut finally called Yasir Arafat and said, in effect: "Yasir, we can't take this anymore. We said we'd be with you 'till the last dog dies.' Well, it just died. It's time for you to go."
Bratislav Grubacic, one of the most prominent Serbian journalists, puts out a daily Internet news report from Belgrade. Here's an excerpt from Tuesday, April 6: "The prospect of a prolonged bombing campaign is making people depressed and nervous. However, even if the air strikes stop soon, the reasonable part of the population fears that living in a devastated and isolated country without fresh money and help from abroad will be like living in a concentration camp."
If the U.S. wants to return the Albanian refugees to Kosovo -- without using ground troops -- NATO is going to have to intensify both its diplomacy and its bombing of Serbia, with no holds barred.
Therefore, to emerge with an acceptable outcome, the Clinton team is going to have to steel itself for accusations of engaging in both military "overkill" and diplomatic "appeasement." Managing such a tense endgame will require a cool head and a tight-knit team with a mean streak and steady nerves -- not a group marching forward while looking over their shoulders at each other.

HEADLINE: Gasoline Prices Likely to Peak in May

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
Gasoline pump prices should peak for the year in May after a gain in crude oil prices and a series of refinery problems on the West Coast, the Department of Energy said this week.
Prices will peak at a national average of $1.18 a gallon, 11 percent higher than last year, according to the short-term energy outlook from the Energy Information Administration. The average summer price in the United States will be $1.13 a gallon, up about 10 cents from prices last year. 
 Four California refineries had problems beginning in mid-February that caused inventories to tighten as supplies were transferred to the West Coast.
Crude oil prices rose 37 percent in March, lifted by an agreement by oil-exporting countries to cut 2.1 million barrels a day of output, or 2.7 percent of world supply.
Prices typically peak in June, but they are going to peak in May this year, said David Costello, the economist in charge of the report. Gasoline prices should tail off after May to average $1.13 a gallon for the summer, the report said.
In January, before the exporters pledged to cut production, the information administration predicted that prices would peak at $1.08 a gallon. Gasoline demand is expected to be up 2 percent, aided by a 2.1 percent increase in highway travel, the report said. As before, demand this summer is expected to set a record.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
European Interest Rate Cut Sends U.S. Gauges to Records

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Europeans cut interest rates yesterday, igniting stock markets in midsession here, and all three major market gauges climbed more than 1 percent to new records.
Financial stocks were again among the pacesetters, but they were joined by such recently lagging blue chips as Coca-Cola and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which have suffered from sluggish European operations. Another standout was Wal-Mart Stores, which jumped 4 3/4, to 102 1/4, one of several retailers reporting very strong March sales. 
 "The strength of the market seems to be coming from the bond side," said Philip J. Orlando, the chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management.
Lower interest rates not only tend to make stocks relatively more appealing but also reduce such business costs as carrying inventory or investing in new machinery.
Although there was little reaction to an early rate cut by the Bank of England, a larger-than-expected cut by the European Central Bank shortly after noon galvanized investors and lifted prices sharply.
By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average had gained 112.39 points, to 10,197.70, just over 11 percent higher than at the beginning of the year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 17.09 points, to 1,343.98, and the technology-driven Nasdaq market rebounded from Wednesday's slump to gain 28.96 points, to 2,573.39.
Bond prices advanced along a broad front, with the bellwether 30-year Treasury issue rising 2 6/32 point, to 97 5/32, to push its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, down to a six-week low of 5.44 percent, from 5.50 percent on Wednesday. Rates on 5-year and 10-year Treasury securities -- the latter a benchmark for home mortgages -- eased even more.
With inflation in this country remarkably benign in the ninth year of an uninterrupted economic expansion, United States Treasury securities offer some of the best rates of return among global bond markets.
Initially in yesterday's session, rates were little changed as investors looked largely in vain for signs of cooling economic growth. Another factor was Fannie Mae, which was tapping the market for $3 billion. Dealers who had sold Treasuries as a hedge suddenly were forced to scramble for cover as the market rallied on the larger-than-expected half-point cuts by the European Central Bank. Fannie Mae's 10-year notes were sold at a price to yield 5.716 percent, or about 59 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity.
"The rate cuts caught those who had set short positions leaning the wrong way," said Daniel Antonellis, market analyst at Briefing.com, an analytical firm in Menlo Park, Calif. But he added that they "gave the market much needed direction, particularly with the Federal Reserve on hold."
Besides the financial sector, which included gains of 3 1/2, to 87 7/8, for Chase Manhattan and 3 11/16, to 52 1/4, for Republic New York, hefty gains were widespread among drug and oil companies. Lilly, Abbott and Pfizer all rose about 3 points, while Chevron jumped to a record before closing at 93 3/4, up 3 13/16 points for the day. Oil prices have rebounded smartly in recent weeks.
The Dow's biggest gainer was Union Carbide, which surged 5 1/2, to 51 3/8, on revived speculation that the chemical company may be acquired. General Electric eased 5/8, to 113 7/8, after an earnings report that matched, but did not surpass, profit expectations. Brokerage stocks rose again but generally less than on Wednesday. An exception was a 10-point gain, to 84, for Knight/Trimark Group, a market-maker in Nasdaq and other securities; it traded as low as 4 1/2 six months ago.
But the latest advance did little to remedy what Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock, called a bifurcated market in which household names keep going up, while most others are ignored.
"The big-cap stocks are in a bull market, while the small-cap stocks appear to be in a bear market," he said. The S.& P. is now up more than 9 percent so far this year while the Russell 2000, composed of smaller companies, is down more than 5 percent. The Russell rose 53/100 of 1 percent yesterday, less than half the 1.29 percent gain for the S.& P.
On the New York Stock Exchange volume expanded to 850.6 million shares from 816.4 Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Whitman Looks to the Senate

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey is planning to run for the Senate in 2000. Her announcement that she is setting up a fund-raising committee is as positive a declaration of candidacy as is seemly from a sitting Governor who must convince voters she intends to stay focused on the state's business for the next year and a half.
The idea of adding a Republican woman of Mrs. Whitman's stature to the Senate will excite many people, and to the rest of the nation she probably seems an odds-on favorite. She defeated the incumbent, Jim Florio, in 1993 and presided over a growing New Jersey economy. Like her neighbor, George Pataki of New York, she has identified herself with two popular issues -- tax cuts and environmental protection. Right now the leading Democratic candidate is Mr. Florio, who left office identified with tax hikes, a concept that elicits something less than universal enthusiasm. 
 But Mrs. Whitman's entry does not mean she is an automatic winner. New Jersey has not elected a Republican senator since 1972, and the state seems to have trended Democratic in recent years. Mrs. Whitman herself has never gotten more than 49 percent in any state election, including her surprisingly weak showing against State Senator James McGreevey in the last gubernatorial race.
A contest between Mrs. Whitman, one of a large crop of successful Republican governors, and Mr. Florio, who had to run the state in far less prosperous times, would make for interesting debates. But some Democratic leaders, still smarting from the fact that Mr. Florio's tax plan cost their party control of the state legislature, are hunting for another candidate. Others worry that a primary would leave any Democratic nominee in a weakened condition to run against Mrs. Whitman, but that is not necessarily true. The winner of a primary often simply comes out looking like a winner.
The real problem on everyone's mind is, as usual, campaign funds. A tough Senate race is expected to cost more than $10 million. Mrs. Whitman's fund-raising drive is going to be led by Lewis Eisenberg, who has already been rewarded for past money-raising efforts on her behalf with the post of chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Port Authority is a troubled organization, and Mr. Eisenberg might do better to hand over his job to someone else who does not have to worry about the state of Mrs. Whitman's war chest.

HEADLINE: John Hartwell, 83, Retired Head Of Financial Management Concern

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
John M. Hartwell, an investment counselor and mutual fund manager, died April 2 in New York City, his wife, Sheila, said. He was 83.
Until his retirement in 1996, Mr. Hartwell was the president of his own firm, J. M. Hartwell & Company, which managed private accounts and university endowment funds. 
 Admired for his candor, geniality and acumen, Mr. Hartwell was widely quoted in business publications. "He was one of the early pioneers in identifying the inherent value in growth stocks and growth industries," said Alexander Lazer, a principal with J. M. Hartwell & Company. "Using his research methods, several of his former partners went on to start well-known money management firms."
Born in Everett, Mass., Mr. Hartwell graduated from Harvard College in 1936 and from the Harvard Business School two years later. He taught economics and accounting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at Rutgers University before joining the Navy as an officer in World War II. He was awarded the Purple Heart for wounds received during the invasion of the Marshall Islands.
Before founding his own company, Mr. Hartwell worked as an economist for Mutual of New York and an economic analyst for the Ford Motor Company. He was also the treasurer of the Piedmont Life Insurance Company and special assistant to the chairman of the finance committee of the Vick Chemical Company.
In addition to his wife, the former Sheila Walker, of Manhattan, Mr. Hartwell is survived by three children, Robert, of Dorset, Vt., John 3d, of Greenwich, Conn., and Kathryn Hartwell of Manhattan; a brother, Richard, of Bellevue, Wash.; a sister, Tina Hartwell of Loma Linda, Calif.; two stepchildren, Jonathan Walker and Jason Walker, both of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Iraq Rejects Panels' Efforts to End Impasse on Security Council

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 8

 BODY:
Iraq has angrily rejected the recommendations of three special panels that have tried to find a solution to the diplomatic impasse over Iraq on the Security Council.
Western diplomats said Iraq's blistering response made it clear that Baghdad would not accept any further arms inspections unless economic sanctions imposed after its defeat in the 1991 Persian Gulf war were lifted. 
 "The net result of the recommendations is disappointing" because they "fall short of the goal, which should have been putting an end to the prolonged regime of sanctions," Iraq wrote in response to three reports issued last week by Celso Amorim, Brazil's representative to the United Nations, who was the chairman of all three panels.
The panels' conclusions not only provide "the enemies of Iraq with the pretext for future aggression," Baghdad said; they would infringe Iraq's territorial sovereignty and dignity.
"Such a position," the statement declared, "will never be accepted by the Government of Iraq."
The three inquiries were set up in January to seek compromises that would permit arms inspections to resume, improve the health and welfare of Iraqis and resolve the fate of more than 600 people who disappeared after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
Western diplomats said Iraq's defiant rejection of the findings puts Russia, China and France, the permanent members who have argued most forcefully for an end to the sanctions, in a politically difficult position. "Iraq's most vocal advocates now have a big problem," said a senior American official. "Iraq clearly doesn't want to cooperate, and we intend to make that noncompliance and noncooperation the major issue."
For that reason, Western diplomats said, Richard Butler, the executive chairman of the special commission charged with disarming Iraq, decided once again not to provoke a fight within the Council by trying to attend Security Council deliberations on Friday on the future of his agency.
Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia's representative, vowed today to bar Mr. Butler from the Council's discussions on Friday, as he did on Wednesday. Mr. Butler agreed on Wednesday to send in his place his American deputy, Charles Duelfer, after Mr. Lavrov warned that unless Mr. Butler were barred, he would not enter the room.
According to associates and friends, Mr. Butler decided that provoking a fight over his presence would only distract the Council from the real issue: Iraq's unwillingness to disarm and to comply with the Council's resolutions.
The United States and Britain have argued that Council resolutions require Iraq to disarm itself of unconventional weapons and meet its other commitments before sanctions are lifted. Russia and China have argued, by contrast, that sanctions are no longer warranted because most questions surrounding Iraq's past weapons programs have been answered.
Mr. Amorim tried to strike a balance, arguing that a reinforced long-term monitoring system could both answer questions about Iraq's past programs and monitor future ones. While recommending that steps be taken to get more food and medicine to Iraq, he did not urge that sanctions be lifted.
Iraq also repeated reports that the United States has used inspection missions and the monitors' field office in Bahrain to spy on President Saddam Hussein and select targets for American air strikes.
Clearly unnerved by such allegations, Bahrain, another Security Council member, has asked Secretary General Kofi Annan for public assurances that the monitors are not using their base there to spy or for any purposes other than disarming Iraq.
"We want to be assured publicly, as we have been in private, that things have been done according to the United Nation's resolutions," said Jassim M. Buallay, Bahrain's representative. "We don't want our facilities to be used for anything else."
In another development today, American officials and diplomats confirmed that the United States had asked Mr. Annan to help set up meetings with Libya to clarify what Tripoli must do to persuade the Council to lift sanctions imposed in 1992 and 1993.
This week Libya surrendered two men charged with downing Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, enabling Washington to abandon its longstanding prohibition on direct contacts with Tripoli, officials said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Europeans Cut Key Rate More Than Foreseen

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 8

 BODY:
Confronted with an economic slowdown over much of the Continent, the European Central Bank surprised almost everyone today by reducing interest rates to one of the lowest levels European nations have ever seen.
The cut in the central bank's benchmark rate, to 2.5 percent from 3 percent until now, came hours after a smaller cut by the Bank of England. It reflected growing alarm that economies are stalling and need a boost from lowering the cost of borrowing. 
 There had been some expectations that rates would be lowered today. But the European Central Bank's cut was twice as deep as had been anticipated. The announcement -- which came after European financial markets had closed but with nearly four hours of trading remaining on Wall Street -- ignited a broad rally in American stocks, and major market indexes all closed at record highs. Page C6.
The European rate reduction also seemed aimed at quieting complaints by officials of European Governments, many of whom have pressed the bank for months to stimulate economic growth as a way to reduce joblessness averaging more than 10 percent across the Continent.
Yet the central bankers, even as they reduced borrowing costs to such low levels, warned again that in their view the only real solution to high unemployment was through lightening European nations' costly regulation and social welfare programs.
"Monetary policy is not the cause of structural unemployment, nor is it the solution," said Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank. "Now it will become demonstrably clear that monetary policy is not the solution to those problems."
Today's move marks the first major policy decision by the new central bank, which assumed its powers with the introduction of a single currency, the euro, on Jan. 4.
It came after months of pressure from political leaders, particularly in Germany and France, for lower rates. Until recently, bank officials had only stiffened their resistance at each new call for cheaper money.
But a stream of bleak economic data made it increasingly clear that growth has slowed much more sharply than in the United States. At the same time, inflation has all but evaporated and many experts have begun to worry about a deflationary spiral in prices.
"Inflation is not a danger," Mr. Duisenberg said, and this "enabled us to pay more attention to the second objective of the European Central Bank, which is to support the economy."
He added that the bank -- which is governed by a board that includes the central bank presidents of all 11 countries in the euro zone -- decided to act more boldly than expected in order to put an end to second-guessing about future rate cuts.
"We were afraid that only a smaller move would have led to expectations in the future of more small moves," Mr. Duisenberg said. "Now you can be sure: this is it."
The Bank of England's decision to reduce its key short-term rate to 5.25 percent from 5.50 percent was done independently of the European central bankers and was the latest in a series of reductions over the last half year. There is some expectation that the Bank of England might cut rates further.
Thomas Mayer, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt, said that Mr. Duisenberg clearly intended to put new pressure on European political leaders to push ahead with legislation promoting economic growth. "They threw the ball back into the politicians' court," he said. "From now on, they won't be able to put the blame on monetary policy."
At least initially, the decision seemed to have no real impact on the euro. The euro has fallen more or less steadily against the dollar, from $1.17 at the time of its introduction to $1.0740 in New York today.
Though an interest-rate reduction can lower the value of a currency, traders had already anticipated a cut of some sort. Indeed, in a display of buying on the rumor and selling on the news, the euro climbed slightly before the central bank made its announcement and then eased back again later.
European political leaders quickly expressed pleasure at the decision.
"This signal can only boost confidence among economic actors and international partners in the European Union's ability to return to strong growth," said a statement released in Brussels tonight by the union's caretaker executive body, the European Commission.
In France, a spokesman for Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn praised the rate cut as "part of a rebalanced European policy mix more supportive of growth and employment."
Mr. Duisenberg insisted that the bank had not capitulated to political pressure or changed its basic approach, which places top priority on price stability.
"I want to deny that in any way we switched our monetary policy," he said. With inflation stable at less than 1 percent a year, he said, the bank now had the leeway to stimulate the economy by lowering rates.
Mr. Duisenberg also said he was not concerned by the euro's slide against the dollar. Indeed, he said, based on the value of a "synthetic euro" -- a hypothetical currency made up of the 11 national currencies in the months before the euro's introduction -- its value is about the same as it was a year ago.
But most economists were skeptical that today's rate cut would do much to strengthen growth, because the problems derive more from structural issues within Europe, such as high taxes and rigid regulations, and from declining exports to Asia, Russia and Latin America.
"Growth here was not weak because of high rates," Mr. Mayer of Goldman, Sachs said.

HEADLINE: Denver's Hispanic Residents Point to Ills of the Uninsured

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
Erica Aguilar, a Mexican-American born in Denver, is 21 years old and has three children, ages 4, 2 and 8 months. The children have Medicaid, and for them she uses the city's La Casa Family Health Center.
But Ms. Aguilar herself has no health insurance. She works 26 hours a week as a sales clerk at Montgomery Ward for $6.50 an hour, and as a part timer, she is ineligible for insurance even if she could pay her share of the premium. Yet she earns too much to get Medicaid. 
 So for herself and sometimes her children, Ms. Aguilar uses home remedies. "I go by what my grandmother tells me," she said. She douses her eyes with sugar and water to cure eye irritations. To cure colic, she rubs the baby's stomach with warm oils.
Ms. Aguilar's story is emblematic of a striking disparity in the nation's health care. For reasons that are largely economic, but also cultural, 34 percent of the nation's 31 million Hispanic people have no health insurance, compared with 22 percent of blacks and 12 percent of non-Hispanic whites. Over all, 43 million people in the nation lack insurance, up from 31 million a decade ago.
While Hispanic people appear to be gaining in economic and political strength, they disproportionately lack insurance coverage and ready access to professional care. That is particularly true for the three-quarters who are from Mexico and Central America. Cuban-Americans tend to be older and wealthier and to have insurance.
The social costs of the uninsured come with the dangers of untreated contagious diseases and an eventual reliance on emergency room care, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention.
Denver has a vast Hispanic population, making up a quarter of the city's half-million residents compared with 11 percent nationwide.
Hispanic residents here are mostly young and mostly from Mexico and Central America, and as in many cities their lack of professional health care sustains a thriving system of alternative care built on religion, tradition and home remedies. Often it works. But just as often, it delays and impedes crucial care.
Health system officials and community leaders here say the menial jobs for relatively young and uneducated Hispanic workers make health insurance unlikely for them. But the disparity in coverage is worsened, the officials say, by cultural and bureaucratic barriers and a political climate that has darkened for immigrants, both legal and illegal.
"They tend to be poor," said Ann Zuvekas of the George Washington University Center for Health Policy Research in Washington and author of several studies of minority health. "They tend to work for small employers, in low-wage jobs, cleaning buildings and gardening, in car washes."
Ms. Zuvekas added: "There are cultural differences and language barriers. And a number are immigrants. Public policy has been to make sure that many immigrants don't get insurance."
Under the welfare overhaul of three years ago, for example, legal immigrants must wait five years to apply for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor.
Little has been done to treat the gap in the Hispanic population's coverage, beyond a $48 billion, 10-year program enacted two years ago to expand Government insurance to allpoor children.
"We are being lobbied to improve our children's care," said Richard C. Allen, director of Colorado's Medicaid program. "But regarding Hispanics? No."
Some who do qualify for programs like Medicaid still will not enroll because they do not like being counted.
"They're frightened," said Dr. Richard Wright, chief executive of Community Health Services of Denver Health, the city's health care system, which was once public and is now independent. "They think, 'If I enroll, that will work against me as an immigrant."'
For most uninsured Hispanic people the disparity in coverage arises from a decline in jobs that offer benefits. Only half of all Hispanic people are covered through employment, compared with two-thirds of African-Americans and three-quarters of white workers.
When employers do offer insurance, usually asking workers to share the cost, Hispanic workers are the most likely to refuse, because they feel they cannot afford it.
While economic reasons dominate, issues of culture also emerge.
"People rely on faith a lot," said Luz Collins, who was born in Mexico and is the administrator of the Westside Family Health Center, one of 11 Denver Health clinics. "They wheel and deal with God. You call it home medicine. It's our actual medicine. A lot of it's hidden because we realize it's not accepted by the majority."
Some home medicine tends to be harmless, like the ceremony performed for the 2-year-old granddaughter of Irene Chavez. Recently, in the waiting room at La Casa, Ms. Chavez lovingly displayed a framed photograph of the toddler with her deep, happy dimples and wavy black hair.
"She's a beautiful granddaughter," Ms. Chavez says, "so beautiful that people just can't believe she's real."
Whether in spite, envy or admiration, she said, someone gazed too long at her granddaughter and marked her with the evil eye, or mal de ojo. A day or two later the child fell ill, with vomiting, diarrhea and a high fever. Doctors said she had a virus. "They said, 'Stop being paranoid,' " Ms. Chavez said. ' "There's nothing wrong with her.' "
Unconvinced, the family called in Louise, their 77-year-old neighborhood curandera, or healer. Chanting prayers, the woman rubbed an unbroken egg over the child, tracing signs of the cross. Then she broke the egg, put it in a cup, placed a cross made of twigs in the yolk, and put the cup under the child's bed. By morning the child was well. The egg, Ms. Chavez said, had exorcised the curse.
But when such efforts fail and patients belatedly show up at doctors' offices, says Dr. Alicia Vazquez, the primary care physician at La Casa, they have been drinking cocktails of exotic herbs or using cheap, under-the-counter prescription medicines that bodegas smuggle in from Mexico.
"A 32-year-old female comes in with a five-day history of sore throat, runny nose and a cough and reports that she's been taking an antibiotic from Mexico because that's all she could get," Dr. Vazquez says.
Dr. Vazquez takes a culture of the patient's mouth to see if she has strep throat. It proves negative. "But is that because she does not have strep throat, or is she partially treated?" she said. Not knowing which, she said, leaves the doctor with the choice of treating a condition the patient may not have or waiting to see if the conditions worsens.
Even the act of going to a clinic is novel to some. "In Mexico, there are so many things around for curing yourself that you don't go to the doctor," said Juvenica Acevedo Flores, a hearty widow who is 4 feet 4 inches tall and 87 years old.
She has Medicare but rarely used it until a few years ago when she was found to have diabetes. Now her daughter takes her to the Westside clinic for checkups. "It's necessary," Ms. Acevedo said with a shrug.
Lucille Brodsky, a clinic manager whose grandmother was a curandera, said the whole notion of insurance could be foreign. "The culture isn't one to ask for help outside the family," she said. "Then when something really bad happens, you turn to the family for money" to pay for professional care.
Language is also a barrier, both in efforts to get patients to enroll in health care programs and in communicating with them once they sign up.
At Denver Health's Community Health Services, which oversees the clinics and serves a predominantly poor and Hispanic clientele, 83 percent of the 80 physicians are non-Hispanic whites. So are all eight senior social workers and 84 percent of the 97 registered and advanced-practice nurses.
As a result, said Ms. Collins of the Westside clinic, "a Hispanic is given heart medicine and it's not well-explained."
"They end up taking it when they have a chest pain," she said, "not every day."
Barbara Sanchez-Martin, director of the Center for Community and Behavioral Health at the Denver branch of the Latin American Research and Service Agency, says the problem is one of "cultural competence," not just language.
At the private, largely church-funded Tepeyac Clinic, husbands sometimes stop their wives from having pap smears. "If the doctor's a man," said Jim Garcia, chairman of the clinic's board, "the husband says no. The idea of another man touching his wife is beyond comprehension."
"So we try to relieve that," said Susan M. Gallo, a psychologist and the clinic's executive director, "by having a female attendant in the examining room -- a chaperone."
Barriers like these help drive Hispanic people into the unofficial health care safety net. One strand is the neighborhood curandera, and another the bodegas and specialized stores that dispense herbs, teas, incense, charms, sprays and oils, some with proven medicinal value and often prescribed by curanderas.
Dr. Rick Padilla, a family physician at Westside, estimates that 100 to 200 curanderas serve Denver, nearly all working from their homes and known only by word of mouth. In a random survey of 405 adult Hispanic patients, he found that 29 percent had sought a curandera's intervention at least once in their lives.
Some charge nothing, Dr. Padilla said. Others accept a meal, or a donation ranging from $5 to $100. "They're not very well regulated," he said, "and there's a lot of potential for abuse." But when he feels that Hispanic patients' fears and suspicions obstruct their care, he refers them to a trustworthy curandera.
"Many Latin people think their diseases are related to someone having put a hex on them," said Toni Palma, a counselor to the elderly at Westside. A woman might say she has been cursed and made sick by another who wants her husband.
On the face of it, the disparities in insurance coverage do not translate into conclusive evidence of a sicker population. Nationwide, the average Hispanic resident is a first-generation immigrant and 26 years old, or 10 years younger than the rest of the population, and less likely to have contracted the diseases that develop later in life.
Still, among the three largest population groups -- non-Hispanic white, black and Hispanic -- statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that they have the highest rates of such diseases as mumps, tetanus, whooping cough and German measles. They have lower levels of H.I.V. infection, diabetes and tuberculosis than blacks but about twice the levels of whites.
Twenty-eight percent of Hispanic children are uninsured, the journal Health Affairs reports, compared with 18 percent of black children and 12 percent of white children.
Once Hispanic immigrants have lived in the United States for a decade or two, physicians here say, their diets begin to shift from beans, grains, fruit and vegetables to fast and processed foods.
 So once they are settled, said Robin Weinick, social scientist at the Federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, "Hispanics tend to be in poorer health." And, she said, "They have the poorest access to care of any population we measure."
Dr. Wright of Denver Health said: "We've got to learn. We've got to talk to people in the community. We've got to have a dialogue so our system and their beliefs can be more in sync."

HEADLINE: 9 Men Plead Guilty to Slaughtering Cormorants to Protect Sport Fishing

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Nine men from sport-fishing communities along the eastern shore of Lake Ontario pleaded guilty yesterday to charges stemming from the shotgun slayings of more than 1,000 federally protected birds last summer, prosecutors said.
The shootings, which killed hundreds of double-crested cormorants -- both adults and nestlings -- and left dozens of nestlings to starve to death, are considered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to be one of the largest mass killings ever of a species protected by Federal laws. 
 A 10th man pleaded guilty to being an accessory to the crime by hiding shotguns used to kill the birds. The plea agreements, negotiated over the last few weeks, were entered in Federal District Court in Syracuse, said Thomas J. Maroney, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of New York.
The five men who pleaded guilty to the most serious charges agreed to serve six months of home confinement, monitored with electronic ankle bracelets. They each agreed to pay a $2,500 fine and to contribute $5,000 to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, a private group, which will use the money to restore wetlands around Lake Ontario.
But several of the men, who are professional fishing guides, have said all along that they believed they were justified in shooting the fish-eating birds to save their livelihood. And they feel vindicated, they say, by the state's recent decision to cull the cormorant flock to protect sport fish.
James R. McGraw, a defense lawyer in the case, said the state plans proved that the killing of the birds was appropriate. "They've done nothing other than what the State of New York is going to do itself," he said. Several of the defendants were reached by telephone, but declined to be interviewed until their final sentences are handed down in August.
The cormorants are not endangered, but are protected by the 81-year-old Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits hundreds of species that migrate across international borders from being killed or harassed.
Their numbers have risen sharply in recent decades, and the birds, which can each gulp several pounds of fish a day, are considered pests by anglers in the Great Lakes and catfish farmers in their winter range along the Gulf Coast.
Before the shootings last year, several of the defendants in the case had publicly threatened to cull a fast-growing colony of the birds on Little Galloo Island, which is about five miles from Henderson, a lakeside town where dozens of charter boats dock and 8 of the 10 defendants live.
Many people in the community blamed the cormorants for a recent sharp decline in stocks of smallmouth bass, a popular game fish. The economy of Henderson, which is largely built on bass fishing by tourists, has seen a simultaneous downturn, as anglers seeking a sure catch have headed elsewhere.
A study released in December by New York environmental scientists confirmed a link between the growth in the cormorant colony and falling fish stocks.
But prosecutors and Federal and state wildlife officials said yesterday that there was no excuse for the outburst of violence against the birds.
"Vigilantism, and especially this kind of cruel killing by individuals, has no place in resolving a complex population issue," said Craig A. Benedict, an assistant United States attorney who helped prosecute the case.
The pleas filed in court described the systematic nature of the shootings: On July 27, the five men facing the most serious punishments, David McCrea, Ronald Ditch, Mitchell Franz, Louis Cook and John Kabot, took Mr. McCrea's boat to the island, where they split into groups and began shooting birds from the boat and the shore.
Mr. Ditch and Mr. McCrea are guides whose families have made a living from sport fishing for several generations. Mr. Cook owns a marina.
After the July 27 shooting, according to the plea agreements, the men handed their shotguns to Rex Allen, who was in another boat and who did not shoot any birds. Several of the guns were later hidden by another man, Angelo Aversa.
The mass shooting was discovered when state biologists visited the island two days later as part of a continuing study of the birds' diet. They found dozens of fledglings starving to death, sitting among piles of carcasses.
In the same plea agreement, Mr. Aversa and Mr. Ditch's three sons -- Andrew, David and Thomas -- admitted to shooting cormorants in separate incidents last year along with the other five men. They have agreed to serve three months of home confinement and pay smaller fines. Mr. Allen, who never shot at the birds, will pay a fine and be placed on probation.
Mr. McGraw, a lawyer for Mr. Ditch and his sons, said they stood by their actions, but were willing to accept punishment.
"When they got involved, they knew there was going to be a consequence," Mr. McGraw said. "They weighed the good and the bad and decided it was appropriate to do. When the bureaucracy sits back and lets a community die and an industry die, I don't think that's vigilantism."
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation is planning to go ahead with its own culling of the Little Galloo Island colony, under a permit that is expected to be issued by Federal wildlife officials in the next few weeks.
State biologists plan to trap and kill 300 adult birds and dip the cormorants' eggs in mineral oil and return them to nests. This practice suffocates the embryos, but the parent birds continue to roost and thus are not prompted to breed a second time. The goal is to reduce the colony from 6,000 nesting pairs to about 1,500 in five years, according to the state proposal.
The men are to be sentenced Aug. 11 by Magistrate Judge Gary L. Sharpe, and will not be confined to their homes until September. They are not prohibited from fishing on the lake this summer, said Mr. Benedict, the assistant United States attorney.

HEADLINE: U.S.-CHINA TALKS FAIL TO PRODUCE MAJOR TRADE DEAL

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
President Clinton and China's Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji, fell short today of reaching a major trade deal that China has long sought, even though the two leaders said they made significant progress in negotiations to usher China into the organization that sets the rules for global commerce.
Although the announcement by Mr. Clinton that "we are not quite there yet" came well short of the hopes both leaders had harbored for China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, it had the virtue of giving Mr. Clinton and Mr. Zhu more time to prepare their constituencies at home for an agreement that faces fierce opposition in both capitals. 
 At a 90-minute news conference today, the blunt-talking Chinese Prime Minister blamed what he termed an "anti-Chinese" mood in Washington, saying, "If you want to hear some honest words, then I should say that now the problem does not lie with this big difference, or big gap" in negotiating positions, "but lies with the political atmosphere." If it were not for that, he said, China and the United States would be ready to sign "a full-package agreement."
Business executives and China experts expressed surprise at the scope of some of Beijing's concessions -- some of which may have as much political resonance as economic impact. For the first time, for example, China agreed to permit American telecommunications companies to control Chinese cellular telephone firms and Internet companies, and operate throughout the vast country of 1.2 billion people. How China would square that with its efforts to quash political opposition and limit Internet access was unclear.
Among the issues left outstanding, though, were some that directly affect two of President Clinton's most high-profile constituencies: Wall Street and Hollywood. China has refused to let American brokerages into its free-for-all stock markets, and it wants to restrict the number of American movies that can be released in its theaters, arguing that it must limit what one Chinese official recently called "cultural pollution."
The days of furious negotiations were overshadowed this afternoon, however, as Mr. Zhu used the news conference to take on China's critics with a vehemence and a directness that no Chinese leader has ever shown on American soil.
He invoked Abraham Lincoln's use of force to keep the Union together as an example China should keep in mind as it deals with Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway province -- a comparison Mr. Clinton stepped in to reject. He derided reports that China stole nuclear weapons secrets, and mocked assertions that China sought to influence the 1996 Presidential election.
"I have $146 billion of foreign exchange reserves," said the man who has overseen China's profound economic transition in recent years, "so I should have put out at least $10 billion for that purpose."
"Why just $300,000?" he said, referring to the amount of campaign contributions investigators say originated from Chinese military intelligence. "That would be too foolish!" he said, as the audience laughed and Mr. Clinton cracked a smile.
And even in human rights, the perpetual area of dispute, Mr. Zhu first attacked the American decision to win an international condemnation of its political crackdown, and then tried disarming his critics by partially agreeing with them.
"I am more impatient than you are" to change China's human rights environment, he said, suggesting that his country was still struggling under the hangover of thousands of years of a feudal system.
Today's meetings came amid a clear effort by Mr. Clinton to embrace Mr. Zhu as the kind of Chinese reformer he can deal with -- an embrace similar to the one Washington extended a decade ago to the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Although he is a clear No. 2 to President Jiang Zemin, who came here a year ago, the 70-year-old Mr. Zhu received most of the trappings of a state visit.
On Washington's first cloudless and warm spring day, the economic reformer who talks openly about dismantling Mao's system of state-owned industries was given a 19-gun salute, full military honors and a welcome from President Clinton that included thanks for China's willingness 200 years ago to give "our newly independent nation equal standing with the powers of Europe." He was clearly suggesting that the United States, by guiding China into the trade organization, intended to return the favor.
Tonight, Mr. Clinton was host at a glittering official dinner and invited business executives and academics with ties to China, for a performance by Yo-Yo Ma, the world's premier cellist.
Mr. Zhu seemed relieved by the welcome. Asked today why he came to the United States at this difficult moment in the two countries' relations, he said: "Are you asking me to tell you the truth? To tell you the truth, I was really reluctant to come," adding that he had asked a delegation of American Congressmen and Senators in Beijing last week, "Will my 'new face' be turned into a bloody face?"
But he came to Washington as Congress was out of session, meaning that he did not have to confront China's critics on the Democratic left and the Republican right, who appear to be joining forces in opposing China's entry to the world trade group. In fact, Mr. Clinton's aides acknowledged today that any trade deal with China would become enmeshed in the debates about nuclear spying, stepped-up political repression and a soaring trade deficit.
"Getting this through the Hill is going to be a killer," a senior Administration official said today.
Before the news conference, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Zhu met in two separate sessions that, participants said, were far more sober and businesslike than their public performance later in the day. They discussed -- and disagreed on -- Kosovo this morning in a small session attended by the national security adviser Samuel R. Berger, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, the Cabinet member who has most frequently encountered the Chinese Prime Minister. Chinese leaders fear that the precedent of international intervention over a rebellious province could easily be applied to Taiwan.
At a larger meeting with other aides present, Mr. Zhu repeated his vow not to devalue the Chinese currency, the yuan. Mr. Rubin and others fear that a devaluation could re-ignite the Asian financial crisis. They argued briefly over Mr. Clinton's plans to develop a missile defense system in Asia, one ostensibly intended to protect American troops from North Korean missiles, but a system the Chinese believe could ultimately be used to defend Taiwan against Chinese missiles.
At one point, veering into a discussion of Tibet, Mr. Zhu and Mr. Clinton discussed the possibility of using the Vatican as a conduit for discussions between Chinese leaders and the Dalai Lama, the exiled religious leader of the Himalayan territory. In public, the Dalai Lama is denounced as a religious fraud by Chinese diplomats; the private conversation about opening a secret channel to him, which White House officials refused to confirm tonight, was calm and businesslike, according to several people familiar with it.
In an interview this evening, the main American negotiator on the trade issues, United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, described China's willingness to open its markets in agriculture, telecommunications, banking, insurance and other areas as "very sweeping." She suggested that final agreement was near -- but that negotiators had simply run out of time.
"I do not believe that any of the remaining issues are show-stoppers," she said. "I would expect fairly rapid resolution" that would pave the way for China to join the trade organization by the time it holds a ministerial meeting in Seattle in November. In fact, executives of several companies said they were surprised by the last-minute concessions that China made, some of which are bound to open Mr. Zhu up to criticism that he is leaving Chinese enterprises too vulnerable too soon to foreign competition.
The telecommunications agreement -- allowing foreign control of cell phone networks, Internet providers and other "value-added services" -- came as a surprise. But while the business opportunities for the likes of Motorola Corporation or AT&T -- along with their Japanese and European competitors -- are obvious, such accords usually run into myriad obstacles on the ground. And over the years, the Chinese have shown that they understand that Internet connections and a vast cell phone network are a price of joining the global economy -- even if they dilute Beijing's ability to control dissent and outside information.
Other aspects of the accord hint at a broadening of economic freedom. China agreed to allow 100 percent foreign ownership of commercial banks within five years -- almost all are now joint ventures between Chinese and foreign partners -- and they will be permitted for the first time to handle individual Chinese accounts. That creates the possibility that a worker in Xian would be able to deposit his savings at Citibank -- even if he would still face restrictions on moving his money abroad.
"These are things that five years ago the Chinese wouldn't even talk about," Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, said this morning, as Mr. Zhu and President Clinton reviewed the military guard on the South Lawn.
But the Chinese were unwilling to let foreign brokerages compete for Chinese customers. They argue that an uncontrolled flow of foreign capital worsened the Asian crisis, and they have no desire to repeat the experience. But Administration officials said they believed China's reluctance had more to do with protectionism, noting that they could keep in place strict rules on capital flows in and out of the country.

HEADLINE: British Airways Will Close Base in Queens

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
British Airways, one of the largest employers in Queens, plans to shut its American headquarters at the former Bulova watch building near La Guardia Airport -- a move that union officials fear will result in the loss of hundreds of jobs.
Airline officials said yesterday that they planned to close their offices at the Bulova Corporate Center in Jackson Heights when the company's lease runs out in 2002 and shut down their telephone sales operations, which employ more than 600 people. About 200 other corporate employees in Queens will be moved to a smaller headquarters at a location that has not yet been chosen. A British Airways spokesman would not say whether the new headquarters would be in the New York area. 
 The airline has been an anchor tenant at the sprawling 23-acre Bulova property since it was converted to an office complex from a watch factory 12 years ago.
"The company has made the decision to close the facility in three years," said John W. Lampl, a spokesman for British Airways. "But we have guaranteed jobs and no loss in pay to everyone who will be affected."
Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, whose district includes the Bulova center, said that he learned of the airline's plans a few days ago. "For British Airways to be so cavalier about its relationship with New York is rather striking to me," he said.
Mr. Vallone said he informed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of the airline's plans yesterday. "The Mayor didn't know anything about it," he said. "We're naturally very concerned about this and we're going to try to convene a meeting with the airline to talk some sense into them and get them to stay in the city."
Randy L. Levine, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, said that he spoke with company officials yesterday, who assured him that after union contract negotiations were completed and a planned terminal expansion at Kennedy was finished next year, "they expect that in the future, there will be a net increase of British Airways jobs in New York."
Mr. Lampl said that although the airline planned to turn its telephone sales operations over to outside sources, it would offer its displaced workers other customer service jobs at four airports in the United States: Kennedy International Airport and airports in Seattle, San Francisco and Charlotte, N.C.
Union officials said, however, that many of the workers had been with the company and had lived in the area for a long time and that relocation would be difficult at best for them. They also said they believed the company's plan to hire an outside company to handle telephone sales was an attempt to break the union.
"If you're working 25 years there, you can't pick up your family and just go," said Joseph Adinolfi, general chairman of District 142 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents British Airways workers in New York and Houston. "We don't believe that can happen."
The airline's plans to phase out its telephone sales operation have been a major point of contention in recent contract negotiations with the union, which represents the airline's telephone sales representatives, airport customer service agents and airport mechanics. In addition to the changes in New York, the airline plans to close its telephone sales division in Houston in 2001, where 160 people are employed.
Union leaders said they believed that the airline planned to shift its telephone sales network to a nonunion call center in Florida and possibly to a site in India, where the airline has a major reservations center. Mr. Lampl said that the airline had not yet chosen a vendor to handle its telephone reservations but that the move to an outside vendor was intended to help save the company money.
"We have a corporate business efficiency program that requires us to save one billion British pounds a year," he said, or roughly $1.5 billion. Among other changes throughout the corporation, he said, its United States operations "decided to outsource telephone sales to lower costs."
Contract negotiations stalled earlier this year and the National Mediation Board, the Washington agency that moderates labor disputes in the airline industry, mandated a 30-day "cooling-off period" that runs out on April 17. Union officials have said that if negotiations are not successful next week, the workers might go on strike, but they said there also are indications that the airline might lock out its employees.
"We're hopeful that we will be able to reach an agreement," Mr. Lampl said. "But if there is an industrial action, we have contingency plans, and service will not be disrupted." He said that the company had already trained replacement workers.
Wendy Szerencses, who has worked in reservations for British Airways for the last 14 years, was one of 200 employees who protested against the airline's plans in front of the British Consulate in Manhattan yesterday.
"I planned to retire from this company," she said. "It was a great airline until the last few years when they began angering employees by asking for cutbacks despite huge profits." She said that she and her husband had just bought a house in Queens and that they were uncertain what they would do if she were forced to relocate.
British Airways last year recorded $14.49 billion in revenues and $77 million in profits, according to Mr. Lampl. The telephone sales representatives are paid an average of $12 an hour.
Local officials from the City Council, the State Assembly and Congress said they would introduce resolutions denouncing the British Airways plan to close its Queens headquarters.
"This would be a very significant loss for the city because we're talking about a large number of good-paying jobs that are going to be difficult to replace," said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, a Democrat from Woodside, Queens.

HEADLINE: A New Strain On the Cost Of Health Care;
Latest Medical Devices Bring Bigger Bills

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Managed health care plans and the Medicare program have had some success slowing growth in spending for doctors, hospitals and home care agencies. But managed care has been much less successful reining in spending on new life-enhancing medical devices and procedures.
Advances in technology -- from laser treatments to the latest surgical procedures with miniature instruments -- are one of the main reasons for the reacceleration in the overall costs of health insurance, after several years of slow or zero growth. Sales of new medical devices in the United States rose 30 percent over the last five years, outpacing the 22 percent rise over all in health care spending and all other categories except prescription drug sales, which were up 50 percent. 
 "About half the growth in real per-capita health costs is associated with medical technology" including advances in procedures and drugs, said Mark Freeland, deputy director of the National Health Statistics Group in the Health Care Financing Administration.
Increased medical costs were cited yesterday by Humana Inc., a managed care company with 6.2 million members, as it announced that its first-quarter earnings would fall below Wall Street's expectations.
Paradoxically, many of the new procedures are promoted as reducing costs: a $3 million laser device that provides an alternative to brain surgery can pay for itself by reducing the costs that surgical procedures and lengthy hospital recoveries would have previously required. But health plans are finding that over all, technology costs are surging, in large part because the new procedures are more available or more attractive to more people -- fostering a demand that insurers cannot stem.
Patients who are hesitant about traditional open surgery, for example, will eagerly agree to minimally invasive procedures with miniature instruments to repair heart valves or remove defective gallbladders.
The pattern was clear at Health Partners, a big, nonprofit Minnesota health maintenance organization. In only two years, from 1996 to 1998, the H.M.O. counted double-digit growth in the number of procedures for every thousand members in eight categories, including some of the most expensive: brain and nervous system procedures, heart and artery surgery, orthopedics like hip and knee replacements and organ transplants. Premature infants were another big-ticket item.
At Children's Hospital in Minneapolis, where many patients are tiny premature babies, "there has been a technological explosion and a tremendous increase in survival rates and the good news is, we did not have an increase in extremely damaged children," Dr. Ronald Hoekstra said. But with the advances, he added, costs are bound to go up.
One of Dr. Hoekstra's patients, Simon Hagman, a strapping 30-pounder who celebrated his third birthday late last month, has already made a personal contribution to the economics of high-technology health care. Health Partners, his family's plan, spent $1.2 million on lifesaving care for Simon, whose birth only 22.5 weeks after conception was dangerously premature.
Simon, born weighing 1 pound, 4 ounces and only 12 inches in height, lived for 14 months in the neonatal unit at Children's Hospital. With the help of sophisticated procedures and technology, he overcame three heart attacks, several bouts of pneumonia and a threat of blindness. He went home, with 24-hour nursing, still dependent for a time on an oxygen system that augmented his miniature lung power.
"Miraculously, Simon survived without brain damage," said his mother, Tracey Hagman.
A dozen years ago, there would have been small hope for an infant with Simon's precarious medical profile. For premature babies with severe problems who did qualify for the less-advanced treatments available then, the medical charges were about $250,000.
The new drugs and procedures were welcomed as essential to excellent care. "It's the right thing to do, but it's very expensive," said George Halvorson, chief executive of Health Partners.
"As a result, our premiums are going to go up, and people are going to have to pay more for care," he added. There were 345 cases in 1998 on which Health Partners spent $50,000 or more. That was more than double the number in 1996.
While some experts say the spread of managed care will slow the introduction of advanced devices, that is clearly not the case at many H.M.O.'s.
"It is extraordinarily difficult for H.M.O.'s to put up barriers for care that is valuable," said Michael Chernew, a health economist at the University of Michigan.
Most big managed care plans rely on advice from panels of medical experts to recommend acceptance or rejection of new technology. For example, a Blue Cross advisory panel endorsed a number of new developments last year, but the group determined that a heavily marketed new electron beam CT scanner was not as effective in diagnosing heart disease as the older methods, said Dr. Alan Garber, a professor of medicine at Stanford University who is a member of the panel. Such panels appraise the scientific value of products and procedures; insurers typically weigh the recommendations as well as cost-effectiveness in deciding whether to approve the innovations.
Not all the advanced devices are big and complicated. Among the most popular are stents, the tiny metal tubes that prop open clogged blood vessels. In part because of new competition that cut the price, sales of stents exploded last year to $1.4 billion, up 40 percent from 1997, said Vivian R. Wohl, a health care securities analyst with Merrill Lynch. Sales of implantable defibrillators, which shock faltering hearts, rose 20 percent, to $1.2 billion.
Other new products are in demand: a robot-assisted gamma knife to attack tumors deep in the brain, lasers to improve vision by sculpturing corneas, ultrasensitive blood oxygenators to keep premature infants alive and inch-long metal spinal implants to relieve back pain.
And there is much more to come. Medical devices still being tested include one to position a functioning heart in what is called beating heart surgery; minimally invasive devices to thwart blood clots and prevent strokes, advanced insulin pumps that continuously adjust to changes in a diabetic's blood sugar; devices that use microwaves, lasers or ultrasound to treat enlarged male prostate glands.
"We are going to see a flood of these things," Dr. Garber said. "Most of these new technologies do contribute something to improve health, but the cost pressures are enormous."
Health care costs, to be sure, are rising for a number of reasons, including an aging population. While the cost pressures of many factors can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, technology is a moving target, with some prices falling and the number of sophisticated procedures rising.
"Some of the biggest impacts are not clear until years after a procedure is introduced, as it gets better and physicians find more uses for it," said Paul B. Ginsburg, president of the nonprofit Center for Studying Health System Change in Washington.
And a new procedure can often be used by a larger pool of patients than before, raising overall costs.
"When you get better at doing a procedure, through experience, you are willing to do it on older people and frailer people, as happened with coronary bypass grafts," said Joseph Newhouse, a health economist at Harvard.
Bypasses were also improved in ways that made them more expensive. "The product in 1999 is not what it was in 1990," Dr. Garber said. Defying expectations, the number of open heart bypass surgeries kept on growing, even after a wildly popular alternative, the angioplasty balloon-and-stent procedure to repair arteries, took off, he said.
"Looking far out, there are some possibilities that new kinds of technologies might be so powerful as to reduce the cost of health care," said Stuart Altman, a Brandeis University professor who is chairman of the Council on the Economic Impact of Health System Changes, a nonprofit group supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. "But for the next 5 to 10 years, if not longer, the general consensus is that technology will continue to increase health care spending."
Even today, however, studies have shown that some of the latest drugs and devices can save money. Last month, scientists at the New York University Medical Center said that patients who required surgery for defective heart valves spent four fewer days in the hospital after a minimally invasive procedure, compared with traditional open chest surgery.
And in brain surgery, 45 American hospitals and surgery centers have purchased $3 million gamma knife systems, which use radiation instead of a risky cutting procedure to zap tumors.
One patient, Joseph Keenan, had put off surgery for years on a tumor that was interfering with his hearing and balance. Dr. Keenan, 55, a professor of family medicine at the University of Minnesota, finally had the procedure done about a year ago with a gamma knife.
He checked into the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., at 5 A.M., had the procedure and was sent home by 10 the same morning. Two days later, he flew to China for a long-scheduled lecture tour and a round of golf.
"It was great," Dr. Keenan said.
At Health Partners, new devices are screened by expert committees in each area, said Dr. George Isham, chief health officer of the Minnesota H.M.O. The gamma knife reviewers, for example, included a brain cancer specialist from Mayo, a radiation oncologist and a brain surgeon from the University of Minnesota, a brain surgeon from the Park Nicollet Clinic, a big Twin Cities medical group, and a neurologist from Health Partners' own medical group.
After reviewing scientific reports, the experts concluded that the knife was effective. The H.M.O. then decided to pay for the procedures, Dr. Isham said.
At the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which pioneered gamma knife surgery in the United States, Dr. L. Dade Lunsford said that studies had shown an "enormous return on the initial technological investment."
Dr. Lunsford, who is chairman of neurosurgery, said the gamma knife was increasingly used to destroy hearing-nerve tumors like Dr. Keenan's. Typically not cancerous, they are a problem for 2,000 Americans each year.
Patients return to work in days instead of months, he said. Complications are rare and the need for additional surgery has been eliminated, he said.
"The total cost of traditional surgery was $30,000," he said. The charge for Dr. Keenan at Mayo was $18,000, paid by Health Partners.
As for Simon Hagman, the premature baby, he is "very well nourished and improving with time," Dr. Hoekstra said.
"I don't think you can put a price on a life," Simon's mother said. "It was worth every dollar spent."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Edge Up as Oil Costs Jump

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
Producer prices rose less than expected last month as the biggest increase in oil prices since the Persian Gulf crisis in 1990-91 was offset by falling prices for computers and a variety of other products.
The Labor Department said today that producer prices, which are paid to factories, farmers and other producers, rose two-tenths of 1 percent in March. Although that was a reversal from February, when prices fell four-tenths of 1 percent, the March increase was below the forecasts of analysts, who had expected a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent. 
 The core rate of price growth, which excludes food and energy costs, was unchanged in March for the second consecutive month. Analysts had expected a rise of one-tenth of 1 percent.
"Those who are looking for inflation are being frustrated by every piece of data we get," said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson, a Chicago investment firm. "We expected oil to rise, but the rest of inflation is behaving very, very well."
Crude oil prices rose 27.1 percent in March, the biggest gain since October 1990, when they jumped 29.7 percent, shortly after Iraqi forces occupied oil-rich Kuwait.
Producer energy prices over all rose 1.2 percent in March, led by the largest increase in the cost of home heating oil since February 1994. The increase reflected late-winter storms in some parts of the country. Gasoline prices also increased.
The price of crude oil has risen as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has moved to reduce production.

HEADLINE: Venezuela's New Leader: Democrat or Dictator?

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela

 BODY:
To the adoring, impoverished masses who catapulted him to power, Hugo Chavez Frias is El Comandante, their protector and benefactor, the bold leader who will wipe out 40 years of inequality and corruption and redirect this country's enormous oil wealth to better their lives.
To his opponents, the 44-year-old former army paratrooper who is Venezuela's new President represents something unsettling, even dangerous. With his talk of "revolution," his contempt for institutions he calls "worm-eaten and decadent" and his violent coup attempt seven years ago, he strikes many of them as an autocrat in the making. 
 The jury is still out on Mr. Chavez, who took office on Feb. 2 while riding a wave of popular disgust with a political system seen as venal and unresponsive. But whether he turns out to be democrat or dictator, his charisma and his vows to overturn the prevailing order have already transformed politics in this country of 23 million people.
Trying to divine Mr. Chavez's ultimate intentions from a flood of contradictory public pronouncements has become a popular pastime here, leading to the publication of several new books with titles like "Chavez the Wizard of Emotions: Psycho social Analysis of a Political Phenomenon."
But ask Mr. Chavez, and he classifies himself as a post-modernist politician, bound by none of the "Cartesian" limitations of established ideologies.
"If you try to assess me by traditional canons of analysis, you'll never emerge from confusion," he said in an interview in his office at the same presidential palace he attacked in 1992. "If you are attempting to determine whether Chavez is of the left, right or center, if he is a socialist, Communist or capitalist, well, I am none of those, but I have a bit of all of those."
Mr. Chavez's Minister of Finance, Maritza Izaguirre, describes the President, who had never held public office before, as a pragmatist going through "a process of apprenticeship." Dealing with the budget, for instance, he was eager to learn even the most arcane details of state spending, she said.
But the President's critics argue that Venezuela, the largest supplier of crude oil to the United States in recent years, is mired in a crisis so severe that it cannot afford the luxury of giving him on-the-job training. Inflation and unemployment are near all-time highs, oil prices slumped to their lowest level in years just as Mr. Chavez was taking office, and the Venezuelan economy is expected to contract this year for the second year in a row.
To deal with the situation, Mr. Chavez demanded from Congress, and received late in March, the power to rule by decree for the next six months. But the main, and most controversial, plank of his campaign platform was a pledge to convene a constituent assembly to do away with the country's "moribund" Constitution and draw up a new one. A referendum on that proposal is scheduled for April 25.
 On April 8, Mr. Chavez rejected the "enabling law" that Congress had approved, saying it did not go far enough. He threatened to impose a state of national emergency, which would allow him to suspend constitutional guarantees and to rule by decree.
As envisioned by Mr. Chavez and his Fifth Republic Movement, the new Constitution would grant him expanded powers and allow him to run for a second consecutive term, instead of waiting 10 years as currently required. That has led his critics to charge that he plans to make himself a caudillo, or classic Latin American military strongman in the mold of Juan Peron, Fidel Castro or Omar Torrijos, an accusation that Mr. Chavez ridicules.
"If I were going to be a tyrant, I would already have carried out a coup d'etat," he said dismissively. "How am I going to be a caudillo when I am subject to the rules of a system?"
Yet fears that Mr. Chavez plans to ignore the restraints of traditional politics were fanned in mid-March, after he said that he and his supporters would "take to the streets" if the Supreme Court did not allow him to organize the constituent assembly as he wanted. But when the court ruled against him, Mr. Chavez accepted the decision and has tried to make his decree conform to the court ruling.
"The danger is that Chavez could come to believe himself that his relation with the people is like that of a strongman with the masses, like that of Il Duce, Der Fuhrer, El Comandante or the Secretary General of the Party," said Teodoro Petkoff, a former guerrilla leader and a former Minister of Planning. "This kind of primitive conception, which disdains and demonizes political parties or any other intermediary between the population and those in power, could develop from this singular relationship he has created with a good part of the poor population of the country."
Thus far, though, "Chavez has acted as a restraining wall to those around him who have authoritarian impulses, whether they are military men or from the old left," Mr. Petkoff continued. "I think he is finding he has the temperament and a taste for the political game and that he is learning it quickly."
Mr. Chavez's hand has clearly been strengthened by the disrepute that clings to the political parties that have governed Venezuela since the collapse of a military dictatorship in 1958. As ordinary Venezuelans see it, poll after poll has indicated, the country's political elite has either squandered or pocketed billions of dollars of oil revenues that should have been used to make the country and its people rich.
"Chavez's origins are those of the avenger, the instrument the Venezuelan people use to debit the account of the political class that has dominated this country for 40 years," said Alcibiades Castro, leader of the congressional delegation of Copei, the more conservative of the country's two traditional parties. "Notwithstanding the election, not everyone in the parties are fully aware of this, and so our very identities and viability are at stake here."
Traditional politicians may wince at the frankness of some of Mr. Chavez's more colorful or incendiary observations, but most people appear to like what they hear. He was elected with 57 percent of the vote, but recent polls indicate that his support has soared since taking office.
Several gestures intended to demonstrate that the country is in crisis have been particularly well received: Mr. Chavez has refused to accept his $1,200 a month official salary, donating it to a scholarship fund and saying he can live well enough on his military pension, and he has also dispensed with use of a limousine and other traditional perquisites of power.
"Chavez is of the people, with humble origins," said Eduardo Beltran, 29, a security guard at a downtown building. "When have you ever seen a President of this country stop his limousine to get out and talk to the poor? He is a second Bolivar, just the President Venezuela needs."
Indeed, Mr. Chavez's humble start as the child of two schoolteachers is one of his strongest selling points. Eustoquio Duque Castro, a retired military officer, was stationed in Mr. Chavez's hometown, Sabaneta, when the President was a boy, and remembered him selling fruit and ices outside the barracks after school every afternoon before running off to baseball practice.
A left-handed pitcher, Mr. Chavez "could do it all, hit, field, run and pitch, but couldn't afford the equipment he needed," Mr. Duque remembered. As a teen-ager, Mr. Chavez was such a standout that the army recruited him for its team. But an arm injury sidelined him and ended his dreams of a big league career.
"I never thought he could be President, but I voted for him, and I don't regret it," Mr. Duque, 66, said. "I have faith in him. With a young President who wants to work hard, the country is already more animated and disciplined."
After a rocky start caused by his populist declarations and flirtation with Fidel Castro, his relations with Washington also have improved. Mr. Chavez was for many years denied a visa to the United States because of the 1992 coup attempt, but that ban was lifted after his resounding election victory. He has already visited Washington twice.
"We are behind him so long as he remains within constitutional parameters for reforming the country," Peter Romero, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, said on a recent visit.
Mr. Chavez said he was acutely aware that all of his words and actions were being dissected here and in the rest of Latin America, where he is seen as an alarming throwback to the age of the strongman. But he said he welcomed the scrutiny, and invited skeptics to "analyze with objectivity the truth of what is taking place here."
"If they want to know where we are going, then let them watch us, with satellites or lenses, from near or from far, and observe our tracks," he said. "We are heading toward the light, toward the open horizon, gradually building a true democracy, and not towards the darkness of the jungle."

Long Mandibles, Sleek Carapace. A Steal at $300.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 9

 BODY:
Yumiko Tanuma held the 3 1/4-inch-long beetle in her hand, tried not to think of it as an overgrown cockroach and stroked it gently.
"It's kind of cute," she pronounced, smiling tenderly as it waved its pincers. 
 And it should be cute, considering its price. The beetle sells for about $300 at the Tobu Department Store where Miss Tanuma works.
The sad thing for Japan's many beetle owners, though, is that 5 or 10 years ago it might have sold for $6,000 or more. The plunge in beetle prices has been catastrophic, wiping out the value of used bugs that were once worth more than used cars.
Everybody knows about the tumble in value of Japanese real estate and financial assets like stocks. But it is not just office towers and bank shares that have lost value over the last decade. Almost every Japanese investment seems to have dropped in price, from antique porcelain to racehorses -- and especially ohkuwagata, the giant stag beetles that generations of Japanese have hunted and raised as pets.
For many Americans, it may be hard to understand the attraction of buying large black bugs that try to pinch their owners. The typical impulse on seeing an ohkuwagata would be to shriek and run.
"People who don't know bugs might say they look like cockroaches," conceded Katsutoshi Misaki, the insect salesman at Tobu Department Store. "But they have different personalities -- this one is shy, that one is more aggressive and so on."
"When I raise it and hold it in my hand," Mr. Misaki added, "I feel real affection for it."
Japanese have had a passion for insects for more than 1,000 years, collecting crickets and various kinds of beetles and going out at night to spend hours admiring fireflies and collecting them. Foreigners visiting rural areas are sometimes startled to be dragged out through the fields at night for firefly-watching and disquisitions on the merits of various species of fireflies and crickets.
Young Japanese have a special fondness for collecting beetles. The rarest kind are ohkuwagata (Japanese is a far richer language for beetles than English), a variety of stag beetle that hides in rotten logs in remote mountains and is extremely difficult to find. Thus in the "bubble economy" of the 1980's they became a valuable commodity, and department stores began to sell them at prices that until the early 1990's reached $7,000 for a single insect.
One breeder says that six years ago a huge and superb ohkuwagata sold for $30,000.
The collapse of the stock and property markets made people poorer and hurt prices, but market forces were also at work to increase supply and pop Japan's bug bubble. Most important, insect specialists figured out how to breed ohkuwagata.
Supply soared, and prices slumped catastrophically. Many department stores stopped selling insects, and beetles lost some of their cachet. These days almost all ohkuwagata come from breeders, and most specimens sell for less than $100 apiece.
"The increase in supply will continue, because of the breeding," said Kikuo Iwaguchi, an entomologist at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. "I think prices will go down, down, down."
In 10 years, he said, small ohkuwagata might sell for less than $5.
Another factor has been the gray market in imported beetles. Ohkuwagata also live elsewhere in Asia, and when Japanese ohkuwagata were selling at outlandish prices, travelers began to smuggle foreign ones in. One advantage of the foreign ohkuwagata is that they stay active year-round, while Japanese ohkuwagata hibernate several months -- a practice that seems a bit self-indulgent for a pet that costs thousands.
Importing foreign beetles is illegal, but selling those that are already in Japan is of uncertain legality. In any case, the imports began to trade hands and depressed the market just as it was collapsing anyway.
"Smugglers would put threads on their ohkuwagata and tie them up, and then put them in with their souvenirs," said Daiichiro Koseki, a breeder. "Or they put them inside their clothes."
One might suspect that Japan is using the ban on beetle imports to protect its own bug market, just as it curtails rice imports to protect its rice industry. The Japanese insect industry denies this.
"It's not protectionism," said Hiroshi Fujita, editor of Gekkan Mushi, which translates roughly as Bugs Monthly. "It's to protect ecology, because the fear is that the foreign beetles would disrupt Japan's environment."
Mr. Fujita also said that the ohkuwagata market was too small for Japanese bureaucrats to worry about. The whole market in Japan for insects and accessories, he said, has annual sales in the tens of millions of dollars, although some estimates run into the billions.
While the bug market is now severely depressed, Tobu Department Store still has one pair of ohkuwagata priced at $12,500. They have white eyes, a rarity, but so far there have been no takers.
While some other kinds of beetles live a year or less, ohkuwagata live for four or five years, so owners have some time to enjoy their pets. And the bugs do not fly much, so an investment is unlikely to disappear out the window. But of course owners have to look where they step.
"You've got to watch them when you take them out for a walk," said Mr. Misaki, the insect salesman, with a nod to his $12,500 beetle duo. "Otherwise, they could run away and disappear."

HEADLINE: Don't Let Libya Off the Hook

BYLINE: By Paul Hudson; Paul Hudson is a lawyer. He lost his daughter Melina in the Pan Am 103 bombing.

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
Although Libya has finally handed over two suspects charged with planting the bomb that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland more than a decade ago, the United States should not assume that full justice is being done.
President Clinton, like Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush before him, has said that there can be no safe haven for terrorists -- not even for government officials engaged in state-sponsored terrorism. But some American officials are now arguing that we should be satisfied with prosecuting two low-level operatives in a conspiracy that probably involved other officials in Libya and perhaps even Iran. 
 Now that the United Nations has removed sanctions against Libya because the two suspects have been delivered to the Netherlands for trial, some American companies are lobbying for the removal of United States sanctions -- the very sanctions that helped persuade Libya to turn over the suspects. Moreover, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has reportedly pledged that the trial will not be used to "destabilize" Libya. Whether that means that higher-level officials in the Government will not be prosecuted is open to interpretation.
So many concessions have been given to Libya to bring these suspects to justice, I can only wonder what kind of justice it will really be.
International law says that when agents of a government murder citizens of another country, the agents' government is liable for their actions -- even if they abused their authority. Countries are sometimes required to pay compensation to the families of the murdered people, and even reparations to the government of the victims' nation.
The two Libyan suspects in the Pan Am 103 case were chief of security for the Libyan national airline and an employee of the airline in Malta. They are also suspected of being representatives of the Libyan agency for state-sponsored terrorism known as the External Security Organization.
According to a white paper by the American State Department, the Libyan Government also financed, planned or committed dozens of other acts of terrorism against citizens of the United States and other Western nations in the 1980's.
Representatives of the Libyan Government, including the brother-in-law of Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, have been charged by French courts with blowing up a French UTA jet over Niger in 1989, killing all 171 on board, including six Americans and the wife of the United States Ambassador to Chad.
The investigation of Pan Am 103, the sanctions by the United Nations and United States, and the implicit threat of American military retribution have no doubt prevented and deterred many other terrorist attacks over the past decade. However, the United States must do more to really end the threat of state-sponsored terrorism. It must continue its criminal investigations of Pan Am 103 and other cases of terrorism to obtain the evidence needed to indict any higher-level Libyan officials responsible. Should any new evidence against other suspects come out in the trial in the Netherlands, we should pursue these leads to their fullest.
America has the world's best intelligence agencies, along with witness protection programs and many new Federal Bureau of Investigation field offices in foreign countries. All of these resources can be used to shed more light on the Pan Am 103 case as well as other major terrorist cases.
In addition, the families of Pan Am victims have 150 civil cases now pending in the American court system against Libya, its airline and its agents. If these cases succeed in getting punitive damages, it would not only punish those responsible for the bombing, but may help deter other such acts in the future. Mr. Qaddafi and his henchmen would like immunity from American criminal and civil courts, as well as from international tribunals. They must not get it.
The courts must go wherever the evidence leads. No person or government should be able to get away with mass murder merely by giving up the lowest-level players, paying minimal compensation and allowing the passage of time and economic pressure to absolve them of responsibility.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Council Plan on Arts Alters Routine Budget Battle

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
It is one of the most predictable sequences in the annual budget theatrics at City Hall: Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani slashes funding for museums and other cultural institutions, and the City Council rushes to restore the lost money.
But the Council wants to change the routine, and it has proposed a plan this year that has sent cultural groups into conniptions. For the first time in recent memory, its members have vowed not to restore the $17.9 million in cuts to the Department of Cultural Affairs that Mr. Giuliani tucked into his preliminary budget. Council members said they are tired of using a precious bargaining chip to win back funds for groups they describe as unappreciative. 
 Not only that, but Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone wants to overhaul the way that the city funds cultural institutions, using revenues from the hotel tax to create a pool of money that would be split between arts programs and -- here is the rub -- stadium construction. Mr. Vallone would replace the Department of Cultural Affairs with a commission appointed by the Mayor and the Council, whose members would divide the annual hotel tax revenues between arts and sports.
Mr. Vallone insists the plan would benefit cultural institutions by providing them with a reliable source of funding that would be protected from the Mayor's budget knife. But at a time when Mr. Giuliani has proposed building a sports complex on the West Side of Manhattan and several smaller stadiums around the city, arts groups fear they would get only a tiny portion of the revenues.
"With all the stadium fever that is going on right now, I am very afraid the arts will get shortchanged," said Kathy Giaimo, administrative director of the Thalia Spanish Theater in Queens, which gets about 10 percent of its $429,000 annual budget from the city. "We shouldn't be lumped together with sports, because we are two very different things."
But Council leaders said such fears were unwarranted, because the arts would receive at least half of the annual hotel tax revenues. Their proposal, which Mr. Giuliani will consider before presenting his final budget plan later this month, would devote $150 million in hotel tax revenues to stadium construction and the arts in the 2001 fiscal year. The amount would increase to $200 million in 2002, and by 2003, all hotel tax revenues -- about $230 million a year -- would be divided between sports and the arts.
Even if the city built a stadium on the West Side for $1 billion, Council leaders said, the debt service would cost only about $90 million a year, leaving the bulk of hotel tax revenues for the arts.
"We would structure it to insure that it's an enhancement for cultural affairs and never a cutback," Mr. Vallone said. "It will no longer be discretionary on the part of any mayor whether we pay for our cultural institutions."
While Council leaders are couching the proposal as a means of protecting dozens of museums, theaters and dance groups, its other purpose -- giving the Council more control over future stadium construction -- is more politically significant. Mr. Giuliani's proposal last year to build the Yankees a new stadium in Manhattan using tax dollars infuriated Mr. Vallone, who tried to stop the plan with a referendum.
Although the Giuliani administration ultimately blocked the referendum in court, it won widespread praise for Mr. Vallone, who vowed that the Council would have a voice in any future stadium planning.
With his proposal, Mr. Vallone is trying to thwart Mr. Giuliani's own plan for stadium construction, which would use $900 million in revenues from the commercial rent tax over the next four years. Mr. Vallone has called for eliminating that tax.
"The Council recognizes the need to support professional sports teams," said Thomas L. McMahon, the Council's finance director. "But we believe the amount of dedicated revenue should be more modest and should also address the needs of the arts community, one of our largest economic engines."
Arts advocates said the plan seemed well-intentioned, but predicted that the Mayor and the Council would still use cultural institutions as political pawns in budget battles -- this time, over how much to spend on stadium construction. While they praised the Speaker for trying to find a steady source of funds for the arts, they bristled at the thought of being linked with sports.
"We have entirely different missions," said Andrew Ackerman, executive director of the Children's Museum of Manhattan, whose $3 million annual budget includes about $200,000 in city funds. "Getting rid of the Department of Cultural Affairs and tying us with sports would dilute the uniqueness of what cultural organizations bring to the city."
Others said they were even more vexed by the Council's plan to not restore the funds that Mr. Giuliani intends to cut from the $102.4 million cultural affairs budget this year. The Mayor has proposed a 13 percent reduction in city funds for large cultural institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and a 65 percent reduction for smaller arts groups, like the Thalia Spanish Theater. Those groups, many of which are outside Manhattan, tend to rely more heavily on private donations than city funds, so most would not be devastated by the cuts.
But neighborhood theater groups might have to reduce the number of plays they produce, small galleries could be forced to reduce their staffs and dance groups might have to cut back the performances they do in public schools, arts advocates said.
"I can understand the Council's frustration with the Mayor about funding us, but I don't think this is the way to go," said Ms. Giaimo of the Thalia Spanish Theater. "It's putting a lot at stake."

HEADLINE: Niger Leader Assassinated, Apparently By His Guards

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: NIAMEY, Niger, April 9

 BODY:
President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara was killed today, the Government announced. Police officials and witnesses said Mr. Mainassara had been ambushed at Niamey airport by dissident soldiers.
In Washington, the State Department said Mr. Mainassara had been assassinated by members of the presidential guard but did not disclose the source of the information. 
 In a broadcast on state radio, Prime Minister Ibrahim Assane Mayaki said only that Mr. Mainassara had been killed in an "unfortunate accident." He went on to announce the dissolution of Parliament and the suspension of political activity.
Although Mr. Mayaki said the present administration would continue in office until a national unity government took over, it was unclear who was really in charge. Troops were guarding the presidential palace, the airport and top ministries.
Witnesses and police officials at the airport said the ambush took place as Mr. Mainassara was preparing to travel to the interior. Some members of the President's security staff were critically wounded in the attack, they said.
Earlier today, troops with tanks moved into the streets, blocking access to the presidential palace and other important locations.
It was unclear if the assassination was part of an attempted coup, and, if so, what had happened to the perpetrators.
Mr. Mainassara, 49, a former army chief, ended Niger's first attempt at multiparty democracy with a coup in January 1996 that toppled an elected Government. Since winning a disputed presidential election in July of that year, he had faced relentless pressure from an opposition spearheaded largely by leaders of the civilian Government he overthrew.
Friday's events came after a week of mounting political tension over local elections in February. On Thursday, the opposition called for President Mainassara's resignation following a Supreme Court order for a recount in most districts.
Niger, a poor, largely arid nation in West Africa that gained independence from France in 1960, experienced decades of single-party civilian or military rule, before moving toward true multiparty politics in 1990.
In 1993, Mahamane Ousmane became Niger's first democratically elected President in elections that were hailed then as a rare example of a peaceful transition to democracy in Africa.
The country enjoyed a minor economic boom based on uranium production in the 1970's but drought and a slump in world uranium prices in the 1980's took their toll.

HEADLINE: Shipyard Strikers Demand 'Justice'

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: NEWPORT NEWS, Va., April 9

 BODY:
As Marvin Lowrie, a 52-year-old machinist, walked the picket line outside the giant shipyard here, there was pride laced with bitterness when he talked, pride that his shipyard produces the world's most sophisticated nuclear aircraft carriers.
But Mr. Lowrie, who constructs intricate piping systems for the carriers, voiced unmistakable bitterness that after 27 years on the job making ships essential to the nation's defense, he was still earning less than $30,000 a year. 
 Seething about what they called stingy wages and pensions, Mr. Lowrie and more than 8,000 other workers at Newport News Shipbuilding went on strike after their contract expired on Monday in one of the largest walkouts this decade.
"The people here are world-class shipbuilders, yet they get paid peanuts," Mr. Lowrie said.
To Mr. Lowrie, the dispute is not about whether workers get a 14 percent raise or a 22 percent raise, but about economic justice, about whether workers share in the fruits of economic prosperity. The strikers, members of the United Steelworkers of America, demand that the shipyard reward them after they helped nurse it back to financial health by agreeing to a 50-month wage freeze in their last contract. After losing money in 1997, the company earned $66 million in 1998 -- not enough, company officials say, to award the large raises sought by the union.
"Now that the company has had a big turnaround and has a tremendous backlog of work, we want to get our fair share of the pie," Mr. Lowrie said, adding that his annual pay was proving to be a particular hardship now that it cost $9,800 a year to send his 21-year-old son to college.
Unlike many other strikes in their early days, this one does not appear to be shadowboxing. Both sides are digging in, with neither asking the other to return to the bargaining table for fear that it would look as if it blinked first. The shipyard insists it has made its final offer, while the union, steel workers Local 8888, has begun determining who among its strikers will need the most financial assistance to endure a long walkout.
"We realize there is every chance that this could be a lengthy strike," said Alfred Little Jr., the shipyard's vice president of human resources. "I think it could be months, but I hope not."
For now, the workers are in a festive mood, excited by a sense of solidarity while not yet feeling squeezed by weeks without paychecks.
"We're in the honeymoon phase," said Jan Hooks, a crane operator for 23 years whose big complaint is that when she retires in five years her pension will be about $400 a month, not enough to cover her rent.
Today, in groups of 5, 20 and 50, the workers picketed in front of 10 gates at a shipyard that stretches for two-and-a-half miles along the water. Beyond the gates were gigantic, 1,100-foot-long, 90,000-ton aircraft carriers under construction or undergoing nuclear refueling.
In front of company headquarters, an austere brick building, 20 strikers, watched by nine police officers, sang variations of a labor anthem with verses that included, "We build first-class ships. We shall not be moved," and "We want a contract. We shall not be moved."
Shipyard officials insist they have made a generous offer that will increase pensions by at least 10 percent and raise wages by 18 percent over 47 months for most workers.
"This new offer essentially makes our top-rated mechanics the highest paid in the industry when you take into account regional differences in the cost of living," said Jerri Fuller Dickseski, the shipyard's spokeswoman.
The two sides in strikes often see differing realities, and that is certainly the case here.
"Their offer is insulting," said Randolph Deloatch, a stocky 46-year-old who installs and removes nuclear fuel from the carriers.
While company officials hail their proposed 18-percent increase as generous for four years, union members called it ridiculous, saying it would translate into 18 percent over 10 years -- or less than 2 percent a year -- since the workers have not received an across-the-board raise since December 1993.
Dave Meredith, 37, another nuclear fueling worker, noted that one full-time colleague in his highly skilled department earned so little that he qualified for a welfare program to help feed his children. Mr. Meredith also criticized the shipyard for paying him only $12.59 an hour, even though his job is dangerous and demanding, while workers at a nearby Anheuser-Busch brewery earn more than $20 an hour.
"I'm glad for them, but I'm not sure what they do is as important for the national interest," he said. "There's real suffering going on here. It's tearing families apart. A lot of this is being precipitated by a lack of money."
As for the proposed pension increase of more than 10 percent, Arnold Outlaw, Local 8888's president, termed it paltry, saying it would be an increase from a small base -- most recent retirees receive less than $500 each month.
"The way things are, retirees can't even afford to bury themselves after they die," Mr. Outlaw said.
Mr. Little, the vice president, said management's overall pay proposal was the most generous made by any shipyard in years. He also said that the improvements in wages and pensions would make the shipyard the second-best-paying in the nation, behind only Electric Boat in Groton, Conn., where the cost of living is significantly higher.
Mr. Little warned that it would be unwise for the union to push for too steep a raise. The union's proposals amounted to a 35 percent increase, he said, and might push the shipyard into the red and persuade the Pentagon to turn to lower-cost suppliers. He also said the union was wrong to think the shipyard was highly profitable.
"We're on our way to doing better," Mr. Little said, "but there's certainly room to do better than this.
"We're always under a tremendous amount of pressure from the Navy to reduce costs. If we're to continue to get more work in the years, we have to make sure our cost structure doesn't get out of whack. If that happens, we all suffer."
Mr. Outlaw, the union president, said one reason for the strike was that far more shipyard workers belonged to the union than was the case two years ago -- more than 80 percent of the 9,200 hourly workers have joined, up from about 50 percent in 1997.
Workers at unionized companies in Virginia are not required to join the union or pay dues. In theory, the more workers belonging to the union, the fewer will cross the picket line, enabling the union to put more pressure on the company. Pointing out that the colossal cranes at the shipyard were dead still, Mr. Outlaw said the company had largely been shut down, helped by the teamsters' decision to honor the picket line.
Mr. Little voiced optimism that the shipyard could endure a long strike.
"The work is going to continue," he said, "but at a much lower level. It will grow as time goes on."
But William Rollins, a striking mechanic, said, "They're looking to break us and have us run back into the yard. But there's so much unity this year. We have the heart of the shipyard out in the streets. Without the heart, they have nothing to run the yard with."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: IN RUSSIA;
'Don't Push Us,' Yeltsin Warns West On Balkans

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 9

 BODY:
No, President Boris N. Yeltsin did not order Russian nuclear missiles to be targeted at NATO countries taking part in the bombing of Yugoslavia. Nor did he formally endorse the joining together of Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia in a geographically awkward Slavic union.
But at a meeting today with Gennadi Seleznyov, the Communist who is the Speaker of the Russian Parliament's lower house, he unmistakably warned the West not to push Russia into another war in the Balkans. 
 "I told NATO, the Americans, the Germans, don't push us toward military action," he said, speaking before television cameras. "Otherwise there will be a European war for sure, and possibly a world war. We are against this."
It took the Kremlin the better part of the day today to clarify exactly what Mr. Yeltsin said and did not say in his Seleznyov meeting. As he emerged from the session with Mr. Yeltsin this morning, the Speaker sent out the alarming report that Russia would be targeting NATO states with nuclear warheads, touching off an intense flurry of diplomatic activity in Western capitals.
By midafternoon top Russian officials were issuing denials. "As far as we know in the Foreign Ministry, no orders concerning missiles have been issued." said Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov.
Mr. Seleznyov also appears to have overstated the President's support for a union among Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia, an idea pushed by the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, as a way of shoring up Moscow's support for Belgrade. According to remarks televised tonight, Mr. Yeltsin told Mr. Seleznyov that the proposal should be studied.
A union between Russian and Belarus is already under negotiation, but as the proposal now stands, its main purpose is to standardize economic relations between the two countries, without any provision for military or security agreements.
As the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri Yakushkin, noted, including Yugoslavia in such a union would involve several "extremely complicated and delicate" questions that would take months to resolve.
Mr. Yeltsin has repeatedly pledged to keep Russia out of any military involvement in Yugoslavia, a promise that the United States and its allies said today had been reaffirmed through diplomatic contacts. But Russia's harsh denunciations of the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia, and vague threats to adjust its military doctrine, have raised enough concern to prompt a meeting next week in Oslo between Mr. Ivanov and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
In other remarks today, Mr. Yeltsin set down further markers on future NATO policy in the Balkans. "They want to use ground troops, take over Yugoslavia, make it their protectorate," he said. "We cannot allow this. Russia and the access to the Mediterranean Sea are nearby, so we can by no means give Yugoslavia away."
Russia last week sent a reconnaissance ship from its Black Sea fleet towards the Adriatic Sea to monitor NATO's activities off the coast of Yugoslavia. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said Russia had notified Turkey that as many as eight more ships might pass through the Bosporus, with sailing dates staggered between April 12 and 16. But so far, Moscow has not announced a decision to send any of those vessels.
The Yeltsin administration, with its tough cold-war-style oratory, has so far managed to stay abreast of the wave of anti-American feeling that has swept Russia. But as the NATO bombing continues, limiting Russia's opposition to just words may prove increasingly difficult.
By a vote of 279 to 30, the Communist-led lower house of Parliament demanded last Wednesday that the Government send military aid and advisers to Yugoslavia, in violation of United Nations sanctions against Belgrade.
The war in Yugoslavia has added new tensions to Russia's already overheated domestic political struggle. Mr. Yeltsin's Communist opponents, emboldened by the anti-Western mood, have been pressing an impeachment vote against the President, now scheduled for debate on Thursday.
The political atmosphere has been further sullied by an unresolved clash over the future of Russia's chief prosecutor, Yuri I. Skuratov. His dismissal by Mr. Yeltsin, for a second time, has opened up a Pandora's box of charges and countercharges of corruption and misconduct that have threatened to taint members of the President's inner circle.
In a week marked by alarmist reports that the Kremlin is setting the stage for a dramatic showdown with Parliament, Mr. Yeltsin today said publicly that he had no plans to dismiss Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov or to ban the Communist Party.
Nor, he told a meeting of governors, will he support any plans -- like one proposed recently by Mr. Primakov -- to eliminate the direct elections of Russia's regional leaders.
But Mr. Yeltsin gave only lukewarm support to Mr. Primakov and dropped strong hints that a Cabinet shuffle might be in the works. "At this stage, Yevgeny Primakov is useful to us," he told the governors. "Later we will see. On the other hand, the Cabinet does need reinforcement."
Several prominent members of the Communist Party are ministers in the Primakov Government, and in a recent interview, the Prime Minister confirmed reports that he had given his Communist allies a pledge that he would resign before agreeing to dismiss any of their top ministers.
The former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who met this week with Mr. Yeltsin, said in an interview published in Izvestia that he would support changes in the Cabinet. "I wonder why reaction to all this has become so painful," he said. "I changed three Cabinets, and no one reacted so painfully to that."

HEADLINE: U.S. Tells Albany to Aid Failing Hospitals

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
In a strongly worded letter, a Federal agency has warned the Pataki administration that many of the state's most financially troubled hospitals will go bankrupt or default on their loans unless the state does more to help them.
The letter from the Department of Housing and Urban Development calls on the Pataki administration to expand the use of a state-controlled fund that can be tapped to aid struggling hospitals. The letter was sent on Wednesday to Gail H. Gordon, chairwoman of the State Dormitory Authority, which administers the hospital fund. 
 The letter also accused state officials of generally dragging their feet in assisting troubled hospitals, and cautioned that more hospitals will be in danger of failing if the state does not act faster and more forcefully.
"By dragging things out, it is making the situation worse," William C. Apgar, Assistant Secretary for Housing and author of the letter, said in an interview today. The Housing Department issued the letter because it insures state bonds that finance hospital construction and repairs.
Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the State Dormitory Authority, said Mr. Apgar's letter was "riddled with errors" and accused him of playing politics. She said the state had been monitoring its financially troubled hospitals and did not expect that any of them would default on their loans.
Gov. George E. Pataki is a Republican, while the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Andrew Cuomo, is a Democrat. In 1994, Mr. Pataki unseated Mr. Cuomo's father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Housing Department officials denied that there was any political motive behind their letter, which comes during a fierce dispute between the Pataki administration and hospital executives over the economic well-being of the industry.
Hospital officials contend that cuts in government aid, an increase in the number of uninsured patients and the expansion of managed care have hurt many hospitals. Some have cut budgets and laid off workers while others are in danger of closing, the officials have warned.
Both Governor Pataki and the Clinton Administration have recently proposed additional reductions in government-financed health care programs.
The Pataki administration contends that the hospitals are generally in sound financial shape and should be able to handle new reductions. In January, the state's Health Department released a report, based on 1997 data, showing that hospitals had a 42 percent increase in net profits over the previous year.
Part of that increase appears to result from a change in accounting rules that made hospital revenues look larger than they were.
The head of a major hospital trade association asserted today that the Housing Department's letter showed that the Federal Government agrees with industry officials that many hospitals are in dire financial condition.
"There's a ton of cash that needs to be pumped into these places, and nobody has it," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. "The Pataki administration is not recognizing that they are sitting on a time bomb."
The hospital industry has joined forces with unions representing health care workers to lobby legislators in Albany to oppose Mr. Pataki's proposed cuts in Medicaid, the government health care program for the poor.
The industry is also pushing in Washington for greater Federal spending on Medicare, the government health care program for the elderly and the disabled.
Mr. Apgar said that the state had fallen $325,000 short of a pledge to provide $800,000 to help struggling Lockport Hospital, near Buffalo, repay federally backed loans.
Ms. Hutton said the state planned to send the final installment of money to the hospital once it developed a plan for getting out of debt.
Mr. Apgar also said that the state had lagged in assisting two other struggling hospitals, Flushing Hospital Medical Center in Queens and Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. He said the state should be using a special pool of money more aggressively to help those hospitals pay their debt service. The restructuring pool, as it is known, is financed through hospital taxes and is intended to help hospitals become more competitive.
Mr. Apgar also asserted that several other hospitals, including Union Hospital of the Bronx and Victory Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn were financially ailing and may need state assistance to avoid bankruptcy.
"If the Lockport experience is a portent of the future, there's trouble brewing," Mr. Apgar said in the interview.
But Ms. Hutton said there was too little money in the fund to start helping every ailing hospital pay back its debt service. She said it was up to the Legislature to provide more money to do that.
"HUD is trying to insert itself into New York policy making," she said. "It's just plain wrong."

HEADLINE: Rally to Promote Port Leases Widens Gap Between States

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
In a sign of the escalating tensions between the governors of New York and New Jersey, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman plans to go to the World Trade Center on Monday for a union rally intended to push the two states to stop squabbling and sign leases with two of the largest shipping lines in New York Harbor.
Gov. George E. Pataki of New York plans to be in Albany, his spokesman said. 
 The battling between the governors has brought to a standstill the protracted negotiations between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the two companies, Sea-Land Service and Maersk Line, which together account for billions of dollars of cargo business in New York Harbor, 1,000 jobs and a payroll of $100 million. The matter has taken on increasing urgency because Sea-Land and Maersk have given the Port Authority until 5 P.M. Tuesday to deliver its long-promised final lease offer.
If the deadline is not met, many officials in New Jersey and New York, maritime executives and the longshoremen's union fear that Sea-Land and Maersk will make good on their threat to move to Baltimore, which continues to sweeten its offer to build a new hub terminal for the two companies. Sea-Land's lease at the Elizabeth Marine Terminal in New Jersey expired in February, and Maersk's leases expire over the next 14 months.
"My people are very frightened by what's going on," said John Bowers, president of the International Longshoremen's Association, which called for the rally. "I invited Governors Whitman and Pataki to meet my membership and explain to them why their jobs and livelihoods are being used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations between the states."
The terms of the leases with the shipping companies have become ensnared in a heated debate over the distribution of projects and revenues by the Port Authority. The Whitman administration has been eager to finish negotiations with the shipping lines, but Governor Pataki and his chief negotiator, Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority, see the lease negotiations as their best opportunity to gain what they contend would be a more equitable distribution of agency resources.
Assemblywoman Joan L. Millman, whose district includes parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island, said that although she shares some of the Pataki administration's concerns about the Port Authority, she felt the departure of Sea-Land and Maersk could prompt other maritime businesses to leave New York Harbor.
"This could be a really big blow to us," Ms. Millman said. "If these two giants leave, is anyone else going to stay?"
Not only is Governor Pataki not planning to attend the rally, his administration had also tried to persuade the union to abandon its plans, one state official said.
"The Governor's in Albany on Monday," said Mr. Pataki's spokesman, Michael McKeon. "We're ready to negotiate, but we also want to protect our interests. The place to get that done is at the table."
New Jersey officials have said that the Pataki administration has failed to recognize the importance of the port, a $20-billion-a-year maritime industry. The 166,500 jobs in the port are about evenly split between New York and New Jersey.
"It's unfortunate if he chooses not to go to the rally," said Joan Verplanck, president of the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce. "It's the mark of a coward. It's pretty easy to hide in Albany."
It does not appear that either side is willing to give in. Mr. Gargano met briefly yesterday with Louis Eisenberg, chairman of the Port Authority, who is Governor Whitman's principal negotiator. According to officials from both states, New York has demanded that New Jersey agree to restructure the Port Authority, separating New York airports and other sites from those in New Jersey, while leaving the Interstate bridges and tunnels under the agency's control.
Mr. Gargano has also demanded that the agency set up a $400 million "balancing bank" for New York projects, to offset investments in the Elizabeth Marine Terminal. The Whitman administration has agreed to $250 million.
"There are still fairly significant differences," said one official from New Jersey who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Whitman said she won't agree to their ultimatum on restructuring as a way to getting the Sea-Land-Maersk deal done."
Although no meetings were scheduled, officials in both states expected negotiations to continue this weekend.
According to the Port Authority, the agency has invested $5.05 billion in capital projects in New York over the last 15 years, compared with $4.8 billion in New Jersey. New York, however, contends that revenues from projects are used to offset nearly $250 million in operating subsidies for the PATH trains and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, both of which the Pataki administration contends should be New Jersey's responsibility.
It is far from certain that these wide-ranging issues can be resolved in time to provide Sea-Land and Maersk with the terms for new leases. The dispute has come to a head as the Port Authority is predicting that port business could triple over the next 20 years.
It is further complicated by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's disputes with both Governor Pataki and the Port Authority.
"You've got three different poles on this, which is making everything worse," said Elliott Sclar, professor of urban planning and economics at Columbia University. "The political wrangling between these three ambitious Republican politicians obscures the facts. The container port is in New Jersey. On the other hand, the entire port is vital to New York and the region's status as a distribution center for the global economy."

HEADLINE: Police Officers Get 250 More Reasons to Live in the City

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
Hoping to persuade more New York police officers to live in the city, the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development plans to offer about 250 houses at half price to law enforcement personnel who agree to live in them for at least three years, Federal officials announced yesterday.
The houses, which the Government acquires through foreclosure on HUD-financed mortgages, are scattered in 54 so-called distressed neighborhoods in all five boroughs, from University Heights in the Bronx to Stapleton on Staten Island. Police officers will also be eligible for a 20 percent discount -- up to $2,000 -- on a HUD-insured mortgage or home improvement loan on the properties. 
 "This is not an abstract concept, this is not a theoretical or rhetorical plan, this is a real initiative that will make an impact on the ground," the Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Andrew M. Cuomo, said at a news conference in lower Manhattan yesterday morning. "This is a win-win, a real incentive package to bring police officers into the communities that really need them."
The initiative comes amid renewed focus on the question of whether police officers should be required to live in the city where they work in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo two months ago. Two of the four officers who were indicted on charges of second-degree murder for killing Mr. Diallo in a hail of 41 bullets live in the city, and two live on Long Island. A residency requirement, or an incentive program like HUD's, has been a central demand of those outraged over the shooting.
Overall, 54 percent of New York Police Department officers live in the five boroughs, down from 60 percent a decade ago. A residency requirement would require a change in state law, which is considered a political impossibility, but Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced recently that they would try to persuade officers to live in the city with offers of financial and other bonuses.
The Federal plan announced yesterday is an expansion of the two-year-old Officer Next Door program, in which police officers nationwide can buy HUD properties for half their market value. So far, New York has been just a bit player in the Federal program, with about 70 houses bought by city officers. Nationwide, 2,700 police officers have bought HUD houses under the program, which the department promotes as a way to stabilize troubled neighborhoods. In New York, the program is available to members of all law enforcement agencies except for corrections officers.
Officer Nefer Simon, who has been on the New York force for nearly seven years, paid $60,000 for a HUD house in South Ozone Park, Queens, on Feb. 4 and plans to move in by month's end. Officer Simon, who does background investigations on recruits, grew up in Brooklyn and will be leaving her co-op in the Clinton Hill section of that borough. She said it was the price that lured her.
"My rent was up so high, I was like, 'Oh, my goodness.' When this came up, I was like, 'Wow, I'll be paying cheaper in mortgage than I am in rent,' so I jumped on this idea," said Officer Simon, 28, who is married with two children. "It was a good deal, basically to get a house practically with no money down."
Organizers of the program, and community groups that support it, say police officers can help stabilize troubled neighborhoods by living in them, because the officers serve as role models for children and add security. City residency also helps officers understand the communities they work in, experts say.
With her kitchen and bathroom being remodeled, Officer Simon and her aunt have already begun to plant a flower garden in the small front yard of the three-bedroom Colonial. She said she had met her neighbors but had not yet mentioned that she was a police officer.
"They were just pleased to have someone move onto the block instead of an abandoned building," Officer Simon explained. "It doesn't seem like a bad neighborhood."
She remains unsure, however, about what her role as an "Officer Next Door" will be. "When you get into a lot of off-duty incidents, the job might not indemnify you, so you're taking a chance," she said. "But if I see something happening in front of me, I don't think I could just stand there and watch."
It has been difficult to lure officers into the program in New York in part because the available houses have so far been in high-crime neighborhoods, officials said. A similar program that gives New York officers free apartments in public housing projects has attracted just 46 people.
But the expansion of the program means that officers will be able to buy houses in the Clinton Hill, Crown Heights and Red Hook sections of Brooklyn; in St. Albans and Jamaica, Queens, and in Harlem, Washington Heights and the Lower East Side in Manhattan.
Marilyn Mode, Mr. Safir's spokeswoman, called the expansion a "great idea" that "certainly parallels what we've been talking about."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: WARY TRAVELERS;
More Americans Canceling Or Delaying European Trips

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
The Balkans conflict and refugee crisis have started to hurt leisure and business travel well beyond the combat zone, with increasing numbers of Americans scrapping or delaying plans to visit Europe during what ordinarily would be one of the best times to go.
Travel agents and tour operators say they have received cancellations not only to Central and Eastern Europe, which is much closer to the conflict, but also to popular destinations like Italy and Greece and as far as Russia and Turkey. 
 Sobered by television coverage of the nightly NATO bombings in Serbia, the misery of Kosovo refugee families and anti-American demonstrations in countries that support President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, would-be American visitors to Europe are deciding to make other plans.
"I have a sister in Bologna, Italy, and we were thinking of visiting her this summer," said Juan Sabalones, the director of animal husbandry at the Newport Aquarium in Newport, Ky. "But as long as there's a war going on, I've decided to keep an eye on things, and it's possible we may not go at all."
Tour operators say they have already noticed a small but unexpected increase in bookings to the Canadian Rockies, South America, Asia and America's national parks, which they attribute to customers' deciding against traveling to Europe.
Peter Tauck, president of Tauck Tours, a big tour operator with headquarters in Westport, Conn., said that while people were still traveling to popular Italian and Greek vacation spots, "we've had cancellations this week, and the pace of bookings is suddenly relatively flat."
As of yesterday, Mr. Tauck said, there were 42 bookings this week for the company's three tours to Italy this year, compared with about 100 bookings for Italy in a normal week this time of year.
Steve Kang, the president of Maupintour, another big tour company, in Lawrence, Kan., said that he had seen little effect on tours to Turkey and Greece, but that "bookings to Italy are unexpectedly slow."
"The only reason I can think of for that is that people see Aviano on CNN, and they know it's a staging area in Italy," he said. Aviano is the site of a NATO air base used in the bombing campaign.
Many tour operators quickly postponed tours through Yugoslavia when the crisis began building last month and detoured trips when NATO began bombing on March 24. But now they are canceling tours months into the future on the assumption that the conflict will last a long time.
Maupintour canceled two 16-day cruises that were scheduled to go from Bucharest to Vienna, through Belgrade and other points in Yugoslavia, departing May 25 and June 2. Regina Tours, which specializes in Roman Catholic pilgrimages,
canceled its monthly 10-day tours to Medjugorje, Bosnia, through the rest of the year.
Even National Geographic, which specializes in relatively adventurous tours, decided to postpone until this fall a tour to Turkey that had been scheduled from April 26 to May 12, and to cancel its Treasures of Russian Waterway, scheduled from May 28 to June 10. While the Russian tour was canceled because of concern over turmoil in the Balkans, the Turkish tour was postponed over concern with recent bombings in the country attributed to Kurdish militants, National Geographic said.
Yesterday, the Association of Corporate Travel Executives issued a "cautionary travel advisory" warning members about traveling not only to danger zones but also to other European cities. "The P.R. campaign waged by Serbian nationalists," said Earl Foster, president of the 2,500-member association, "has led to some violent street protests in cities far from the battle. We're advising our members to alert their travelers to these related situations, specifically with an eye to avoiding them."
While the recent travel disruptions are not at all as widespread as those surrounding the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the travel industry's big concern is that the Balkans conflict could drag on toward summer.
The concern comes at a time when both the American economy and the warming weather make it a particularly good time to visit Europe. The dollar is strong, American incomes are rising, and many people are spending money.
To be sure, the evidence of a potentially serious slowdown in travel to Europe is largely anecdotal. There are still signs that travel to Europe remains little affected by the Balkans conflict.
United States airlines said yesterday that while there had been some cancellations to central and Eastern Europe, on routes flown by their European partners, there had been few cancellations to Western European cities. "April and May bookings are good," said Tim Smith, a spokesman for American Airlines, "and bookings for the summer indicate those months will be strong."
On Monday, Joseph Buhler, the United States chairman of the European Travel Commission, said its member tourist offices in several countries in the immediate region of the hostilities had reported a slowdown in bookings, with scattered cancellations. But overall, he said, members reported "relatively little adverse impact on travel to Europe as a whole due to the fighting in Yugoslavia."
To forestall cancellations, the cruise industry moved quickly to keep out of harm's way. Three Cunard Line ships and two belonging to Seabourn Cruise Lines -- both companies are owned by Carnival Corporation -- substituted stops at Italian ports on the west coast of the Adriatic for the previously scheduled stops at Dubrovnik and other Croatian ports along the eastern Adriatic. Windstar Cruises has substituted stops in Italy for scheduled stops in Dubrovnik and Rab. Holland America's Maasdam replaced Dubrovnik on three European itineraries with stops in Italy and Greece.
"We've only had 15 or 20 cancellations," said Erik Elvejord, a Holland America spokesman, "but we've had a couple of hundred calls from people concerned about those itineraries." He added that bookings were lagging for the 12-day Venice-to-Venice round-trip cruise, scheduled to depart April 19.
Industry officials say the reason the current fighting has not depressed travel as much as during the gulf war, when bookings on United States airlines decreased 44 percent on trans-Atlantic routes in 1991, is that there is little fear of terrorism in connection with the Balkans conflict.
But most travel officials believe that a Balkans-inspired terrorist incident in the West would set off a wave of airline cancellations.
"If this turmoil and the demonstrations continue for a long time, Americans are going to be afraid to go anywhere in Europe," said Predrag Krivokapic, whose Kompas Holiday International agency in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., specializes in travel to Central and Eastern Europe.
Other travel officials agree. "Especially if it's on TV on a daily basis," said Tom Souza, executive vice president of Collette Tours in Pawtucket, R.I.

HEADLINE: How U.S. and China Failed to Close Trade Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
On a bitterly cold day in Beijing in early January, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was given a startling message by Zhu Rongji, the Chinese Prime Minister who was remaking the country's economy.
Despite China's economic slowdown, Mr. Zhu said, he decided that China was finally ready to offer huge openings of its markets -- in telecommunications, banking, insurance and agriculture -- in return for getting the country into the World Trade Organization. 
 He offered some tantalizing details, apparently hoping that Mr. Greenspan -- whose domain has nothing to do with trade -- would make sure that the right people in Washington got the message.
They did, and in the next three months the two sides made enormous progress, resolving 95 percent of the issues that had divided them for years.
But in the end President Clinton, the man who has repeatedly made commercial diplomacy the centerpiece of his foreign policy, backed away. Distracted by Kosovo, he did not give clear instructions to his trade negotiators until very late in the talks about how much he wanted an agreement now, officials familiar with the negotiations said.
Nor did he make a strong public case until the morning of Mr. Zhu's arrival for what would have been the biggest economic deal in Chinese-American relations.
Some of his top foreign policy aides, led by the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, hoped for an agreement that would bolster Mr. Zhu, whom they see as China's leading force for openness and reform. At a meeting last Saturday, some State Department and trade officials argued that China had moved as far as it could and the President should take the deal on the table.
But one official said there had been "a sense it won't quite do it" with a Congress that is increasingly suspicious of China's intentions. Others expressed fears that any deal involving China would further divide Democrats, enrage labor unions and end up in a huge battle on Capitol Hill that the President would most likely lose.
Moreover, some argued that the Congressional battle would create a rallying cry for Republicans seeking an outlet to debate charges that China has stolen nuclear secrets and surreptitiously donated to Democratic coffers.
In a major speech about China delivered the morning before his meeting with Mr. Zhu, the President declared that "if China is willing to play by the global rules of trade, it would be an inexplicable mistake for the United States to say no."
Many of Mr. Clinton's closest aides took that as a sign that the debate was over, that the deal was done. They proved wrong.
It is too early to tell what the long-term impact of the failure to reach a deal on Thursday may be. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who appeared in no particular hurry about striking an agreement of this scope, insisted today that in the coming months a deal "is certainly doable." The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, insists that "we still want a deal, Zhu wants a deal and I'm sure it will happen."
But without question, momentum has been lost. A fear now is that once Mr. Zhu gets back to Beijing, the deal could unravel. Trade negotiations are like a carefully staged opera, one that can come to a rousing conclusion only after the most careful stagecraft. In this case the singers were playing to very different audiences, and the last act never came off.
Mr. Clinton did not press Mr. Zhu for additional concessions at their meeting on Wednesday night, aides said. And some American officials say they believe that Mr. Zhu was worried that he already had given too much.
If he agreed to strict provisions that would give the United States unilateral rights to retaliate against import surges and would offer more protection to the American textile workers by extending for years strict quotas on the volume of textiles that China can send to the United States, he would be subject to enormous criticism from other Chinese officials.
"I've never seen the President back away like this," one veteran of trade negotiations said today. "We're all still scratching our heads."
By some measures this could be a prime example of how one of America's most critical diplomatic initiatives fell victim to the distractions of a war in the Balkans.
Mr. Clinton has long argued that Chinese membership in the trade organization is not about economics, it is about global integration. It would get China into a legal framework, forcing it to work under Western-style trade laws. It would create huge market openings that, in time, could expose more Chinese to foreign ideas.
And by spreading cell phones and Internet nodes in China, the West would help create more outlets for political expression -- outlets the Chinese Government finds it increasingly difficult to control.
So when Mr. Greenspan returned to Washington in January with his message, Ms. Barshefsky leaped at the opening. She sent her top China negotiator, Robert Cassidy, to Beijing for what turned into weeks of negotiations. In the first week of March she went to Beijing herself, and spent two and half hours with Mr. Zhu.
"For the first hour I talked nonstop," she said. "And it was clear that great progress was being made."
For the first time the Chinese were talking about sweeping away many of the barriers that had long stymied American farmers: limits on agricultural imports, and requirements that goods be distributed only through state-owned companies. There was talk about letting American companies invest in the telecommunications industry for the first time.
"It came in dribs and drabs," said a person involved in the negotiations. "We would push, and we were often surprised that the Chinese came back and said, 'We can do it.' "
Clearly the Zhu visit here was the deadline, and everyone knew it. But in the interim a lot had changed in Washington.
Suspicions that China had obtained the design of the W-88 warhead, the most miniaturized in the American nuclear arsenal, created a new atmosphere on Capitol Hill, and the White House found itself under attack.
Meanwhile, at the negotiating table, the Chinese kept giving. "My overall sense is that the Chinese conceded more than I thought would be politically possible," said Nicholas Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Brookings Institution. "You have to remember that unemployment is at a 30-year high in China, corporate profits are falling off a cliff, and here is Zhu arguing that this is a moment to actually allow the foreigners to offer more domestic competition."
Mr. Berger argued that this was a moment to support Mr. Zhu, making him the man who brought China the prestige of entering the global trading system. Mr. Clinton seemed to agree, and his speech on Wednesday was filled with a discussion of America's interests in both an economically stronger and more secure China.
But inside the White House there was less talk about the dangers of a weak China than the dangers of an agreement that labor unions, liberal Democrats or powerful senators from textile-producing states -- like Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Ernest Hollings, South Carolina Democrat -- could use to rally opposition.
And there were other unhappy interest groups with a strong connection to the White House. China insisted on limits on the import of Western films, meaning that Hollywood might seek to kill the deal.
And the Chinese would not allow American brokerages much access to the rough and ready Chinese markets. That underwhelmed Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, the Administration's most important voice on any economic matter.
The arguments played out in regular meetings in the office of John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, who worried about the damage that would be wrought trying to push the deal through Congress.
"John had visions of Nafta dancing in his head," one participant in the discussions said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which passed in 1993 only because Mr. Clinton was able to rally Republicans to the cause. This year, few of them were expected to come to the President's rescue.
As the White House debate rolled on, Mr. Clinton was busy with other things. He spoke with Ms. Barshefsky only sporadically; she made a last-minute trip to Beijing last week without a clear sense of what the President wanted. There were few meetings to prepare the President for a major meeting with Mr. Zhu.
"He could barely focus on the summit," said a foreign policy aide.
So by the time Mr. Clinton was deeply involved in the details, it was clear that negotiators had run out of time to complete a deal that might have been acceptable to both China and Congress.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert's April 8 column on the paradox of dire poverty in America during an unprecedented economic expansion points to a second paradox. In the United States, to talk about "the American economy" and its successes is to perpetuate the assumption that this wealth is a public wealth, a wealth to be shared. It is not. We would like to believe that America is the richest nation on earth, but we are not. We are the nation with the richest individuals on earth.

Re Bob Herbert's April 8 column: I was intrigued by the concern for the poor, homeless members of society expressed by Andrew M. Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. However, one of the reasons that people end up like that is that there is no living wage in this country. 
 Just one minor catastrophe, like a health crisis or unexpected bill, can make someone homeless. A large number of people are paid a wage that does not permit them to save money after paying their bills.

HEADLINE: On China, A Failed Strategy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "U.S.-China Talks Fail to Produce Major Trade Deal" (front page, April 9): There is no evidence that trade pressure or the threat of sanctions has ever produced a sustainable improvement in Chinese human rights practices. In fact, the greatest recent period of political openness, in the late 1980's, was marked by highly favorable Chinese-American relations. 
 Senator Paul Wellstone's statement (Op-Ed, April 5) that the United States must insist that China "establish an independent judiciary, a free press and respect for the rule of law" would be more credible if Congress financed the rule-of-law programs President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China agreed to pursue last summer.
