HEADLINE: International Energy Agency Says World Will Increasingly Turn to Americas for Oil

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Over the next few years, world consumers are going to become more dependent on North and South America to satisfy their growing thirst for crude oil, according to a forecast to be released Thursday by the International Energy Agency.
The Paris-based organization estimated that the world would increase total oil production every year between 2010 and 2016 by an average 1.1 million barrels a day -- roughly 100,000 barrels short of the expected increase in global demand over the period. 
''After the sharp increase in oil demand in the second part of 2010 as the global economy recovered more quickly than anticipated from the recession, we now foresee higher mid-decade demand,'' the report said.
Tightening oil markets along with spreading unrest in the Middle East have driven oil prices 25 percent higher in the last year. But on Wednesday, concerns about a weakening economy sent prices sharply lower. The benchmark light sweet crude oil in the United States fell $4.56 a barrel to close at $94.81. If a major global downturn occurs and begins a more lasting decline in energy demand and prices, as happened in late 2008 and 2009, it could throw off forecasts.
The report warned that high oil prices ''are weighing down on an already-fragile macroeconomic and financial situation'' in the developed countries, while burdening the financial health of developing countries and pushing up inflation.
The energy agency predicts that 40 percent of demand growth over the next few years will come from China, with most of the rest coming from elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East. The agency expects Europe and the United States to have generally flat energy demand, in large part because their economies are expected to grow less robustly than those in the developing world, while their vehicles should become increasingly efficient.
Saudi Arabia and a handful of other mostly Middle Eastern countries with excess production capacity will have to supply more oil, but global markets will need to rely increasingly on producers outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. With production declining in Mexico and the North Sea, the energy agency suggested that Canada, Brazil, the United States and Colombia would need to take up the slack.
The report projected that by 2016, Canada, already the most important source for United States oil imports, would produce 1.3 million additional barrels a day as it expanded production from the oil sands in Alberta. Brazil is projected to increase production by a million barrels a day because of major new offshore fields in deep waters.
The United States, despite the slowdown in oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster last year and declining production in Alaska, will produce an additional 500,000 barrels a day largely from expanded drilling in oil shale fields in North Dakota and Texas, the agency said.
And Colombia is expected to increase production by 300,000 barrels a day, as a guerrilla insurgency's decline encourages international oil companies to return.
The energy agency cautioned that its optimistic outlook for Canada depended partly on the United States government's approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would take more than 500,000 barrels a day of partly refined Canadian crude from the oil sands to Texas and Louisiana refineries for eventual distribution to the Northeast. Canada will most likely sell the excess crude to China if the pipeline is not approved, but the switch could produce years of delays.
Environmentalists oppose the pipeline because they argue that production of oil from oil sands, which requires the burning of large amounts of natural gas, emits more greenhouse gases than production of most oil products used in the United States.
OPEC will remain a vital source of world oil, the report said, noting that Iraq in particular held the potential to significantly increase exports over the next several years.
In a separate report released last week, BP noted that world oil production rose 1.8 million barrels a day last year, with OPEC and non-OPEC producers each roughly responsible for half the growth.
In a projection for 2030 made earlier in the year, BP said OPEC would be ''primarily'' responsible for meeting growing demand for liquid fuels, although it mentioned Canadian oil sands, deepwater drilling off Brazil, and the countries that made up the former Soviet Union as promising sources of future supplies.

HEADLINE: Separate Bills Focus on Two Pieces of Immigration Puzzle

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For many lawmakers in Congress, the immigration issue has become too hot to touch, especially with presidential campaigns starting up and voters, burdened with persistent unemployment, in a volatile mood. But competing bills introduced this week, one by Republicans and another by Democrats, show small but consequential steps on immigration that leaders on both sides think they might accomplish in coming months, before electoral politics overwhelm the debate.
On Tuesday, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, introduced a bill that would require all employers nationwide to use a federal electronic system, known as E-Verify, to confirm the employment eligibility of new hires. Mr. Smith's bill had only Republican sponsors; a similar proposal was offered the same day in the Senate by Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. 
Also on Tuesday, Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, introduced a bill that would expand the number of permanent-resident documents, known as green cards, for foreign students graduating in math and sciences from top research universities. Ms. Lofgren's bill, which had only Democratic sponsors, would also create new types of green cards for immigrant entrepreneurs who start businesses with $500,000 in backing from American investors, and for foreigners who create businesses with their own resources that employ at least 10 American workers.
The measures were a sign that lawmakers here are skeptical that President Obama can reach his goal of passing anytime soon a broad immigration overhaul, which would include giving legal status to millions of illegal immigrants. In a speech last month in El Paso, Mr. Obama insisted that he wanted just such a package.
But legislators in both parties are looking to break out pieces of the puzzle, to avoid a caustic debate on proposals to legalize illegal immigrants that would most likely fail in the Republican-controlled House.
Summing up the strategy, Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who follows immigration policy, said: ''We are stuck in this position that unless we solve everything, we can't do anything. So let's try something on a small scale.''
Both of the new bills focus on businesses, with contrasting approaches to the same goal of creating jobs for Americans.
''Despite record unemployment, seven million people work in the U.S. illegally,'' Mr. Smith said Wednesday at a hearing on his proposal. ''These jobs should go to legal workers.''
Mr. Smith's bill would eventually require every worker in the country who applies for a job -- not just immigrants -- to be checked through E-Verify. The largest businesses would be required to use the system within six months. Mr. Smith left a large exception for agricultural employers, who would not have to use the system for three years.
The bill was immediately assailed by immigrant advocate organizations and unions.
''Main Street businesses and key agriculture and tourism industries know the economic pain this type of legislation can inflict,'' said Eliseo Medina, the international secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union. ''They know the government database does not work and is too costly for businesses, and for taxpayers who will lose billions of dollars in revenues when disqualified workers go off the tax rolls and into an underground cash economy.''
But Mr. Smith's proposal picked up some new support, as national associations of home builders, restaurants and human resources managers voiced tentative approval. Leaders of the business groups said they preferred one federal worker verification system to the confusing patchwork of laws that states have adopted or considered in recent years.
Ms. Lofgren offered letters of support for her proposal from the nation's biggest technology employers, including Intel, Oracle and Texas Instruments. That bill includes a provision to give temporary visas to immigrant college students brought by their parents to the United States illegally when they were children.
While pieces of a bargain might be on the table, until now businesses have been shy about stepping forward to press their immigration interests too publicly. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, an independent, said Wednesday that he would try to bridge the divide between the parties.
Mr. Bloomberg, in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, said the United States was committing ''national suicide'' if it failed to make its immigration system more friendly to foreign entrepreneurs and highly skilled workers. Congress ''can use the stalemate as a wedge issue to score political points in 2012,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Or, they can come together and adopt changes to our visa system that will spur new companies, strengthen existing ones, and help create jobs for the 13.9 million Americans who are unemployed.''

HEADLINE: As Number of Medicaid Patients Goes Up, Their Benefits Are About to Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration injected billions of dollars into Medicaid, the nation's low-income health program, as the recession deepened two years ago. The money runs out at the end of this month, and benefits are being cut for millions of people, even though unemployment has increased.
From New Jersey to California, state officials are bracing for the end to more than $90 billion in federal largess specifically designated for Medicaid. To hold down costs, states are cutting Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals, limiting benefits for Medicaid recipients, reducing the scope of covered services, requiring beneficiaries to pay larger co-payments and expanding the use of managed care. 
As a result, costs can be expected to rise in other parts of the health care system. Cuts in Medicaid payments to doctors, for example, make it less likely that they will accept Medicaid patients and more likely that people will turn to hospital emergency rooms for care. Hospitals and other health care providers often try to make up for the loss of Medicaid revenue by increasing charges to other patients, including those with private insurance, experts say.
Neither the White House nor Congress has tried to extend the extra federal financing for Medicaid, even though the number of beneficiaries is higher now than when Congress approved the aid as part of an economic recovery package in February 2009.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that federal Medicaid spending will decline in 2012 for only the second time in the 46-year history of the program. But states say they will have to have to spend more on Medicaid as they struggle to make up for the loss of federal money.
State officials say they are resigned to the loss of the extra federal matching payments, given the climate in Congress, where deficit reduction is a paramount goal.
''We all see the reality of what's going on in Congress,'' said Mark W. Rupp, director of the Washington office of Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington State, a Democrat who is chairwoman of the National Governors Association. ''It's more about cutting than spending. Why put a lot of effort into something that did not seem likely to have a positive outcome? It would have been fairly futile.''
Although Medicaid provides health insurance to one in five Americans at some point in a year, it is more vulnerable to cuts than Medicare and Social Security, which have broader political support.
''Medicaid is very much on the chopping block,'' said Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care. ''Seniors vote. But if you are poor and disabled, you might not vote, and if you are a child, you do not vote -- that's a lot of Medicaid's population. They don't have money to do lobbying.''
Medicaid is financed jointly by the federal government and the states, with the federal government paying a larger share in poorer states like Mississippi and West Virginia and a smaller share in higher-income states like New York and Connecticut.
The aid ending next month increased the federal share of Medicaid spending in all states, with additional help for states where unemployment rates had risen sharply. The extra aid was scheduled to expire last December, but Congress extended it for six months at the urging of the White House and state officials.
The additional money pushed the average federal share of Medicaid spending nationwide to 67 percent. It will revert to 57 percent next month. The cutback in federal Medicaid money has put pressure on states to cut the budget for other programs, including education and social services.
Toby J. Douglas, director of the California Department of Health Care Services, said the federal Medicaid cut was causing ''very consequential reductions in health care and other public programs.''
California is cutting Medicaid payments to doctors and many other providers by 10 percent; has established new co-payments for drugs, doctors' services and hospital care; and will limit beneficiaries to seven doctor's office visits a year unless a doctor certifies a need for more.
With 7.6 million Medicaid beneficiaries -- 50 percent more than any other state -- California faces bigger problems, but its response has been typical. A survey issued this month by the National Association of State Budget Officers found that 24 states were reducing Medicaid payments to providers, while 20 were limiting benefits in some way.
R. Andrew Allison, who is executive director of the Kansas Health Policy Authority and president of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said Medicaid was gobbling up new revenues as states recovered slowly from the recession.
Kansas illustrates the predicament most states are facing. Federal Medicaid payments in Kansas are expected to decline by more than $250 million, or 13 percent, in the state's new fiscal year, which starts July 1, Mr. Allison said. But the amount of state revenue spent on Medicaid is expected to increase by more than $300 million, or 39 percent.
New York has just imposed a cap on state Medicaid spending, with a separate limit for each sector like hospitals, nursing homes and managed care plans. Under a new state law, if it appears that the state share of Medicaid spending will exceed the cap, New York officials must devise and carry out a plan to reduce spending, by modifying benefits, provider payment rates or other features of the program.
''This is an enormous sea change for Medicaid,'' said Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for the New York State Health Department.
In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, said, ''Medicaid's growth is out of control,'' and he has proposed numerous changes ''to fill in the hole created by the loss of over a billion dollars of federal stimulus money'' for the program. He would tighten eligibility, reduce Medicaid payment rates for nursing homes, move older and disabled Medicaid recipients into managed care, and charge co-payments for medical day care services.
The New Jersey Legislature appears likely to accept some of the changes in a budget to be adopted this month.
Connecticut has avoided major cuts in Medicaid, but the State Legislature has set new limits on vision and dental coverage for adults.

HEADLINE: Ahmadinejad's Fall, America's Loss

BYLINE: By SUZANNE MALONEY and RAY TAKEYH. 
Suzanne Maloney is a senior fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. Ray Takeyh is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

 BODY:
Washington
THE Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is being sidelined by religious fundamentalists, and it's bad news for American officials seeking to halt Iran's nuclear program.
The same Iranian leader who dabbled in Holocaust denial and messianic fantasies was, paradoxically, also the theocracy's most ardent advocate of direct nuclear negotiations with Washington. As Mr. Ahmadinejad falls out of favor with Iran's hard-line religious leaders, the prospect of a nuclear deal between Tehran and Washington is diminishing.
Once the darling of clerical conservatives, who only two years ago rigged the system to ensure his re-election, Mr. Ahmadinejad is now clinging to his post amid furious recriminations from his erstwhile allies. His fall from grace has been fierce and fast. In what is only the latest in a series of humiliating comedowns, Mr. Ahmadinejad was heckled recently at a service commemorating the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The most devastating blow came in May from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who publicly repudiated his hand-picked protege in a clash over presidential powers. 
Iran's Islamist clerics deliberately made the presidency a weak office, due to their enduring suspicion of central authority and popular elections, and each of Mr. Ahmadinejad's predecessors plainly chafed at its limitations. The brash Mr. Ahmadinejad persistently sought to transcend these constraints. By deftly exploiting nationalist impulses and economic grievances, the president used every opportunity to build a power base and assert his influence. These same shrewd political instincts drove him to embrace the notion of negotiations with Washington, a proposition fundamentally at odds with the clerics' official ideology of anti-Americanism.
Mr. Ahmadinejad's interest in dialogue was not motivated by any appreciation of American civilization or an impulse to reconcile. Rather, the provocative president saw talks as a means of boosting his stature at home and abroad while touting his vision of a strong nuclear-armed Iran. For a politician with delusions of his own grandeur, the idea of high-profile negotiations with Washington offered an opportunity to strut on the world stage as the champion of a new, anti-American world order.
Iran's conservative establishment has long recognized Mr. Ahmadinejad's ambitions as a threat, both to their political domination and to their ideology. However, for as long as Mr. Ahmadinejad's rabble-rousing served the purposes of the regime, Mr. Khamenei indulged and even encouraged him -- until the president's pretensions began to infringe on Mr. Khamenei's authority.
Having finally kneecapped the unruly Mr. Ahmadinejad, the supreme leader is now more firmly in control of Iran than ever before. None of the relevant decision-makers are willing or able to push back against Mr. Khamenei's hostile and suspicious stance toward the West. And as turmoil spreads through the region, Iran is seeking to expand its influence across the greater Middle East and beyond. An increasingly confident and aggressive Iran is unlikely to accept meaningful limitations on its nuclear ambitions or sever its ties to militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.
This poses a real conundrum for policy makers in the United States and Europe, who have been relying almost exclusively on economic sanctions to impede Iran's nuclear progress while hoping that factional infighting might eventually lead the regime to collapse. Both strategies are likely to fall short. After all, Iran's nuclear program was revived by the clerics during a period of isolation and wartime austerity as Iran fought Iraq in the 1980s, and fierce debate among Iranian elites is hardly new.
Still, the current political upheaval in the region does make the Iranian regime vulnerable. Moreover, Mr. Khamenei's increasing absolutism has alienated not just Iran's citizenry but even his loyal foot soldiers, from the revolution's founding fathers, like the former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, to its zealous children, like Mr. Ahmadinejad.
A regime riven by internal conflicts, leery of its constituents, under economic duress, and surrounded by burgeoning anti-authoritarian protest movements offers its own share of pressure points -- and a more creative American approach could pay dividends, as shifting alignments among Iran's political class offer opportunities to reshape Iran's priorities.
Washington must appreciate that it is locked in a prolonged struggle for regional influence with one of its least predictable foes. To prevail in this conflict, Washington must abandon any expectation that Tehran can be seduced or coerced to the negotiating table.
American policy should seek to maximize financial and technological constraints on the Iranian nuclear program, strengthen Iran's opposition, exacerbate the many fissures within its political class and insulate Iran's neighbors from its nefarious activities. The leaders of a revolution that has once again devoured its own can surely be thwarted by the United States and its allies.

HEADLINE: Utilities Turn to Mergers as Demand for Power Slows

BYLINE: ADAM ASTON


HIGHLIGHT: As technological advances hold the line on power consumption, major electricity players are looking to get bigger to protect their bottom lines.

 BODY:
Even as the number of tablet computers, electric vehicles and Internet data centers multiply rapidly, electricity demand is barely growing. Low-power processors, smarter manufacturing plants, rooftop solar panels and other technologies are keeping a lid on electricity use.
The slowdown is spurring a fresh cycle of deal-making among publicly traded utilities. Not unlike the wave of consolidation that came after deregulation in the 1990s, major electricity players are looking to get bigger to protect their bottom lines.
So far this year, utilities in the United States have announced mergers and acquisitions with a total value of $44 billion. That compares with $30 billion in all of 2010, according to Thomson Reuters.
If approved, Duke's Energy's $26 billion deal in January to buy Progress Energy would create the country's largest utility. The combined company would own power plants with 57 gigawatts of capacity, generate $22.7 billion in revenue and serve 7.1 million customers across six states.
The surge of deals "marks the acceleration of a long-awaited consolidation of the U.S. electric utility industry," said Todd A. Shipman, credit analyst of utilities and infrastructure ratings at Standard & Poor's.
By his take, today's deal-making will pick up from the previous era of consolidation. Since deregulation, the industry has shrunk to roughly 50 publicly traded companies, from 100. That number could be halved to 25 in as little as five years, Mr. Shipman said.
While the usual financial pressures to fortify balance sheets and improve credit quality are once again pushing mergers and acquisitions, environmental dynamics are playing a bigger role than in the past. Utilities - facing pending regulation on greenhouse gas emissions and renewed enforcement of older rules on air pollution - must reckon with the rising costs of compliance.
The added expenses come just as growth in electricity demand is being crimped by efficiency gains. Electricity usage increased 0.5 percent a year on average for the decade that ended 2010, down from 2.4 percent a year during the 1990s, according to the Energy Information Administration.
The anemic figures represent the tail end of a six-decade deceleration of electricity demand. The rate peaked in the 1950s, at 9.8 percent a year, during a period of supercharged industrial growth and home construction.
Customers' plans reflect a secular shift. Nine out of 10 businesses and 70 percent of consumers have set specific goals to lower their electricity costs, according to a recent study by the Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions with the Harrison Group, a research services firm. Nearly a third of companies polled have goals to self-generate electricity, whether through solar panels, reuse of wasted heat or other methods.
Utilities are adjusting to the new reality. With customers tapering their electricity use, Consolidated Edison is deferring the installation of transformers and other costly capital equipment in New York, said Rebecca Craft, the company's director of energy efficiency and demand management. Con Ed trimmed its outlook for how much the city's appetite for power will grow in the coming decade to 1 percent a year, from 1.7 percent.
"Practically every utility today is thinking about flattened growth of demand for energy," said Gregory E. Aliff, a vice chairman of energy and resources at Deloitte.
"In the last wave of utility mergers, it was more offensive - companies were seeking growth," he said. "Today is different: the industry is more on the defensive. Companies face a question of how to grow, and consolidation is a way to grow earnings."
New environmental regulations are only heightening the growth challenge. The industry faces potentially sizable bills to meet a raft of air pollution rules being pushed by the White House.
Utilities with a big reliance on coal face the steepest emissions penalties. American Electric Power, which derives about 85 percent of its power from coal, recently estimated the new rules could cost $6 billion to $8 billion in coming years. The money would pay for adding filters to power plant smokestacks, closing coal-fired generators and switching to lower-emission natural gas generators.
Some merger-minded utilities are shedding assets to lower their exposure to such rules. As part of its $7.9 billion deal to buy Constellation Energy, Exelon plans to sell a batch of coal-fired plants. While coal fuels 12 percent of their current generation, the companies aim to halve that share after the merger.
A.E.P., Duke and Exelon declined to comment.
Unlike in previous periods of consolidation, regulators seem more willing to approve deals, given the sluggish economy and job market. Previously, the process could drag on for years, but recent mergers have been moving along more quickly.
This month Connecticut regulators effectively approved Northeast Utilities' tie-up with NStar, despite opposition from the state's attorney general. When the $6.9 billion deal including debt was announced last October, the companies pledged that "no broad-based, corporatewide layoffs or early retirements are planned."
Said Mr. Shipman of S.&P., "In most of these deals, executives have been careful to emphasize that jobs will be spared, rather than cut."

The number of (wealthier) Americans who are renouncing their citizenship has been climbing in recent quarters.
Take a look at the chart below, courtesy of Andrew Mitchel, an international tax attorney who has been manually tallying the lists of expatriates (defined for this purpose as people renouncing their American citizenship or terminating their long-term United States residency) published in the Federal Register. The chart is taken from his blog:
The figures appear to refer primarily to those Americans wealthy enough to warrant notifying the Internal Revenue Service of their change of status, rather than all expatriates. A total of 499 Americans fell into this expatriate category during the first quarter of this year. The number during the first quarter in each of the previous seven years averaged 115.
Now I'm sure a few readers are going to blame "ObamaCare" for this burst of expatriation. Mr. Mitchel, however, suggests that two technical tax-related changes inspired more people to give up their citizenship.He writes in an e-mail:First, in 2008 the expatriation rules were changed. There is no longer the 10 year U.S. tax return filing requirement. Although there is now a mark-to-market regime triggering gains upon expatriation, up to $636,000 of gain can generally be excluded for individuals expatriating in 2011 (the amount is annually adjusted for inflation). Further, non-U.S. citizen, nonresidents can now annually visit the U.S. for 120 or more days without becoming taxed as U.S. residents (under the pre-2008 rules, visits to the U.S. for more than 30 days during any of the 10 years following expatriation caused the individual to be treated as a U.S. resident for that year).
With the $636,000 exclusion from the mark-to-market gain, many individuals can expatriate without paying any U.S. tax. It is important to note, however, that some individuals, especially those with assets in foreign pension plans, may unexpectedly pay more tax than they realize. The circumstances of each individual considering expatriation must be closely analyzed to determine the amount of U.S. tax that will be due upon expatriation.
The second reason for the increase in expatriations, I believe, is the recent publicity regarding the penalties and voluntary disclosures for failing to report offshore bank and other financial accounts. The U.S. tax rules for U.S. citizens living overseas can be quite complex. The increase in awareness of the penalties has caused many individuals with dual citizenship to conclude that their U.S. citizenship is not worth the stress and hassle of the U.S. tax filing rules. The U.S. is almost the only country in the world that requires its citizens that live permanently in another country to continue to file tax returns in the country of citizenship. Combine the U.S. tax return filing complexities with the potentially bankrupting penalties for failing to report certain items, and many individuals conclude that their lives would improve by shedding their U.S. citizenship.

HEADLINE: Driving the Toyota Prius V: a Prius With Costco Capacity

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: Jim Motavalli spends time in a preproduction version of the Prius wagon, scheduled to go on sale in the fall.

 BODY:
According to Toyota, its Prius accounts for 52 percent of the United States hybrid market and outsells all its competitors combined. It's no surprise, then, that the company would want to give the car some siblings.
Toyota brought a preproduction fleet of its latest hybrid, the Prius V, to Westchester County on Wednesday and offered drives along the Connecticut-New York border. Though journalists could choose among various scenic routes, given the car's clear family-hauler aspirations, a trip to a big-box food wholesaler would not have been inappropriate.
The V, which stands for "Versatility," according to Toyota, will be joined by a plug-in Prius sedan and a smaller car based on the Prius C concept, first shown at the Detroit auto show in January, in the next two years. The V, with extra legroom and 58 percent more cargo space than its sedan counterpart, is the firstborn and is expected to be on the market in the fall.
According to Rick LoFaso, corporate marketing manager for cars and vans at Toyota, the V took its cues from the American lifestyle. Hiroshi Kayukawa, the car's chief engineer, visited malls, big-box stores and tourist sites to see how Americans shop, Mr. LoFaso said, and concluded that -- surprise surprise -- we like to move a lot of stuff.
As such, 3 inches were added to the Prius sedan's wheelbase and 6 inches to the overall length. The cabin offers 34.3 cubic feet of stowage, or 67.3 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. Mr. LoFaso noted the V had more cargo space than the Chevrolet Equinox, Honda Element, Ford Escape or Nissan Rogue.
The V is heavier and slightly less aerodynamic (a 0.29 coefficient of drag) than a regular Prius (0.25), so it sacrifices a measure of fuel economy. The car is rated at 44 m.p.g. in the city, 40 on the highway and 42 combined. Though a 19-mile test drive over twisty two-lane, with the obligatory hard acceleration and braking, does not offer a representative test drive by any means, I observed 32.1 m.p.g.
The V is closely related to the regular Prius under the skin, so it doesn't offer many on-road surprises. More revelatory was stretching out in the back after folding the rear seats. A 6' 1" reporter fit with only slightly bent knees. An added bonus is good rear legroom, even behind a fully extended driver's seat -- a rarity in modern cars.
Another test that could be performed in the V without actually going anywhere was programming a new Pandora station. The Internet radio service builds a listening experience around favorite artists, and it worked well in the test car, though down the road, the music died briefly when passing through an area of spotty cell service.
In its upmarket versions -- there are Two, Three and Five trims, and an advanced technology package -- the V is equipped with the Entune multimedia system, which accesses other applications like MovieTickets.com, iHeartRadio and OpenTable through the owner's smartphone.
As preproduction prototypes, the V's I drove still had some kinks. Testing the self-parking system, a feature found on the Lexus LS luxury sedan, was an adventure; the beep tone that alerts the driver when to put the car into reverse did not sound. But with a little trial and error the car tucked itself away with great dexterity.
The Toyota Prius is already a family car, but stretching it makes it even more of one. There's no bottom line yet, but Mr. LoFaso said the V would be priced "a little higher than the current Prius."
Stay tuned for a full review of the Prius V, which will appear in the Automobiles section later in the summer.

HEADLINE: As Chevrolet Turns 100, a Swiss Celebration for a Native Son

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: A Swiss town is bracing for a parade of a thousand Chevrolet cars to honor Louis Chevrolet, the town's most -- and, paradoxically, least -- famous son.

 BODY:
When I first visited La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, last year to see the birthplace of Louis Chevrolet, the woman at the tourist office greeted me with a quizzical, "Who?"
Any uncertainty that might remain about the namesake of the famed automobile, or his connection to this town in Switzerland's Jura Mountains, will be clarified on Sunday when a thousand Chevrolet cars converge for a remembrance of its native son. Fittingly enough, the cars will drive through the center of town and be parked outside the city's once-naive tourist office.
Louis-Joseph Chevrolet, born on Christmas Day in 1878, was barely remembered in the town until recently, when a small but ardent band of his Swiss admirers started a tiny car show here 15 years ago. Those admirers, in turn, have managed to connect with other Chevy fans throughout Europe. And an internationally circulated news report about last year's car show helped air ambitious plans to celebrate the 2011 centennial of the Chevrolet brand in La Chaux-de-Fonds.
"We are expecting, seriously, 1,000 Chevrolets on the main avenue," said Andre Rochat, one of the celebration's organizers, wrote in an e-mail. The 1,000 figure was the goal of Mr. Rochal, expressed to me last August, after the 2010 car show. "We could do even better and show more," he wrote. "But we had to make a few choices in order to present a little bit of everything of 100 years of Chevrolet history."
Cars are coming from all over Europe, he said, including a few from overseas. The oldest car expected here, Mr. Rochat added, is a 1914 Chevrolet 490. Though Chevrolet's first car, the Classic Six (Model C) would not be in attendance, Mr. Rochat was realistic about expectations.
"One is in Detroit, or Flint, and one in Canada, if I am not mistaken," he said.
That first Chevrolet, built from 1911 to 1913, was a large, powerful, elegant and costly machine. From a sales standpoint, it was a flop. Louis Chevrolet, a flamboyant and successful auto racer, loved the car, but he left the company when it was decided to apply the Chevrolet name after the 1915 model year to a small, economical car line previously known as the Little.
Louis Chevrolet started another car company, Frontenac, but died a forgotten, nearly penniless man in Detroit in 1941.
A few fans have refused to let his memory die, however.
"We are with a team of 10 friends, big admirers of Louis Chevrolet as well as the make of Chevrolet," said Mr. Rochat, who lives in nearby Lausanne. "We are organizing this event since 14 years in memory to him."
In August, Mr. Rochat and his friends plan to run a Chevrolet-theme road rally, and on Nov. 3, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chevrolet brand, Mr. Rochat, in connection with General Motors of Europe, will unveil a memorial to the man in La Chaux-de-Fonds. The memorial grew out of media reports last year that indicated Louis Chevrolet was not especially well remembered at the car company he founded.
General Motors Europe initially said it would fund the building of a statue to Louis Chevrolet in La Chaux-de-Fonds. But, as Mr. Rochat noted, "the project became even bigger." The statue idea eventually morphed into a European artist contest.
Even La Chaux-de-Fonds has weighed in, requesting a suitably impressive memorial to be erected in a prominent location downtown -- very close to the tourist office, in fact.

HEADLINE: Petition Seeks Better Pay for Musicans at Jazz Festivals

BYLINE: NATE CHINEN


HIGHLIGHT: One of the goals is a minimum rate of pay for performers.

 BODY:
The Undead Jazzfest, now in its second year, will employ dozens of jazz musicians next week, in more than 50 sets, from Thursday through Sunday, in New York. But the terms of that employment have drawn criticism, according to a petition posted online.
Available at winterundeadmusicians.wordpress.com, the petition - which addresses both the Undead Jazzfest and a longer-running partner event, the Winter Jazzfest - takes issue with the festivals' fee structure, calling on their promoters to meet with a Winter/Undead Festival Musicians Organizing Committee and representatives from Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians. Among its goals is a minimum rate of pay; there's also a reference to "other conditions."
"We seek neither controversy nor conflict, and hope these issues can be resolved through a reasonable good faith negotiation with the promoters," read an email message that circulated with a link to the petition. "But we know that unless we ourselves organize to draw the line somewhere, no negotiations will occur, and the decline in our rates of pay will continue." The petition is anonymous, but the message was signed by a handful of prominent musicians, including the saxophonist Steve Coleman, the pianists Jason Moran and Orrin Evans, and the guitarists Mary Halvorson and Marc Ribot.
The Undead Jazzfest is presented jointly by Search and Restore and Boom Collective; an email seeking comment from both organizations was not returned. Prices for the festival are kept approachably low: a four-day pass is $50, and a single-night pass is $25. The pay scale for participating musicians is undisclosed.
A similar effort in 1999, led by Mr. Ribot, took aim at the Knitting Factory's Texaco Jazz Festival. In that case musicians eventually secured a minimum of $200 each per engagement, for groups of up to six. (In larger ensembles the rate was reduced.)
The Undead Jazzfest operates without title sponsorship, and a minimum rate of pay could affect its programming philosophy along with its ticket price. As an audience experience it traffics in abundance; the economics behind the scene have so far been invisible.
That may not be the case for much longer. "We reject the rationale that musicians should accept unfair treatment in exchange for 'exposure' and 'publicity,'" reads the email message. "The only opportunity guaranteed by acceptance of substandard pay and conditions is the normalization of our own mistreatment."

HEADLINE: Celebrating a City's Solar Muscle

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: Two-thirds of New York City's million or so buildings are suitable for solar panel installations, a laser mapping project shows, raising the possibility that they could meet half of the city's power needs at peak periods in the summertime.

 BODY:
Given that New York City has been falling behind some of its municipal counterparts in new solar power installations, renewable energy advocates are happy to hear that its rooftops can hold more than water tanks and lounge chairs. 
As I report in Thursday's paper, two-thirds of the city's one million or so buildings are suitable for solar panel installations. That means an estimated 615.4 million square feet in usable roof area is capable of producing half of the city's power needs at peak periods in the summer.
 It remains to be seen how much of that potential can be fulfilled, but in the meantime, environmental groups are pushing for passage of a bill introduced in Albany that would set a target for the state's generation of solar power at 5,000 megawatts by 2026, or about 3 percent of New York State's total electric load. 
To prod legislators, some of the groups have been running an ad campaign on Times Square billboards that includes images from a photo contest that encouraged New Yorkers to show their love for solar. Above and below are two winning entries."Poll after poll demonstrates strong public support for an investment in renewable, reliable solar power," said Pierre Bull, a policy analyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council, part of the coalition of energy and environmental organizations pushing for the bill.

HEADLINE: Who Will Step Up to Meet Oil Demand?

BYLINE: CLIFFORD KRAUSS


HIGHLIGHT: A report predicts that Canada, Brazil, Colombia and the United States will come to the rescue as oil demand starts to outstrip production over the next five years.

 BODY:
 For those of you who use gasoline or diesel to get to work in the morning, you may have a problem, in case you haven't noticed prices at the pump lately.
 According to a report released this week by the International Energy Agency, total oil production each year from 2010 to 2016 will have grown by an average of 1.1 million barrels a day. But that is 100,000 barrels a day less than the average growth in global demand expected over the next five years.
 "After the sharp increase in oil demand in the second part of 2010 as the global economy recovered more quickly than anticipated from the recession, we now foresee higher mid-decade demand," according to the report.
 Forty percent of the demand growth will come from China alone, with most of the rest coming from the rest of Asia and the Middle East, the report said. Europe and the United States are expected to have generally flat demand, in large part because their economies are expected to grow less robustly than economies in the developing world and their vehicles will become increasingly efficient.
 So whom are we going to turn to for more oil? According to the energy agency, you won't have to look far. While OPEC members, particularly Saudi Arabia and Iraq, are going to have to pump more, places a lot closer to home are going to have pump more, too. Canada, Brazil, Colombia and the United States are coming to the rescue.
 The report projected that by 2016, Canada, already the most important source for oil imports into the United States, will produce 1.3 million barrels a day more because of the expansion of oil sands production in western Alberta. Brazil is projected to increase its production by 1 million barrels a day, drawing on major new fields in deep waters offshore.
 Despite the slowdown in oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster last year, and a decline in production in Alaska, the United States will produce 500,000 barrels a day more largely due to recent drilling in oil shale fields in North Dakota and Texas, the report said.
 And Colombia is expected to increase its production by 300,000 barrels a day as international oil companies return to exploration there and a guerrilla insurgency continues to wane.
 The energy agency cautioned that its optimistic outlook for Canada depended partly on the Obama administration's approval of construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would take more than 500,000 barrels a day of partly refined Canadian crude from oil sands to Texas and Louisiana refineries for distribution to the Northeast. Canada would probably rely on China to buy any excess crude if the pipeline is not approved, but that would probably bring years of delays.
 "Producers in Canada and refiners in the U.S. are keen," the report noted, but the pipeline plan "has attracted a lot of criticism due to environmental concerns about oil sands production."

HEADLINE: Farm Jobs Lost? Blame Environmentalists! (Or Not.)

BYLINE: FELICITY BARRINGER


HIGHLIGHT: The Pacific Institute reports that the farmers of California's Central Valley did far better than advertised during the three-year drought of 2007 through 2009.

 BODY:
The Pacific Institute, one of the premier research organizations on water issues, has undermined the conventional wisdom in California's Central Valley with its latest report.
Farmers and most other residents in the state's breadbasket blame environmentalism run amok for forcing them to leave fields unplanted when the water they hoped for was diverted to benefit the endangered ecosystem of the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta. But the institute's report, based on an extensive analysis of federal and state data as well as the records of water districts, argues that environmental constraints played at best a minor role in water shortages and rural unemployment. 
If any single factor is to blame for rural unemployment, the analysis concludes, it is the collapse of the construction industry, which was crucial to the state's booming growth in the early 2000s. The report noted that "strong demand for California farm products on national and global markets also kept both crop prices and revenue high throughout the drought." The industries that suffered disproportionate harm from the drought, the report said, were hydropower and salmon fishing, not agriculture.
That's not the explanation that the Fox News commentator Sean Hannity offered for the Central Valley's troubles two years ago, when the photograph above was taken. In 2009, fallow fields sprouted signs reading "Congress-Created Dust Bowl" -- an apparent reference to congressional support for the Endangered Species Act, one of the laws involved in curtailing water supplies from the federal Central Valley Project.
But the report notes that in two of the drought years, 2008 and 2009, California's crops brought record high revenues. And while some Central Valley counties, particularly in the southern portions of the valley, suffered significant declines in crops like citrus fruits, overall unemployment in the agricultural sector rose in lockstep with -- or even a bit more slowly than -- unemployment in other sectors.
To borrow from James Carville's old maxim, the report's basic message was, "It's the economy, stupid." Or at least not environmentalism.
The drought, of course, was real and severe, even if it didn't match its two immediate predecessors in the 1970s and 1980s. Precipitation from 2007 through 2009 was 25 percent below normal, and stream flows were 40 percent below average. Farmers pumped groundwater to make up the difference.
 In the Westlands District on the southwestern side of the delta, groundwater pumping in the wet year of 2007 added 25,000 acre-feet of water to surface supplies; in 2009, the figure was 480,000 acre-feet. (An acre-foot of water is sufficient to provide water to about two average households for a year.) Over all, the reduction in the volume of total groundwater during the drought was 48 times worse than reductions in a comparable period earlier in the decade.
The farmers controlling the state's largest water districts tended to blame environmental considerations like protecting the delta smelt from extinction for the water cutoffs. But the report, whose lead author is Juliet Christian-Smith, a senior researcher at the Pacific Institute, said that less than 25 percent of the water was diverted to in-stream flows rather than sent to the aqueduct.
At a later point, the authors noted, "Statewide, total harvested crop acreage declined to the course of the drought, but acreage has been in decline for over a decade, even during periods of more abundant water." However, it added, "the rate of decline actually appears to have slowed during the during the drought years." The yields of fields were down for seed, melon and vegetable crops, but overall the fruit and not crops did well," although there were hits to local produce market. 
And the fallowing of fields was handled differently in different parts of the state. In 2009, crop acreage in Fresno, Kern and Kings counties were at record lows; in Tulare County there were record highs. As for the crops themselves, in Fresno County, the report said, "there were no dramatic declines in the yield of the three highest-value crops": grapes, almonds and tomatoes.
 But in Kern County, citrus production decreased by 40 percent in 2009, and the value of the crop by 31 percent. And all of Kings County's crops significantly declined in acreage and revenue.
Still, during the drought years, farm jobs accounted for the same or a slightly higher percentage of the overall labor force as they had previously. "While unemployment increased within the Valley and statewide over the drought period," the report said, "job losses were concentrated in sectors not related to agriculture. In fact, the proportion of agricultural jobs has either remained stable to increased in areas facing the greatest reductions in federal and state water deliveries."
According to state data for 2003 to 2009, it said, "agricultural employment throughout the Central Valley gained slightly (2 percent), while natural resources, mining and construction jobs fell by 44 percent, and employment in the trade, transportation and utilities sectors fell by 46 percent."

HEADLINE: No Strike at Macy's

BYLINE: ADRIANE QUINLAN


HIGHLIGHT: Macy's and the union representing roughly 4,000 workers reached a tentative contract agreement, averting a threatened strike.

 BODY:
There will be no picket lines on 34th Street, no marching in Herald Square. Tourists who feared their jaunts to New York might be ruined by a strike at Macy's need worry no longer: the department store and its employees reached a tentative agreement on a new contract early Thursday.
The deal was reached around 7 a.m. after an all-night negotiating session, as talks continued beyond the union-imposed midnight deadline that would have put roughly 4,000 employees on strike at the flagship store in Manhattan, and three others in the Bronx, Queens and Westchester County.
The workers must still ratify the contract through a vote.
Joan Solomon, a Macy's worker who participated in the talks, said the new health care plan was more affordable than the one previously presented.
Before the deal was reached, union officials said management had proposed terms that would have raised health care costs, shifted a number of full-time workers to part-time schedules and instituted a starting hourly salary of $7.50 - all of which the union had been contesting.
The proposed deal would increase hourly wages by 65 cents in the first year of the five-year contract, and a total of $3.05 over the five years, said Ron Chencinski, vice president of Local 1-S of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union. He said the union made gains in health care costs, with some plans costing workers less than before. And Macy's has agreed to guarantee full-time employees 37 \xC2 hours of work per week while part-time employees would be guaranteed 28 hours.
Ken Bordieri, president of Local 1-S, called the tentative agreement a "solid contract," and a spokeswoman for Macy's, Elina Kazan, said in a statement that the new contract "addresses the economic and business realities of the retailing industry, while keeping jobs at Macy's among the best in the department store industry."
Stuart Appelbaum, the union's president, said the agreement was symbolic in a union-busting recession.
"All we hear is that working people have to give concessions and provide givebacks and just feel lucky to have any job at all and just agree with what is offered," he said. "These negotiations serve as an important symbol for working people in New York that you can make gains for yourself and your family."
Riding the bus back to her home in Canarsie, Brooklyn, after the all-night negotiation session, Ms. Solomon, who has worked at the flagship store's cosmetics counter for the past 15 years, said she was tired but happy. "You're not going to please everybody," she said. "But I'm quite sure the majority will be pleased."
The contract could be ratified by Wednesday, when the last group of the union's 3,800 workers covered under the contract will vote.

HEADLINE: Hiring Slows, but City's Jobless Rate Remains 8.6%

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: New York City's unemployment rate holds steady, but hiring has slowed, the State Department of Labor reports.

 BODY:
Hiring slowed in New York City last month, but the city's unemployment rate held steady at 8.6 percent, the New York State Department of Labor reported Thursday.
 Employers in the city added about 9,400 jobs in May, with many of the new positions created in hotels, restaurants and other businesses that benefit from tourism, according to a report on the department's Web site. Employment in retail stores was weak in May because Easter came later than usual, postponing the post-holiday layoffs that normally occur in May, the report said.
 Some industries that had accounted for a lot of the hiring in the city after the recession, including financial services, health care and education, all lost jobs in May, it said. Still, those industries added more than 28,000 jobs in the past 12 months, more than half of the 48,100 jobs the city gained over that period. 
 In the last year, the city's private-sector employment has grown by 1.5 percent, slightly lower than the national job-growth rate of 1.7 percent. But the city's unemployment rate remains lower than the national rate, which rose in May to 9.1 percent, from 9 percent. New York state's unemployment rate in May was 7.9 percent.
 Keith Hall, the commissioner of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, spoke in Manhattan on Thursday about labor-market conditions across the country. He pointed out that the national labor force has shrunk - especially among teenagers and young adults - as workers have become discouraged about their prospects of finding work, but he noted that New York City had been an exception to that trend. 
 "We've had a fairly large exodus from the labor force through this long, deep recession and the months since," Mr. Hall said. "The longer you're unemployed, the worse it is. We have this whole cohort of people who have graduated from high school and college and are not getting employed and have no experience."

HEADLINE: Sanity Alert: Senate Votes to End Billions in Ethanol Subsidies

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: One energy subsidy down, many more to go.

 BODY:
Just one day after the Senate voted to keep costly ethanol tax breaks in place and Climate Progress headlined a news roundup "Ethanol Subsidies Here to Stay," the Senate voted overwhelmingly this afternoon to end the $5-billion-a-year incentive for ethanol production. The vote, according to Wall Street Journal coverage, also would end a 54-cents-a-gallon tariff on imports of the fuel.
There are many subtexts in this effort, many of which are laid out nicely in the Journal article on the earlier vote. It's also important to note, as the Los Angeles Times explains, that the measure is attached to a stalled economic development bill.
The Hill notes that anti-tax campaigners had warned Republicans that a vote to kill this subsidy, if not accompanied by a tax break elsewhere, constituted a vote to raise taxes. Now there's a constructive approach to American fiscal and energy policy.
Still, it's clear that a combination of pressures to cut the deficit, concerns about food prices and clearer information about the dubious merits of most existing methods of producing ethanol has overcome the political heft of farm states. (Farmers can take comfort in the untouched federal mandate requiring that 36 billion gallons a year of biofuel get into automobile fuel tanks by 2022.)
This might be a good time to reflect on the prospects for building support for a fundamental reexamination of incentives and disincentives in energy and innovation policy that could help America lead the way toward a global energy menu that can work for the long haul -- and not just for an array of vested interests.
Compromise would be essential, and a willingness to look at the costs and benefits of subsidies in "clean tech" as well as the fossil arena and nuclear power. But getting started is, to my mind, better than seeking perfection.
Given that the Heritage Foundation's sister lobbying group has pursued action along these lines, there must be some prospect for finding common ground.

HEADLINE: Demag Backs $1.4 Billion Offer From Terex

BYLINE: CHRIS V. NICHOLSON


HIGHLIGHT: Demag Cranes of Germany said that it would accept an improved offer from the Connecticut-based equipment manufacturer in a deal that values the company at about 963 million euros.

 BODY:
Demag Cranes of Germany said Thursday that it would accept an improved offer from the Terex Corporation, the Connecticut-based equipment manufacturer, in a deal that values the company at about 963 million euros ($1.4 billion).
Terex announced an offer last month of 41.75 euros per share for the crane maker, but Demag called the offer too low and rejected the bid. Terex had to raise the bid to 45.50 euros per share -- an 8.9 percent increase -- to win the support of the Demag board.
The bid represents a 25 percent premium over Demag's closing price before the offer was first announced, and a 53 percent premium over the trading price last October when deal rumors began to circulate.
To close, the bid needs the acceptance of 51 percent of Demag's shareholders, who have until June 30 to tender their stock.
Aloysius Rauen, chief executive of Demag, said in a statement that he had secured "important assurances" from Terex regarding employees.
"For a period of three years, Terex guarantees that it will not cause Demag Cranes to announce enforced redundancies as a direct result of the transaction," Demag said. "Terex pledges to fulfill shop agreements and collective bargaining agreements as well as other employee rights."
Demag management is also maintaining a certain autonomy, with Mr. Rauen set to represent the unit before the executive team at Terex. The Connecticut company is also backing Demag in its strategy of growing its mid-market offering and expanding in emerging markets, particularly through a partnership with the Weihua Group, one of China's biggest crane makers.
Over the last decade, Terex has completed four major deals in Germany, its second-largest market. One of those was to buy Demag Mobile Cranes in 2002.
Terex, which supplies equipment to the construction, infrastructure, mining, shipping and energy industries, among others, has 16,300 employees globally, and reported $4.4 billion in sales last year.
Demag makes cranes and their components, specializing in ports, which have had an increase in business in step with the economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Braces for New Layoffs as Profits Wane

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: Faced with weak markets and uncertainty over regulations, many of the biggest firms are preparing for deep cuts in jobs and other costs.

 BODY:
Wall Street plans to get smaller this summer. Faced with weak markets and uncertainty over regulations, many of the biggest firms are preparing for deep cuts in jobs and other costs.
The cutback plans are emerging even as Wall Street firms have mostly recovered from the financial crisis and are reporting substantial profits again. But those profits are not as big as they were before the crisis, and it is expected that in the coming months it will be even more difficult for firms to make money. Worries about debt in Europe and the shape that the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul rules will ultimately take, combined with the usual summer doldrums, are prompting banks to act.
"It's a tense environment right now," said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with the investment bank Nomura.
Even Goldman Sachs, Wall Street's most profitable firm, is retrenching. Senior executives at Goldman have concluded they need to cut 10 percent, or $1 billion, of noncompensation expenses over the next 12 months, according to a person close to the matter who was not authorized to speak on the record. The big pullback will cause Goldman employees, who have already been ordered to cut costs, to re-examine every aspect of their business. 
The firm, this person said, had not set final targets for layoffs, but Goldman was "certain" to shrink headcount in the coming months. Decisions on bonuses are still months away, but they are sure to come down as well if business does not pick up.
Bank of America is also examining its expenses and is likely in the next few months to cut some staff members from its securities division, according to one senior executive at that firm who was not authorized to speak on the record. And Credit Suisse is in the process of identifying people to cut in its investment banking unit, according to a person briefed on that bank's plans.
Morgan Stanley is expected to cut at least 300 low-producing brokers in its wealth management division this year, more than the firm initially expected, and has announced plans to cut $1 billion in noncompensation expenses over the next three years. Unlike many of its rivals, however, the firm so far has no plans to cut staff members from its investment banking and trading division, which has added hundreds of employees over the last two years or so as part of a rebuilding effort after the financial crisis.
Some firms have already wielded the ax. In January, Barclays Capital cut 600 people, or more than 2 percent of its worldwide staff, citing a business slowdown, and recently cut more employees for "performance-related reasons," according to a person briefed on the cuts but not authorized to speak on the record. A third of the January cuts were in New York. 
Regulatory overhaul has weighed on the decisions to cut back, senior bank executives say. Regulation has caused some Wall Street banks to exit some businesses, like proprietary trading. Rules that require banks to hold more capital will probably cause some firms to end certain business lines as they decide they can more effectively deploy the capital elsewhere. On products like derivatives, firms will lose revenue as instruments once traded off exchanges will move into open markets.
While many financial rules are still to be written, some firms have decided that they cannot afford to wait any longer. The last significant industrywide job cuts were in early 2009. In the first quarter of that year Goldman alone cut its work force by almost 9 percent. Since then, most firms have held steady on their head counts or have added to them slightly. That will change this summer.
The scale of the expected cuts is bad news for the New York City economy, which depends heavily on a booming financial industry to pay taxes and fill its restaurants. And they will come as the national economy is still struggling to find its footing since the financial crisis. 
Not all is doom and gloom. Wall Street is benefiting from the boom in social media and technology public offerings. In recent weeks big names like Pandora Media and Linkedin have gone public, brought to market by banks. So far this year, companies have raised $29.3 billion in public offerings, up more than 200 percent from a year ago. This year is on track to be the most lucrative since the technology boom in 2000, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
The profit picture is also somewhat more stable for diversified companies like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, which have large commercial retail banking operations in addition to those in trading and sales. JPMorgan has no immediate plans to cut head count in trading, according to a person briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record. The bank is, however, trying to reduce noncompensation expenses. 
But firms like Bank of America are still paying for mortgage sins of days gone by, which have dimmed their profit pictures. Earlier this year Bank of America put aside another $1 billion to cover claims from outside investors who lost money and want the firm to buy back billions of dollars in bad Countrywide Financial mortgages. The Durbin Amendment, a proposed restriction on debit card fees, is also expected to reduce profits when it comes into effect next month.
For those firms that depend on trading, it is clear how much the engines of Wall Street have slowed. Return on equity, the amount a firm earns on its common stock outstanding and an important measure of financial performance, has decreased significantly in the years since the credit crisis. Industrywide return on equity was 8.2 percent in 2010, down from 17.5 percent in 2005, according to Nomura. 
And this year there is another reason that is prompting Wall Street to act more swiftly on cuts. Wall Street typically pays out roughly half of its revenue in compensation, and firms often wait until late summer to cull staff when they have a better sense of revenue for the year. The newest cuts are expected to come earlier this year because of recent changes in the way employees are paid. 
Traditionally, Wall Street employees get most of their annual pay in the form of a one-time year-end bonus. But after the credit crisis most firms changed the way they compensated employees in an effort to discourage excessive risk-taking, increasing base salaries while reducing performance-related payments. As a result, banks are paying out more compensation as the year goes on, forcing firms to re-evaluate staffing levels earlier in the year because more of their compensation costs are now fixed. 
Firms are also trying to cut noncompensation expenses and are looking for ways to cut fat. Goldman's goal to cut $1 billion in noncompensation expenses this year is significant, analysts say. There will be immediate and significant savings from the fall off in trading volumes. 
Trading firms pay fees to trade, and lower volumes could result in an annual savings of $200 million at Goldman alone, one analyst estimated. Those savings will come naturally, but most will not, and banks will be forced to rein in everything, including travel and professional fees.

HEADLINE: Bachmann Said To Have Deal For Memoir

BYLINE: JULIE BOSMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Ms. Bachmann has been in negotiations with Sentinel, a conservative imprint of Penguin.

 BODY:
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota has made a deal to publish her memoir, selling a book to Sentinel, a conservative imprint at Penguin Group USA, two people familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday.
Ms. Bachmann, a Tea Party favorite who announced her presidential candidacy during the Republican debate on Monday, has been shopping her memoir for weeks, meeting with several New York publishers to discuss a possible deal.
The book is tentatively expected to be released this fall. John Fund, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, will assist with the writing of the book.
One person who saw Ms. Bachmann's proposal said the book was largely biographical, an account of the formation of her political and economic ideas. Ms. Bachmann was "very impressive" in her meetings with publishers, winning over the skeptics in the room, the person said.
Publishers submitted pitches to Ms. Bachmann that included publicity and marketing plans. House members are allowed to receive royalties from book sales but not advances.
Sentinel, founded in 2003, has published books by Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas; the journalist Matthew Continetti; and the conservative columnist Mona Charen.
Will Weisser, the associate publisher of Sentinel, declined to confirm the deal. "We have nothing to announce at this time," he said. "We did have a wonderful meeting with her."

HEADLINE: The Tricky U.S. Reactor Tally

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Workers at the abandoned Bellefonte 1 plant in Alabama hope their reactor will be completed and become No. 106, but with many reactors in jeopardy, the future remains hazy.

 BODY:
At the entrance to the unfinished Bellefonte nuclear plant in Hollywood, Ala., are morale-building posters for Tennessee Valley Authority employees. In bold type, they proclaim "106." 
 The number refers to how many nuclear reactors the United States would have if the Bellefonte 1 reactor were finished, but such prognostications are dicey. 
As I note in Thursday's paper, the Bellefonte project was announced in 1970. Ground was broken in 1974, but the plant was ultimately abandoned in 1988 because of weak demand for its electricity. The board of directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority plans to vote in August on whether to finish Unit 1. 
 At present there are 104 operable power reactors in the United States. (On any given day, several are shut down for one reason or another.) The T.V.A. is already working to finish another long-suspended nuclear project, Watts Bar 2 in Tennessee, a two-hour drive from Bellefonte. That plant is supposed to be completed in 2012, and Bellefonte 1 could be finished by 2020, becoming No. 106.
Except that two or three of the existing 104 may be shut by then. New Jersey had pressed Exelon to build a cooling tower for its Oyster Creek reactor, in Toms River, N.J. Oyster Creek won a 20-year license extension, but then reached an agreement with the state to skip the cooling tower but retire the plant in 10 years. Vermont Yankee, in Vernon, Vt., on the Connecticut River near the Massachusetts border, has won a 20-year license extension but needs a permit from the state if it is to run beyond next spring. Vermont officials are refusing, and the case is in court .
Some other plants around the country may also retire, especially in view of the very low price of natural gas, which makes nuclear power less competitive. Speculation is growing that Progress Energy might decide to shut down its Crystal River reactor near Tampa, Fla., where operators have been trying for nearly two years to fix a problem with the containment building. The Tampa Tribune reported recently that a decision is imminent. 
Further complicating the reactor numbers game, the Southern Company plans to finish two additional units at Plant Vogtle near Augusta, Ga., by 2020, and two more reactors are planned in South Carolina at the site of the existing V.C. Summer reactor.

HEADLINE: Live Blog: Anthony Weiner Resigns

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN and ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Live coverage from Representative Anthony D. Weiner's resignation news conference.

 BODY:
The technology-aided, self-inflicted ordeal of Representative Anthony D. Weiner that began 20 days ago when he unwittingly cc'd the world a lewd photo came to an end in a most old-fashioned way: He announced his resignation Thursday afternoon in a brief speech at the same senior center in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, where he had announced his candidacy for City Council in 1991 at age 26.
For the full story of Mr. Weiner's fall, read Raymond Hernandez's article. Following is a recap of Mr. Weiner's news conference, along with a transcript of his resignation speech. 
6:01 P.M. | Upstaging The Headliner, Basking in Notoriety
Read a piece by Ashley Parker about Benjy Bronk, the provocateur from "The Howard Stern Show" who managed to make Mr. Weiner's farewell announcement into even more of a circus.
3:28 P.M. | Transcript of Weiner's Speech
Good Afternoon. About 20 years ago, I stood in this very same room here at the council center and asked my neighbors for their help to take a chance on me in electing me to the City Council. Then some seven years later, I asked those same people to join with people in Queens in sending me to Congress. 
There is no higher honor in a democracy than to be sent by your neighbors to represent them in the United States House of Representatives. It is particularly humbling to represent this district because the communities and families of the Ninth Congressional District are hard working, they're patriotic, they're opinionated, they are authentic. 
I have never forgotten my neighbors because they represent the same middle-class story as mine. I went to public schools my whole life. My mother was a schoolteacher for 32 years. My father went to law school on the G.I. Bill. The middle-class story of New York is my story, and I'm very proud of that. 
I am here today to again apologize for the personal mistakes I have made and the embarrassment I have caused. I make this apology to my neighbors and my constituents but I make it particularly to my wife, Huma.
I had hoped to be able to continue the work that the citizens of my district elected me to do: to fight for the middle class and those struggling to make it.
Unfortunately, the distraction that I have created has made that impossible, so today I'm announcing my resignation from Congress, [cheers, shouts of "Yeah!"] so my colleagues can get back to work, my neighbors can choose a new representative and most importantly that my wife and I can continue to heal from the damage I have caused. 
[Heckles, commotion.]
To repeat, most importantly, most importantly, so that I can continue to heal from the damage that I have caused. 
I want to thank my colleagues in the House of Representatives, Democrats and Republicans alike. They come from different places around the country, but fundamentally we all agree. They're all patriots and I will miss them all. Thank you. 
I also want to express my gratitude to members of my staff. They're young people who are not paid very much. They're people that work very hard and very long hours. Ultimately, those people define the notion of service. I want to thank, of course, the many people who have helped me, the people who have volunteered, the people who have given me advice, the many of my constituents who have offered me good ideas.
And of course I want to express my gratitude to my family: to my mother and father who instilled in me the values that carried me this far; to my brother, Jason; and, of course, to my wife, Huma, who has stood with me in this entire difficult period and to whom I owe so very much. 
I got into politics to help give voice to the many who simply did not have one. Now I'll be looking for other ways to contribute my talents to make sure that we live up to that most New York and American of ideals: the idea that leading a family, a community and ultimately a country is the one thing that all unites us, the one thing we're all focused on. 
With God's help and with hard work we will all be successful. Thank you and good afternoon. 
3:00 P.M. | During the Announcement, Jeers and Cheers
The businesslike nature and attempted dignity of Mr. Weiner's announcement was repeatedly punctured by shouts from around the packed room. "Bye-bye, pervert!" one man yelled as he announced his resignation. Another called out a vulgar question.
 As Mr. Weiner continued to speak, a chorus of shouts attempted to drown him out.
2:36 P.M. | The Speech: Short and to the Point
Mr. Weiner's speech, brief and to the point, lasted exactly four minutes. Wearing a dark suit, he spoke quickly but carefully. When a heckler shouted "Pervert!" just as he spoke the words "I"m announcing my resignation," he simply spoke louder. 
Mr. Weiner began by recalling how 20 years ago he "stood in this very room in the council center and asked my neighbors for their help in electing me to the City Council." He saluted his constituents and, indirectly, himself. 
"I have never forgotten my neighbors because they represent the same middle-class story as mine," he said.
He offered an apology "to the citizens of my district but particularly to my wife, Huma" and said he was leaving office "most importantly, so that I can continue to heal from the damage that I have caused."
Mr. Weiner thanked his staff, his colleagues his family, and Ms. Abedin, "to whom I owe so much."
Then he strode from the room, ignoring the questions shouted in his wake.
2:24 P.M. | 'I'm Here to Apologize.' Then, He Resigns
Mr. Weiner took the stage at 2:20 p.m.
"I'm here to apologize for the personal mistakes I have made and the embarrassment that I have caused," he said. He said he hoped to continue to serve his constitutents. "Unfortunately, the distraction I created has made that impossible."
With that, he tendered his resignation from the United States Congress.
2:14 P.M. | An Oddly Homey Setting for a Political Drama
Up on the second floor of the senior center, large pastel cloth-and-wire butterflies lazed from the ceiling, belying the caffeinated mood as more than 100 members of the media scrambled into position to await the arrival of Mr. Weiner.
"More people than last week at the bar mitzvah," joked a reporter.
As the reporters climbed the stairs to the room where the news conference would take place, a group of senior citizens gathered to take in the scene, and stood gossiping and craning their necks for a better view.
Inside the room, two American flags had been placed on either side of the microphone bank, and a large white overhead screen was pulled down as the backdrop.
Mr. Weiner's press secretary, Dave Arnold, looked slightly more tired than usual, but he stood near the front of the room, checking his BlackBerry and handling last-minute logistics.
The lights began flashing, and reporters crowded into their seats, waiting for Mr. Weiner to appear.
2:10 P.M. | Video: Ashley Parker Checks In From Outside the Senior Center 
2:01 P.M. | Outside the Senior Center, a Steadfast Supporter
The line in front of the Council Center for Senior Citizens, where Mr. Weiner is expected to announce his resignation, was already surrounded by gray police barricades and snaking nearly to Coney Island Avenue at the end of the block an hour before Mr. Weiner was expected to arrive.
Across the street, patrons of Avi Glatt Kosher, a large market with a blue awning and an oversize menorah on top, gathered outside to take in the scene, gawking at the news anchors doing their stand-ups.
And in the press line, Vicku Hodja, 53, stood waiting to support Mr. Weiner, her longtime congressman who always appeared at her childrens' school to handout awards for stellar attendance and good behavior.
"Human beings: they make mistakes but they learn from them," she said. "He hurt nobody. He only hurt himself, his wife. There's unemployment, the country's going down, and they have another Weiner story? C'mon!"
Ms. Hodja blamed his troubles on modern technology.
"I know the computer is dangerous to everyone," Ms. Hodja said. "It brings the devil in the house."
Ms. Hodja did, however, have some words of advice for Ms. Abedin: "She needs to take the Hillary Clinton steps. If you put your man down, you're putting yourself down."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Annoyed at Senate for Letting Rent Rules Lapse

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Cuomo chastized lawmakers for failing to act on rent regulations and threatened to keep them in Albany if the regulations are not renewed.

 BODY:
ALBANY - Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo sharply criticized the State Senate on Thursday after it rejected a short-term extension of the state's rent laws minutes before they expired at midnight on Wednesday.
The state's top housing official urged tenants not to panic after the rent laws, which limit how much landlords can charge for more than one million apartments in the New York City area, lapsed.
Mr. Cuomo, who favors strengthening the rent laws in an effort to slow the rate at which rent-regulated apartments are converted to market-rate homes, has also urged tenants to remain calm while the Legislature works. But the governor expressed irritation at the surprise turn of events Wednesday night, when senators returned from a dinner break after 10 p.m. and an odd coalition of Democrats who want rent regulations strengthened and Republicans who want them eliminated joined forces to defeat a short-term extension of the existing rules.
Mr. Cuomo threatened to keep the Legislature in Albany beyond the scheduled end of its session Monday if rent regulations are not renewed.
"We are making progress, but the Senate's failure to act last night was unacceptable and a betrayal of the one million tenants living in rent protected apartments," the governor said in a statement. "I will not allow the Legislature to go out of session and go home until tenants are protected."
State officials said that the lapsing of the rent laws - which has occurred during similarly contentious negotiations in years past - would cause no short-term impact. Tenants living in rent-regulated apartments cannot not see their rent changed through the duration of their leases, and anyone with a lease expiring in the coming days should have already been offered a lease renewal and decided whether to accept it, locking in their rate-regulated rent for the next year. Darryl C. Towns, the commissioner of the state's housing agency, New York State Homes and Community Renewal, issued a statement on Thursday in which he promised that his office would focus its attention on ensuring that tenants remain protected while lawmakers negotiate a long-term extension of the rent laws.
Mr. Towns said he had established a 24-hour toll-free phone line - (855) 391-4526 - for residents to call if landlords seek to take advantage of the Albany stalemate by illegally seeking to raise their rent or evict them from their rent-regulated apartments. Complaints can also be submitted via e-mail to rentlaws2011@nyshcr.org

HEADLINE: Capital One to Buy ING's Online Bank for $9 Billion

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Capital One Financial will buy ING Group's online banking business in the United States for about $9 billion in cash and stock, in an effort to bolster its banking operations.

 BODY:
9:54 p.m. | Updated 
Capital One Financial agreed on Thursday to buy the ING Group's online banking unit in the United States for $9 billion in cash and stock, one of its biggest efforts yet to add to offerings beyond credit cards and other consumer lending.
Under the terms of the deal, Capital One will pay $6.2 billion in cash and issue $2.8 billion worth of new shares to ING, giving it a 9.9 percent stake. ING will also have the right to name a director on Capital One's board.
Long known for cheeky credit card ads asking customers "What's in your wallet?" Capital One is seeking to build up a national banking franchise. Buying ING Direct USA, one of the best-known online banks in the country, will help give Capital One a broader platform and a huge source of lower-cost funds.
Currently the eighth-biggest bank in the country by deposits, Capital One will rise to the fifth-biggest through the deal.
"The acquisition of ING Direct is a game-changing transaction that delivers attractive deal economics immediately and compelling long-term strategic value," Richard D. Fairbank, Capital One's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
ING was reluctant to shed its online banking business, one of its crown jewels and a leader in the expanding direct banking industry. But it was forced to sell off the unit by the European Commission as part of the bank's 10 billion euro bailout in 2008.
"Although I regret that ING Direct USA will no longer be a part of ING, I am very pleased that we have found in Capital One a good home for our customers and employees, who are very important to the continued success of the ING Direct USA Business," Jan H. M. Hommen, ING's chief executive, said in a statement.
Capital One emerged the winner of a relatively crowded auction, one that also included General Electric's GE Capital and the CIT Group, according to people briefed on the matter. One of the reasons Capital One prevailed was its willingness to shoulder more than $60 billion worth of mortgages and mortgage-linked securities.
In order to help pay for the transaction, Capital One said it planned to raise about $2 billion from a sale of new shares and $3.7 billion from selling new debt.
But the bank insists that the deal will pay for itself quickly. Capital One expects to reap $90 million in savings from combining back-end systems and staff, as well as $200 million from lowering funding costs. The transaction will also add to Capital One's earnings per share beginning next year.
Shares in Capital One began rising on Thursday afternoon after Dow Jones reported news of the impending deal, closing up $1.13, or 2.4 percent, at $49.
The deal is expected to close by the end of the year or early next year, pending regulatory approval.
Capital One was advised by Morgan Stanley, Barclays Capital, Centerview Partners and the law firms Mayer Brown, Loyens & Loeff and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. ING Direct was advised by Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase.

HEADLINE: The Memory of Bush

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Why it's still Obama's secret weapon, and what that means for Republicans in 2012.

 BODY:
As the economy continues to struggle, Jay Cost compares Barack Obama to Jimmy Carter, and Walter Russell Mead compares him to Herbert Hoover. But HotAir's Allahpundit, parsing the numbers from the latest Wall Street Journal poll, suggests why neither of those shoes quite fit. Neither Carter nor Hoover could credibly pin the country's economic problems on their predecessor, but the country still assigns George W. Bush much more of the blame for our ongoing malaise than it assigns to Obama.We like to goof on The One for blaming Bush for his problems, but the reason he does that is because it works. People remember who was president when the financial crisis struck, they remember having utterly lost confidence in that guy for various reasons during his second term, and they're prepared to cut O a wide, wide berth on the economy because of it.The numbers he's talking about show that 62 percent of Americans still call the current economic picture "a situation Obama inherited," and only 25 percent call it a situation that the president's policies are "mostly responsible for." As Allahpundit notes, those numbers will probably "move as we get closer to the election," since "the number who say he inherited the economy plunged as the midterms approached." But it's still a built-in advantage that most presidents presiding over these kind of jobs numbers wouldn't enjoy. And if you're a Republican candidate in 2012, the resilience of this advantage (and the memory of Bush that it's founded on) seems like a good reason not to run for president on an economic agenda that just doubles down on supply-side economics, while refusing to admit that there were any problems with the Bush economy that couldn't have been solved with more tax cuts for businesses and investors.
When I offered exactly that critique of Tim Pawlenty's economic plan, Nick Schulz objected:Pawlenty's proposed tax reforms are substantive and unambiguously growth oriented. Bush, on the other hand, was far from a serious tax reformer. He cut tax rates, yes, but left the system largely intact and exceedingly complicated.
It's worth remembering that Bush's political approach to taxes was often explicitly designed to appeal to middle-class voters (e.g. the expanded child credit). It yielded results Ross now rightly criticizes.
Any given politician's policies can have only so much effect on economic growth. And Ross and some other skeptics of growth politics are right to argue that growth can't solve all the nation's problems. But they make the opposite blunder by giving short shrift to what growth can accomplish. It's a mistake to characterize Pawlenty's approach-which is nothing if not bold reform with growth at the core-as Bush redux.The policy questions here deserve a longer reply. (In a nutshell, I think it's possible to craft a pro-growth tax reform - a hybrid of Simpson-Bowles and Ponnuru-Stein, maybe - that's roughly distributionally neutral and doesn't blow a hole in the deficit, both tests that I suspect Pawlenty's plan would fail.) But I just want to focus on the political implications of the argument that Pawlenty's tax policies represent a big improvement on the Bush tax cuts.
You'll recall that Bush cut taxes on upper earners, capital gains, estates, dividends, etc. He also cut taxes on families and the middle class. He also cut taxes without offsetting the cuts with spending reductions, on the assumption that growth would take care of any deficits that ensued. He didn't reform the tax code by shrinking the number of brackets, as Pawlenty proposes to do. As Schulz notes, Bush's mix of policies earned disappointing results - not necessarily in terms of overall growth rates (at least before the financial crisis), but in terms of wage growth for middle class and downscale Americans, and in terms of their impact on the national debt. So against that backdrop and amid those memories, the Pawlenty plan would send Republicans to the hustings with a tax plan that's likely to increase the deficit, and with the argument that the reason wage growth for the middle class was so disappointing in the Bush years was that Bush's tax policies were too weighted toward middle-class concerns (!), and didn't go far enough in flattening the tax burden and lowering rates on investors and the rich. In other words: Dear middle class American, we're going to address the economic anxieties you experienced in the '00s with a deficit-increasing tax reform that's much more favorable, in its initial impact, to the wealthiest quintile of the country than were the Bush tax cuts. 
My view of this argument - that the path to middle-class prosperity is paved with more, and still more, upper-income tax cuts - is similar to my view of the oft-heard Democratic talking point that the 2009 stimulus package would have worked if only it had been much, much larger than the (extraordinary, unprecedented) package we actually passed. Even if I were completely convinced of the economic case in either instance, I would still be dismissive of the political case, on the grounds that a policy is only actually feasible and worth championing if you have some hope of persuading a majority of Americans (and their elected representatives) to go along with it. Any Republican tax plan that can be caricatured as "more Bush than Bush" seems likely to fail that test, and give Barack Obama a great political gift into the bargain.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
In response to its critics in Congress, the White House has justified continuing the United States's limited role in NATO operations in Libya without lawmakers' approval by arguing that a deadline set in the War Powers Act doesn't apply to the mission. Charlie Savage and Mark Landler explain that the Obama administration says the conflict does not rise to the level of full-blown hostilities set forth by the law. The escalating confrontation with Congress over Libya reflects the radically altered political landscape in Washington over executive war powers.

Wald reports that nuclear regulators have concluded that safety rules in the United States do not adequately weigh the risk that a single event would knock out electricity from both the grid and from emergency generators, as an earthquake and tsunami recently did at a nuclear plant in Japan. The findings by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will be the subject of a Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works hearing scheduled at 10 a.m.
Competing immigration bills introduced this week in the House and Senate by Republicans and Democrats suggests that some legislation could pass this year, before election year politics overwhelms the discussion, Julia Preston writes. In a switch of their traditional roles, Democrats are courting business with proposals to increase green cards for math and science graduates of American colleges, while Republicans are playing to their supporters with a bill that businesses oppose, which would require electronic verification for everyone who applies for a job in the United States.
States are bracing for the end to a federal injection of cash into Medicaid that runs out at the end of this month despite increased unemployment rates, Robert Pear writes. He explains how states are trying to hold down costs for the program, which provides health care coverage to low-income people, even as costs are expected to rise in other parts of the health care system.
Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Md., was once a place where Washington's political power brokers could go to relax and maybe make a deal or two. But members of Congress aren't likely to be heading to the club, even as it hosts the U.S. Open this week, Juliet Macur reports. Lawmakers are wary of golf's reputation because it has been tied to lobbying scandals and they fear that constituents will condemn them for spending their time on the links.

HEADLINE: Romney: 'I'm Also Unemployed'

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney met with a group of unemployed Floridians in Tampa on Thursday.

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. - Mitt Romney sat at the head of the table at a coffee shop here on Thursday, listening to a group of unemployed Floridians explain the challenges of looking for work. When they finished, he weighed in with a predicament of his own.
"I should tell my story," Mr. Romney said. "I'm also unemployed."
He chuckled. The eight people gathered around him, who had just finished talking about strategies of finding employment in a slow-to-recover economy, joined him in laughter.
"Are you on LinkedIn?" one of the men asked.
"I'm networking," Mr. Romney replied. "I have my sight on a particular job."
The morning coffee hour at Buddy Brew Coffee here on West Kennedy Boulevard was interrupted by a conversation about small businesses and job creation as Mr. Romney finished a three-day swing through Florida. While his visit was largely focused on fund-raising, he spent more than an hour promoting his pitch that he would be a stronger steward of the economy than President Obama.
But any of the bravado that accompanied him in the wake of his first presidential debate on Monday in New Hampshire - he vowed to return to the state in four years, accompanied by a Secret Service detail - was absent. He took a humble, self-deprecating approach.
"I wish I had a job for everybody," Mr. Romney said at the end of his discussion. He added, "I may be unemployed for longer than I'd like."
The references to Mr. Romney's own unemployment status added yet another humorous, but occasionally awkward, moment to his ever-growing catalog of off-the-cuff remarks that he makes as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination. He spent the morning doing more listening than talking - a woman in the crowd openly urged him to talk about the deficit - and it was unclear whether he persuaded any voters to join his effort.
Tom Yarranton, 55, lost his job in March 2010. He had spent 31 years as an internal auditor at a manufacturing company. He said he liked Mr. Romney's mind-set as a businessman, but added that he did not blame Mr. Obama for still being unemployed.
"I'm not mad at him," Mr. Yarranton said in an interview after the session ended. "It's amazing in politics. They're all into pointing fingers at each other. The Republicans right now are so mad at the Democrats, but nobody is doing anything."
The sentiment illustrated the long-term challenge for Mr. Romney and other Republican candidates as they try to win over independent voters - and, perhaps, even some conservative Democrats - to accomplish their ultimately goal on Election Day in November 2012.
In the conversation with voters, Mr. Romney modulated his criticism of the president, saying, "I won't be too partisan here." A few moments later, as he stood before television cameras, he ratcheted up his disapproval.
"We have all been distressed by the policies that this administration has put in place over the last two years," Mr. Romney said. "We have seen the most anti-investment, anti-growth, anti-job strategy in America since Jimmy Carter. The result has been it's harder and harder for people to find work."
Joan Savage, who described herself as a die-hard Republican, said she was uncertain whether her party could win back the White House. She said that she walked away with a favorable impression of Mr. Romney, but added, "I don't know that anyone can beat Obama right now."
The path to that fight will begin here in Tampa, where Republicans will hold their national convention next summer and formally crown their nominee to challenge Mr. Obama.

HEADLINE: Among Democrats, Relief as Weiner Bows Out

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Democrats breathed a collective sigh of relief after Representative Anthony D. Weiner finally resigned.

 BODY:
3:46 p.m. | Updated Democratic leaders wished Representative Anthony D. Weiner well after he announced his resignation on Thursday, as the party looked forward to an end to weeks of scandal.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said in a statement that Mr. Weiner "exercised poor judgment in his actions and poor judgment in his reaction to the revelations," but that he had "made the right judgment in resigning."
She added that Mr. Weiner made the decision with "the confidence of his constituents and the recognition of his need for help," adding, "I pray for him and his family and wish them well."
Representative Steve Israel of New York, the man charged with electing Democrats to the House during the 2012 election, said in a a statement that Mr. Weiner's decision was "right for him and his family, our party and our country, because we have serious work to do in Congress."
Democratic lawmakers and candidates across the country had expressed frustration for the last two weeks as Mr. Weiner sought to stay in office amid revelations that he had engaged in lewd online exchanges with several women. The scandal threatened to rob the party of any control over its campaign-season message and grew more distracting with almost daily disclosures about Mr. Weiner's actions.
"Last week, Republican leaders introduced a bill to privatize Social Security, and the American people deserve an undistracted debate on it, Medicare, jobs and other important issues," Mr. Israel said, seeking to turn the page back to the economic debate.
Neither Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who had called on Mr. Weiner to resign, nor officials at the White House issued statements immediately after Mr. Weiner's announcement.
The scandal has proved to be a distraction for Ms. Pelosi and her fellow Democrats, who have been eager to refocus public attention on Republican budget plans to revamp the Medicare system. Before Mr. Weiner's announcement, several Democratic lawmakers said his departure would allow the party to focus again on issues like the economy and jobs.
"The hemorrhaging will stop," Representative Raul M. Grijalva of Arizona said on MSNBC. "The hemorrhaging politically to the institution will begin to subside as well."
Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, said on MSNBC that Mr. Weiner had made "the right decision" to resign.
"Truthfully, I think it's been a while coming," Mr. Tester said.
Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York said in a statement, "There is life after Congress for Anthony Weiner, and I hope he devotes himself to repairing the damage he caused to his personal life."
Even Republicans had described Mr. Weiner's situation in similar ways. In comments to reporters this week, Speaker John A. Boehner said the scandal had "just been a distraction to the American people.

HEADLINE: Big Deal | Soon After Buying, Developer to Sell Fifth Avenue Co-op

BYLINE: SARAH KERSHAW


HIGHLIGHT: William Lie Zeckendorf is asking $31.5 million for an apartment at 927 Fifth Avenue. He paid $29.1 million for it last December.

 BODY:
William Lie Zeckendorf, a developer of 15 Central Park West who made a $30 million profit on the sale of his penthouse in the building late last year, has already listed the new apartment he bought in December, at 927 Fifth Avenue, according to brokers familiar with his decision.
Brown Harris Stevens is listing Mr. Zeckendorf's co-op at 927 Fifth Avenue, currently configured with five bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms, for $31.5 million this weekend. He closed on it for $29.1 million, according to property records, buying it from the estate of Bruce Wasserstein, the chairman and chief executive of Lazard who died in 2009. 
In addition to Mr. Wasserstein, other well-known residents of 927 Fifth have included Mary Tyler Moore and Pale Male, the red-tailed hawk safely ensconced in a 12th-floor aerie at the prewar co-op.
Given the listing price, Mr. Zeckendorf obviously isn't planning on realizing anything like the dizzying profits of his 15 Central Park West apartment, for which he paid $10 million. But the brokers said the reasons for his selling again were unknown at this point.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Frets Over New Rules

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Wall Street is stepping up its attacks on new financial regulation, warning Congress that restrictions threaten to weaken big banks and the broader economy.

 BODY:
Wall Street is stepping up its attacks on new financial regulation, warning Congress on Thursday that a wave of restrictions threatens to weaken big banks and the broader United States economy. 
"The regulatory pendulum clearly has now begun to swing to a point that risks hobbling our financial system and our economic growth," Barry Zubrow, JPMorgan Chase's chief risk officer, said in prepared testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. 
The concerns center on the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory overhaul that has emerged as the scorn of Wall Street. Enacted in the wake of the financial crisis, the law reforms some of the industry's biggest profit centers, including derivatives trading and debit card fees. 
JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and other financial titans are positioning themselves as victims of the law, amid rising fears that it will enable big European banks to poach their business. Foreign regulators, the banks complain, have a lighter touch than Washington policymakers. 
"U.S. regulations that are being implemented on a unilateral basis are threatening the competitiveness of the U.S. markets," Timothy Ryan, president and chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, told the committee. 
The banks in particular loathe the thought of tougher capital requirements. Under Dodd-Frank, a council of regulators must designate the financial firms - including mutual funds, private equity shops and hedge funds - that pose a systemic risk to the financial system. These firms, and banks like JPMorgan that have more than $50 billion in assets, will face higher capital requirements. 
JPMorgan and its fellow Wall Street firms object to the additional layer of capital, calling it a "surcharge." The banks note that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision already is enforcing its own international capital requirements. The so-called Basel III rules require JPMorgan to hold 45 percent more capital than it had stored away during the crisis, according to Mr. Zubrow.
"Considering a capital surcharge above Basel III levels that does not adequately account for the changes that have been made," he said. 
Banks also predict a grim future for their derivatives business, an industry at the center of the financial crisis. 
Dodd-Frank requires many derivatives contracts to be traded on regulated exchanges and run through clearinghouses, which act as a backstop in case one party defaults. Dodd-Frank, banks say, could push derivatives business and profits overseas as the rules do not match up with foreign regulations. 
"It could put U.S. markets at a serious competitive disadvantage," Stephen O'Connor, a top Morgan Stanley derivatives official and chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, said in prepared testimony on behalf of the association. 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities Exchange Commission, charged with writing the new rules, recently delayed their implementation plan. But they still plan to finalize the regulations later this year, while international regulators plan to wait until the end of 2012. 
The European Commission, the European Union's executive body, has discussed similar rules, but the regulators may take until 2012 or later to complete the overhaul. 
Gary Gensler, chairman of the trading commission, said his agency was "actively coordinating with international regulators to promote robust and consistent standards."
Until the European rules are completed, banks in the United States say they will have to collect margin from pension funds and other investors looking to enter a derivatives deal. But a European bank booking a deal out of, say, London or Frankfurt would not have to collect any upfront collateral payments, giving them a competitive edge. 
The "draconian" margin requirements could "effectively end" Wall Street's overseas derivatives business," Mr. Zubrow said. 
Mr. Gensler noted, however, that new regulations were needed to rein in the derivatives markets. 
"Though two years have passed, we cannot forget that the 2008 financial crisis was very real," he told the committee.

HEADLINE: Fun (Actually in the Water!) on the Trinity River

BYLINE: By JOE NICK PATOSKI. 
Joe Nick Patoski is a frequent contributor to these pages. His first swimming hole experience was on the Clear Fork of the Trinity River in Fort Worth.

 BODY:
The scene near downtown Fort Worth was surreal. On a Thursday night in early June, several hundred people, mostly young adults, stripped to their swimsuits and floated atop inner tubes on the Trinity River clutching soda and beer cans while listening to Josh Weathers & the True Endeavors playing on a stage on the west bank above a sign that read ''Trinity River Vision.''
It was as if the Guadalupe River had been magically transported 250 miles north. 
The Trinity has never been much-loved like the Guad, the San Marcos or the Frio -- the state's most popular recreational rivers, all of which are fed by artesian springs bubbling out of rocky Hill Country limestone and run relatively swift and clear. The Trinity is wide and muddy for most of its 710-mile journey from the northern prairie to the Gulf of Mexico northeast of Houston. By the time the Clear and West Forks reach Fort Worth, dams, channels and levees give the river an industrial look even when there is no industry nearby.
The Trinity wasn't always this way, and for the first time, both Dallas and Fort Worth are making efforts to revitalize it and make it a destination for recreation.
A $4 million kayak park, called the Dallas Wave whitewater park, below the confluence of the Elm and West Forks, is one element of Dallas's Trinity River Corridor Project, a $2.5 billion undertaking approved by the city's voters in 1998 to transform the historically neglected Trinity flood plain into the nation's largest urban park. So far, the most visible signs of the makeover, the largest urban development in Big D's history, are the 400-foot-tall arched tower of the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge and the $37 million Trinity River Audubon Center, the gateway to the 6,000-acre Great Trinity Forest, the largest urban hardwood forest in the United States.
In Fort Worth, the $909 million Trinity Vision venture is centered on the creation of a Trinity Uptown addition to downtown, with residential and commercial developments clustered around a San Antonio-inspired river walk.
Both cities' efforts have come with criticism and stumbles. Cost overruns and expensive add-ons like a toll road inside the levees in Dallas -- now all but dead -- have bogged down the Trinity River Corridor Project, while Trinity Vision has been attacked for its use of eminent domain to the benefit of private developers.
The planned opening of the Dallas Wave was delayed in May because of public safety concerns about its design, although some paddlers appear more concerned about pollution in the river. It's cleaner 30 miles upstream in Fort Worth but still urbanized enough that worries persist about the fecal coliform count in the water and elevated levels of highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls that have led to a ban on fish consumption.
Still, the Trinity project has forward momentum. A low dam constructed west of downtown Fort Worth has created a standing wave for kayakers and surfers since 2006, and there's a new wakeboard park, Cowtown Wakepark, with cable tow lines built on a five-acre, artificial lake adjacent to the Trinity on Fort Worth's north side.
Tubing is the latest recreation option added to the mix. Last Thursday's event was the first of six Rockin' the River tube floats scheduled for this summer by Trinity Vision, featuring live music, lifeguards and discounts at nearby bars in the newly hopping West Seventh district just west of downtown.
Judging from the photographs that Wendy Stane of The Fort Worth Star-Telegram posted on Facebook, most of the participants enjoyed themselves -- and the stereotypical urban river experience was nowhere in sight
''We never encountered any bloated bodies or trash or other weirdness in the area we floated,'' said Ms. Stane, a veteran tuber. ''Other than sticks, leaves and mud, we had no problems.''
While she wishes for more sand in the launching area and portable showers so floaters can rinse off when they leave the river, Ms. Stane's critique is one that city officials will be glad to hear. ''I would definitely do it again,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Tentative Deal on Contract Forestalls a Strike at Macy's

BYLINE: By ADRIANE QUINLAN

 BODY:
There will be no picket lines on 34th Street, no marching in Herald Square. Tourists who feared their jaunts to New York might be ruined by a strike at Macy's need worry no longer: the department store and its employees reached a tentative agreement on a new contract. 
The deal was reached around 7 a.m. Thursday after an all-night negotiating session, as talks continued beyond the union-imposed midnight deadline that would have put roughly 4,000 employees on strike at the flagship store in Manhattan, and three others in the Bronx, Queens and Westchester.
The workers must still ratify the contract through a vote.
While neither side would discuss specifics until after the contract is presented to the first group of employees at 5 p.m. Thursday, Joan Solomon, a Macy's worker who participated in the contract talks, said that a new health care plan is more affordable than the one previously presented.
Before the deal was reached, union officials said that management had proposed terms that would have raised health care costs, shift an unspecified number of full-time workers to part-time schedules, and institute a starting salary of $7.50 - all things that the union had been contesting.
Ken Bordieri, president of Local 1-S of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union, called the tentative agreement a ''solid contract,'' and a spokeswoman for Macy's, Elina Kazan, said in a statement that the new contract ''addresses the economic and business realities of the retailing industry, while keeping jobs at Macy's among the best in the department store industry.''
Stuart Appelbaum, the union's president, felt the agreement was symbolic in a union-busting recession. ''All we hear is that working people have to give concessions and provide givebacks and just feel lucky to have any job at all and just agree with what is offered,'' he said. ''These negotiations serve as an important symbol for working people in New York that you can make gains for yourself and your family.''
Riding the bus back to her home in Canarsie, Brooklyn, after the all-night negotiation session, Ms. Solomon, who has worked at the flagship store's cosmetics counter for the past 15 years, said she was tired but happy. ''You're not going to please everybody,'' she said. ''But I'm quite sure the majority will be pleased.''
She said she was going home to sleep until 5 p.m., when she needed to return to Manhattan for a vote. She, for one, said she would vote yes. The contract could be ratified by Wednesday, when the last group of the union's 3,800 workers covered under the contract will vote.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Michele Bachmann Memoir

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota has made a deal to publish her memoir, selling a book to Sentinel, a conservative imprint at Penguin Group USA, two people familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday. 
Ms. Bachmann, a Tea Party favorite who announced her presidential candidacy during the Republican debate on Monday, has been shopping her memoir for weeks, meeting with several New York publishers to discuss a possible deal.
The book is tentatively expected to be released this fall. John Fund, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, will assist with the writing of the book.
One person who saw Ms. Bachmann's proposal said the book was largely biographical, an account of the formation of her political and economic ideas. Ms. Bachmann was ''very impressive'' in her meetings with publishers, winning over the skeptics in the room, the person said.
Publishers submitted pitches to Ms. Bachmann that included publicity and marketing plans. House members are allowed to receive royalties from book sales but not advances.
Sentinel, founded in 2003, has published books by Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas; the journalist Matthew Continetti; and the conservative columnist Mona Charen.
Will Weisser, the associate publisher of Sentinel, declined to confirm the deal. ''We have nothing to announce at this time,'' he said. ''We did have a wonderful meeting with her.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Mercury Is Looking
More Interesting
For years, many planetary scientists did not express much curiosity about Mercury, which looked gray and cratered -- a slightly larger version of the Moon. But data released from NASA's Mercury Messenger spacecraft, which entered orbit around Mercury in March, is painting a more vibrant picture of the solar system's innermost planet. PAGE A21

OBITUARIES
Bob Banner, 89
A producer during television's early years, Bob Banner began working in television in 1948 and helped shape the new medium, mainly as an executive producer. For one of his shows,''Candid Camera,'' he had to solve the problem of hiding cameras from unsuspecting subjects. He was known for crisp camera work, and for trying new things, like doing a variety show (''Garroway at Large'' in 1949) with no studio audience. PAGE B14

Museums
- American Folk Art Museum: 'Quilts: Masterworks from the American Folk Art Museum' (through Oct. 16) This exhibition celebrating quilts from the museum's collection reveals the optical vitality of these eminently pictorial textiles. Ranging across a variety of patterns and techniques and nearly two centuries, the examples here effortlessly combine personal and national histories with rigorous down-home formalism, all the while making brilliant use of available, often humble, fabrics. The various geometric ins and outs, color contrasts and boldly scaled compositions confirm that quilts, like Navajo blankets, are among the earliest abstract art in post-conquest North America. 45 West 53rd Street , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20110616
American Folk Art Museum: 'Super Stars: Quilts From the American Folk Art Museum' (through Sept. 25) In conjunction with the exhibition of quilts at the main museum, its branch is featuring 20 quilts in which stars figure in some way, whether as pieced-together geometric forms or as little tufts of thread that suggest a distant galaxy. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue, at 66th Street , (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Smith)20110616 
American Folk Art Museum: 'Eugene Von Bruenchenhein: Freelance Artist -- Poet and Sculptor -- Inovator -- Arrow maker and Plant man -- Bone artifacts constructor -- Photographer and Architect -- Philosopher' (through Oct. 9) Whether photographing his wife as a sweetly chaste pinup girl; fashioning plant forms from scrounged clay or little thrones from salvaged turkey bones; or making delicate ballpoint-pen drawings or hallucinatory paintings rife with intimations of exotic undersea or sci-fi worlds, this self-taught, self-proclaimed multitasker (as made clear in the show's subtitle) never wavered in his sense of his own greatness. Mounted 27 years after his death, his first American museum survey doesn't quite do him justice and especially shortchanges the paintings, but it presents the fruits of his ceaseless labors with a clarity that makes them feel of a piece, and like a gift. 45 West 53rd Street , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Smith)20110616
Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum: 'Set in Style: The Jewelry of Van Cleef & Arpels' (through July 4) Van Cleef & Arpels, the century-old French jewelry firm, is the primary sponsor of this show and has supplied much of its mega-carat menu: some 350 lavish pieces worn by royals, screen sirens and social swans. Although extravagance doesn't seem out of place in this former Carnegie mansion, the show often looks as if it were put together by the company's creative directors and merchandisers. The visitors lining up around the block don't seem to care, as long as they can linger over pieces like a maharani's carved-emerald necklace and large sapphire-and-diamond pendant earrings worn by Elizabeth Taylor. 2 East 91st Street , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20110616
Guggenheim Museum: 'The Hugo Boss Prize 2010: Hans-Peter Feldmann' (through Nov. 2) Mr. Feldmann, the septuagenarian German artist who was the surprise pick for the Boss Prize honors, has decided to exhibit his prize money -- in the form of 100,000 $1 bills, pinned to the wall of one of the Guggenheim's Tower galleries. What sounds on paper like a conceptual stunt or a riff on Warholian materialism becomes overpoweringly physical in person, thanks to the smell of the used bills and the traces of their circulation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)20110616
- International Center of Photography: 'Elliott Erwitt: Personal Best' (through Aug. 28) Like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Mr. Erwitt seeks ''the decisive moment,'' an instant in real time when people, animals or objects appear before the camera in surprising, funny and illuminating ways. The Henny Youngman of photographic one-liners, he delivers visual humor with such economy and grace that it is easy to overlook just how excellent an artist he is. This show presents more than 100 of his favorite images from the past seven decades. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Ken Johnson)20110616
Jewish Museum: 'Collecting Matisse and Modern Masters: The Cone Sisters of Baltimore' (through Sept. 25) At the Jewish Museum, this exhibition samples the extraordinary trove of European art amassed by two American spinsters in the first half of the 20th century, work now owned by the Baltimore Museum of Art. Although some major collection highlights are absent, the pieces here -- presented in the order of acquisition -- generate a compelling portrait of the Cones as collectors. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20110616
Jewish Museum: 'Maira Kalman: Various Illuminations (of a Crazy World)' (through July 31) Like her fellow New Yorker magazine contributors Ed Koren and Roz Chast, Ms. Kalman offers gently humorous cartoon commentary on the trials and tribulations of modern metropolitan life. Ranging in style from faux-naive eccentricity to suave realism, the more than two decades worth of drawings and paintings on paper in this career survey make for an entertaining if not deeply provocative experience. With a flea market-like installation of nondescript objects from her personal collection, however, she tries too hard to be amazingly original. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110616
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Andean Tunic, 400 B.C.E.-1800 C.E.' (through Sept. 18) This small show celebrates the festive yet functional garments woven south of the equator. To the modern eye, they're wearable paintings; lovers of Keith Haring and Elizabeth Murray will find much to admire. So will anyone interested in the complex relationships among art, clothing, ritual and power. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20110616
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Anthony Caro on the Roof' (through Oct. 30) No one in the 1960s produced groovier abstract sculpture than the British artist Anthony Caro, five of whose heavy metal assemblages grace the Met's Rooftop Garden. But only one of these works has that startling, newborn feeling. Sporting a new coat of shiny, taxicab-yellow paint, ''Midday'' (1960) has the look of a jaunty, industrial dinosaur. The others, dating from 1968 to 2010, show a development toward an increasingly conservative, ponderous monumentality. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110616
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Guitar Heroes: Legendary Craftsmen from Italy to New York' (through July 4) The heroes of this exceptionally interesting show are three craftsmen known for producing some of the most sought-after jazz guitars of the 20th century. Part I surveys a history of Italian luthiers from 17th-century Naples to Italian immigrants producing string instruments in New York in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Part II presents lovingly made archtop guitars and mandolins dating from 1923 to 2008 by inheritors of that tradition: John D'Angelico, James D'Aquisto and John Monteleone. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110616
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty' (through Aug. 7) A triumph for this British fashion designer -- who died at 40, by his own hand, last year -- and for the curator Andrew Bolton of the Met's Costume Institute, this career retrospective is ethereal and gross, graceful and manipulative, and poised on a line where fashion turns into something else. The operatic spectacle is pushed along by soundtrack of wind, Handel and orgiastic moans, and has a holographic image of Kate Moss spinning like a moth in a flame at the center. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20110616
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Night Vision: Photography After Dark' (through Sept. 18) It wasn't until the gelatin dry-plate process was introduced in the late 1880s that exposure time was lowered enough for photographs to be taken regularly after dark. Alfred Stieglitz was among the first to photograph New York at night. His work is shown alongside Berenice Abbott's spectral ''Nightview, New York'' from 1932, taken from the window of a skyscraper; Brassai's nocturnal views of Paris; and Weegee's high-contrast picture of a crime scene. Diane Arbus, Bill Brandt, Robert Frank, Garry Winogrand and Kohei Yoshiyuki are among the other artists included in this modest, lovely show of 40 black-and-white photographs drawn from the museum's collection, which stops a couple of decades short of the present. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)20110616
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Poetry in Clay: Korean Buncheong Ceramics from Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art' (through Aug. 14) This beautiful exhibition presents bottles, vases, bowls and dishes made by 15th- and 16th-century Korean artisans. In shades of gray, from creamy and opalescent off-whites to deep, warm blacks, the anonymous craftsmen covered vessels with loosely rendered images of flora and fauna and fine-grained patterns of dots and tiny blossoms. These infectiously lively works look as if they'd been made not centuries but only decades ago. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110616
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Rooms with a View: The Open Window in the 19th Century' (through July 4) This compact, quietly splendid exhibition explores the window as luminous light source, as semi-abstract compositional element and as the focal point for a certain poignant, implicitly Romantic yearning. The images -- mostly by German, French and Scandinavian artists before 1830 -- depict both domestic settings and artists' studios and are passively subversive in their avoidance of large-scale, historical themes and formal portraiture. They show us a world on the verge of electricity, photography and industrialization, a moment of irretrievable, partly fictive calm that incites some yearning of its own. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Richard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective' (through Aug. 28) Few artists have pushed drawing to such sculptural and even architectural extremes as Mr. Serra, so it makes sense that his adamantine pursuit of the medium, surveyed in an installation that he largely designed himself, is not quite like anything seen at the Met before. There are moments of off-putting starkness on Mr. Serra's side and some of the usual architectural infelicities on the Met's, but as a demonstration of this august institution's willingness to engage with genuinely radical, physically unsettling art of recent vintage, the show is cause for hope. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20110616
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Tibetan Arms and Armor From the Permanent Collection' (through fall) The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Met's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Later Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, created this follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including five acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense; examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20110616
MoMA P.S. 1: 'Laurel Nakadate: Only the Lonely' (through Aug. 8) Laurel Nakadate might be on the cusp of a great new career. She is known for disconcerting, sad and sexually provocative videos that she enlisted older, worse-for-wear men to participate in, but in the past three years she has made two feature-length films. Included in this enthralling survey of her 10-year career, they focus with lingering, heart-aching care on adolescent girls, lost souls looking for love and only getting into trouble. MoMA P.S. 1, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20110616
Morgan Library & Museum: 'The Age of Elegance: The Joan Taub Ades Collection' (through Aug. 28) This small but engrossing exhibition presents about three dozen works dating from the mid 17th to the late 19th centuries by European artists, each in his own way a draftsman of consummate skill. Some names, like Boucher and Millais, are familiar; most will be known only to art historical specialists. Ranging from postcard to laptop size, including portraiture, still-life and mythological scenes, they exemplify the fine but now endangered art of drawing at its best. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Johnson)20110616
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Illuminating Fashion: Dress in the Art of Medieval France and the Netherlands' (through Sept. 4) Medieval illuminations -- so rich in narrative, embellishment and religious expression -- can display sartorial trends that can help experts date manuscripts and discern the subtleties of a figure's status or character. There are many examples here, as well as mannequins in full-scale model attire -- say, a splendid hunting ensemble of gold-embroidered blue velvet and lilac wool felt for the men, and for the women, a princessy gown of yellow silk trimmed in black crushed velvet, accessorized by a turret. This lively show will teach you to scrutinize centuries-old manuscripts as you would a style magazine. 225 Madison, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)20110616
Museum of Modern Art: 'Access to Tools: Publications From the Whole Earth Catalog, 1968-1974' (through July 26) Brainchild of the visionary techno-hippie artist Steward Brand, the Whole Earth Catalog did for counterculture youth in the '60s what the Sears catalog did for children of the Great Depression and what Google does for people of the Internet age: provide a way for ordinary citizens to connect with and make use of the global economy. This modest but stirring time capsule of an exhibition presents various editions of the catalog, along with a mind-expanding array of books, magazines and ephemera that influenced or exemplified its holistic mission. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20110616
Museum of Modern Art: 'Francis Als: A Story of Deception' (through Aug. 1) This possibly premature, hit-and-miss survey of the quixotic, politically aware, yet obstinately poetic art of this Belgian artist, who has lived in Mexico since 1986, whipsaws a visitor between engagement and boredom, serious consideration and dismissal. In the show, at MoMA and its P.S. 1 site in Queens (closes Sept. 12), the best works are videos, but the split exhibition is garnished, you might say, with sometimes appealing paintings and sculptures and also dulled with extensive backup materials: studies, notes, texts and newspaper clippings pertaining to most of the works on view. Too often the result confirms this museum's blind faith in the wan, cerebral machinations of late-late-late Conceptualism. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20110616
- Museum of Modern Art: 'German Expressionism: The Graphic Impulse' (through July 11) MoMA's largest survey of Germany's first Modern art movement is infused with an urgent, crackling energy, by turns joyful, satiric, grim and tragic. Presenting some 250 works -- most of them little-seen prints -- it celebrates one of the 20th century's most brutally effective, socially responsive unions of medium and message and shakes up the (understandable) conventional wisdom that the museum is almost terminally Francophile. While lavish, the show reveals but a fraction of the museum's 3,200 Expressionist works on paper, all of which are newly available for digital viewing at moma.org/explore/multimedia/interactives/161. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20110616
Museum of Modern Art: 'I Am Still Alive: Politics and Everyday Life in Contemporary Drawing' (through Sept. 19) This show of contemporary drawings (most acquired since 2005) is anchored by a group of telegrams sent by the Japanese artist On Kawara to friends and associates; each one bears the message ''I am still alive.'' The artists seem to be in a permanent state of wariness and suspicion, which is sometimes the result of political instability and at other times more innate. But their efforts to process matters of life and death in short bursts of creative activity feel very of the moment. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)20110616
Museum of Modern Art: 'Boris Mikhailov: Case History' (through Sept. 5) This exhibition's visceral photographs of homeless people in Ukraine are not for the squeamish. The 19 photos, large-format examples from a series of more than 400 images produced in the late 1990s, portray people in grungy rooms or in wintery outdoor sites naked or pulling aside their clothes to expose parts of their bodies. Thus Mr. Mikhailov protests a society that allows people to fall into such substandard states and conditions. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20110616
Neue Galerie: 'Vienna 1900: Style and Identity' (through June 27) One of history's more fraught fin-de-siecle efflorescences of art and thought is recounted in a shifting kaleidoscope of paintings, drawings, architectural models, posters and several species of decorative arts. Among paintings by Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele, there is also a re-creation of Freud's psychoanalytic couch, an eye-popping tribute to the Vienna Secession and a crowded face-off between the designer-theoreticians Josef Hoffmann and Adolf Loos. Over all, it resembles a tasting menu with enough rich and disparate flavors that the gaps and omissions can be overlooked. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.com. (Smith)20110616
New Museum: 'Apichatpong Weerasethakul: Primitive' (through July 3) Focusing on teenage boys in rural Thailand, the celebrated Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul has produced an expansive, multiscreen video installation that is, by turns, beautiful, tedious, opaque and affectingly poetic. With the patience-testing style we've come to expect of avant-garde moviemaking, ''Primitive'' revolves around the playful construction of a time-traveling spaceship by village youths. The obliquely invoked background is a half-century of war and civil strife that has taken the lives of countless young men in Southeast Asia. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110616
- Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture: 'Soulful Stitching: Patchwork Quilts by Africans (Siddis) of India' (through June 30) The 15 brilliant contemporary quilts in this show were made by women of the Siddi ethnic group, descendants of early African migrants to South Asia, including slaves brought by Portuguese colonists in the 16th century. Strips and patches of recycled cloth -- solid-colored, patterned or shot through with glittery threads -- are the basic components. Together the results look like a spring garden in bloom. New York Public Library, 515 Lenox Avenue, at 135th Street, Hamilton Heights , nypl.org. (Cotter)20110616
Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian: 'A Song for the Horse Nation' (through July 7) Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing, beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navajo, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)20110616
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Cory Arcangel: Pro Tools' (through Sept. 11) This solo turn from Mr. Arcangel, the digital wunderkind, artist-musician and inveterate hacker, seems a trifle scrubbed clean, sanitized and austere. Containing work almost entirely from 2011, it tells us little of his funkier early digital efforts or artistic development. A few pieces reflect his longstanding interest in television and video games; in others he tries too hard to establish his formalist bona fides with wry riffs on abstract painting and sculpture. Mr. Arcangel seems guided by a somewhat callow faith in the avant-garde, striving to perpetuate its tradition, dating from Duchamp, of laying claim to new areas of nonart for art's sake. Sometimes he succeeds, but not always. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20110616
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Breaking Ground: The Whitney's Founding Collection' (through Sept. 18) In anticipation of its move to a new home in 2015, the Whitney is cooking up a series of six back-to-back experimental permanent collection shows at its present location. The first of them is a sampler of the earliest work in the holdings, and as a summary of the institution's initial view of American Modernism, what a curious thing it is. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20110616
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Singular Visions' (continuing) With its ''one artwork per room'' rule, ''Singular Visions'' is a refreshing departure from the typical collection sampler. The show's work includes pieces by A A Bronson, Sarah Charlesworth, Robert Grosvenor, Eva Hesse, Edward Kienholz and Georgia O'Keeffe; some rooms are more intriguing than others, but on the whole the show feels like a necessary experiment.

'John Storrs' (through June 30) This exhibition, by emphasizing relatively realistic works, complements the illuminating survey of the American sculptor John Storrs (1885-1956) -- best known for his Deco-ish evocations of abstracted skyscrapers -- at New York University's Grey Art Gallery. The works here include figures, portrait busts and terra cotta reliefs, as well as an array of wood-cuts, drawings and a few paintings; they present a softer, more personal side of Storrs's sensibility. Meredith Ward Fine Art, 44 East 74th Street , (212) 744-7306, meredithwardfineart.com. (Smith)20110616
Galleries: 57th Street
'Decadence and Decay: Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, George Grosz' (through June 24) This seductively titled show of 65 works by these three Weimar-era luminaries complements the Museum of Modern Art's current show of German Expressionist prints. Dix is the standout, with Neue Sachlichkeit portrait drawings that make figures look both vulnerable and monstrous. Also here are prints from his 1924 cycle ''The War,'' which can be seen at MoMA in its terrifying entirety. Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, Manhattan , (212) 245-6734, gseart.com.

Cao Fei: 'Play Time' (through June 25) In the last couple of years the Beijing-based artist Cao Fei has been building eerie simulacrums of modern Chinese society within virtual-reality games. But in her latest show she works in real space, with all its complexities and restrictions, and engages older forms of entertainment and fantasy. Her photographs and videos are now populated by shadow puppets, skateboarders and children's television characters instead of avatars. In the context of China's crackdown on cultural expression, Ms. Cao's juvenilia seems to express a longing for some basic adult freedoms. Lombard Freid Projects, 518 West 19th Street , (212) 967-8040, lombard-freid.com. (Rosenberg)20110616
- John Chamberlain: 'New Sculpture' (through July 8) In some of the largest works of his career, this venerable American sculptor uses his signature materials -- crushed car bodies and fenders -- with tremendous compositional variety, verve and his usual unerring color sense. Variously comical, stately, architectural and gestural, these pieces erupt from the gallery's expansive concrete floors like unusually well-shaped mesas, creating an exhilarating indoor landscape. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street , (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com. (Smith)20110616
- Mark Grotjahn: 'Nine Faces' (through June 25) Full of thatches of thrashing, live-wire lines made with a surprisingly methodical palette-knife technique, Mr. Grotjahn's newest paintings are harsh, elegant things that enthrall the eye and splinter the mind. Ellipses and circles tumble about among the lines, intimating fractured features and calling attention to the nominal masklike faces of early Picasso and Matisse, Jawlensky and Brancusi. Altogether, they emphasize painting as a psychic and bodily process, fueled in part by the devouring and digesting of previous art to formulate a new synthesis. Anton Kern Gallery, 532 West 20th Street , (212) 367-9663, antonkerngallery.com. (Smith)20110616
- Jasper Johns: 'New Sculpture and Works on Paper' (through July 1) The centerpiece of this pleasantly miscellaneous show is a large cast-aluminum relief and six smaller two-sided ones in cast bronze and silver, which put grids of the numbers zero through nine through elaborate variations in texture, legibility and suggestion. Among the artist's first cast-metal objects in some years, they exemplify his trenchant recycling of motifs and clarify his tendency to conflate aspects of printing, painting and sculpture (and collage). Their mesmerizing combination of lapidary detail and casual process reveals the intensity of Mr. Johns's mind with unusual clarity. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street , (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Smith)20110616
- 'Donald Judd' (through June 25) Nine large silvery, seemingly identical floor boxes, all open at the top, turn out to have markedly different and expansive interiors, articulated by various vertical divisions and planes of colors. These wells of space and color exemplify Judd's frequent use of surprise to create suspense and clarity; they also reflect his origins in painting and his lifelong admiration for the simple forms and strong colors of painters like Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and Josef Albers. David Zwirner, 525 and 533 West 19th Street , (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Smith)20110616
Sean Landers: 'Around the World Alone' (through June 25) Mr. Landers's latest paintings avoid both his confessional texts and art-historical style-mongering, opting for sea captains in full clown makeup (red noses, hair and beards) at the wheels of old sailing ships. A flinty, restrained realism and startling immediacy distinguishes both the figures and the expanses of rolling seas and dramatic skies. The lonely-clown-as-man-against-the-elements theme may amount to a double and thus self-canceling triteness. In any event, Mr. Landers's recurring theme -- the bane of maleness -- gains in maturity here, along with a marvelous sense of light and space. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 537 West 22nd Street , (212) 680-9467, petzel.com. (Smith)20110616
Sol LeWitt: 'Arcs and Lines' (through July 1) This extraordinary show features three gridded wall drawings by the eminent Conceptual-Minimalist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007), most prominently the airy and ebullient ''Wall Drawing #122'' from 1972, a spare work in blue crayon that wraps almost perfectly around the gallery's large central space. Featuring combinations of two straight, wavy, curved or broken lines in each compartment of the grid, its vaulting composition evokes Matisse's blue nudes, brisk Alpine views and even the blinking sweep of a radar screen, exemplifying both the economy and rich suggestiveness of LeWitt's art. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street , (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Smith)20110616
- Toyin Odutola: 'Maps' (through June 25) Using ballpoint pens and other drawing utensils, this young artist, born in Nigeria and living in San Francisco, makes a polished New York solo debut with small portraits. Each one, derived from photographs of friends but incorporating Mr. Odutola's features, looks to have been weaved from strips of dark, ductile, sinewy material, then finished with hair-fine details. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street , (212) 645-1701, jackshainman.com. (Cotter)20110616
- Picasso and Marie-Therese: 'L'Amour Fou' (through July 15) While falling short of the exhibition of late Picasso paintings and prints that filled this space two years ago, the latest Gagosian exegesis into Picasso land is a wonderfully motley, almost scattershot affair, brilliantly installed. It presents works, in all mediums and several styles, that Picasso made during the late 1920s and '30s, when he was under the spell of the voluptuous, Roman-nosed, level-eyed, full-limbed Marie-Therese Walter, arguably the love of his life. Anchored by this single if perpetually mutating subject, the art on hand confirms that when Picasso told Walter she had saved his life, he meant that she had also saved his art. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street , (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com. (Smith)20110616
Tobias Putrih: 'When Language Goes on a Holiday' (through June 25) The latest from this Slovenian artist is a flexible system of thin, mostly hexagonal, perforated sheets of black aluminum that can be bolted together any number of ways. Here they yield abstract sculpture, partitions (some used for displaying chair designs by the early modern Swedish designer Erik Gunnar Asplund) and furniture. A mordant yet genuine utopianism results. Meulensteen, 511 West 22nd Street , (212) 633-6999, meulensteen.com. (Smith)20110616
- Jo Ractliffe: 'Terras do Fim do Mundo (The Lands of the End of the World)' (through July 15) At first glance, this South African photographer's black-and-white shots of sun-baked Angolan landscapes look random and bland: rocks, dirt, scrubby trees; some handwritten signs but no people. Only when you read some of the titles -- ''Mass Grave at Cassinga,'' ''Minefield Near Mupa''-- do you learn where people are, or once were, and the pictures snap into expressive focus. The Walther Collection Project Space, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 718 , (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)20110616
- Vladimir Tatlin: 'Monument to the Third International' (through July 30) Concocted by a founder of Russian Constructivism between 1915 and 1920, following close encounters with the Eiffel Tower and Picasso's guitar constructions in Paris, this tilting, spiraling, viaduct-like structure is one of early Modernism's most ambitious and best-known works of unrealized architecture, embodied by one of its biggest architectural models. Shown in the United States for the first time -- the oldest (1967) remake of the original model, which disappeared around 1932 -- it is dense with portents of 20th-century sculpture to come, from LeWitt's grids to Smithson's jetty. Tony Shafrazi, 544 West 26th Street , (212) 274-9300, tonyshafrazigallery.com. (Smith)20110616
Richard Tuttle: 'What's the Wind' (through July 22) Working quite a bit larger than usual, this Post-Minimalist master of seeming trifles presents a series of deftly cobbled-together thingamajigs that charm and challenge. Each presents a kind of stage-set-like open volume of sculptural events patched together from colorful, lightweight materials and objects. The result is a somewhat slovenly, art-supplies Constructivism that is characteristically light, ephemeral and full of joy. Pace Gallery, 510 West 25th Street , (212) 255-4044, thepacegallery.com. (Smith)20110616
- Gillian Wearing: 'People' (through June 24) This British artist's first New York show in eight years more than makes up for lost time. In three very different video works, she relentlessly tests the limits of what might be called narrated portraiture, coaxing forth unstated feelings and scarring experiences or, in one instance, reviewing several decades of snapshot styles to recast a demurely resentful life story. She also eerily re-enacts three famous portraits of famous photographers using her signature custom-made rubber masks and ventures into three dimensions with two small statues that pay tribute to everyday heroes. Life daunts, but the living persist. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street , (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com. (Smith)20110616
Galleries: SoHo
- 'Drawing and Its Double: Selections From the Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica' (through June 24) The drawings in this show take an unusual form: they are the designs etched by artists, using burins and acid, on metal plates from which prints (the ''double'' of the title) are made. The selection begins on a grand note with a set of 10 oddly shaped copper plates made for a 16th-century print version of Michelangelo's ''Last Judgment'' and concludes with expressionistic illustrations by the contemporary artist Paolo Canevari on the Ten Commandments. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street , (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Cotter)20110616
Galleries: Other
- 'Ethiopian Magic Scrolls: Talismanic Art of Ethiopia' (through June 30) In 2005 the London dealer Sam Fogg blew us away with an exhibition of Ethiopian Christian liturgical art. Now, in association with Milos Simovic of Elizabeth Street Fine Arts, he follows up with a show of 18th- and 19th-century painted and written scrolls that emerged from Ethiopian popular religion. And they are equally, if very differently, wondrous. Figures of warrior-saints and archangels rub shoulders with demons; talismanic designs mingle with New Testament quotations. They're all tucked away like a hidden trove in the back of a shop specializing mostly in Coney Island antiques. Elizabeth Street Fine Arts, 209 Elizabeth Street, Nolita , (212) 274-9400, elizabethstreetfinearts.com. (Cotter)20110616
- Tom Fairs: 'Drawings' (through July 15) You might mistake the small, town-and-country drawings in this lovely show for the works of an early 20th-century follower of Pierre Bonnard. The truth is that the British painter Tom Fairs (1925-2007) did not begin producing art full time until after his retirement from teaching at age 60. Working with soft pencils, he drew the outdoor world with an almost shocking avidity. This show, the first solo ever devoted to Fairs's work, is inspiring. KS Art, 73 Leonard Street, TriBeCa , (212) 219-9918, kerryschuss.com. (Johnson)20110616
John Storrs: 'Machine-Age Modernist' (through July 9) The Chicago-born artist John Storrs (1885-1956) compacted utopian, machine-age dreaming into Cubist-Art Deco-style sculptures resembling pieces of architectural ornament and models of skyscrapers. There is nothing quite like his dense, carefully wrought stone and metal sculptures in early American -- or European, for that matter -- Modernism, and this finely tuned show gives a good account of his progress from the late '10s to the early '30s. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East , (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)20110616

'Mark di Suvero at Governors Island: Presented by Storm King Art Center' (through Sept. 25) With 11 works spanning more than three decades, this show organized by Storm King Art Center, the 500-acre sculpture park in the Hudson Valley, is Mark di Suvero's biggest New York City survey since 1975. The all-outdoor exhibition works alongside the island's packed calendar of activities and festivals, offering bike riders and picnickers culture by osmosis. Plan to spend some time along the island's southern end, where four of Mr. di Suvero's best sculptures engage the waterfront and one another in invigorating ways. Governors Island , govisland.com. (Rosenberg)20110616
Eva Rothschild: 'Empire' (through Aug. 28) At the southeast entrance to Central Park stands a colorful, tubular structure resembling a swing-set frame designed by spiders on LSD. Touching ground at 10 points on the cobbled plaza, its red, green and black striped posts rise at different angles into an airy web over 18 feet at its highest point. A playful riff on the ancient form of the triumphal arch, ''Empire'' will be a required photo-op for tourists and other visitors. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, Central Park, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, Public Art Fund , (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Cotter)20110616
Out of Town
- Anacostia Community Museum: 'Word, Shout, Song: Lorenzo Dow Turner, Connecting Communities Through Language' (through July 24) Housed in a converted movie theater in a predominantly African-American neighborhood that is a cab ride's distance from the National Mall, the Anacostia Community Museum is one of Washington's cultural secrets. Its exhibition on the scholar Lorenzo Dow Turner (1890-1972), who documented surviving traces of African languages and customs in modern African-American culture, is both an archival homage and a well-paced drama of ideas. Smithsonian Institution, 1901 Fort Place SE, Washington , (202) 633-4820, anacostia.si.edu. (Cotter)20110616
- The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery, Skidmore College: 'Environment and Object: Recent African Art' (through July 31) Contemporary African art can mean many things: art made in Africa, or by someone from Africa living elsewhere, or by someone not from Africa but of African descent. All definitions apply in this stimulating show, as do variant readings of the rest of exhibition title. This is very much a show of objects, with several environments or installations. At the same time, the environment itself, meaning the natural world, under dire threat, is the subject of much of the art. 815 North Broadway, Saratoga Springs, N.Y. , (518) 580-8080, tang.skidmore.edu. (Cotter)20110616
- Princeton University Art Museum: 'Kurt Schwitters: Color and Collage' (through June 26) The German artist Kurt Schwitters, who died in 1948, is one of Modernism's true delights, though seen far less often than he deserves to be. This smallish show, his first substantial survey since the 1985 Museum of Modern Art retrospective, is made up primarily of wonderful collages spanning his career, from garrulous early examples made from the odds and ends of urban life -- tram tickets, stamps, receipts -- to the light-and-shadow late ones, done when he was in wartime exile in England and living, as he loved to be, surrounded by nature. From very first to very last, he's golden, and worth the trip to see. Princeton, N.J. , (609) 258-3788, artmuseum.princeton.edu. (Cotter)20110616
Last Chance
- 'David Adamo' (closes on Sunday) This brilliant solo debut from a young New York artist now living in Berlin forms an expansive meditation on sculpture and its materials, evocations and traditional techniques, both additive and subtractive. A New England stone wall reads as a lumpy Carl Andre floor piece. An array of cedar beams evoke both Mr. Andre's early work and Brancusi's studio, but not too reverentially. Casualness alternates with bravura precision, like the trompe-l'oeil-painted plaster casts of partly eaten fruit that are strewn everywhere and form a dispersed vanitas. There's more, and the cumulative effect is refreshingly open-ended. Untitled, 30 Orchard Street, Lower East Side , (212) 608-6002, nyuntitled.com. (Smith)20110616
'Alchemy & Inquiry' (closes on Sunday) Contemporary art always comes with a stunning botanical backdrop at Wave Hill, the Bronx garden and cultural center on the Hudson. And though the green-thumbed artists in this season's show -- Philip Taaffe, Fred Tomaselli and Terry Winters -- have made the rounds of Chelsea, the natural setting refreshes some of their familiar tropes. All three made work specifically for this exhibition, responding to different areas of the grounds. Wave Hill, Independence Avenue and West 249th Street, Riverdale, the Bronx , (718) 549-3200, wavehill.org. (Rosenberg)20110616
- Alvin Baltrop: 'Photographs 1965-2003' (closes on Saturday) All but unknown in his lifetime, the photographer Alvin Baltrop (1948-2004) focused much of his energy on documenting the illicit erotic and aesthetic life on abandoned shipping piers along the West Side of Manhattan in the 1970s and '80s. Image by image the work is uneven, but there are wonderful things, and the cumulative impact is potent, not only as art produced by an exceptional eye but as a record of a turning-point moment in time, just before and after AIDS struck. Third Streaming, 10 Greene Street, second floor, SoHo , (646) 370-3877, thirdstreaming.com. (Cotter)20110616
Elaine Cameron-Weir: 'without true bazaars' (closes on Saturday) In this modest yet convincing debut, Minimalist simplicity and several kinds of rectilinear form are explored with wit, physical variety and an admirable economy of means. The works include a Persian rug dipped in indigo dye; a long, gracefully curved wood dowel covered in rolling tobacco; a scent-emitting wall piece; and best of all, ''Pedestal,'' a tall, narrow, stepped monolith tenderly worked in plaster that resembles an architectural model for a skyscraper. Ramiken Crucible, 389 Grand Street, Lower East Side , (917) 434-4245, ramikencrucible.com. (Smith)20110616
- Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum: 'Color Moves: Art and Fashion by Sonia Delaunay' (closes on Sunday) Examining the more practical side of Delaunay's pioneering achievement, this beautiful, enlightening exhibition offers some alluring artworks, garments and accessories, especially a passel of radiant scarves. But it bets most of the house on fabric swatches -- Delaunay's textile designs -- and succeeds with a display of some 90 gouache studies for textiles and their equally vibrant commercial results: more than 120 hand-printed silks, velvets and cottons laid out in large vitrines. Patterns ranging from geometric to floral variously revisit, amplify and presage much of the history of modern painting and may even deserve a place in that history. 2 East 91st Street , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Smith)20110616
John Divola: 'Trees for the Forest' (closes on Saturday) This mini-survey of John Divola, a Los Angeles-based conceptual photographer, reveals the depth and diversity of that city's art scene. Early shots of artistic interventions in vandalized homes have an experimental, Man Ray-meets-Gordon Matta-Clark aesthetic; other works recall Bruce Nauman and Bas Jan Ader. Wallspace, 619 West 27th Street, Chelsea , (212) 594-9478, wallspacegallery.com. (Rosenberg)20110616
- Eric Fischl: 'Early Paintings' (closes on Saturday) Mr. Fischl produced some psychologically astounding paintings in the early 1980s. Made with a loose, expressionist touch on medium-large canvases, his emotionally raw, semi-photorealist images of adolescent Oedipal confusion still project a dreamy, penetrating acidity. ''Sleepwalker'' (1979) pictures a skinny, naked boy standing in the shin-deep water of an aqua plastic pool hunched over and masturbating in a suburban backyard. It is a classic. Skarstedt, 20 East 79th Street , (212) 737-2060, skarstedt.com. (Johnson)20110616
'Hilary Harnischfeger' (closes on Sunday) For her third gallery solo show in New York, this artist supplements her already robust combination of materials and mediums -- which include paper, plaster, paint and minerals -- with multicolored clay. This complicates things considerably in terms of surface, form and hue, yielding in particular a series of small, truculent, impacted, free-standing works that refuse easy categorization. Rachel Uffner Gallery, 47 Orchard Street, Lower East Side , (212) 274-0064, racheluffnergallery.com. (Smith)20110616
- Chris Kraus: 'Films' (closes on Sunday) Chris Kraus, one of our smartest and most original writers on contemporary art, was once a very interesting filmmaker, as is evident in the five films show here, which take us underground with Henry James, Antonin Artaud and American slavery. The gallery viewing setup is intimate, with the films on small screens with attached headsets. The longest piece, ''Gravity and Grace'' (1996), begins screening every day at 4 p.m. Real Fine Arts, 673 Meeker Avenue, Brooklyn , realfinearts.com. (Cotter)20110616
Sean Landers: 'A Midnight Modern Conversation' (closes on Saturday) This 1996 series of canvases, never before exhibited in New York, show the artist abandoning his diaristic text paintings for the first time and pursuing his boys-will-be-boys ruminations by redoing William Hogarth's 1732 painting of debauched drinkers. His tributes have a wonderful gaucherie, but the real revelations here -- as paintings and as human drama -- are eight smaller, ancillary works featuring British Redcoats. In them, nature, women and death enter the picture, along with some wonderfully shimmering, slurry surfaces. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 118 East 64th Street , (212) 680-9889, marianneboeskygallery.com. (Smith)20110616
- New Museum: 'Lynda Benglis' (closes on Sunday) This startlingly excellent resurrection of the prescient Post-Minimalist renegade and her gaudy, multidexterous, often gender-bending segues among Process, Performance and Body Art is long overdue. Carefully chosen, it includes her notorious 1974 Artforum ad, but it gives pride of place to her equally flamboyant, if abstract, evocations of the body in pigmented wax, latex and polyurethane foam. Taking tips from Pollock, these works combine the dancer and the dance, unleash painting into real space and mock the less colorful efforts of her mostly masculine contemporaries. The through line: feminist intuition, formalist excess and a reckless disregard for art-world standards and practices. Bravo. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)20110616
- David Shapiro: 'Money Is No Object' (closes on Sunday) A year in the life of the artist David Shapiro is almost identical to a year in the life of a good many other striving, middle-class New York art-worldings. At least that's the conclusion to be drawn from his minutely detailed, virtuosically executed, personal inventory of a solo show. It consists of every bill and receipt he received during the calendar year 2010, but all presented in hand-drawn and painted form on 12 long paper scrolls. Sue Scott Gallery, 1 Rivington Street, Lower East Side , (212) 358-8767, suescottgallery.com. (Cotter)20110616
'Soutine/Bacon' (closes on Saturday) This intense show pairs still lifes, landscapes and portraits by Chaim Soutine (1893-1943) and Francis Bacon (1909-92). The two shared an appetite for viscera and a zest for reinterpreting the masters, but Soutine is the stronger voice here; standouts include the Tate's ''Landscape at Ceret (The Storm),'' a crackling mass of thunderheads that anticipates Pollock and de Kooning, and a glistening ''Still Life With Ray Fish,'' made in homage to Chardin's ''Skate.'' Helly Nahmad Gallery, 975 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street , (212) 879-2075, hellynahmadgallery.com. (Rosenberg)20110616

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROOMS WITH A VIEW: THE OPEN WINDOW IN THE 19TH CENTURY': (through July 4) This compact, quietly splendid exhibition explores the window as luminous light source, as semi-abstract compositional element and as the focal point for a certain poignant, implicitly Romantic yearning. The images -- mostly by German, French and Scandinavian artists before 1830, including this 1807 work by Carl Ludwig Kaaz -- depict both domestic settings and artists' studios and are passively subversive in their avoidance of large-scale, historical themes and formal portraiture. They show us a world on the verge of electricity, photography and industrialization, a moment of irretrievable, partly fictive calm that incites some yearning of its own.

HEADLINE: Crunch Talks Aim at Deal to Defuse Crisis in Greece

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and MATTHEW SALTMARSH; Matthew Saltmarsh reported from Paris.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- As European officials headed into a long weekend of critical talks over Greece's crippling debt crisis, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that they were confident of a deal to secure a vital 12-billion-euro ($17 billion) portion of the outside aid needed to stave off an imminent Greek default.
The comments, reflecting belated advances in negotiations that have been going on for weeks, were aimed at calming anxious financial markets and preventing a Greek default from setting off another financial crisis. The fear is that could threaten the integrity of the euro zone, require European countries to bail out banks that lent heavily to Greece and other deeply indebted countries, and spread panic across global markets.
After a drop in U.S. markets on Wednesday that was compounded by fresh fears about the pace of the American economic recovery, stocks turned mixed in New York, with the Dow Jones industrial average slightly higher and broader indexes lower. The euro slipped further, Asian and European stocks faltered and the interest that investors demanded to buy bonds of the more indebted European countries climbed. 
Spain, which has largely remained outside the line of fire aimed at Greece, Portugal and Ireland, sold 2.8 billion euros, or $4 billion, of bonds at an auction Thursday, missing its top target and with average yields creeping up again.
Despite the signs of progress, uncertainty continued to plague Europe, with a political crisis unfolding in Athens and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, due to meet the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, in Berlin on Friday to try to overcome divisions over a second Greek bailout. The French and German leaders disagree about the extent to which banks and other private investors should be required to contribute to a second rescue of Greece, which received a 110 billion euro package about a year ago.
On Sunday night, ministers from the 17 euro zone countries are to meet in Luxembourg to try to agree on support for Greece that would satisfy the I.M.F.'s loan requirements, allowing it to release its portion of the aid needed by the end of the month.
While the technical aspects of a second bailout remain complex, the politics of the situation are probably a bigger worry. If the Greek Parliament refuses to approve more austerity measures, European governments will not be able to justify to their own voters any offer of further loans.
Nonetheless, Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said he was confident that, on Sunday, euro zone finance ministers ''will be able to decide on the disbursement of the fifth tranche of the loans for Greece in early July.'' In doing so, he said, the European Union would help Greece ''avoid the default scenario.''
But he emphasized that ''a great deal of responsibility'' lay with the Greek political leadership. ''We expect the Greek Parliament to endorse the economic reform program as agreed by the end of June,'' Mr. Rehn said.
Officials from the I.M.F. also sought to reassure investors, emphasizing the importance of parliamentary approval in Athens. ''We stand ready to continue our support for Greece subject to adoption of the economic policy reforms agreed with the Greek authorities,'' Caroline Atkinson, an I.M.F. spokeswoman, said in a statement. ''Progress is being made in the discussions to ensure the full financing of the program, and we anticipate a positive outcome on this at the next Eurogroup meeting.'' The Eurogroup is made up of E.U. finance ministers.
''Conclusion of the pending program review,'' she added, ''remains subject to approval by the I.M.F.'s executive board.''
Though the plan is now for a two-stage solution, with agreement only in principle on Sunday night or Monday morning in Luxembourg, the timetable of a definitive and detailed accord on a second bailout for Greece was unclear.
Mr. Rehn said this would be achieved in July, but Reuters reported that Germany wanted to delay agreement on the detailed package until September.
There was no official comment from the German Finance Ministry. But a German government official, who declined to be identified by name because he is not allowed to speak on the record, said that after ''agreement on the key points of the next program, including the participation of the private sector -- which would be quantifiable, substantial, verifiable and voluntary''-- that the ''drafting of the detailed program will flow from this and will come later.''
While the pace of decision making among European policy makers remains extremely slow and frustrating to outsiders, the recent turmoil in markets appears to be forcing action.
''I think this will get fixed,'' said Paul Mortimer-Lee, chief of market economics in London for BNP Paribas. ''The cost of not fixing this is too great.'
''Each time there's an episode like this in Europe, we move closer to the edge,'' he added. ''It's just the way E.U. politics work.''
Two Deutsche Bank strategists, Jim Reid and Colin Tan, warned in a report Thursday that the current Greek crisis had echoes of the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank in September 2008, an event that plunged the financial system into chaos and required the commitment of trillions of dollars in government support to stave off another Great Depression.
''Everyone in every corner of global financial markets should be keeping a very close eye on upcoming Greek events,'' they wrote. ''The period is resembling the build-up to the Lehman collapse where, although markets were increasingly nervous, virtually everyone expected a last-minute buyer.''
''The risks are building,'' the analysts added, ''as the situation gets ever more difficult.''
The mood in the markets was accentuated by comments Wednesday from the Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan. He said that Dublin was ready to impose losses on senior unsecured bond holders of Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society if the European Central Bank agreed. His comments came after a meeting with the I.M.F., which, he said, understood his position.
And there were growing signs that major banks were prepared to accept some loan extensions and other steps to prevent a Greek bankruptcy, which could easily spread to other vulnerable debtor nations. Speaking in London, Charles H. Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, an organization that represents big banks, said Thursday that ''there is a broader sense emerging by the community that there needs to be a voluntary participation by the private sector to cooperate with officials to come to a solution.''
''We need a broader base of participants, including pension funds and institutional investors,'' he added. ''We need to expand the spectrum to spread the burden.''

To the Editor:
Re ''Dispute Between Vietnam and China Escalates Over Competing Claims in South China Sea'' (news article, June 11): 
How China handles the South China Sea dispute will set the tone for the regional relationship in the 21st century.
The world is curiously (or nervously) watching how China uses its growing economic and military might. Will China be a bossy superpower that disrespects smaller countries' voices, or will it apply classical wisdom to balance regional interests?
A harmonious neighborhood is more crucial to China's long-term well-being than the oil and gas buried under the South China Sea. Thus, China should be particularly careful and sensible, and should prove to the world that it will be a responsible and respectful great nation.

HEADLINE: Uncertainty Over Greece Weighs on Markets

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting from Paris and Stephen Castle from Brussels.

 BODY:
Financial markets remained unsettled on Thursday amid concerns about political stability in Greece and the fate of a second Greek bailout, sending investors into less risky assets.
Questions about the fiscal challenges in Europe overshadowed trading, but stocks were mostly higher in the United States during the day before losing some momentum. Investors also sorted through fresh economic data about jobs and housing that showed some improvement in those sectors.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 64.25 points, or 0.54 percent, to 11,961.52. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.22 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,267.64. The Nasdaq composite index fell 7.76 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,623.70. 
United States government bonds traded higher in price as euro zone concerns started another ''flight to quality,'' said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.
''Even if some of the economic numbers are better, it doesn't matter,'' he wrote in a research note. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 14/32, to 101 23/32. The yield fell to 2.93 percent from 2.98 percent late Wednesday.
Fewer people applied for first-time unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department reported, indicating some improvement in jobs. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits in the week that ended June 11 dropped 16,000, which was more than expected, to 414,000. The less-volatile four-week moving average held at 424,750, the lowest level since April 23.
Still, applications have been above 400,000 for 10 weeks, suggesting that any recovery in the job market remains anemic.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that housing starts rose 3.5 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 560,000 units. April's starts were revised up to a 541,000 unit pace.
Despite the gain, the pace of home-building is well below the level required for a robust housing market, and the surfeit of foreclosed homes is expected to weigh on the sector for some time.
Housing permits, a measure of future construction, rose 8.7 percent in May to their highest level since December. But apartments and condominiums were a big part of that increase. Permits for buildings with five or more units surged to their highest point since October 2008.
The number of single-family homes started in May rose 3.7 percent, but the pace still lags behind last year. Single-family homes make up 80 percent of residential construction.
Outside of jobs and houses, manufacturing showed continued weakness.
On Thursday, for the second consecutive day, a gauge of regional manufacturing activity in the United States showed a steep decline. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its index of manufacturing conditions fell to 7.7 in June, down from 3.9 in May and the lowest reading since July 2009.
On Wednesday, the Fed's regional survey for New York showed a decline in both manufacturing activity and optimism for June.
Factory output, which had been something of a bright spot since the recession ended, has slowed this spring.
While debt crisis in Europe has been in the forefront of investors' minds for some time, it was an even greater focus this week, as Prime Minister George Papandreou of Greece said he would reshuffle his cabinet to get his government to approve additional austerity measures demanded by its foreign creditors.
The looming fiscal crisis in Europe overshadowed the fresh data, said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners.
''The headlines out of Greece are the most important thing this week,'' Mr. Landesman said. ''We are going to have a very volatile year. All the liquidity pumped into the market has helped the stock market, but not the global economy.''
He added: ''I still think this market believes they are going to bail out Greece.''
American Express led the Dow, rising $1.13, or 2.4 percent, to $48.41. Hewlett-Packard rose 2.1 percent, to $34.97. Home Depot gained 1.8 percent, to $34.50.
In the broader market, materials, information technology and consumer discretionary shares declined less than 1 percent. Utility companies helped pull up the broader market. Progress Energy rose 1.6 percent, to $47.69.
Southern Union climbed $4.95, or 17.5 percent, to $33.21, after Energy Transfer Equity agreed to acquire the company for $4.2 billion, creating the largest natural gas pipeline company in the United States. Shares of Energy Transfer rose $3.49, or 8.2 percent, to $45.96.
Among companies that reported earnings, Kroger gained $1.04, or 4.5 percent, to $23.99, after its first-quarter results exceeded forecasts and it raised its 2011 forecast. Smithfield Foods rose $1.31, or 6.4 percent, to $21.70. It reversed a fiscal fourth-quarter loss.
Research in Motion appeared poised to weigh on the market on Friday morning. After the close on Thursday, the company, which makes BlackBerry smartphones, lowered its earnings forecast, and its shares fell as much as 17 percent after hours.

HEADLINE: Pinnacle That's Not Out of Reach for the Regular Guy

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
BETHESDA, Md. -- Michael Tobiason Jr. always wears black socks when playing golf. Ryan Nelson has caddied for himself. Chris Williams catches fish with his bare hands.
All three played in the United States Open for the first time Thursday.
Unlike many national championships, golf's version throws open its doors to the melting pot that is American golf. And all kinds play their way in.
Tobiason has a caddie named Mungo, and this week they are sharing a $29 hotel room. Nelson gave up high-level competitive golf for five years, re-emerging on the low-paying mini-tours only two years ago. Williams, 19 and still an amateur, hails from Moscow, Idaho. Asked if he knew any famous golfers from Idaho, Williams said, ''Nope.''
But this week Tobiason, who teaches golf at an academy near his Delaware home, has had a locker between Steve Stricker and David Toms, who have combined for 23 PGA Tour victories. 
Nelson, who three years ago was working behind a pro shop counter, stood on the first tee Wednesday awaiting his practice round with David Howell, the Ryder Cup player and four-time European Tour winner.
Howell approached and said: ''Excuse my ignorance Ryan, but are you on the PGA Tour?
The 33-year-old Nelson answered: ''Me? No, not me.''
The same day, Williams was warming up on the practice range next to Sergio Garcia. At least he was for a while.
''Then I realized I wasn't hitting shots anymore,'' Williams said. ''I was just standing there watching Sergio hit shots.''
But the United States Open is not a fantasy camp sweepstakes. All three had to play exceptionally well to get in the field, with Tobiason defeating 90 of 97 potential qualifiers in one day and a host of tour pros the next week to earn his spot. Nelson shot consecutive rounds of 66 in the same day -- with no bogeys -- while caddying his own bag on a hilly course north of Atlanta. Williams made six birdies in the last nine holes to win his sectional qualifier in Washington state.
''I think all of us are chasing a dream,'' Williams said. ''And this is one of those times when we get to dream, but our eyes are open -- just taking it all in.''
Thursday was when the dream became a reality for these first-timers in the 111th United States Open, the day they were set loose on Congressional Country Club, the second-longest golf course in United States Open history.
All three posted respectable scores: a four-over 75 for Tobiason and Nelson, and a five-over 76 for Williams. It was not the easiest day for scoring. The world's top-ranked golfer, Luke Donald, shot 74. For the 27-year-old Tobiason, it was one more step of many since his father died of bile duct cancer last July.
''After his father passed, Michael has found a new maturation that has had an effect on everything in his life,'' said his mother, Joan Tobiason. ''He wanted to reach this level before but not with the desire he's shown in the last year.''
According to his caddie, the 56-year-old Gerry Thornton, known as Mungo, who met Tobiason last year at the DuPont Country Club in Delaware, Tobiason began practicing seven days a week shortly after his father's death.
''I think everything he's doing now is in honor of his father,'' Thornton said.
Tobiason and Thornton toured the pristine grounds of Congressional on Thursday with smiles on their faces, Thornton toting a hefty cigar and Tobiason's unadorned, lightweight kick-stand bag. Both said they slept well Wednesday night at their discount hotel in Fairfax, Va., even with Thornton, a buildings and grounds superintendent at a county prison, on an air mattress laid across the floor.
Tobiason's long drives -- he often hits it more than 300 yards -- were met with cheers of ''Go Delaware'' from the more than 100 friends and family who have made it inside the gates to cheer their favorite son.
''I feel like the whole state is here,'' Tobiason said afterward. ''Because we don't have that many people.''
His mother, Joan, who stuffs her son's golf bag with homemade peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, said: ''People gravitate to Michael because he's nice to everyone. And we'll be here until Sunday, just like Michael.''
That suggests Tobiason will make Friday's cut.
Nelson, meanwhile, was not predicting whether he would make the cut. He was happy to have his swing coach, Neil Wilkins, lugging his bag up and down Congressional's many hills and valleys. Nelson carried his own clubs in the 36-hole final qualifying round, he said, because it seemed like the economical thing to do.
''But it didn't turn out to be such a smart thing,'' he said. ''I was really cramping up and exhausted the last nine holes. But, you know, it's probably the best day of golf I've had.''
Nelson, who did not start playing golf until he was 15, turned pro in 2001 but failed in three attempts at the PGA Tour's Q School selection process. He worked at a golf club from 2003 to 2008.
''But you can't really play competitive golf from the pro shop,'' he said.
Three years ago, members at the club raised some money for him to try the golf's minor league mini-tours again and Nelson's results dramatically improved.
''It was a lot different going back out after working those years, because I was different,'' Nelson said. ''I had grown up a lot. I understood a lot of things better.''
Qualifying for this week's United States Open also made him some new friends.
''I got some random Facebook messages from strangers offering to caddie for me,'' Nelson said with a laugh. ''It's a big golf world.''
Idaho was the golf world for Williams as a youngster where he played multiple youth sports.
''But I decided to quit all the other sports and focus on golf because I thought that might be the best way to pay for college,'' Williams said. ''And it is paying for college.''
Williams will be a junior on the University of Washington golf team next fall. In 2010, he was the Phil Mickelson award winner as the nation's top freshman golfer. He has shot a 59 in competition, in Burley, Idaho.
''Idaho isn't the best-known golf state but I love playing there in the summer and that lets me hang out and fish with my buddies,'' he said.
Williams is somewhat of a fishing legend since he has caught a fish with his bare hands -- and more than once. He does it from a boat in a stream, leaning over to snatch the fish in shallow waters.
''It's my claim to fame,'' he said.
At least so far. The second round of the Open begins Friday morning.

HEADLINE: Brown Angers Democrats by Vetoing California Budget

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Gov. Jerry Brown of California on Thursday vetoed the state budget that the Democratic-controlled Legislature had passed the day before, saying that the plan merely papered over the long-term deficit and added billions of dollars in debt.
The veto means that the governor will have to reopen negotiations with the Legislature to win approval for his plan to close a nearly $10 billion gap. The plan relies on extending some taxes that are set to expire this year, and for it to pass, Mr. Brown needs the support of two Republicans in each legislative chamber. Those votes have been elusive. 
Many lawmakers said they had expected the governor to continue to negotiate with Republicans, but few expected the veto. It was the first budget veto since at least the 1920s.
Mr. Brown, who has railed against maneuvers that the state has relied on for years to balance its budget, placed the blame on Republicans and commended lawmakers from his party for their ''tremendous efforts.'' But he said the plan that was approved on Wednesday was not truly balanced.
He said that the spending plan contained ''legally questionable maneuvers, costly borrowing and unrealistic savings,'' and that it would not meet the state's financial obligations.
''A balanced budget is critical to our economic recovery,'' he said in his veto message. ''I am, once again, calling on Republicans to allow the people of California to vote on tax extensions for a balanced budget and significant reforms.''
He said the extensions, on sales, income and vehicle taxes, were the only alternative to deep cuts and were needed to solve long-term problems.
''California is in a fiscal mess,'' Mr. Brown said. ''The political class is deeply divided.''
''If we can't find a way to get around that, then we will irreversibly enter on a pathway of decline.'' He added that deeper cuts would be ''a tragedy for which Republicans will bear full responsibility.''
One reason for the legislators' scramble to pass the stopgap budget by Wednesday's deadline is that state law calls for them to be docked a full day's pay for every day the budget is late. The law requires legislators to pass a balanced state budget, but it was unclear whether the state controller, who issues their paychecks, would consider the budget they passed to have met that criterion.
Mr. Brown's veto angered members of his own party, who said they had yet to hear his plan for what he would do if he could not secure support from Republicans in the final two weeks of the fiscal year, which ends on June 30.
''His decision is apparently part of some elaborate strategy to force a confrontation,'' said Darrell Steinberg, the president pro tempore of the Senate. ''We are too far down the road for the governor to continue avoiding a specific set of proposals if he cannot gain those votes.''
John A. Perez, the speaker of the Assembly, said the veto was ''unnecessary and counterproductive, and it leaves us back at square one.''
Talks between the governor and Republicans broke down in March.
The State Senate minority leader, Bob Dutton, said in a statement that Mr. Brown was wrong to place the blame on his party. ''The truth is Governor Brown and the Democrats blocked the people's right to vote because they can't stand up to the powerful public employee unions,'' he said. The budget requires ''meaningful pension reform, a spending limit and business-regulation relief for job creation.''
Mr. Brown said he would urge lawmakers to take ''24 hours to reflect on where we are,'' adding that he would ''move heaven and earth'' to secure the Republican support he needed to get the budget passed.

HEADLINE: Banished In California, Dance Event Edges East

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- The Electric Daisy Carnival drew nearly 160,000 people to the Los Angeles Coliseum last year for a two-day outdoor extravaganza of electronic music and dazzling visual displays. 
But that rave also produced dozens of arrests, hundreds of drug overdoses and the death of a teenage girl, drawing a storm of criticism that effectively banished the carnival from returning to Los Angeles this year.
On Thursday, the Electric Daisy promoters were all but given the keys to Las Vegas. The event's chief executive, Pasquale Rotella, flew here for an official proclamation and a personal testimonial from the mayor, Oscar B. Goodman, for bringing it to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway on June 24 through 26.
''I don't care what L.A. says, you know that,'' Mr. Goodman said after he and Mr. Rotella posed holding the official city proclamation honoring the event. ''L.A. is like a second-class entertainment venue. We're the world entertainment venue.''
Mr. Goodman, whose term is coming to a close, is a mayor who has always celebrated the ''sin'' in Sin City, and he made no exception as the city rolled out the red carpet for an event that has gained such notoriety. Among its detractors was Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles.
When questioned about the drug death of a 15-year-old girl there, Mr. Goodman responded, ''I know, but an under-age girl could die anyplace if she misbehaves.'' The promoters should not be held responsible for the behavior of the thousands of people who attend, he said.
The Electric Daisy Carnival, which is also held in several other cities, will last three days here and is expected to draw over 250,000 people. There will be six stages, with names like Kinetic Field, including some of the best-known D.J.'s and performers of electric music. The producers, Insomniac Events, have been promoting raves like this for 14 years and said they were taking precautions against drug abuse or health problems.
Mr. Goodman, in honoring Electric Daisy as an economic boon to a city known for over-the-line celebrations, confessed that he was less than well acquainted with the music celebrated at these kinds of events.
''Is this going to be in the daytime as well as the evening, or just in the evening?'' he asked Mr. Rotella.
Mr. Rotella cleared his throat. ''It starts at 8 and goes into the morning,'' he responded.
The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission effectively canceled the rave earlier this year at a cost of almost $300,000 in lost revenues. Questions had been raised about why it should be staged in a city-owned building and about conflict of interest after The Los Angeles Times reported that a top Coliseum official was also working as a consultant to Insomniac Events.
Mr. Rotella had given up trying to find another place in Los Angeles for the event, instead turning his attention here. ''We have gotten a great reception from Las Vegas,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Who Is James Johnson?

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Paul Krugman is off today.

 BODY:
Most political scandals involve people who are not really enmeshed in the Washington establishment -- people like Representative Anthony Weiner or Representative William Jefferson. Most scandals involve spectacularly bad behavior -- like posting pictures of your private parts on the Web or hiding $90,000 in cash in your freezer.
But the most devastating scandal in recent history involved dozens of the most respected members of the Washington establishment. Their behavior was not out of the ordinary by any means. 
For that reason, the Fannie Mae scandal is the most important political scandal since Watergate. It helped sink the American economy. It has cost taxpayers about $153 billion, so far. It indicts patterns of behavior that are considered normal and respectable in Washington.
The Fannie Mae scandal has gotten relatively little media attention because many of the participants are still powerful, admired and well connected. But Gretchen Morgenson, a Times colleague, and the financial analyst Joshua Rosner have rectified that, writing ''Reckless Endangerment,'' a brave book that exposes the affair in clear and gripping form.
The story centers around James Johnson, a Democratic sage with a raft of prestigious connections. Appointed as chief executive of Fannie Mae in 1991, Johnson started an aggressive effort to expand homeownership.
Back then, Fannie Mae could raise money at low interest rates because the federal government implicitly guaranteed its debt. In 1995, according to the Congressional Budget Office, this implied guarantee netted the agency $7 billion. Instead of using that money to help buyers, Johnson and other executives kept $2.1 billion for themselves and their shareholders. They used it to further the cause -- expanding their clout, their salaries and their bonuses. They did the things that every special-interest group does to advance its interests.
Fannie Mae co-opted relevant activist groups, handing out money to Acorn, the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and other groups that it might need on its side.
Fannie ginned up Astroturf lobbying campaigns. In 2000, for example, a bill was introduced that threatened Fannie's special status. The Coalition for Homeownership was formed and letters poured into Congressional offices opposing the bill. Many signatories of the letter had no idea their names had been used.
Fannie lavished campaign contributions on members of Congress. Time and again experts would go before some Congressional committee to warn that Fannie was lowering borrowing standards and posing an enormous risk to taxpayers. Phalanxes of congressmen would be mobilized to bludgeon the experts and kill unfriendly legislation.
Fannie executives ginned up academic studies. They created a foundation that spent tens of millions in advertising. They spent enormous amounts of time and money capturing the regulators who were supposed to police them.
Morgenson and Rosner write with barely suppressed rage, as if great crimes are being committed. But there are no crimes. This is how Washington works. Only two of the characters in this tale come off as egregiously immoral. Johnson made $100 million while supposedly helping the poor. Representative Barney Frank, whose partner at the time worked for Fannie, was arrogantly dismissive when anybody raised doubts about the stability of the whole arrangement.
Most of the people were simply doing what reputable figures do in service to a supposedly good cause. Johnson roped in some of the most respected establishment names: Bill Daley, Tom Donilon, Joseph Stiglitz, Dianne Feinstein, Kit Bond, Franklin Raines, Larry Summers, Robert Zoellick, Ken Starr and so on.
Of course, it all came undone. Underneath, Fannie was a cancer that helped spread risky behavior and low standards across the housing industry. We all know what happened next.
The scandal has sent the message that the leadership class is fundamentally self-dealing. Leaders on the center-right and center-left are always trying to create public-private partnerships to spark socially productive activity. But the biggest public-private partnership to date led to shameless self-enrichment and disastrous results.
It has sent the message that we have hit the moment of demosclerosis. Washington is home to a vertiginous tangle of industry associations, activist groups, think tanks and communications shops. These forces have overwhelmed the government that was originally conceived by the founders.
The final message is that members of the leadership class have done nothing to police themselves. The Wall Street-Industry-Regulator-Lobbyist tangle is even more deeply enmeshed.
People may not like Michele Bachmann, but when they finish ''Reckless Endangerment'' they will understand why there is a market for politicians like her. They'll realize that if the existing leadership class doesn't redefine ''normal'' behavior, some pungent and colorful movement will sweep in and do it for them.

HEADLINE: Unhappy Jazz Musicians

BYLINE: By NATE CHINEN

 BODY:
The Undead Jazzfest, now in its second year, will employ dozens of jazz musicians next week, in more than 50 sets, from Thursday through Sunday, in New York. But the terms of that employment have drawn criticism, according to a petition posted online. 
Available at winterundeadmusicians.wordpress.com, the petition - which addresses both the Undead Jazzfest and a longer-running partner event, the Winter Jazzfest - takes issue with the festivals' fee structure, calling on their promoters to meet with a Winter/Undead Festival Musicians Organizing Committee and representatives from Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians. Among its goals is a minimum rate of pay; there's also a reference to ''other conditions.''
''We seek neither controversy nor conflict, and hope these issues can be resolved through a reasonable good faith negotiation with the promoters,'' read an email message that circulated with a link to the petition. ''But we know that unless we ourselves organize to draw the line somewhere, no negotiations will occur, and the decline in our rates of pay will continue.'' The petition is anonymous, but the message was signed by a handful of prominent musicians, including the saxophonist Steve Coleman, the pianists Jason Moran and Orrin Evans, and the guitarists Mary Halvorson and Marc Ribot.
The Undead Jazzfest is presented jointly by Search and Restore and Boom Collective; an email seeking comment from both organizations was not returned. Prices for the festival are kept approachably low: a four-day pass is $50, and a single-night pass is $25. The pay scale for participating musicians is undisclosed.
A similar effort in 1999, led by Mr. Ribot, took aim at the Knitting Factory's Texaco Jazz Festival. In that case musicians eventually secured a minimum of $200 each per engagement, for groups of up to six. (In larger ensembles the rate was reduced.)
The Undead Jazzfest operates without title sponsorship, and a minimum rate of pay could affect its programming philosophy along with its ticket price. As an audience experience it traffics in abundance; the economics behind the scene have so far been invisible.
That may not be the case for much longer. ''We reject the rationale that musicians should accept unfair treatment in exchange for 'exposure' and 'publicity,''' reads the email message. ''The only opportunity guaranteed by acceptance of substandard pay and conditions is the normalization of our own mistreatment.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Craft Rejuvenated, With Added Emphasis on Art

BYLINE: By REYHAN HARMANCI. 
rharmanci@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Unlike the bold, colorful hand-lettered signs he makes for restaurants, bars and other businesses, Damon Styer, the owner of New Bohemia Signs, is an understated guy.
A 1993 graduate of San Francisco Art Institute who began sign painting ''on a whim'' after a failed marriage and a stint at the San Francisco stock exchange, Mr. Styer emphasizes old-school values -- sure-handedness and practice -- and plays down the business's artistic side.
But low key or not, Mr. Steyer's creative cache is definitely on the rise. Five young painters, many of whom flash tattoos and share Mr. Styer's art school training, churn out hand-painted signs and gold-leaf work for clients as diverse as North Beach's Stinking Rose restaurant and Facebook. And last year, New Bohemia began participating in gallery exhibitions. 
''I think, nationally, there's more of an interest in D.I.Y., maybe partly due to the economic situation,'' Mr. Styer said. ''People are coming to us saying, 'We want something authentic.' ''
The company's latest art show opened last week at Guerrero Gallery in the Mission district. Titled ''Sign Your Life Away,'' it was an opportunity for New Bohemia workers to apply their professional technique to pieces not done for clients. New Bohemia donated paint but does not profit from the work that is sold.
Just like the studio itself, the crowded salon-style hanging at the gallery creates a visual cacophony. Shouting smart-alecky phrases like carnival barkers on a boardwalk (''What's the sign you've been waiting for?'' and ''You've been warned''), the multitude of signs makes an overwhelming yet moving paean to the form.
The show also features Jeff Canham, a Bay Area artist who used to work at New Bohemia, and Steven Powers, a high-profile graffiti artist whose colorful text-based work has been influenced from his time working with traditional sign painters.
Like silk-screening and letterpress operations, sign painting is benefiting from a general resurgence of interest in hand-done crafts.
A documentary about sign painters is to be released in early 2012, and new businesses, like Golden West Sign Arts in Berkeley and Best Dressed Signs in Boston, started by Josh Luke, a New Bohemia alumnus, are hanging up shingles.
Mr. Styer said business at New Bohemia had been brisk. Earlier this year, the company moved into a space ''at least'' double the size of its former studio.
Andres Guerrero, proprietor of Guerrero Gallery, used the word ''authentic'' in describing the exhibition's appeal -- noting as well that fans of sign painting run the gamut from graffiti enthusiasts to typography nerds.
''We could all use Photoshop all day and make letters,'' Mr. Guerrero said. ''Yet there's this element of hand -- your style, how you control things.''
Hand-painted signs will probably never go back to the glory days of the 20th century, when itinerant ''wall dogs'' would go on ''sign snapping'' trips across the country, drumming up business.
But then, 30 years ago, the advent of vinyl sign-cutting technology turned the industry on its head.
''Until the 1980s, all outdoor visual communication was done by a person who did it by hand,'' said Sam Macon, who is co-directing the film ''Sign Painters: Stories from an American Trade'' with Faythe Levine. ''Vinyl decimated the community.''
Wade Swormstedt, editor of Signs of the Times magazine, agreed, saying that in 2010, sign companies that used paint comprised 43 percent of the non-electric sign industry, down from 59 percent in 2000. But Mr. Swormstedt also said he thinks that hand-painted signs ''would never go away.''
Outside of industry trends, New Bohemia has been cultivating a close-knit community of artist sign-painters, many of whom have garnered success in the fine-art world.
When Mr. Styer took over the business in 1999 (it was founded in 1993), he was its sole employee. But through talented apprentices like Tauba Auerbach -- a participant in the 2010 Whitney Biennial who worked with Mr. Styer for three years before moving to New York City in 2008 -- and Mr. Canham, who is known for his graphic design as well as hand-painted artworks, a new generation was exposed to the craft.
Plying the sign-painting trade at New Bohemia has affected their art, the artists said.
''It totally changed,'' Mr. Canham said, speaking of his mixed-media work. Whereas before he had improvised a technique for his letter-based art, the sign shop instilled a discipline and appreciation for new materials.
Ms. Auerbach wrote in an e-mail, ''I can't imagine a more perfect job for me at the time.''
She sought out New Bohemia in 2002 and she said the experience helped hone her pursuit of ''that illusive sweet spot'' between precision and speed.
New Bohemia is not currently planning any more gallery shows, but with so much interest in the shop, the staff will begin offering classes this summer.
And every month, Mr. Styer said, a steady stream of young people knock on the door, many with artistic aspirations. He counsels patience, saying, ''You have to master the craft before you start bending it.''

HEADLINE: Worries Grow About Breadth of Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Contributing reporting were Eric Dash, Stephen Castle, Matthew Saltmarsh and Liz Alderman.

 BODY:
The tumult in the European monetary zone is spreading concern among investors of a broader crisis in financial markets from Ireland to Spain.
The worry is that the worst case, a Greek debt default, would lead to damaging losses for European banks and spur a global panic, replaying the events of September 2008. Then, investors fled all but the safest government debt, unloading everything from corporate bonds to American and emerging country stocks. Global markets froze.
As European officials headed into a long weekend of critical talks, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund said that they were confident of a deal to secure a vital 12 billion euros ($17 billion) in outside aid needed to stave off an imminent Greek default.
The comments, reflecting belated advances in negotiations that have been going on for weeks, were aimed at calming anxious financial markets. But so far, the deepening concerns are stopping short of transferring forcefully to the United States. For the time being at least, investors seem to believe enough shock absorbers have been built in to comfortably withstand any default by Greece or other highly debt-ridden nation. 
The interest rate on United States 10-year Treasury bonds remains below 3 percent. In contrast, Spanish bond yields rose to an 11-year high of 5.74 percent as anxious investors fretted that it could be next in the firing line after Greece.
''U.S. financial institutions are very cash-rich, so that means a liquidity crisis would have to be extraordinary before it affects them,'' said Guy LeBas, the chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott.
After a 179-point sell-off on Wednesday, American markets stabilized, with all the main United States indexes closing higher.
But the cost to investors of insuring their holdings of Greek government debt, to make sure they recoup their money in the event of a default, registered its single biggest one-day move.
An investor now has to pay about $2 million annually to insure $10 million of Greek debt over five years, compared with about $50,000 on the same amount of United States government debt, according to Markit.
Insurance rates on the debt of Irish and Portuguese governments, as measured by rates in the market for credit-default swaps, also climbed to record highs. In addition, Spain struggled to kindle investor interest on its auction of bonds, selling 2.8 billion euros ($4 billion), missing its top target and with average yields creeping up again. The fear is that a Greek default could threaten the integrity of the euro zone, require European countries to bail out banks that lent heavily to Greece and other deeply indebted countries, and spread panic across global markets.
The European Union's top economic official, Olli Rehn, said he had reached a deal with the International Monetary Fund to avoid a Greek default through at least the fall.
But he warned politicians they must agree to new austerity measures or the program would be worthless.
The mood in the markets was made more nervous when Michael Noonan, finance minister of Ireland, said on Wednesday that the Irish government was ready to impose losses on senior unsecured bondholders of Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society if the European Central Bank agreed. That added to fears that countries beyond Greece might be involved in a broader restructuring.
Also, some well-regarded economists say that a Greek default is almost inevitable. The chances of Greece defaulting are ''so high that you almost have to say there's no way out,'' Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on a ''Charlie Rose'' broadcast, shown on Bloomberg TV on Thursday night. He added that as a result, some American banks may be ''up against the wall.''
The financial markets are watching nervously as the Greek government tries to push through austerity measures required to secure more international aid.
Greece ''needs to better inform the markets as well as the Greek people that what's being done is actually achieving results, which will help restore confidence,'' said Claude Giorno, the senior economist for Greece at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, based in Paris.
But the United States, for the time being, appeared insulated from the problems, and American assets remain a destination for anxious global investors, with the dollar and Treasuries rising.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.22 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,267.64. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 64.25 points, or 0.54 percent, to 11,961.52. The Nasdaq composite index fell 7.76 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,623.70.
Still, two Deutsche Bank strategists, Jim Reid and Colin Tan, warned in a report on Thursday that this Greek crisis had echoes of the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank in September 2008, an event that plunged the financial system into chaos and required the commitment of trillions of dollars in government support to stave off another Great Depression.
''Everyone in every corner of global financial markets should be keeping a very close eye on upcoming Greek events,'' they wrote. ''The period is resembling the buildup to the Lehman collapse where, although markets were increasingly nervous, virtually everyone expected a last-minute buyer.''
One ugly scene that some analysts are imagining involves a default by Greece leading to losses inflicted on banks in other European countries that own large amounts of Greek debt. The European Central Bank, too, is a big holder of debt, and analysts said in the event of a default it might need to be recapitalized, another blow to confidence.
Those losses could then cascade to the United States because the American and European banking systems are so interlocked, lending billions of dollars to each other every day.
American banks and insurance companies may also be liable for the biggest share of default insurance payments to European institutions if Greece or other countries fail. And the trillion-dollar money market fund industry could also suffer.
About 44.3 percent of money-market fund assets are European bank debt, according to Fitch Ratings, although they may be a little insulated because they have sold much of their Spanish, Portuguese and Irish debt. The funds have never held Greek bank debt, which rarely met the funds' credit rating standards. The markets are keenly watching for signs that contagion is spreading through the global financial system.
The renewed volatility in the markets has again trained a spotlight on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. The VIX, as it is known, measures the implied volatility of options on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. It rose to settle above 21 on Thursday for the first time since March.
Another pressure gauge under scrutiny is the overnight interbank lending rate. As of Monday, investors' expectations for three months from now of the overnight interbank lending rate showed an increase of about 10 basis points to nearly twice its current levels.
Still, increases in those two measures so far pale in comparison to the spikes in both during last year's flare-up in Europe.

HEADLINE: City Makes Progress in Stepped-Up War Against Chronic Student Absenteeism

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN; Robert Gebeloff contributed reporting.

 BODY:
At Public School 309 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, students wear necklaces with colorful pendants, each marking a month in which they did not miss a day of school. At P.S. 75 in the South Bronx, a row of young adults welcomes students each morning as they walk in the door. Some 40,000 city children got daily automated wake-up calls from Magic Johnson and other celebrities to remind them to show up for class, and City Hall offered prizes like baseball tickets and gift certificates.
Throughout New York, educators and politicians have been increasing their focus on attendance in recent years, and their efforts appear to be paying off, at least in elementary schools: 1 in 15 elementary students were absent on a given day this year, compared to 1 in 13 four years ago and 1 in 9 in 1995. 
And there have been even more significant strides in combating chronic absenteeism in early grades, according to a new study by the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School: In the 2009-10 school year, according to the report, there were 105 elementary schools where 30 percent or more of students missed at least a month of class, down from 216 three years earlier.
The problem has hardly disappeared. Last year, at 42 percent of the city's 700 elementary schools, one in five students missed a month or more of school, according to the New School study. But four years ago, that was true of 58 percent of the schools. And high school attendance is worse and tougher to fix: 34 percent of the city's high school students missed a month or more of school last year.
''We were surprised by the results,'' said Kim Nauer, a New School researcher. ''The number of elementary schools with virulent absenteeism problems is going down. But thousands of kids are still in schools where a third of their class might be gone on any given day.''
Researchers and city officials credited the improvements, in part, to a change the Education Department made two years ago in beginning to specifically track chronic absentees, defined as students who miss 20 days or more in a school year, along with tracking average attendance in schools, the traditional benchmark.
''Changing the way we count attendance is so essential to turning things around,'' said Hedy N. Chang, the director of Attendance Counts, a policy group.
There are countless causes of chronic absenteeism, including illnesses like asthma, safety concerns, transportation problems and lax parents. It is one of the best-known predictors of future dropouts, and according to another new study, a driver of the city's low test scores.
Following about 64,000 New York City students through third and fourth grades between 2006 and 2008, that study, by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, found that as attendance improved, so did performance on state tests.
It also found that the attendance environment at the school mattered: at schools with high absentee rates, students who improved their individual attendance got less of an achievement bump than those at schools with near-perfect attendance.
Poverty and race are closely tied to chronic absenteeism, the study found. Among black and Hispanic children in the study, more than 90 percent of whom qualified for free or reduced-cost lunch, more than one in five were chronically absent. Asian-Americans had the lowest rate of chronic absenteeism, 4 percent, though 84 percent of them qualified for the lunch program; 12 percent of white students in the study were chronically absent, though they were economically better off.
The Campaign for Fiscal Equity's researchers said the predicted improvement on tests from good attendance amounted to a fifth or a quarter of the achievement gap between black and Hispanic students and their white and Asian classmates.
At P.S. 309, where the students proudly wear their attendance tags around their necks, chronic absenteeism has fallen from one in four students to one in five over the last two years. This year, the principal, Emily Zucal, began an early-morning fitness program to help lure students, as well as monthly assemblies and pizza parties for those who do not miss a day.
''Kids really want to be called out in front of their peers and be celebrated,'' Ms. Zucal said. ''And the nice thing is, rewards for attendance are completely blind of everything else, like behavior and grades.''
At P.S. 75, a hulking old school near an entrance ramp to the Bruckner Expressway, a dozen young adults in matching uniforms form a line between the school buses and the entrance door, greeting children with hugs, high-fives and sometimes stickers. They work for City Year, a federal program that places mentors in high-poverty schools.
A spokesman for City Year, Ian Rees, said that in the last year the program had been working to prevent dropouts by focusing on what he called the ABCs: absenteeism, behavior and course performance. A city pilot program allowed City Year mentors at seven schools this year to see student attendance data for the first time, so they could focus their tutoring and attention on students having trouble.
On Tuesday, Shimee Housey, 12, a fifth grader who was frequently late last year, shyly accepted a rainbow sticker from Heather Slivko-Bathurst, 22, one of the mentors, as he arrived at school. ''They help kids gather up focus in class, and help us learn,'' Shimee said.
City Year had only few thousand dollars to spend on incentives, so mentors offered things like origami fortune tellers with fortune cookies attached for those who showed up early to school. But the City Hall pilot program, which included 25 schools this year and will grow to 50 schools in the fall, offered some richer prizes: for example, Angel Lopez, the fourth grader with the most-improved attendance at P.S. 75, got to stand in center field at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday with other students at a special ceremony before the first pitch.
This year, overall attendance at P.S. 75 improved slightly, following the citywide trend. But among the 130 students with the worst attendance who were the focus of the mentoring, the wake-up calls, help from a health clinic and the incentives, ''we've seen a lot of dramatic improvements,'' Richard Gugliotta, an assistant principal, said.
''If nothing else,'' he added, ''we were annoying people into bringing their kids to school, which was fine with me.''

HEADLINE: State Workers Swarm Trenton to Protest Charges to Their Health and Pension Plans

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA; Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Thousands of angry government workers swarmed New Jersey's Capitol on Thursday and some were briefly arrested, one day after Gov. Chris Christie and legislative leaders agreed to sharply increase the contributions public employees must make into their health insurance and pensions plans.
The proposed deal, which has yet to come to a vote in either house, would be a major victory for Mr. Christie, transferring billions of dollars a year in expenses from the government to its employees, and once again curbing the power of the governor's favorite foil, the public employee unions. 
It would eliminate the longstanding practice of negotiating health care payments in contract talks with the unions, instead imposing those terms through legislation. The proposed deal puts Mr. Christie firmly in the ranks of fellow Republican governors who have curtailed public workers' collective bargaining rights this year, including Mitch Daniels of Indiana, John Kasich of Ohio, Paul LePage of Maine and Scott Walker of Wisconsin.
But the recent conflicts in those states have been strictly partisan affairs, with Democrats opposing moves made by Republican majorities. In New Jersey, the battle over pensions and health care has turned into an intramural fight among Democrats, who control both houses of the Legislature, threatening to shake up the party's leadership and weaken it in coming elections, thereby strengthening Mr. Christie's hand.
Currently, most state and local employees pay 1.5 percent of their salaries for health insurance. Mr. Christie's proposal would phase in a sliding scale, requiring higher-income workers to pay a bigger share of their insurance premium. For a typical worker making $65,000 a year, the cost of full-family coverage would rise to about $3,600 a year, from about $1,000.
Employees' pension contributions would rise immediately from 5.5 percent of their salary to 6.5 percent, and then, in stages, to 7.5 percent. On a $65,000 salary, the increase would come to $1,300 a year.
Union members packed a State Senate hearing in Trenton on Thursday, the first one to take up the proposal. Like thousands of their compatriots in the State House hallways and on the lawn outside, they noisily protested what they called an assault on collective bargaining and a betrayal by key Democrats.
At one point, chanting protesters brought the hearing to a halt, which lasted until the State Police forced about two dozen of them out of the chamber. They were arrested, but then released.
''There is a campaign across the country to use this economic crisis as an excuse to destroy the rights of working people,'' said Robert Master, regional legislative and political director of the Communications Workers of America, the union that represents the largest number of state employees. ''Real Democrats would not have collaborated with Chris Christie to make this attack on the democratic rights of public workers.''
Another official from the union, Christopher Shelton, compared the governor to Adolf Hitler, telling the crowd ''Welcome to Nazi Germany'' and ''It's going to take World War III to get rid of Adolf Christie,'' according to the Associated Press. Mr. Shelton later said his remarks were inappropriate, and apologized.
The bill would affect about 400,000 state and local workers and is expected to go to a vote next week in both the Senate and the Assembly, where legislators say most Democrats will vote against it. With Republicans sure to line up behind the measure, however, even a minority of Democrats could help pass it.
Mr. Christie is negotiating with state employee unions for a new set of contracts, and with the Legislature over a state budget, and aides said he viewed the health and pension provisions as prerequisites for both.
At a conference of county officials in Atlantic City, he said that with the pension and health care agreement his office announced on Wednesday night, ''New Jersey is setting the model by dealing with it in an honest way.''
Some of the Democrats' most important power brokers outside the Legislature have lined up with the governor on this issue, including George M. Norcross of Camden County; Joseph DiVincenzo, the Essex County executive, and his mentor, Stephen N. Adubato Sr. Mr. Sweeney, a Gloucester County Democrat, has pushed for years to curb the cost of employee benefits, and the proposed law resembles his original plan more than the governor's.
''We could either oppose the governor or craft our own revolutionary response to reform,'' he said Thursday. ''Reform is needed now.''
But at several points in recent weeks, when a deal seemed imminent, Ms. Oliver held back, unable to overcome her own objections and those in her caucus. Even after the governor's office announced the deal, she made no public statement on it.
The deal infuriated the unions that are usually the Democrats' most important allies. ''He keeps talking about shared pain and sacrifice,'' said Matthew Koczur, 47, a member of the communications workers union. ''But if you put our pain and sacrifice on a scale with their pain and sacrifice, we give far more.''
.
In the last decade, Democratic elected officials, party bosses and unions have formed a mostly united front, electing governors and senators, and ensuring that Democrats retained legislative majorities even when Mr. Christie defeated Gov. Jon S. Corzine in 2009.
Now, as labor considers withholding support from Democrats, Republican strategists hope to exploit those divisions in the legislative elections this year, as well as in the 2013 race for governor.

HEADLINE: Setbacks for Samsonite and Prada in Hong Kong

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Two of the most prominent initial public offerings in Asia this year were dealt setbacks on Thursday, as renewed worries about the debt crisis in Greece and the waning growth momentum in China sent stocks sharply lower.
Prada, the Italian luxury fashion house, lowered the price guidance for its listing in Hong Kong amid feeble demand from retail investors, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said Thursday. 
And shares in Samsonite, the luggage maker that was founded in the United States 101 years ago, fell sharply on their first trading day in Hong Kong, becoming the latest in a string of global offerings to weather a poor market debut.
Widespread selling across the Asia-Pacific region sent several major stock indexes down by more than 1.5 percent.
The global market sell-off had started on Wednesday, as protests and an imminent cabinet reshuffle in Athens once again fed fears that Greece's debt crisis would escalate and spread. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.5 percent on Wednesday.
Asian markets followed suit on Thursday, with a 1.9 percent drop in Australia and South Korea. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong declined 1.8 percent.
There has been ''a complete loss of confidence,'' said Francis Lun, managing director at Lyncean Holdings in Hong Kong. ''With Greece on the verge of default, there are now fears that there will be a wider financial crisis.''
In many of the fast-growing emerging nations, inflation pressures and rising interest rates are adding to investor nervousness. On Thursday, India raised its key interest rate for the 10th time since early last year.
Likewise, the authorities in mainland China have been reining in bank lending for the last 18 months, as well as raising interest rates. Another rate increase is widely expected to come within weeks as Beijing continues its battle to contain inflation.
''Liquidity is being squeezed by the government's determination to bring down property prices and tighten rates,'' Mr. Lun said.
Stock markets in the Asia-Pacific have performed poorly this year as a result. Most major indexes in the region are now below where they began the year, and several stock market debuts have performed poorly. Some companies have even shelved their public offerings as a result.
The weak market sentiment on Thursday prompted Prada, whose high-end handbags and apparel are popular with Asia's increasingly affluent shoppers, to lower its price range to 39.50 to 42.25 Hong Kong dollars, from a previously announced range of 36.50 to 48 Hong Kong dollars, according to a person with direct knowledge of the listing, who spoke anonymously because the information was not yet public.
A price at the upper end of the lowered range would bring Prada $2.3 billion, from the previous maximum of $2.6 billion. Prada is to price its shares on Friday and start listing on the Hong Kong exchange on June 24.
Meanwhile, shares in Samsonite, which had been only moderately oversubscribed, dropped as much as 10.6 percent early in the day. Although they recouped some of those losses later on, the shares were well below the issue price of 14.5 Hong Kong dollars, or $1.86, by late afternoon, closing at 13.38 dollars, down 7.7 percent.
Samsonite, which was bought by the British private equity firm CVC Capital Partners in 2007, had previously been forced to price its shares at the lower end of its indicative range, bringing it proceeds of $1.25 billion, rather than the maximum $1.5 billion it had hoped for.
Still, the decisions by companies like Samsonite and Prada to seek a listing in the Asian financial hub, rather than on an exchange closer to home, reflect an overall shift in the center of economic and financial gravity toward fast-growing countries in Asia.
About a dozen non-Asian companies are aiming to list in Hong Kong this year in a bid to tap a cash-rich investor base and to raise their visibility in what is a central market for their goods.
''We feel at home here,'' said Tim Parker, the Samsonite chief executive, amid a clatter of camera shutters at a listing ceremony at the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday, adding that the company planned to build its business in China, India and other parts of Asia.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Increase, While Jobless Claims Slip

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week and builders broke ground on more homes in May. The latest data offered some hope that the economy may be improving after hitting a recent slump.
Unemployment benefit applications fell to a seasonally adjusted 414,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was the second drop in three weeks and a positive sign that layoffs are slowing. 
Still, applications have been above 400,000 for 10 consecutive weeks, evidence that the job market is weak compared with earlier this year.
Home construction rose last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 560,000 units a year, the Commerce Department said. Economists say the pace of construction is far below the 1.2 million homes a year that must be built to sustain a healthy home building industry.
Unemployment applications had fallen to 375,000 in February, a level that signals sustainable job growth. They stayed below 400,000 for seven of nine weeks. But applications surged in April to 478,000 -- an eight-month high -- and they have declined slowly since then.
Economists said the steady decline in unemployment applications signaled that the job market was improving, but at a very slow pace.
''This is not a derailing of the economy,'' said Bricklin Dwyer, an economist at BNP Paribas. ''This is a period of weak growth, and we're going to see this for some time.''
The elevated level of applications suggests that companies pulled back on hiring in the face of higher gas and food prices, which have cut into consumer spending. Hiring has slowed sharply since applications rose.
Employers added only 54,000 net new jobs in May, much slower than the average gain of 220,000 a month in the previous three months. The unemployment rate rose to 9.1 percent from 9 percent.
Employers probably added more jobs in June than in May, but less than the 220,000 pace from earlier this year, economists said.
More hiring is important because it is critical to increasing consumers' incomes, which in turn would fuel more spending. Consumer spending grew at a weak 2.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, down from 4 percent in the previous quarter. That pushed down economic growth to 1.8 percent, from 3.1 percent.
While the job market was improving earlier this year, home building is coming off the two worst years on records dating back five decades. And the May data suggests that will not change anytime soon.
The number of single-family homes started in May rose a modest 3.7 percent. But the construction pace of single-family homes, which accounts for about 80 percent of all residential construction, is well below the 2010 rate. Construction of those traditional homes is ''still very much dead in the water,'' said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo.
Housing permits, a gauge of future construction, rose last month to the highest level since December. But apartment and condominium construction accounted for a large portion of that increase. Renting has become a preferred option for many Americans who lost their jobs in the recession and were forced to leave their rapidly depreciating homes.
Though new homes represent a small fraction of the overall housing market, they have an outsize influence on the economy. Each home built generates, on average, three jobs and $90,000 in taxes, according to the National Association of Home Builders.
Factory output, which has been one of the strongest sectors of the economy since the recession ended two years ago, has also slowed this spring. And it may be getting worse in the Northeast.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said on Thursday that its regional index of manufacturing conditions dropped to minus 7.7 in June, down from 3.9 in May. It was the first negative reading since last September and the lowest reading for the index since July 2009.
The index tracks manufacturing conditions in the region covered by the Philadelphia Fed. That includes eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.

HEADLINE: Meatless Mondays Catch On, Even With Carnivores

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
ASPEN, Colo. -- Friction between the health-and-eco-minded hippies who came here for a Rocky Mountain High in the 1970s and the super-wealthy second-homers who followed from the intersection of Hollywood and Hedge Fund is an old story here at 8,000 feet.
But now there is a new potential skirmish line: Meatless Mondays. 
For whatever reason, chefs and restaurateurs say, the big outside money that fuels economic life here, often flying in by private jet from places like Malibu or the Main Line, tilts heavily toward the carnivorous.
''It's very interesting, but for some reason when people come to Aspen, they want to eat meat,'' said Mimi Lenk, a vegetarian for more than a decade and the manager of Syzygy, a downtown restaurant where elk, bison and lamb are the big sellers.
A new nationwide pro-veggie effort, however -- aimed at persuading people to go meatless at least one day a week -- has been embraced here more than in any other city in America. At least 20 institutions and restaurants, including Syzygy, are offering vegetarian choices on Mondays under a plan announced this month.
''Nobody is saying, 'go become a vegetarian,' '' said Martin Oswald, a restaurateur who led the effort in signing up Meatless Monday participants among his food-industry friends. Mr. Oswald said he thought the dynamic that made Aspen such a prime place to expand Meatless Monday was not philosophy or health, but rather the cutthroat economics of the restaurant business -- keeping up with the Joneses for fear of being left out.
''The key was to get enough restaurants involved, then I could say: 'Well, that guy does it and that guy over there and this guy does it over here. Do you want to do it, too?' '' he said, sitting across the table at one of his restaurants, Pyramid Bistro. That approach, with its hard-to-say-no overtones, worked well. ''So far, nobody has actually refused,'' he said.
In food, as in so many other things, Aspen was already nowhere near average. In a state with the lowest obesity rate in the nation, an alpine outdoor menu -- biking, rafting, hiking, rock-climbing and, of course, skiing -- make it a fitness capital. And local institutions already led the charge in healthier eating.
Aspen Valley Hospital began boosting vegetarian choices several years ago in its food services. This month, the cardiac rehabilitation unit, where 20 percent to 30 percent of the patients are second-homers, began urging patients to patronize Meatless Monday restaurants in town.
In the public school system, which embraced Meatless Monday two years ago, whole grain pancakes, dubbed ''breakfast for lunch,'' are a popular Monday rotation in the elementary and middle schools. And even during the rest of the week, school lunches, down to and including the ketchup, are made from scratch, overseen by a chef hired away from a downtown restaurant.
''We roast our own beets,'' said Tenille Folk, the director of food services for the Aspen School District's middle and elementary schools.
The ambition and scale of the wider restaurant effort for Meatless Monday, which started on June 6, has made Aspen ''the nation's first true Meatless Monday community,'' said the Meatless Monday campaign, a national effort in association with the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health.
It can be a delicate process, and many chefs here stress that they are not trying to convert anyone. The customer is always right, they say, whatever he or she wants to eat. Indeed, many say that in the tougher economic times of the past few years, meat consumption has probably gone up, perhaps as comfort food. A strictly vegetarian restaurant in Aspen closed a few years ago.
But that environment of competition and cost-control also created an opening, boosters of Meatless Monday say. Vegetables, in addition to having less impact on the planet than meat in energy and water usage, are much cheaper as an ingredient. And some local restaurateurs participating in Meatless Monday also said they had noticed an increasingly prominent gender gap, too, in recent years -- with women tending more toward the vegetable side of the menu -- which they can now overtly exploit on Mondays.
''It's all about getting somebody in the door,'' said Tico Starr, the chef at Rustique Bistro.
Still, some restaurants remain skittish.
''It's something you need to study,'' said Alex Harvier, the manager at Cache Cache, a French restaurant where entrees on recent Monday night included osso buco and calf's liver, with prices ranging from $30 to $58. He said the integrity of the menu and the dining experience had to be considered in adding any new dishes.
''You can't just tack something on,'' he said.
The local government has also taken a cautious approach. Meatless Monday backers, in approaching the City Council for a public resolution of support -- similar to ones passed in San Francisco and Washington, among other cities -- got nowhere.
Some residents said the Council's reluctance was rooted in the old Aspen -- rowdy and antiauthoritarian, as epitomized by the gonzo author Hunter S. Thompson, who came to the area in the 1970s and died in 2005. Others said it was the newer Aspen at work -- a fear of alienating second-homers by acting in a way that might come off as superior or elitist.
''It's not government's role, or municipal government's role, to be talking about personal choice,'' said Torre, a City Council member, who uses only one name. Torre, a tennis instructor when not on city business, said he and one other person on the five-member Council already practice one-day-a-week vegetarianism.
''But is it appropriate to pass a resolution on behalf of Aspen?'' he said. ''That's a lengthier conversation.''

HEADLINE: Artists Whose Vitality Flows From the Streets

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Because of a long renovation of El Museo del Barrio's Fifth Avenue building, four years have passed since the museum's last ''bi-annual'' survey of new Latino, Caribbean and Latin American art. As if to make up for lost time, the new edition is the biggest so far. It includes work by 75 artists spread over seven shows in four boroughs, with the main event at El Museo itself.
The title for the whole shebang is ''El Museo's Bienal: The (S) Files 2011,'' with the S standing for ''Street,'' as in street art. It's a baggy theme, encompassing everything from graffiti to junk sculpture to painted cityscapes, and some of the work has problems with focus. Yet taking the street as a subject opens the possibility of at least thinking about other subjects, like money, and the lack of it. 
Although the market keeps crowing about how auctions and fairs are booming even in a ruinous economy, the exhibition catalog points out that the average artist is having a tough time, scrounging for the odd job, for a place to show, even for materials -- all things that the street has helped provide in hard times past. The show itself also suggests an alternative definition of ''average artist.'' Scan the resumes of participants in mainstream roundups like the Whitney Biennial or ''Greater New York,'' and you'll find lots of Ivy League M.F.A.'s and out-of-the-gate Chelsea debuts. Collectively the artists in ''The (S) Files'' tend to have somewhat different credentials in biology, sociology, mathematics and telecommunications, earned at institutions that range -- and I restrict the range to New York City -- from Columbia University to Apex Technical School.
As for prestige galleries, some are represented. But far more of the artists here show in places like Splatterpool, Helenbeck, TT-Underground, Buzzer Thirty, Monkeytown and Sacred, not to mention in hardscrabble alternative spaces like Tribes on the Lower East Side and Taller Boricua in East Harlem, a few blocks from El Museo.
In short, the ''The (S) Files'' confirms what should be obvious but rarely is in the art world: there are scads of artists out there with careers and lives that don't, whether by chance or by choice, revolve around a few square blocks of mid-Manhattan art real estate. At the same time another truth is demonstrated: In a highly competitive market that turns art schools into art mills, a lot of art, no matter where it comes from, looks like a lot of other art everywhere.
The show starts off with a pair of cityscapes that give contrasting urban views. The first is a panoramic mural -- part painting, part collage, part sculpture -- by the young Brazilian Priscila de Carvalho, of tiny figures dwarfed by towering buildings and a toxic-looking sky. The second is a set of photographs by Daniel Bejar, a Bronx native, documenting a kind of guerrilla project that had him replacing regular, multicolored New York City subway maps with new ones featuring boroughs colored entirely green to evoke the pristine forestland the city once was.
From this we move to another history, that of a specific urban art, graffiti -- or rather to recent work by three of its pioneers, all immigrants: Lady Pink (Sandra Fabara), born in Ecuador; Mosco (Alvaro Alcocer), born in Mexico; and Lee Quinones, born in Puerto Rico. (A fourth artist, Cope2, a k a Fernando Carlo Jr., born in New York City, has a piece in El Museo's cafe.) All these artists started painting in the streets as teenagers in the 1970s and '80s but have since shifted much of their activity to the studio.
Mr. Alcocer transmutes a tradition of aerosol calligraphy into fluid oil-and-acrylic abstract paintings. Mr. Quinones keeps the anti-authoritarian impulse of old-style street art alive in a figurative painting, framed as if for a baronial hall, of a wolf dressed in a red hunter's jacket and stalking the viewer through trees with dollar bills for foliage.
Ms. Fabara's ''Women Breeding Soldiers,'' with its images of embryos and falling bombs, cuts right to the political chase and is painted, at least in part, on the wall.
Some younger artists are tackling topical content in direct ways too. Geandy Pavon, who was born in Cuba, has a masterly trompe l'oeil portrait of Barack Obama in the show, or rather a painting of the president's face as if seen in a crumpled-up photograph. Last month, however, Mr. Pavon took portraiture straight out to the street when he projected an image of the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei onto the facade of the Chinese Consulate on West 42nd Street in Manhattan.
Mr. Obama appears again in a sequence of paintings by Joaquin Rodriguez del Paso, where his melting face is paired with the image of a dish of vanilla ice cream dripping with chocolate sauce. Race, as fiction and reality, is one of the show's recurrent subjects. In a photographic narrative by Rachelle Mozman, one Latin American actor -- the artist's mother -- plays the roles of aristocratic twin sisters, one light-skinned, one dark, as well as a family maid.
And in a series of silhouette self-portraits, Firelei Baez, who is Dominican by birth, simultaneously asserts and cuts through what she calls an Afro-Latina identity. Her hairstyle changes from portrait to portrait -- from curly to straightened, and so on -- but her staring eyes, her only visible facial features, remain the same in each picture.
Ethnicity as a performance is at its most theatrical in Irvin Morazan's fantastically costumed performances, in which he wears towering masklike headdresses that mix references to pre-Columbian and contemporary hip-hop cultures. In a 2009 video made in his homeland, El Salvador, Mr. Morazan wears his ''Ghetto Blaster Headdress'' as he presides, like a Mayan potentate, over a break-dancing display.
The headdress, on view in the gallery, is basically an assemblage of found odds and ends: a tape deck, feathers, tons of gold chains. And the show -- organized by Rocio Aranda-Alvarado, Trinidad Fombella and Elvis Fuentes, all curators at El Museo, and a guest curator, Juanita Bermudez -- devotes quite a bit of space to work made from recycled objects and materials, with uneven results.
Alberto Borea makes something purposeful -- a wall-size diversity rainbow -- from hundreds of plastic shopping bags.
But Abigail DeVille's grotto of amassed found paper and plastic just looks like a pileup of debris, despite a highfalutin title.
In the end the most satisfying work is the most visually unassuming: a beautiful abstract wall relief made of stretched inner tubes by Adan Vallecillo; an ingenious sound installation by Thessia Machado, with two turntables tripping off miniature percussive devices; three small object-video sculptures by Marcos Agudelo; and Jessica Kaire's stuffed-and-stitched soft-sculpture weapons: like morally slippery toys, they render aggression harmless but also make it O.K.
I like the two moody photographic self-portraits by Sol Aramendi, an artist who came to New York from Argentina several years ago and created a photographic program called Project Luz for new immigrants to the city. And I like the fact that many of the exotic props surrounding her in her pictures were borrowed from a friend, the artist Juan Betancurth, who has an installation that doubles as a performance space near the entrance to the exhibition.
Born and educated in Colombia, Mr. Betancurth describes his performances as being inspired by the lives and deaths of Roman Catholic saints; his stagelike installation, filled with mementos he associates with his mother, has the subdued air of a shrine. To some degree his work is ''Latin American'' in a way that's unfashionable in these supposedly post-identity days, when everyone is being urged to leave geography and ethnicity behind.
Some of the artists in this show simply don't do that, nor does the show itself. Is this a problem? Not at all. As long as the names that flash across the global art world radar continue to be generated by a blinkered Euro-North American art establishment, exhibitions with ethnic handles likes ''The (S) Files'' will remain a practical necessity.
So will institutions like El Museo del Barrio, which is not attached to a ''barrio'' at all, yet continues to serve an indispensable role as a showcase for Latino art in this Latino city, which otherwise finds little place for such work. (And, by the way, to get a clear sense of the intense social and psychological conflicts that still keep identity politics on the boil, you need only study this institution's fraught history.)
Of course there are other reasons for savoring El Museo and its biennial: namely visual and intellectual stimulation, which promises to be multiplied several times in the months ahead as ''The (S) Files 2011'' gradually opens at other locations: Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, Queens, on Sunday; Lehman College Art Gallery in the Bronx on Wednesday; the Times Square Alliance in Manhattan on July 14; the Northern Manhattan Cultural Alliance on Sept. 13; and the BRIC Rotunda Gallery in Brooklyn on Nov. 9.
''El Museo's Bienal: The (S) Files 2011'' continues through Jan. 8 at El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem; (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. A display sponsored by the group Chashama continues through Friday in the windows of the former Donnell Library Center, 20 West 53rd Street, Manhattan.

HEADLINE: As Demand for Power Wanes, Utilities Turn to Mergers

BYLINE: By ADAM ASTON

 BODY:
Even as the number of tablet computers, electric vehicles and Internet data centers multiply rapidly, electricity demand is barely growing. Low-power processors, smarter manufacturing plants, rooftop solar panels and other technologies are keeping a lid on electricity use.
The slowdown is spurring a fresh cycle of deal-making among publicly traded utilities. Not unlike the wave of consolidation that came after deregulation in the 1990s, major electricity players are looking to get bigger to protect their bottom lines. 
So far this year, utilities in the United States have announced mergers and acquisitions with a total value of $44 billion. That compares with $30 billion in all of 2010, according to Thomson Reuters.
If approved, Duke's Energy's $26 billion deal in January to buy Progress Energy would create the country's largest utility. The combined company would own power plants with 57 gigawatts of capacity, generate $22.7 billion in revenue and serve 7.1 million customers across six states.
The surge of deals ''marks the acceleration of a long-awaited consolidation of the U.S. electric utility industry,'' said Todd A. Shipman, credit analyst of utilities and infrastructure ratings at Standard & Poor's.
By his take, today's deal-making will pick up from the previous era of consolidation. Since deregulation, the industry has shrunk to roughly 50 publicly traded companies, from 100. That number could be halved to 25 in as little as five years, Mr. Shipman said.
While the usual financial pressures to fortify balance sheets and improve credit quality are once again pushing mergers and acquisitions, environmental dynamics are playing a bigger role than in the past. Utilities - facing pending regulation on greenhouse gas emissions and renewed enforcement of older rules on air pollution - must reckon with the rising costs of compliance.
The added expenses come just as growth in electricity demand is being crimped by efficiency gains. Electricity usage increased 0.5 percent a year on average for the decade that ended 2010, down from 2.4 percent a year during the 1990s, according to the Energy Information Administration.
The anemic figures represent the tail end of a six-decade deceleration of electricity demand. The rate peaked in the 1950s, at 9.8 percent a year, during a period of supercharged industrial growth and home construction.
Customers' plans reflect a secular shift. Nine out of 10 businesses and 70 percent of consumers have set specific goals to lower their electricity costs, according to a recent study by the Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions with the Harrison Group, a research services firm. Nearly a third of companies polled have goals to self-generate electricity, whether through solar panels, reuse of wasted heat or other methods.
Utilities are adjusting to the new reality. With customers tapering their electricity use, Consolidated Edison is deferring the installation of transformers and other costly capital equipment in New York, said Rebecca Craft, the company's director of energy efficiency and demand management. Con Ed trimmed its outlook for how much the city's appetite for power will grow in the coming decade to 1 percent a year, from 1.7 percent.
''Practically every utility today is thinking about flattened growth of demand for energy,'' said Gregory E. Aliff, a vice chairman of energy and resources at Deloitte.
''In the last wave of utility mergers, it was more offensive - companies were seeking growth,'' he said. ''Today is different: the industry is more on the defensive. Companies face a question of how to grow, and consolidation is a way to grow earnings.''
New environmental regulations are only heightening the growth challenge. The industry faces potentially sizable bills to meet a raft of air pollution rules being pushed by the White House.
Utilities with a big reliance on coal face the steepest emissions penalties. American Electric Power, which derives about 85 percent of its power from coal, recently estimated the new rules could cost $6 billion to $8 billion in coming years. The money would pay for adding filters to power plant smokestacks, closing coal-fired generators and switching to lower-emission natural gas generators.
Some merger-minded utilities are shedding assets to lower their exposure to such rules. As part of its $7.9 billion deal to buy Constellation Energy, Exelon plans to sell a batch of coal-fired plants. While coal fuels 12 percent of their current generation, the companies aim to halve that share after the merger.
A.E.P., Duke and Exelon declined to comment.
Unlike in previous periods of consolidation, regulators seem more willing to approve deals, given the sluggish economy and job market. Previously, the process could drag on for years, but recent mergers have been moving along more quickly.
This month Connecticut regulators effectively approved Northeast Utilities' tie-up with NStar, despite opposition from the state's attorney general. When the $6.9 billion deal including debt was announced last October, the companies pledged that ''no broad-based, corporatewide layoffs or early retirements are planned.''
Said Mr. Shipman of S.&P., ''In most of these deals, executives have been careful to emphasize that jobs will be spared, rather than cut.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Ready To Cut Again

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
Wall Street plans to get smaller this summer. Faced with weak markets and uncertainty over regulations, many of the biggest firms are preparing for deep cuts in jobs and other costs.
The cutback plans are emerging even as Wall Street firms have mostly recovered from the financial crisis and are reporting substantial profits again. But those profits are not as big as they were before the crisis, and it is expected that in the coming months it will be even more difficult for firms to make money. Worries about debt in Europe and the shape that the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul rules will ultimately take, combined with the usual summer doldrums, are prompting banks to act.
''It's a tense environment right now,'' said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with the investment bank Nomura.
Even Goldman Sachs, Wall Street's most profitable firm, is retrenching. Senior executives at Goldman have concluded they need to cut 10 percent, or $1 billion, of noncompensation expenses over the next 12 months, according to a person close to the matter who was not authorized to speak on the record. The big pullback will cause Goldman employees, who have already been ordered to cut costs, to re-examine every aspect of their business. 
The firm, this person said, had not set final targets for layoffs, but Goldman was ''certain'' to shrink headcount in the coming months. Decisions on bonuses are still months away, but they are sure to come down as well if business does not pick up.
Bank of America is also examining its expenses and is likely in the next few months to cut some staff members from its securities division, according to one senior executive at that firm who was not authorized to speak on the record. And Credit Suisse is in the process of identifying people to cut in its investment banking unit, according to a person briefed on that bank's plans.
Morgan Stanley is expected to cut at least 300 low-producing brokers in its wealth management division this year, more than the firm initially expected, and has announced plans to cut $1 billion in noncompensation expenses over the next three years. Unlike many of its rivals, however, the firm so far has no plans to cut staff members from its investment banking and trading division, which has added hundreds of employees over the last two years or so as part of a rebuilding effort after the financial crisis.
Some firms have already wielded the ax. In January, Barclays Capital cut 600 people, or more than 2 percent of its worldwide staff, citing a business slowdown, and recently cut more employees for ''performance-related reasons,'' according to a person briefed on the cuts but not authorized to speak on the record. A third of the January cuts were in New York.
Regulatory overhaul has weighed on the decisions to cut back, senior bank executives say. Regulation has caused some Wall Street banks to exit some businesses, like proprietary trading. Rules that require banks to hold more capital will probably cause some firms to end certain business lines as they decide they can more effectively deploy the capital elsewhere. On products like derivatives, firms will lose revenue as instruments once traded off exchanges will move into open markets.
While many financial rules are still to be written, some firms have decided that they cannot afford to wait any longer. The last significant industrywide job cuts were in early 2009. In the first quarter of that year Goldman alone cut its work force by almost 9 percent. Since then, most firms have held steady on their head counts or have added to them slightly. That will change this summer.
The scale of the expected cuts is bad news for the New York City economy, which depends heavily on a booming financial industry to pay taxes and fill its restaurants. And they will come as the national economy is still struggling to find its footing since the financial crisis.
Not all is doom and gloom. Wall Street is benefiting from the boom in social media and technology public offerings. In recent weeks big names like Pandora Media and Linkedin have gone public, brought to market by banks. So far this year, companies have raised $29.3 billion in public offerings, up more than 200 percent from a year ago. This year is on track to be the most lucrative since the technology boom in 2000, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The profit picture is also somewhat more stable for diversified companies like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, which have large commercial retail banking operations in addition to those in trading and sales. JPMorgan has no immediate plans to cut head count in trading, according to a person briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record. The bank is, however, trying to reduce noncompensation expenses.
But firms like Bank of America are still paying for mortgage sins of days gone by, which have dimmed their profit pictures. Earlier this year Bank of America put aside another $1 billion to cover claims from outside investors who lost money and want the firm to buy back billions of dollars in bad Countrywide Financial mortgages. The Durbin Amendment, a proposed restriction on debit card fees, is also expected to reduce profits when it comes into effect next month.
For those firms that depend on trading, it is clear how much the engines of Wall Street have slowed. Return on equity, the amount a firm earns on its common stock outstanding and an important measure of financial performance, has decreased significantly in the years since the credit crisis. Industrywide return on equity was 8.2 percent in 2010, down from 17.5 percent in 2005, according to Nomura.
And this year there is another reason that is prompting Wall Street to act more swiftly on cuts. Wall Street typically pays out roughly half of its revenue in compensation, and firms often wait until late summer to cull staff when they have a better sense of revenue for the year. The newest cuts are expected to come earlier this year because of recent changes in the way employees are paid.
Traditionally, Wall Street employees get most of their annual pay in the form of a one-time year-end bonus. But after the credit crisis most firms changed the way they compensated employees in an effort to discourage excessive risk-taking, increasing base salaries while reducing performance-related payments. As a result, banks are paying out more compensation as the year goes on, forcing firms to re-evaluate staffing levels earlier in the year because more of their compensation costs are now fixed.
Firms are also trying to cut noncompensation expenses and are looking for ways to cut fat. Goldman's goal to cut $1 billion in noncompensation expenses this year is significant, analysts say. There will be immediate and significant savings from the fall off in trading volumes.
Trading firms pay fees to trade, and lower volumes could result in an annual savings of $200 million at Goldman alone, one analyst estimated. Those savings will come naturally, but most will not, and banks will be forced to rein in everything, including travel and professional fees.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Capital One Agrees to Buy ING's Online Banking Unit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
9:54 p.m. Updated
Capital One Financial agreed on Thursday to buy the ING Group's online banking unit in the United States for $9 billion in cash and stock, one of its biggest efforts yet to add to offerings beyond credit cards and other consumer lending. 
Under the terms of the deal, Capital One will pay $6.2 billion in cash and issue $2.8 billion worth of new shares to ING, giving it a 9.9 percent stake. ING will also have the right to name a director on Capital One's board.
Long known for cheeky credit card ads asking customers ''What's in your wallet?'' Capital One is seeking to build up a national banking franchise. Buying ING Direct USA, one of the best-known online banks in the country, will help give Capital One a broader platform and a huge source of lower-cost funds.
Currently the eighth-biggest bank in the country by deposits, Capital One will rise to the fifth-biggest through the deal.
''The acquisition of ING Direct is a game-changing transaction that delivers attractive deal economics immediately and compelling long-term strategic value,'' Richard D. Fairbank, Capital One's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
ING was reluctant to shed its online banking business, one of its crown jewels and a leader in the expanding direct banking industry. But it was forced to sell off the unit by the European Commission as part of the bank's 10 billion euro bailout in 2008.
''Although I regret that ING Direct USA will no longer be a part of ING, I am very pleased that we have found in Capital One a good home for our customers and employees, who are very important to the continued success of the ING Direct USA Business,'' Jan H. M. Hommen, ING's chief executive, said in a statement.
Capital One emerged the winner of a relatively crowded auction, one that also included General Electric's GE Capital and the CIT Group, according to people briefed on the matter. One of the reasons Capital One prevailed was its willingness to shoulder more than $60 billion worth of mortgages and mortgage-linked securities.
In order to help pay for the transaction, Capital One said it planned to raise about $2 billion from a sale of new shares and $3.7 billion from selling new debt.
But the bank insists that the deal will pay for itself quickly. Capital One expects to reap $90 million in savings from combining back-end systems and staff, as well as $200 million from lowering funding costs. The transaction will also add to Capital One's earnings per share beginning next year.
Shares in Capital One began rising on Thursday afternoon after Dow Jones reported news of the impending deal, closing up $1.13, or 2.4 percent, at $49.
The deal is expected to close by the end of the year or early next year, pending regulatory approval.
Capital One was advised by Morgan Stanley, Barclays Capital, Centerview Partners and the law firms Mayer Brown, Loyens & Loeff and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. ING Direct was advised by Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase.

HEADLINE: Spain Looks Into Taxes Of a Banker

BYLINE: By RAPHAEL MINDER. 
Floyd Norris, whose High & Low Finance column normally appears on this page, is off.

 BODY:
MADRID -- Spain's already fragile banking sector was shocked Thursday by the news that Emilio Botin, the country's most influential banker and chairman of Banco Santander, and 11 of his relatives were the subjects of an investigation into tax evasion stretching back to accounts that ostensibly were opened during the dark days of the Spanish Civil War.
The national court in Madrid said it had agreed to hear an investigation by antifraud prosecutors from the Spanish tax agency into past income tax returns filed by Mr. Botin and his relatives. 
The tax agency said the inquiry dated to May of last year, when Spain received a list of undeclared Swiss bank accounts, which was initially handed over to France by a former information technology specialist at HSBC.
Jesus Remon, a lawyer for the Botin family, said Thursday that the Botins expected the court to resolve the case ''quickly and satisfactorily'' because ''the family has voluntarily and completely normalized its tax situation and is compliant with all its tax obligations.''
A person with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the family had paid about 200 million euros, or $283 million, in back taxes over the last year.
Mr. Botin has been a dominant figure on the Spanish corporate scene for 25 years. He has transformed his bank into one of Europe's largest, with significant investments in Brazil, Britain and the United States, where Santander owns Sovereign Bank.
The investigation comes at a particularly difficult time for Spanish banks, as they struggle with record borrowing costs and loan defaults after the collapse of the country's real estate sector.
Spain has been part of a group of euro zone countries with troubled economies that has been in investors' line of fire for more than a year. The yield differential, or spread, between Spanish and German government bonds climbed back to its highest in a decade on Thursday, a sign of investor nervousness about the implications for Spain of a possible financial and political collapse in Greece.
Because of its formidable assets outside Spain, particularly in the booming Brazilian market, Santander has weathered the financial crisis better than many of its Spanish counterparts.
The court announcement preceded a shareholders meeting on Friday in Santander, the northern Spanish city where the bank originated.
The tax agency emphasized that it had pursued court action because a statute of limitations will expire on June 30, jeopardizing its ability to examine some of the oldest tax data.
Among the family members being investigated are Mr. Botin's daughter, Ana Patricia Botin, who is in charge of Santander's British business, and Mr. Botin's brother Jaime, a major shareholder in Bankinter, another leading Spanish institution.
Bankers in Spain did not want to comment for the record on an issue under judicial investigation, but many expressed astonishment about accusations that Mr. Botin was linked to the undeclared Swiss accounts in the HSBC file. Mr. Botin's stature in Spain is such that his rare pronouncements on the Spanish economy can eclipse those of politicians in the national media.
The case dominated the conversation Thursday at an industry gathering in Madrid at which a prize was being awarded to Francisco Gonzalez, the chairman of BBVA, Santander's main Spanish rival.
The person familiar with the Botin situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the family's dealings with HSBC dated to 1937, when Mr. Botin's father, Emilio, opened an account in Switzerland after the start of the Spanish Civil War when he left Spain for London. The elder Mr. Botin died in 1993; according to this person, his son and other heirs were told only last year by the Spanish authorities of the money kept in Switzerland.
The HSBC list included 569 Spanish clients. Its disclosure allowed Spain to recoup about 300 million euros, or $426 million, in previously undeclared tax revenue last year, according to the head of the tax agency, Juan Manuel Lopez Carbajo. That amount is expected to increase this year because of outstanding cases involving some of the largest Spanish holders of secret accounts at the Swiss private banking subsidiary of HSBC.
Leadership problems at Santander surfaced this year after a court ruled against Alfredo Saenz, the chief executive of Santander and Mr. Botin's second in command, for making false claims in the 1990s against debtors to Banesto, a troubled bank that was eventually taken over by Santander. The ruling also prohibited Mr. Saenz from banking for three months, but he has remained in the job pending the outcome of an appeal.
Mr. Botin, 76, has been chairman of Santander since 1986 but has shown little inclination toward finding a successor. ''See you at the next acquisition,'' is how he famously ended a presentation to analysts in London after buying Abbey National, a leading British mortgage lender, in 2004.
Since then, he has actually accelerated Santander's expansion during the financial crisis to take advantage of falling valuations and help offset a weakening domestic market. Recent acquisitions have expanded Santander's presence in markets like Mexico, Germany and Poland.
Mr. Botin is not the first prominent corporate leader to be a target of Spanish antifraud prosecutors. Two years ago, Cesar Alierta, the chairman of Telefonica, was cleared after a lengthy investigation into accusations of insider trading. A court rejected the charges because it judged that too much time had elapsed between the suspected crime and the start of court proceedings.

HEADLINE: So, Whom Do YOU Like for President? Madison, Alabama

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
After the chicken salad sandwiches were handed out and people had their fill of A.B.O. (Anybody but Obama) jokes, the Republican Women of Madison got down to business.
''It's absolutely the most important election we've ever faced, from top to bottom,'' said Janet Donoghue, 74, a nurse and health educator who identifies herself as a conservative Republican.
Every third Wednesday, Mrs. Donoghue joins a few dozen other women for the group's monthly meeting. Newly minted Tea Party members sit next to veterans of regional and national political conventions. And they agree on the issues one might imagine. The state's teachers' union must be stopped. So should same-sex marriage. Government needs to be more transparent. 
They cheer the fact that for the first time since Reconstruction, Republicans last fall took control of the Alabama Legislature. Every major office, save one seat in Congress, is now Republican.
But when it comes to who should next run the country, there was no consensus among the women in the Holiday Inn banquet room.
For Denise Book, 53, a self-identified right-wing conservative, Herman Cain is the best man for the job.
''He's upfront, he's honest and he's clean,'' she said. By which, Mrs. Book explained, he has no skeletons in his closet -- as opposed to, say, Newt Gingrich.
''I'm sorry,'' she said, ''but a lot of women aren't going to vote for him because he's cheated on spouse after spouse after spouse.''
Mitt Romney had some support, but it was not overwhelming. He's a good businessman, sure. And he has experience. But some did not like his position that people might have something to do with climate change. Others were not happy with what they said was a failed health care plan in Massachusetts.
And everyone seemed to think he had a certain preprogrammed stiffness to him and the whiff of ordination from top Republican leaders.
''John McCain was the consensus, kind of like Bob Dole,'' said Liz Cureo, 58. ''And look where that got us.''
Ms. Cureo is known as something of a supervolunteer around Madison. She likes Michele Bachmann, a member of Congress from Minnesota with deep Tea Party support.
''She's got more experience than Obama has,'' she said. ''Has Obama had 23 foster children?''
Others imagined a Romney-Bachmann ticket, and wanted to know more about Tim Pawlenty. Is he conservative enough? Does he have enough international experience?
They ticked through other names. Former Senator Rick Santorum? Like him, but perhaps not broad enough in his appeal. Ron Paul? Shouldn't even be running. On the other hand, Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, absolutely should.
And what of Sarah Palin? Few seemed to think she would really run, but someone suggested she would be the perfect secretary of the interior.
The Republican Women of Madison did agree, however, on the core issues: the economy and the deficit.
Madison County, home to about 330,000 people near the Tennessee border, has three women Republican clubs. (There was a turf war. They don't like to talk much about it.)
It's a place where cotton farms share a road with the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, home of the most advanced genomics-based research in the world.
So the analysis here was smart and blunt. The next president needs to offer the nation some tough love about government spending before it is too late. That, in turn, will create a robust economy.
''You can't say it is just the wars or just the economy or just the debt,'' said Alicia Liburdi, 53, who offers ''give me Liburdi or give me death'' as a pronunciation guide. ''You have to start with what the federal government is supposed to do and cut out everything else.''
But it was way too early, the women agreed, to know which candidate might be the one to do that.
''It's like taking a turkey out of the oven too soon,'' Mrs. Liburdi said. ''Who wants to eat raw turkey? KIM SEVERSON

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Seek Assurances on Bank Regulations

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Financial regulators sought to reassure lawmakers that they could coordinate with global officials and still maintain industry competitiveness as they rewrote Wall Street oversight rules.
Harmonization has been a top consideration in international talks related to how much capital the biggest banks must maintain and methods for orderly wind-downs of large firms, several officials told the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday at a hearing in Washington.
Representative Spencer Bachus, the Alabama Republican who leads the Financial Services Committee, conducted the hearing amid complaints from bankers that American regulations being imposed under the Dodd-Frank act might slow economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and drive business overseas. Lawmakers sought assurances that regulators were looking out for United States interests in dealing with their international counterparts. 
''Dodd-Frank was not passed in the E.U., and it was not passed in the G-20, so our regulators must take great care,'' Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who serves as financial services vice chairman, said referring to the European Union and the Group of 20 nations.
The six regulators who appeared before the panel agreed that they planned to ensure a level playing field in rules, including those for the $601 trillion global swaps market.
''The best national regime in the world is not going to be adequate if other countries do not adopt robust resolution tool kits and complementary authorities,'' said Lael Brainard, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs.
She was joined at the hearing by Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve governor; Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; Mary L. Schapiro, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and John Walsh, acting comptroller of the currency.
The international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision agreed last year to raise the minimum common equity requirement for banks to 4.5 percent from 2 percent, with an added buffer of 2.5 percent, for a total of 7 percent of assets weighted for risk.
The Basel members are also proposing that so-called global systemically important financial institutions hold additional capital.
''What is important is not to lose sight of the costs of not acting,'' Mr. Tarullo said at the hearing. The surcharge based on some studies may be as high as seven percentage points above the Basel requirement, he said, adding that the final figure, now under consideration by regulators, may not reach that level.
American regulators have yet to align themselves on the issue, with Ms. Bair pushing higher capital levels for the largest banks and Mr. Walsh, who oversees national banks, urging caution as talks over rules continue.
''I'm concerned with how much further we can turn up the dial without negative effects on lending capacity,'' Mr. Walsh told lawmakers. ''A very real risk is that lending will fall, will become more expensive and will again move from the regulated banking sector into the less-regulated shadow banking sector.''
The committee also heard testimony from a second panel including executives at JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley as well as an associate general counsel at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
The banking officials argued that certain derivative rules will push business outside of the United States.
Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the Financial Services panel, told regulators they should not let concerns over bank profits affect their decisions.
''They are the means to a sound financial system, they are not the end,'' said Mr. Frank, who co-sponsored the financial regulation law that bears his name. ''Their profitability in and of itself is not important to anyone other than themselves.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Scowl At Romney Joke

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. - Mitt Romney sat at the head of the table at a coffee shop here on Thursday, listening to a group of unemployed Floridians explain the challenges of looking for work. When they finished, he weighed in with a predicament of his own.
''I should tell my story,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I'm also unemployed.'' 
He chuckled. The eight people gathered around him, who had just finished talking about strategies of finding employment in a slow-to-recover economy, joined him in laughter.
''Are you on LinkedIn?'' one of the men asked.
''I'm networking,'' Mr. Romney replied. ''I have my sight on a particular job.''
The morning coffee hour at Buddy Brew Coffee here on West Kennedy Boulevard was interrupted by a conversation about small businesses and job creation as Mr. Romney finished a three-day swing through Florida. While his visit was largely focused on fund-raising, he spent more than an hour promoting his pitch that he would be a stronger steward of the economy than President Obama.
But any of the bravado that accompanied him in the wake of his first presidential debate on Monday in New Hampshire - he vowed to return to the state in four years, accompanied by a Secret Service detail - was absent. He took a humble, self-deprecating approach.
''I wish I had a job for everybody,'' Mr. Romney said at the end of his discussion. He added, ''I may be unemployed for longer than I'd like.''
The references to Mr. Romney's own unemployment status added yet another humorous, but occasionally awkward, moment to his ever-growing catalog of off-the-cuff remarks that he makes as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination. He spent the morning doing more listening than talking - a woman in the crowd openly urged him to talk about the deficit - and it was unclear whether he persuaded any voters to join his effort.
Tom Yarranton, 55, lost his job in March 2010. He had spent 31 years as an internal auditor at a manufacturing company. He said he liked Mr. Romney's mind-set as a businessman, but added that he did not blame Mr. Obama for still being unemployed.
''I'm not mad at him,'' Mr. Yarranton said in an interview after the session ended. ''It's amazing in politics. They're all into pointing fingers at each other. The Republicans right now are so mad at the Democrats, but nobody is doing anything.''
The sentiment illustrated the long-term challenge for Mr. Romney and other Republican candidates as they try to win over independent voters - and, perhaps, even some conservative Democrats - to accomplish their ultimately goal on Election Day in November 2012.
In the conversation with voters, Mr. Romney modulated his criticism of the president, saying, ''I won't be too partisan here.'' A few moments later, as he stood before television cameras, he ratcheted up his disapproval.
''We have all been distressed by the policies that this administration has put in place over the last two years,'' Mr. Romney said. ''We have seen the most anti-investment, antigrowth, antijob strategy in America since Jimmy Carter. The result has been it's harder and harder for people to find work.''
Joan Savage, who described herself as a die-hard Republican, said she was uncertain whether her party could win back the White House. She said that she walked away with a favorable impression of Mr. Romney, but added, ''I don't know that anyone can beat Obama right now.''
The path to that fight will begin here in Tampa, where Republicans will hold their national convention next summer and formally crown their nominee to challenge Mr. Obama.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: So, Whom Do YOU Like for President? Chicago, Illinois

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
About a mile from President Obama's 2012 re-election headquarters, a crowd of young Republicans was swelling at an Irish bar. If Republicans in Democrat-ruled cities like Chicago sometimes sound lonely and gloomy, particularly with a hometown Democrat in the White House, they were anything but that now.
Mr. Obama's chances of re-election? To hear people in this corner of the bar tell it, so long as a Republican -- any Republican -- keeps his (or her) eyes trained squarely on the economy, the miserable unemployment rate and Washington's ''spending madness,'' this should be a Republican cakewalk. Simple as that. 
''The economy is the issue, and I don't see things turning around in time to change that,'' Meredyth Richards, 24, the president of the Chicago Young Republicans, said cheerily, as a Katy Perry tune blared from nearby speakers. ''I believe Illinois could even be a battleground.''
The notion that Illinois, where Mr. Obama got more than 61 percent of the vote in 2008, might actually be a state the presidential candidates fight over in 2012 sounded a tad hopeful even to some of Ms. Richards's fellow Young Republicans. But a broader sense of optimism about 2012, nonetheless, was clearly flowing here, along with the Blue Moon drafts.
Still, for a group that seemed generally pleased with the candidates and with the performances during this week's debate, these Republicans could not be less unified on a candidate. Nursing their beers, some offered private explanations for their strong -- but widely varying -- leanings.
John Giokaris, 26, said he was a ''loud and proud'' supporter of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. ''What this country really needs right now is a turnaround specialist,'' Mr. Giokaris said.
Shalesh Kumbhat, 39, said he favored Tim Pawlenty for his economic program and record as governor of Minnesota.
And David Ratowitz, 41, who ran a failed bid for Congress here last fall, argued that Ron Paul, the congressman from Texas, is ''the only one who is actually talking sense,'' adding, ''and he's been saying the same thing for like 40 years so no one can say he waffles.''
If even such a conversation seemed unlikely in Mr. Obama's backyard, consider this: In early 2008, the Chicago Young Republicans numbered fewer than 100 members. But the group -- which has in the past used the slogan ''It's not easy being right in Chicago'' -- has blossomed to more than 1,000. ''Thank you, President Obama!'' Ms. Richards said.
Many here offered grim views of Mr. Obama's record, accusing him of ''flip-flopping,'' and implementing a ''failed stimulus plan.'' And, from a state where some of the most successful Republican candidates have been fiscal conservatives and social moderates, some had a plea for the Republicans: do not fixate on divisive social issues, but talk about what real people worry about -- the economy.
Much of the conversation at these monthly happy hours aimed at people 18 to 40 years old is not about politics. It is ordinary bar talk, including a smidgen of flirting (many couples boast that they met here).
For those who prefer a quieter scene, the group holds a monthly book club, which is currently reading ''The Flipside of Feminism,'' by Suzanne Venker and Phyllis Schlafly. MONICA DAVEY

HEADLINE: Americans Support Offshore Drilling, But Washington Wavers

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
THE last year and a half has brought a rapid sequence of reversals in the Obama administration's policy toward oil and gas exploration on public lands and in United States waters.
Since the beginning of 2010, Washington has caromed from a restrictive approach to drilling to a permissive policy closely mirroring that of the Bush administration to a near-total shutdown of offshore drilling after the Deepwater Horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. After that fatal accident, the administration decreed a deepwater drilling moratorium, lifted it six months later, then took five more months before beginning to issue drilling permits.
Throughout that time, the American public's attitudes toward domestic oil and gas development have been remarkably consistent: Americans are in favor of it, though Democrats and those on the coasts are much less likely than Republicans and those in the South and Southwest to be supportive. 
National support for offshore drilling and for domestic oil and gas development generally dipped for a time after the BP disaster -- from a strong majority to a bare majority -- but quickly rebounded.
A Gallup poll taken immediately after the gulf spill showed that 50 percent of Americans supported offshore drilling while 46 percent opposed it. By March of this year, public support had risen to 60 percent versus 37 percent.
The administration's offshore drilling policy, like its fervor for domestic production more generally, has gone through rapid changes. In March 2010, President Obama announced that the United States would make vast tracts of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic and Arctic oceans available for leasing by oil and gas companies. After the BP spill began on April 20, 2010, he declared those areas off-limits for at least five years. Then, last month, the president announced that he would permit accelerated development in Alaska, the gulf and along parts of the Atlantic coast.
Administration officials defend the policy changes as reasonable responses to changed circumstances.
Mr. Obama came to office as a proponent of increased domestic oil and gas development, as part of a broader strategy to reduce oil imports. Accordingly, they said, he took steps to accelerate development. He then imposed a sharp cutback after the BP disaster to give regulators and oil companies time to put new safeguards in place.
After the president was satisfied that drilling could resume safely, and in response to public anxiety about high fuel costs, he shifted back to a more pro-development stance, the aides said.
''These spikes in gas prices are often temporary,'' Mr. Obama said on May 14 in a radio and Internet address, ''and while there are no quick fixes to the problem, there are a few steps we should take that make good sense.''
The public's support for offshore drilling has tracked changes in the price of gasoline. When gas prices were near record highs in the summer of 2008 and again this spring, support for domestic drilling was highest.
Conversely, unease about the effects of offshore drilling peaked after the BP accident, which killed 11 rig workers and spewed nearly five million barrels of crude into the gulf.
''News of that incident has faded, possibly lessening Americans' resistance to coastal area drilling,'' Gallup said when releasing its poll in March that showed 60 percent of Americans supportive.
The poll found that 49 percent of Americans favor opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration, a step the Obama administration strongly opposes. That is the highest level of support for drilling in the Arctic refuge since Gallup first asked the question in 2002.
The nationwide poll of 1,021 adults was conducted by telephone in early March.
''Timing is everything,'' said Jack N. Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's most prominent lobbying group in Washington. ''As the price of gasoline has increased, public attention has turned once again to the question of energy. When they hear their elected officials continue to resist development of American resources, they are appalled.''
The Gallup survey found that men are more likely than women to support drilling offshore and in Alaska and support is much higher among Republicans than Democrats. It also found regional variations, with the strongest backing for aggressive oil exploration in the South and the most significant opposition along the East and West Coasts.
And while the public appears to support exploiting domestic oil and gas resources, there is also skepticism about the economic and environmental costs of America's continued reliance on oil. A New York Times/CBS News poll taken in March asked how important it was for the United States to develop an alternative to oil as a major source of energy. Fully 94 percent of respondents said it was very or somewhat important to do so.
The Times/CBS News poll was conducted by telephone with 1,266 adults nationwide.
Daniel J. Weiss, a senior fellow in Washington at the Center for American Progress, said that while the public tends to support more domestic oil and gas drilling, they see it as only one egg in a basket of policies to lower energy costs, reduce dependence on foreign oil and clean up the environment.
''Americans generally support an all-of-the-above strategy,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''They say, 'Let's have more offshore drilling, but also higher mileage standards for our cars and trucks. Let's crack down on the speculators and invest in electric cars, natural gas trucks and biofuels.' ''
Mr. Gerard said that Mr. Obama's sporadic and reluctant support for increased domestic production was largely politically driven and not part of a comprehensive energy strategy. But he praised the president for at least appearing responsive to public opinion in calling for more American oil and gas.
''Until the economy gets back on track, until the unemployment rate comes down, and with the price of energy high, I think you'll see the president focus more and more on the supply side,'' he said. ''And as pressure continues to mount as we get closer to Election Day, I think you'll see more of that.''

HEADLINE: Stars of Venice Shine in Basel

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
BASEL, Switzerland -- The German artist Hans-Peter Feldmann said that the sheer size of his $100,000 Hugo Boss Prize inspired him to paper a gallery at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York last month with 100,000 $1 bills.
Were Mr. Feldmann at Art Basel this week, $100,000 might not have seemed like so much after all. Examples of his work are in many booths at this granddaddy of contemporary art fairs, some priced around $50,000. And if business is as brisk as people say it is, by the time Art Basel ends on Sunday, Mr. Feldmann may have made another $100,000, and probably more.
Mr. Feldmann, 70, is one of many artists of the moment whose work can be spotted at this commercial crowd pleaser of an event. 
As boisterous as ever, this year's Art Basel consists of more than 300 galleries from 35 countries showing an estimated $1.75 billion worth of art. Its magnitude attracts many of the world's most important collectors. Spotted on Tuesday, when the fair opened to art-world V.I.P.'s, were megacollectors like the hedge-fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen, the Los Angeles financier Eli Broad and the New York financier Stephen A. Schwarzman. The actor Will Ferrell was here too, as was the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami and the fashion models Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Stephanie Seymour.
The acres of booths are filled with works by artists whose markets are well proven, while examples of emerging talents are few.
''Collectors do want tried-and-tested artists,'' said Gordon Veneklasen, a partner at the Michael Werner Gallery who runs spaces in New York and Markisch Wilmersdorf, Germany.
The mood is upbeat. Although a true measure of business is difficult to gauge, many say it is far stronger than during the slump of 2008-9, but still not nearly as frenetic as in 2007, when the market for contemporary art was at its peak.
''People are really looking at things and asking the right questions,'' said Brian T. Washburn, a New York dealer. ''They're not simply buying.''
Larry Gagosian, the superdealer who is showing a large selection of the artists he represents, said he thought ''business is better than last year because the economy is stronger.''
Before the end of Tuesday's preview the Gagosian Gallery had sold several multimillion-dollar works by artists including Picasso, Jeff Koons and Maurizio Cattelan.
Art Basel's opening less than two weeks after the preview days for the Venice Biennale has meant that dealers purposely brought examples of work by artists who were stars there. Mr. Veneklasen, for instance, was showing work by Enrico David, 44, an Italian who lives in Berlin and who currently has an exhibition at the Fondazione Bevilacqua La Masa in Venice. Within hours of Art Basel's opening Mr. Veneklasen had sold ''Study for a Body as a Dog's Training Camp,'' a large sculpture made this year. It is fashioned from black automotive rubber and depicts a man encircled in chains. The buyer was an Italian collector who had seen Mr. David's show in Venice. The price: around $100,000.
The Paula Cooper Gallery from New York had a similar experience. Ms. Cooper represents Christian Marclay, whose film ''The Clock,'' a 24-hour montage of clips from movies and television that depict particular minutes in the day, synchronized with the moment they are shown, was a huge hit at the Biennale, winning Mr. Marclay the best-artist prize there. His 1990 work ''White Album (Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do),'' made from Beatles' album covers, sold for about $30,000 on Tuesday to a New York collector.
No surprise that work by Allora & Calzadilla, the Puerto Rico-based artists representing the United States at the Biennale this year, could be spotted here in several places. Gladstone Gallery of New York is showing ''Lifesaver Manhole'' (2011), a sculpture of a bright-orange life preserver from which hangs a black manhole cover. Ms. Gladstone said it sold to an Australian collector on Tuesday for $110,000.
Urs Fischer, the Swiss artist whose monumental functioning candle in the full-scale form of Giovanni Bologna's 16th-century sculpture ''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' is getting a lot of attention in Venice, had work on view here too. Sadie Coles, the London dealer, is showing ''Pineapple/Melon,'' from 2010, which consists of four mirror-polished stainless-steel cubes -- two with blown-up silk-screened images of sponges and two with what looks like giant images of 18th-century carved-wood dining-room chairs. The set of four is $600,000, and it too sold on Tuesday. ''I sent collectors JPEGs, and several things sold before the fair even opened,'' Ms. Coles said.
While young talent is scarce this year, one artist receiving lots of attention is 26-year-old Jacob Kassay, whose eight hypnotic, all-silver abstract paintings hang in a room by themselves at ''Unlimited,'' the section of the fair devoted to oversize work. Several art advisers who had interested clients were grumbling that Mr. Kassay's dealers -- Art: Concept Gallery of Paris and Xavier Hufkens of Brussels -- would sell the group only to a museum. They want $350,000 for the installation.
Warhol's magic never wanes, no matter the economy. One of the most inventive booths is that of Thomas Ammann Fine Art of Zurich. All lined in silver (even the chairs are wrapped in foil), it is a takeoff of Warhol's Factory. On view are three Warhol self-portraits, as well as a dramatic installation of 13 of his 1964 printed cartons of Campbell's tomato juice, some belonging to Jose Mugrabi, the Manhattan dealer. Priced at $1.1 million each, three had sold by Wednesday.
Another Zurich gallery, Bruno Bischofberger, features Warhol's ''Onehundredandfifty Black/White/Grey Marilyns,'' a 33-foot-long painting from 1980, priced at $80 million. (On Tuesday gallery officials said a collector had reserved the painting, but on Wednesday Mr. Bischofberger said it had not sold.)
Other blue-chip names in demand included Brice Marden, whose suite of drawings from the early 1980s at Matthew Marks Gallery went to a New York collector for around $1 million; and Glenn Ligon, whose midcareer retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art ended this month. Mr. Ligon's New York dealer, Luhring Augustine, sold ''Masquerade #1,'' a 2006 black-and-white canvas with coal dust on its surface, to a British collector for $225,000.
Even the die-hards have found that this vast fair takes stamina. Spotted sitting on one of the long green benches on Tuesday afternoon were the Miami collectors Don and Mera Rubell, looking a bit weary. A couple known as gifted talent spotters, they said they especially liked the work of Mr. Feldmann, in particular his ''Stamps With Paintings,'' tiny pictures of art-historical nudes on a set of 180 stamps from post offices around the world. They liked it so much they bought it.

HEADLINE: Higher Prices Help Smithfield Post Record Profit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Smithfield Foods posted record profits for its fiscal fourth quarter on Thursday as the company, the world's largest hog producer, was able to raise prices.
The company also announced a $150 million stock buyback, and its shares jumped more than 6 percent. 
Smithfield had struggled during the recession as consumers cut back on spending in restaurants and on more expensive ham in favor of cheaper foods. With demand returning, however, Smithfield said it had been able to pass on the higher costs it had been paying for corn and soybeans to feed its hogs.
''The fundamentals are very strong for the industry,'' C. Larry Pope, Smithfield's chief executive, told analysts during a conference call. ''No one wants to push through price increases, but it's a reality of life.''
Smithfield reported net income of $98.4 million, or 59 cents a share, for the three months ended May 1. That compared with a net loss of $4.6 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding a charge tied to early debt retirement, adjusted earnings were 85 cents a share, beating the average forecast of 82 cents, according to analysts polled by FactSet.
While hog and pork prices have rebounded, industry analysts were unconvinced that consumers had overcome their economic jitters, and warned that a slowing economy would leave Smithfield with high feed prices but a diminished ability to cover those costs.
Akshay Jagdale, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, noted that hog prices had already fallen from their peak levels in May. With prices likely to be lower into 2012, Smithfield's long-term profits could become crimped, Mr. Jagdale said.
Mr. Pope told analysts that export markets might be able to pick up any slack caused by a slowdown in the economy. With China looking to control food costs however it can, pork imports from the United States might be starting to look more attractive, he said.
Smithfield said revenue increased 7 percent, to $3.12 billion, in its fourth quarter, just shy of Wall Street's estimate of $3.19 billion. The improvement over last year's sales was driven by sales of fresh pork and packaged meats, which both improved during the quarter. Lower United States hog inventories also led to a 19 percent increase in live hog prices.
The company, based in the Smithfield, Va., reported net income of $521 million, or $3.12 a share, for the full year. It lost $101.4 million, or 65 cents a share, the previous year.
Revenue climbed 9 percent, to $12.2 billion. The company said its strongest sellers included Armour LunchMakers, Curly's barbecue and Kretschmar Deli.
Smithfield shares rose $1.31, or 6.4 percent, to close at $21.70.

HEADLINE: Fathers More Active, and More Absent

BYLINE: LISA BELKIN


HIGHLIGHT: It's the time of year when everyone seems to be taking the measure of Dad. Are they more likely to be involved? Or more likely to be absent?

 BODY:
It's the time of year when everyone seems to be taking the measure of Dad.
From Cozi, the online calendar and organization service, we learn that men are busy (and, 'natch, in need of online calendars):54 percent of dads said the biggest changes they observed involved shifts in parents' roles: More moms are working, and parents are splitting household tasks more evenly, so dads are more involved in their children's lives.
22 percent of dads said one of the biggest changes in this generation is that families are busier than before.25 percent say they are the main organizers in their families, and 85 percent said they are somewhat or very involved in managing the family's schedule.The Goddard School for Early Childhood Development, meanwhile, surveyed 1,000 fathers and found that dads are more involved in making decisions in their children's lives -- particularly when it comes to, wait for it ... childcare and preschool.
No, that was not first on the list of things fathers said were important to their children's welfare. It was fourth out of 10, after "basic needs (food, clothing, shelter)," "a safe home environment," and "financial support." The survey found that three-quarters of fathers visit preschools before enrolling their child, a sign, the researchers conclude, of a growing commitment.
Yahoo has been studying Dad, too, and has found that:51 percent of dads are responsible for grocery shopping41 percent do the laundry46 percent feel their families are doing better (financially) than last year, compared with 30 percent of men with no kidsAnd Workplace Options, a North Carolina-based provider of work-life programs and employee benefits, finds that Dad is under a lot of pressure, what with all that preschool shopping and laundry sorting. A company-sponsored poll of 459 respondents found:68 percent have clashed with their employer due to work/life conflicts48 percent say they spend only six hours a day or less with their kids (compared with the 31 percent of mothers who said the same)56 percent of fathers report taking time off from work to deal with family illness and issues (compared with 40 percent of mothers, a number that just doesn't ring true to me)39 percent said work demands mean they are not there as often as they should be70 percent of employed fathers considered their current employer to be understanding of their family responsibilities, but 43 percent also said that "more tools, programs or assistance to help them balance their roles at work with those at home" -- exactly the sort of product that Workplace Options sells -- would be helpful.There is also data from groups not trying to sell something, and the results seem, at first, very similar to the commercially sponsored surveys.
Boston College's Center for Work and Family, for instance, has just released a report titled "The New Dad: Caring, Committed and Conflicted," which polls a national sample of nearly 1,000 professional fathers from Fortune 500 companies in four different industries.
"Today's dads associate being a good father just as much with the role of effective caregiver as the traditional role of 'breadwinner'," researchers conclude. "These men want to be engaged parents and successful professionals, yet find conflicts as they try to achieve both objectives."
More specifically:Job security and flexible work options are more important than high income and good opportunity to advance.
Most fathers surveyed said they want to share equally in caregiving but fall short of that goal.
20 percent of fathers took more than two weeks off after their most recent child was born, and 1 in 100 took five weeks or more off.
Fathers are much more likely to use informal flexible work arrangements at a much higher rate than formal ones.
53 percent of fathers would consider not working outside the home if they could afford to.But once you move away from the high socio-economic layer polled by all of the above, you find that the "involved and conflicted father" seems a function of income, ethnicity and education. In a report this week titled "A Tale of Two Fathers: More Are Active, but More Are Absent" the Pew Research Center found that 46 percent of respondents say fathers play a greater role in their children's lives now than 20 or 30 years ago, nearly the same percent (45 percent) say they play less of a role now. According to the Center, both perceptions are correct:The role of fathers in the modern American family is changing in important and countervailing ways. Fathers who live with their children have become more intensely involved in their lives, spending more time with them and taking part in a greater variety of activities. However, the share of fathers who are residing with their children has fallen significantly in the past half century.
Fathers' living arrangements are strongly correlated with race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status as measured by educational attainment. Black fathers are more than twice as likely as white fathers to live apart from their children (44% vs. 21%), while Hispanic fathers fall in the middle (35%). Among fathers who never completed high school, 40% live apart from their children. This compares with only 7% of fathers who graduated from college.Other data points from Pew:63 percent say being a dad is harder today than it was a generation ago.26 percent think today's dads are doing a better job of parenting than their own fathers did; 34 percent think they are doing a worse job; 40 percent rate themselves "about the same."87 percent of males who are now between the ages of 15 and 44 who have no children say that they would like to, eventually.How would you rate yourself compared with your own father? Is the job harder today? Are the fathers you know more determined to be more than just the breadwinner?

HEADLINE: Big Deal | All Units Are Unique, Some Uniquely So

BYLINE: SARAH KERSHAW


HIGHLIGHT: A three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom co-op with 4,235 square feet of space and "quite a unique history," according to the broker who is handling the $21.4 million listing.

 BODY:
Real estate brokers often describe the properties they market as "unique." (Roughly 99.9 percent of the time.)
But Tim Cass of the Corcoran Group, who is listing a $21.4 million penthouse at 50 Gramercy Park North this weekend, does have a point in this case. 
An Icelandic couple bought two apartments in the building, a duplex and a simplex, in 2007. They paid a total of about $14 million, in cash. At the time, the $10.18 million investment in the duplex penthouse alone was one of the highest prices ever paid for an apartment south of 42nd Street.
An Icelandic bank is now selling the penthouse, which it acquired for $22 million in February, property records show. The couple, Jon Asgeir Johannesson, the founder of the Baugur Group, a once wildly successful Icelandic holding company with investments in grocery, fashion and real estate, and Ingibjorg Palmadottir, now his wife, had intended to combine the duplex and the simplex on the floor below as a pied-a-terre, Mr. Cass said.
Then the global recession intervened, and the company suffered a reversal of fortune. The couple wound up renting out the $4 million simplex apartment for $26,000 a month.
And here is where things get a little unusual: In February 2010, the renter filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court accusing the landlords, who had promised to equip the apartment with a kitchen in a timely fashion, of "willfully" installing an "ugly" kitchen with Ikea furniture. Ikea is generally known to "offer low-budget furniture," the complaint read, and the renter argued that this kitchen was not only unsuitable in anIan Schrager tower with expensive and lavish kitchens, but was "the source of embarrassment for plaintiff and the subject of remarks by guests."
The lawsuit, which has since been dismissed, stated that the renter suffered other indignities, including the discovery of 30 chewed-through chicken wings dropped onto the renter's terrace from the Icelandic couple's duplex while the renter had guests in attendance, according to the complaint.
The renter still lives in the unit, Mr. Cass said.
He had represented the couple in an unsuccessful attempt to sell the co-op, until it was taken off the market and then bought by the bank. He said the current asking price, more than double the original sale, was justified by the unlikelihood of a similar property's ever coming on the market, given that it has the amenities of a luxury hotel and a location on Gramercy Park.
Mr. Cass said he was happy to have the listing back, especially as the luxury market had picked up in recent months. The three-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath co-op has 4,235 square feet of space and "quite a unique history," he said.

HEADLINE: Nasdaq Said to Seek Stake in London Clearinghouse

BYLINE: CHRIS V. NICHOLSON


HIGHLIGHT: Nasdaq OMX wants to take a minority stake in LCH.Clearnet, the swaps clearinghouse, as it heads into another stand-off with NYSE Euronext.

 BODY:
Nasdaq OMX wants to take a minority stake in LCH.Clearnet, the London-based swaps clearinghouse, as the exchange operator heads into another stand-off with its rival, NYSE Euronext.
Nasdaq OMX, which last month withdrew its unsolicited bid for the owner of the Big Board last month in the face of antitrust concerns, is now weighing a deal to partner with the clearinghouse, a move that would increase its international exposure, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
The talks to tie LCH.Clearnet more closely to an exchange come as regulators in the United States and Europe try to bring more transparency to the huge over-the-counter derivatives market, another reaction to the financial crisis.
Clearinghouses guarantee that trades, once made, are actually settled, ensuring that transactions go through even in the event that a counterparty becomes insolvent.
Nasdaq OMX already operates the International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearinghouse founded in 2007 that settles interest-rate swaps and various fixed-income derivatives. 
LCH.Clearnet said last month that it had "received various proposals indicating an interest in pursuing some form of possible business combination or other cooperation," without naming the interested parties. At the time, it described the talks as being at a "preliminary stage." It declined to comment on Friday.
LCH.Clearnet has already been approached by Markit and NYSE Euronext, which would consider a joint bid, a person familiar with the matter said. The Big Board would be the minority partner in the bid, the person said. 
On Thursday, LCH.Clearnet and NYSE Euronext extended their clearing arrangements in Europe until mid-2013. 
NYSE Euronext's chief executive, Duncan L. Niederauer, said in a statement Thursday that the clearinghouse was "considering its own strategic options" even as his exchange was finalizing its merger with Deutsche Borse. He noted that "this extension gives both parties the time needed for these strategies to crystallize."

HEADLINE: Falcone's LightSquared Reaches Wireless Deal With Sprint

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The hedge fund manager Philip A. Falcone intends to operate a 4G network with Sprint Nextel, but his wireless venture still faces considerable challenges.

 BODY:
8:46 p.m. | Updated 
LightSquared, the wireless broadband venture controlled by the billionaire hedge fund manager Philip A. Falcone, has reached a 15-year agreement to jointly develop and operate a 4G network with Sprint Nextel, a reprieve for a company that has come under fire recently for its wireless ambitions.
The roughly $15 billion deal would allow LightSquared to piggyback on Sprint's network instead of having to build its own, according to a letter Mr. Falcone sent to investors in his hedge fund, Harbinger Capital Partners. For Sprint, the deal gives it a partner to bear the cost of an expensive build-out and gives it access to LightSquared's high-speed wireless service. The exact terms of the deal are still unclear.
Mr. Falcone has been under pressure on multiple fronts. Most recently, his company has been facing down concerns that its wireless venture will interfere with GPS signals, a condition that could pose problems for technologies as diverse as medical services and car systems.
A report by LightSquared on the extent of the potential interference has been delayed until July 1, but the looming issue had raised questions about the viability of Mr. Falcone's venture, which cannot move forward under its current plans until the conflict is resolved. A spokesman for Mr. Falcone declined to comment.
Mr. Falcone, 48, rose to prominence in 2007 when his hedge fund placed a major bet against the subprime mortgage market that made him an instant billionaire. Known as a tough investor, Mr. Falcone built his reputation by buying up shares in troubled companies and finding creative ways to turn them around. But in recent years, Harbinger's large ownership stake in LightSquared has frightened his investors.
Indeed, the wireless venture was the latest in a long line of actions that Mr. Falcone had taken that alienated Harbinger investors. His funds were down heavily during the financial crisis, and he refused to let clients pull out their money for fear of selling assets into a falling market. But during that same period, Mr. Falcone borrowed $113 million from one of his funds to pay a tax bill, prompting regulators to take a closer look at him and Harbinger.
Problems have grown worse for Mr. Falcone since then, as investors have withdrawn their money in droves and the size of his bet in LightSquared has swelled.
Mr. Falcone caught the attention of Washington lawmakers, who raised questions about why LightSquared was given a rare waiver by the Federal Communications Commission on the company's operations. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, sent a letter to the F.C.C. requesting copies of all communications between the agency and Mr. Falcone and his companies.
The confrontation with GPS users has been the most recent hurdle for Mr. Falcone's grand ambition, which is to create a broadband provider to help relieve the country's overloaded wireless networks. Some have raised questions about the viability of any deal struck between the company and Sprint, given the uncertainty over the GPS issue.
Analysts figure that in addition to the GPS question, Mr. Falcone must raise billions of dollars more to pay for whatever deal he has worked out with Sprint to build the network they would share. LightSquared must also find customers and clean up some patches of its spectrum, or wireless capacity.
The deal, which was reported earlier by Bloomberg News, includes an upfront cash payment to Sprint as well as caveats should the GPS issue prove damaging to LightSquared's ambitions, according to a person who has been briefed on the terms.

HEADLINE: Making Choices 'as if the Future Matters'

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: A conversation with Diane Coyle, a British economist and the author of "The Economics of Enough."

 BODY:
Diane Coyle is a British economist who blogs at The Enlightened Economist and is an active Twitter user. Her previous book, "The Soulful Science," examined the revival of economics as a field relevant to the rest of us, and her latest book is called "The Economics of Enough."
The Financial Times, The Independent (of London) and The New York Times, among others, recently reviewed "The Economics of Enough." In an interview with the British site The Browser, Ms. Coyle listed her own favorite economics books. My exchange with Ms. Coyle follows.
Q. Your book, as you write, is about "how to make sure what we achieve in the present doesn't come at the expense of the future ... how to run the economy as if the future matters." One big challenge seems to be getting people to sacrifice for the future at a time when the present isn't very good. How do you think about the politics of "the economics of enough"? 
Ms. Coyle: Looking to the long term is difficult enough in business and finance, and it's all the more so in the realm of politics. Voters are disillusioned, and part of the explanation is that public policy is so clearly failing to tackle the complexities and uncertainties of the modern economy. There is too much cynicism about politicians, I think. Most people go into public life because they start out with the noble ambition making things a bit better for their fellow citizens. So why do they all seem to end up doing short-term pork-barrel politics?
One answer is that politicians and voters alike are unaware of the extent of the economic problems. Believe it or not, the government debt is much worse than it looks because it currently excludes the implied promises of future Medicaid and Social Security payments as the population gets older. To take another example, there are no official statistics on the depletion of the country's natural resources. One of the main measures we look at, gross domestic product, indicates how much income the national economy produces in a year, but we don't know how much of the nation's capital -- in the widest sense, including natural resources -- has been eaten to generate it. Statistics need to be tailored to their era, and developing official measures of the nation's wealth, as well as its income year to year, would give politicians both the information and the ammunition they need in order to build a solid economic legacy.
A second reason we lack the "politics of enough" is that people are unlikely to make sacrifices for the future if the future looks likely to be as unfair as the present. The decline in the real incomes of millions of families, especially in the U.S., while the very rich have grown much richer make it unlikely that a majority of voters would have any confidence about benefiting from future growth. This is a question of politics, and the extent of the power certain groups such as bankers have been allowed to develop; and it's also for me a question of morality, the strong ethical commitment to one's fellows needed for the market economy to work well.
Q. In the context of the huge long-term deficits facing rich countries, you say that recent generations have been living beyond their means. What do you think is the one kind of tax increase that would best help us live within our means? And, similarly, the one kind of spending cut? 
Ms. Coyle: The current system of taxes and government spending encourages consumption and the over-use of resources today and creates too little incentive to save and invest. The one tax to increase now is a carbon tax. You don't even have to worry about climate change to accept it has many benefits. In particular, it will encourage innovation in noncarbon-based energy supplies from renewables to nuclear. This is a field in which the U.S. and other Western economies could build on their strong science base to build an area of technological strength for the future, and at the same time reduce dependence on oil and gas imports from overseas. There are multiple good reasons for introducing a carbon tax.
Government spending needs to be redirected away from massive corporate subsidies -- including to the financial sector but also big companies in health care and agribusiness -- and instead towards infrastructure investment and education (which is infrastructure of a different kind for the digital economy). But the really painful cut in expenditure needs to be in government support for older people. Across the Western economies, retirement ages and the age threshold for benefits from the government will have to increase. If not, healthy and active over-60s benefiting from the taxes of a declining proportion of working people in the population are going to bankrupt the government and undermine the arrangement of mutual benefit that keeps any society stable. And, yes, I'm fully planning on working until I'm 70.
Q. And how should we be spending money in ways that we are not now -- or not doing enough of now?
Ms. Coyle: Governments are what we have to take decisions for all of us, and that means there are three ways governments should spend our tax dollars. One is in making judgments about which groups need support from the rest of the society. This is why democracy is so important, to legitimize choices between spending on one group rather than another. A second is when there are what an economist calls public goods, which mean that private spending overlooks the wider benefits of some activity and therefore expenditure would be too low. Examples range from defense spending to public parks. The third is when it's important that the government can take decisions over a longer time horizon than any private business or individual can.
In my book I focus on the first and the third. The first because in a society whose average age is rising, which is the case in all Western democracies, voters will have a growing tendency to favor programs for older people at the expense of the young. Yet the younger people do most of the work, drive the growth of the economy, and pay the taxes that fund government expenditure. This could become extremely divisive politically, especially given the scale of the cuts in deficit spending currently needed to restore the government's finances to a sustainable state. In the U.K., the coalition government has gone ahead with brave -- and controversial -- public spending cuts, but these are likely to fall more heavily on younger age groups, while some subsidies for the elderly are politically untouchable because older people are more likely to vote. So I argue we need to make a generational assessment of government expenditure.
On the question of the time horizon for investments to pay back, any business raising money through the financial markets or the banks will need to be earning a return on investment within two or three years, but the advanced economies need investments that might not pay back for 20 or 50 years. Investment in basic research is another example, where spending might not earn its return for decades, if at all. But who could argue that past investment has not served America well, putting the country at the global frontier for science and technology? In the U.S. and U.K., investments made in the 1950s and 1960s (or even the 1890s), such as the highways and ports, are still serving us well. Government spending needs switching from current needs to investment anyway, and the question needs to be: which projects are so long-term that future generations will be the ones to benefit from the investment? What is the current legacy for the nation going to be?
Q. I may be grasping for optimism here, but is there any good reason to think we'll be able to make this transition?
Ms. Coyle: The triumph of democracy, in the end, is that it offers a path for difficult transitions. People know things have to change, and I think are both ready and eager for the political debate that requires, a different kind of debate from politics as usual. So I'm definitely an optimist about it -- as long as we do everything we can to put the tools in place for that process to start.

HIGHLIGHT: Representative Anthony D. Weiner announced his resignation to an audibly hostile audience on Thursday.

 BODY:
From Today's Times:
 Ending a three-week scandal that erupted when a lewd photo was sent from his Twitter account, Representative Anthony D. Weiner resigned from Congress on Thursday. In a brief but rowdy news conference in New York, Mr. Weiner apologized again while hecklers jeered him and shouted vulgar questions. The Times's Raymond Hernandez reports that Mr. Weiner decided to resign after long emotional discussions with his wife and political advisers. In his final news conference as defense secretary, Robert M. Gates urged the United States on Thursday to maintain its critical, albeit troubled, relationship with Pakistan for the sake of regional stability. But he steered clear of discussing concerns that the leader of the Pakistani Army could lose his position because of anger over the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden, The Times's Elisabeth Bumiller and Thom Shanker report. The House closed a tense, weeklong debate by voting to cut food aid to the poor and other agriculture programs on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Senate voted to end government benefits like tax credits for the corn-based ethanol industry. While the Senate's measure is unlikely to become law because it is attached to a larger bill that will probably fail, the vote showed that support for ethanol is weakening in Congress and may leave room for a bipartisan compromise on ending such tax breaks, The Times's Jennifer Steinhauer and Carl Hulse report. Gov. Jerry Brown of California sent the Democratic-controlled State Legislature back to square one on Thursday, vetoing a budget that he said papered over the deficit. The Times's Jennifer Medina reports the move took lawmakers by surprise. Mr. Brown will now have to reopen negotiations to close a nearly $10 billion budget gap.Around the Web:
 Senator John McCain criticized President Obama on Thursday for arguing that the military operation in Libya did not require Congressional approval, Roll Call reports. While Mr. McCain supports the United States' participation in the Libya campaign and wants Congress to support it, he said the conflict falls under the War Powers Act.Washington Happenings: What was the demand for oil and gas like in May? The American Petroleum Institute will release its monthly statistics on Friday. In other economic news, the Conference Board will release its index of leading indicators for May and the Labor Department its state and regional unemployment data for last month.

HEADLINE: Making Choices 'as if the Future Matters'

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: A conversation with Diane Coyle, a British economist and the author of "The Economics of Enough."

 BODY:
Diane Coyle is a British economist who blogs at The Enlightened Economist and is an active Twitter user. Her previous book, "The Soulful Science," examined the revival of economics as a field relevant to the rest of us, and her latest book is called "The Economics of Enough."
The Financial Times, The Independent (of London) and The New York Times, among others, recently reviewed "The Economics of Enough." In an interview with the British site The Browser, Ms. Coyle listed her own favorite economics books. My exchange with Ms. Coyle follows.
Ms. Coyle: Looking to the long term is difficult enough in business and finance, and it's all the more so in the realm of politics. Voters are disillusioned, and part of the explanation is that public policy is so clearly failing to tackle the complexities and uncertainties of the modern economy.

HEADLINE: Oaktree Capital Files to Go Public

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: Oaktree Capital Group, the firm founded by Howard Marks, filed for an initial public offering on Friday, the latest alternative asset manager looking to tap into the stock market.

 BODY:
Oaktree Capital Group filed for an initial public offering on Friday, the latest alternative asset manager looking to tap into the stock market. With its I.P.O., the firm, which oversees more than $80 billion, will shift its shares from a private market to the New York Stock Exchange. It will trade under the ticker symbol "OAK." 
In the filing, the firm set the I.P.O. at $100 million. But the number is an estimate used to calculate the registration fee, and the ultimate size of the offering could change. 
The move by Oaktree is part of a broader trend among hedges funds as they look to find a more permanent base of capital. During rocky times like the financial crisis, investors are quick to pull their assets, often forcing managers to sell at low prices or losses. With a public listing, hedge funds are seeking stickier assets that don't flee at the first sign of trouble.
William Ackman, the much followed head of Pershing Square Capital Management, is said to be weighing an initial public offering for a portfolio, according to people with knowledge of the matter. He is planning to raise billions of dollars for a fund, but does not plan to take the firm itself public. Brevan Howard and CQS Management, two British hedge funds, have taken funds public already.
Oaktree will join a small club of alternative managers whose shares trade on the stock market. Apollo, the Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Fortress Investment Group are all public.
The Los Angeles based Oaktree, which was started in 1995, has its origins in credit. Its founders, Howard Marks and Bruce Karsh, left TCW to start their own shop, with many of the top managers working together in high yield bonds and convertible securities.
Oaktree has more than recovered from the financial crisis. In 2008, assets slipped 5 percent to less than $50 billion. They now stand at more than $80 billion.
The underwriters on the I.P.O. are Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Egypt Business Forum

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your June 10 front-page article ''Egypt's Economy Slows to a Crawl, in Test to Revolt'' describes the slowdown of the Egyptian economy after the January protests. Although the revolt was largely started by people who simply wanted a job, the immediate result has been slower economic growth and higher unemployment. 
In response, at the end of this month the United States government will be the host for a forum called Egypt: Forward, the first major event between the United States and Egypt since the protests. The forum will connect American and Egyptian businesses and promote increased trade between the countries.
As President Obama said of Egypt in a speech last month, ''It's important to focus on trade, not just aid, and investment, not just assistance.'' It is critical at this important juncture that we support the growth of the Egyptian economy, by building direct, sustainable trade and business partnerships between the United States and Egypt. Egypt: Forward will provide an opportunity to do just that.

HEADLINE: How to End the N.F.L. Deadlock

BYLINE: By ARLEN SPECTER. 
Arlen Specter, a senator from Pennsylvania from 1981 to 2011, is a lawyer.

 BODY:
Philadelphia
IT will be bad for America if there is no N.F.L. football in the fall.
Cancellation of the 2011 National Football League season -- a possibility that looms over the players' strike and the owners' lockout -- would not only disappoint the sport's many fans and disrupt the social rituals (tailgating, Super Bowl parties) that surround the game; it would also have serious economic consequences. Edgeworth Economics, a consulting firm, studied the cost of a canceled 2011 season (at the request of the players association) and estimated it to be about $5 billion from lost jobs, decreased spending at local businesses and reduced tax revenue. In addition, billions of dollars in TV revenue and millions of dollars in ticket sales would vanish.
With this much at stake, the country should not sit back and wait for the players and owners to reach an agreement on their own. Congress can -- and should -- intervene to force a resolution of the dispute. 
Congress has considerable leverage over the N.F.L. because it grants the league an antitrust exemption without which it could not operate as it currently does. The joint agreements among teams on matters like free agency and revenue sharing, as well as the league's single national TV deal, would otherwise run afoul of federal antitrust laws, which prohibit businesses (in this case, individual teams) from making deals that reduce competition.
To ensure an agreement between the owners and players in time for the 2011 season, Congress should place a special condition on the continuation of the N.F.L.'s antitrust exemption: the owners and players must abide by a settlement procedure known as last-best-offer arbitration. This procedure would require the two sides to negotiate; if an agreement is not reached, each side would make its last best offer and an arbitrator would chose between the two. This arrangement creates an incentive for each side to make the more reasonable offer, lest the arbitrator pick the other side's.
Skeptics will note that in the past, Congress has been unwilling to use its leverage to compel the N.F.L. to alter unpopular or controversial practices. When the Philadelphia Eagles threatened to move to Phoenix in the early 1980s, I introduced legislation that would have made the antitrust exemption conditional on the league's prohibiting such moves if the team was financially successful (as the Eagles were). That legislation, which was strongly opposed by N.F.L. lobbyists, did not pass.
Similarly, in the '90s, when several professional football and baseball teams threatened to move in order to pressure cities to pay for stadium construction costs, I introduced legislation that would have made the antitrust exemption conditional on having the N.F.L. and Major League Baseball (which has a similar exemption) pay three-quarters of such construction costs. Again, the legislation was opposed by lobbyists and did not pass.
But the political climate today is much more conducive to congressional action than past efforts to deal with local issues like franchise moves and stadium construction costs. The prospect of a lost N.F.L. season has upset fans across the country, not least because the league has never generated more revenue or been more popular than it was last year.
There is already a starting point for the legislation I am proposing. A bill introduced in March by Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, aims to strip the antitrust exemption from the N.F.L. because the league, according to the bill, ''acted in bad faith'' by negotiating broadcast contracts that guaranteed it would be paid even in the event of a lockout.
This is a good moment for Congress to act. Gridlock on other issues has left the House and the Senate with time to spare. And even the mere threat of such legislation might induce a settlement.

HEADLINE: Financial Advice Gleaned From a Day in the Hot Seat

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
WHEN I started writing this column almost three years ago, one of my goals was to figure out what the wealthiest Americans knew and pass along those lessons to middle- and upper-middle-class readers.
This past Monday, I put that idea to the test, spending the afternoon in a Manhattan town house with eight wealthy men who are all members of an investment club called Tiger 21. I was there to hear an unvarnished critique of how my wife and I save, spend and think about money.
Each of the 180 members of Tiger 21 has a net worth of at least $10 million, pays $30,000 in annual membership fees and commits to spending one day a month with other members. Nearly all of them made their money -- they didn't inherit it -- and most are men.
I had asked to sit in on one of the group's signature sessions, the portfolio defense, but a few weeks ago, the members invited me to be in the hot seat. I jumped at the chance. Beyond looking at how money is invested, the portfolio defense is intended to force members to discuss their wealth in the broadest terms. 
I had heard horror stories. One member was told he needed to lose a lot of weight if he was going to get people to invest in his new fund. Another was chastised for telling his children that he had lost his money in the financial crash so that he would not have to talk to them about his immense wealth.
Michael Sonnenfeldt, the founder of Tiger 21, used the term ''carefrontation'' to describe what happens in a portfolio defense. The assessments are meant to be direct, unsettling and possibly painful to hear, Mr. Sonnenfeldt told me. But the goal is to get members to think differently about what they are doing with their investments and about everything in their lives that is affected by their wealth, from their family to charities.
''It's not meant for the faint-hearted,'' Mr. Sonnenfeldt said. ''This is a process that some people could clearly find offensive or discomforting.''
What I experienced was rough, but it was also thought-provoking. The value to me -- and to anyone given a similar opportunity -- was that the members challenged everything about my assumptions on saving and spending. Here's some of what I took away.
OUR MISTAKES In the week leading up to this, I worked with Joel Treisman, an executive coach and the chairman of one of Tiger's 17 groups, to gather up all of our financial reports.
I was confident that the group would think my wife and I were in good financial shape. We save a good percentage of our income. We don't have any debt beyond mortgages and a car payment. We probably spend a bit too much on food and pet care, but we don't run up credit card bills to do it.
The members were warm and welcoming as we filled our plates with poached salmon, grilled asparagus and buffalo mozzarella from the buffet. But as soon as we were seated, it was all business. And I was immediately on the defensive. There were two big surprises but also blunt advice and some thoughtful questions about our portfolio.
First, the surprises. The group agreed that we did not have enough life or disability insurance. We both have insurance that would cover about three or four years of earnings if one of us died. This seemed sufficient to get past a few years of sorting things out. The group disagreed. Going from two incomes to one would mean a radical rethinking of our life.
We needed more sizable policies to give us the freedom to sort through things. Though we both carry disability insurance, the policies are old and do not reflect our current income. They would also cover only 50 to 60 percent of our old base salaries. The members thought we should buy individual policies to add to this.
The second surprise was about our savings. We have been saving about 15 percent of our post-tax income. Alan Mantell, a lawyer who made his money in real estate, development and investment, said the issue was not how much we saved but how we thought about spending.
''You need to ask, 'What can I afford to spend versus what do I need to spend?' '' he said. We could be saving more money for retirement -- or in case something bad happens -- if we cut back on things we did not really need, he said.
All the members agreed that we should sell our vacation condominium. ''You need to become more liquid,'' said Thomas Gallagher, the former vice chairman of CIBC World Markets. ''If something bad happens, it's easy to get rid of a dog walker; it's hard to get rid of a house in Naples.''
Florida real estate is in a sad state, so I asked what they would do with an offer that was less than our mortgage?
''Take it,'' Mr. Gallagher said. ''Write the check and be done with it.''
As for our portfolio of stocks and bonds, the questions were more basic. Leslie C. Quick III, whose money came from Quick & Reilly, the discount brokerage firm, looked at our investments -- 50 percent in equities, 34 percent in fixed income, 12 percent in commodities and real estate and 4 percent in cash -- and wanted to know how our investment manager had done in the bear market. He also thought we should ask our adviser how he balances the risks in our jobs against those in our portfolio.
OUR SOLUTIONS Because I had parachuted into Tiger 21 for one meeting, I was taken aback by the group's brutal honesty. I walked out after three hours in a daze. Over the next couple of days, though, I concluded that the members had made some great points.
Some solutions were simple. We can increase our term life insurance for comparatively little money -- $1 million of term life costs about $700 a year. Individual disability policies cost more. Barry Lundquist, president of the Council for Disability Awareness, said the yearly premium would usually be 1 to 3 percent of a person's salary, but the payout would still be limited to a percentage of that person's income.
As for our portfolio, I put the questions to our adviser, K. C. King of Emerson Investment Management. I liked that he did not sidestep the bear market question: Emerson's portfolios did better than the benchmarks in 2008, but they lost value like everything other than cash, gold and Treasuries.
Where I took comfort, though, was in how he thought about our portfolio. ''We're very mindful that what we're managing for you and most of our clients is their core portfolio,'' Mr. King said. ''If someone said from the Tiger group that this is fairly conservative and you're not taking big swings, we'd say you're right. This is the portfolio that we're trying to keep for your daughter's education and into your retirement.''
The issue that Mr. Mantell raised about spending is the thorniest one. My wife and I are under no illusions that having a condo in Florida makes financial sense. Trimming spending in other places is easier: Walking the dogs ourselves, for instance, would save $100 a week or $5,200 a year.
In the end, though, there are such radical differences between the wealth of the Tiger members and most Americans that some of their advice could not apply.
Mr. Sonnenfeldt estimated that 90 percent of Tiger members had paid off the mortgages on all of their homes.
They also tend to view money as something to preserve rather than accumulate. Mr. Sonnenfeldt said members spent about 3 percent of their wealth annually, which allowed the principal to continue to grow. But at the $10 million entry level, this would mean $300,000 a year.
Perhaps most important, none of the members became rich by eating out less. They became rich by working in industries that paid extremely well or by building businesses that they later sold.
Still, what was best about the session was that no one pulled any punches. Their honesty forced us to think hard about the assumptions we were making. Yes, it was difficult. But really, who wouldn't want advice from those who have made it?

HEADLINE: Hopes for Greek Bailout Help Most Shares Gain

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stock prices stabilized on Friday and the euro was higher as increased hopes for a Greek bailout gave major indexes their first weekly gain since April.
Shares gained as Germany agreed under pressure from France not to force private investors to take on some of the burden of a new bailout package for Greece. The announcement in Berlin meant Germany was backing away from a sticking point with the European Central Bank on the issue.
The market pared its gains late in the day, however, after Moody's Investors Service put Italy's government bond ratings on review for possible downgrade. The rating agency cited growth challenges, a likely rise in interest rates and risks posed by changing funding conditions in Europe as among the reasons for the review. 
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was 42.84 points, or 0.4 percent, higher at 12,004.36, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 3.86 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,271.50. The Dow rose 0.4 percent and the S.& P. edged up just 0.04 percent for the week -- the first weekly gains since April 29.
The Nasdaq composite index closed lower Friday, falling 7.22 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,616.48, its fifth consecutive weekly loss.
The euro continued to be buffeted by European debt developments, reacting sharply on Friday to the announcement by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany about the Greek bailout.
''That is when the euro popped,'' said Brian Dolan, the chief currency strategist for Forex.com. The European currency rose to $1.4306 in late New York trading from $1.4207 late in the day on Thursday.
Mr. Dolan said that the debt issue was likely to continue to weigh on the European currency, however. ''You get a short-term rebound in the euro but the long-term issues are still there, and that is going to prevent the euro from a sustained recovery,'' he said.
In European markets, the CAC-40 in Paris rose 31.43 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,823.74. The DAX in Germany was up 53.85 points, or 0.8 percent, at 7,164.05, and the FTSE in London gained 16.13 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,714.94.
Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist of Key Private Bank, said concerns about European debt and a slowdown in the United States economy had probably pushed United States stock prices down too far, too quickly. ''We priced in a lot of negatives over a short time period,'' he said. With investors having reduced their exposure to equities, he said, now the market ''has the opportunity to rally a bit.''
In the bond market, Treasury issues slipped Friday after rallying on Thursday in response to European debt worries. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note yield fell 5/32, to 101 18/32, and the yield rose to 2.94 percent.
Analysts said that even if Europe can agree on the details of a rescue package for Greece, worries will persist about political stability in the country as well as a possible contagion effect on Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal.
''The problems in the euro zone don't begin and end with Greece,'' said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.
In stock market trading on Friday, financials, consumer staples, utilities and telecommunications shares rose by more than 1 percent. Among the gainers, I.B.M. rose 1.8 percent to $164.44, JPMorgan Chase gained 1.1 percent to $40.80, AT&T climbed 1.1 percent to $30.77 and Microsoft rose 1.1 percent to $24.26.
Among the day's biggest decliners was Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry smartphone. The company, which has struggled to compete with Apple's iPhone and Google Android phones, reduced its earnings outlook for the second time this year after the market close on Thursday. RIM shares plunged 21.45 percent Friday to $27.75.

HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
8 P.M. (HBO) INCEPTION (2010) Leonardo DiCaprio, above, stars as Cobb, a specialist in corporate mental espionage who, using a combination of drugs, wires and other Matrix-y methods, penetrates the minds of his sleeping targets to extract information. Ken Watanabe is Saito, the wealthy client who has hired Cobb and his associates (Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page, among others) to undertake the trick known as inception, which involves planting an idea in someone's mind that will come to fruition in the real world. Their mission: to induce a young man (Cillian Murphy), whose father (Pete Postlethwaite) is a business rival of Saito's, to break up the company he is about to inherit. Meanwhile, Cobb can't stop thinking about his wife (Marion Cotillard). '' 'Inception,' Christopher Nolan's visually arresting, noir-tinged caper, is as packed with allusions and citations as a film studies term paper,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. 
''Admirers of Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' and Stanley Kubrick's '2001' will find themselves in good company, though 'Inception' does not come close to matching the impact of those durable cult objects. It trades in crafty puzzles rather than profound mysteries, and gestures in the direction of mighty philosophical questions that Mr. Nolan is finally too tactful, too timid or perhaps just too busy to engage.'' Still, Mr. Scott said of the film, which won Oscars for cinematography, sound mixing, sound editing and visual effects, ''A lot of this is -- what is the critical term of art I'm looking for? -- pretty cool.''
NOON (13) RICHARD HEFFNER'S OPEN MIND Michele Moody-Adams, the dean of Columbia College of Columbia University, discusses the history and future of America's liberal arts colleges. Ms. Moody-Adams says she ''resists the thought that an education has to be preprofessional or vocational in some deliberate way in order to prepare students for a challenging and very brutal moment economically,'' adding that ''in preserving the best intellectual tradition, we're also giving students a set of skills and cognitive capacities that will suit them well, whatever line of work or profession they choose.''
9 P.M. (13) GORKY PARK (1983) Gorky Park, Martin Cruz Smith wrote in the novel of the same title on which this spy drama from Michael Apted is based, is ''the purest heart of the city'' and the only place in Moscow ''where you could fantasize.'' The park is also the site of three grisly murders, investigated here by Arkady Renko (William Hurt, above), a police inspector who finds himself slowly drawn to the hope and freedom represented by the outdoor expanse. He is led deep into a web of deception involving a ruthless American entrepreneur (Lee Marvin) and an insolent beauty (Joanna Pacula). ''Although 'Gorky Park' seems to grow more tangled and affectless as it progresses, it remains a taut, clever thriller throughout, with Mr. Apted's direction establishing its intensity immediately and sustaining it well,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The Times. In Pedro Gonzalez-Rubio's ''Alamar'' (2009), at 11:10, a young man (Jorge Machado) of Mayan descent and his half-Italian son (Natan Machado Palombini) embark on an epic sea voyage to the Banco Chinchorro, the largest coral reef in Mexico, before bidding farewell. Reviewing this ''luminous semi-documentary film'' in The Times, Stephen Holden wrote that it risked ''lapsing into ethnographic sentimentality and at moments comes perilously close to turning into an escapist fantasy of abandoning civilization for never-never land.'' But, he added, ''in a gentle, firm voice, it teaches hard lessons about impermanence and letting go.''
9 P.M. (BBC America) OUTCASTS With Earth no longer habitable in 2040, a group of pioneers travels to another planet to begin again in this series from Ben Richards, a writer of ''MI-5.'' Liam Cunningham plays President Tate, who is determined to run the new civilization, Carpathia, as a democracy. Hermione Norris, Daniel Mays and Amy Manson are his core team. And Eric Mabius (''Ugly Betty'') is Julius Berger, the vice president for the evacuation program on Earth, whose presence on the last known transporter to the new world makes Tate more than a little nervous. Lady Gaga, Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush head the guest roster on ''The Graham Norton Show,'' at 10, followed by the Season 3 premiere of ''The Inbetweeners,'' at 11. And in ''Come Fly With Me,'' a new mockumentary set in an airport terminal, at 11:30, Matt Lucas and David Walliams of ''Little Britain'' play more than 50 characters -- from the flight crew and counter agents to paparazzi and passengers.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Lowers U.S. Forecast, But Other Data Is Promising

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Consumer sentiment worsened this month on renewed concerns about the outlook for the economy as gloom about job and income prospects persisted, data released Friday showed.
But a separate report suggested that the rate of the recovery could soon pick up after stalling in the first half of the year. 
Taking the unexpected soft patch into account, the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for economic growth in the United States, warning Washington and debt-ridden European countries that they were ''playing with fire'' unless they took immediate steps to reduce their budget deficits.
While the I.M.F. thinks downside risks to growth have increased, it still expects the economy to gain speed next year.
Consumer sentiment in the United States declined more than expected in June, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey showed, as consumers remained pessimistic about stagnant incomes and job prospects.
''Job growth is, at best, anemic and the unemployment rate is high. If you've been laid off, it's probably been for a long period of time,'' said Cary Leahey, economist and managing director at Decision Economics in New York. ''That can't help but affect these sentiment figures.''
The preliminary reading showed the index at 71.8, down from 74.3 the month before. It was below the median forecast of 74.0 among economists polled by Reuters.
Although the data contained little evidence that a new downturn was under way, the survey found that most consumers believed the recession had not yet ended.
Consumers' view of rising prices was also mixed as the survey's one-year inflation expectation fell to its lowest since February, to 4.0 percent from 4.1 percent. But the five-to-10-year inflation outlook was at 3.0 percent, edging up from 2.9 percent.
A separate report showed that a gauge of future economic activity rose more than expected in May, but high gasoline prices and a weak housing market are expected to keep growth moderate.
The independent Conference Board said on Friday its Leading Economic Index increased 0.8 percent to a record high of 114.7, after a revised 0.4 percent fall in April. Economists had expected a rise of 0.2 percent.
The rise in the economic indicators was an encouraging sign after recent sluggish data, and underscored releases on Thursday that showed a better-than-expected picture of the labor and housing markets, but a contraction in Mid-Atlantic factory activity in June.
''This rebound in the leading indicators index is an encouraging sign that the recent slowdown in the economy may be short-lived,'' Nicholas Tenev, an economist at Barclays Capital, wrote in a note.
In its report Friday, the I.M.F. forecast that the gross domestic product in the United States would grow a tepid 2.5 percent this year and 2.7 percent in 2012. In its forecast just two months ago, it had expected 2.8 percent growth in 2011, rising to 2.9 percent in 2012.

HEADLINE: Frozen Dead Guy Festival for Sale (the Man Himself Stays on Ice)

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
NEDERLAND, Colo. -- As a business opportunity, Nederland's frozen dead guy is pretty hot right now. Well, technically, of course, he's still frozen, packed in dry ice in a shed outside town, as he has been for going on 20 years.
But the concept and the rights to the name Frozen Dead Guy Days, the gleefully ghoulish late-winter bacchanal of ice and death and beer -- that's up for grabs. The Nederland Area Chamber of Commerce here in the mountains northwest of Denver owns the registered trademark to all things Dead Guy and has put those rights up for sale. 
''It has grown out of our grasp,'' said Blue Hessner, the chamber's president. Mr. Hessner said that the board would consider all offers, with no pre-set price, and that depending on the buyer, ''it could become a little more commercial.'' He said discussions were under way with two potential buyers, but he declined to name any names.
Celebrating the mortal remains of an 89-year-old Norwegian named Bredo Morstoel, whose body became stranded here in 1993, is already a big local economic engine. Upward of 20,000 people came this year over a three-day weekend in early March to mark its 10th year and its packed agenda -- the coffin races, the parade of hearses, the crowning of an Ice Queen and the not-to-be-missed frozen salmon toss.
Mr. Morstoel, or so local lore has it, died in 1989. His body, already frozen, was brought to Nederland by a family member who dreamed of opening a cryogenic-body-storage-in-the-mountains business. Local officials subsequently found two frozen bodies, including Mr. Morstoel's, in the family's possession and outlawed the practice of storing dead bodies. One of the bodies was relocated, but Mr. Morstoel's was allowed to stay.
A caretaker was hired by the family, charged with keeping Mr. Morstoel in fine frozen fettle against the advent of a scientific breakthrough that would someday allow his revival. Tours to view the shed and the sarcophagus, about 10 minutes outside town, are offered separately by the caretaker during festival times.
The festival, meanwhile, moved on its own trajectory starting in 2001 as a way for the town to capitalize on the weird, unlikely tale. A spokeswoman for the chamber stressed that what is up for sale is the festival itself and the name, not Mr. Morstoel's actual remains or responsibility for his upkeep.
Frozen Dead Guy Days falls right into the longstanding Western tradition of hyperbolic, manic absurdity in ways that Mark Twain, who chronicled the jumping frogs of Calaveras County, Calif., would probably have appreciated.
Fruita, Colo., holds an annual fete for a chicken named Mike who supposedly lived for 18 months after his decapitation on Sept. 10, 1945. Ainsworth, Neb., trying to make lemonade from lemons, holds a Middle of Nowhere festival in June. And Conway, Ark., has something called Toad Suck Daze.
Here in Nederland, at least one corporate sponsor has been on board for years. Tuff Shed, a maker of, well, sheds, spotted opportunity when the original outbuilding used for body storage started deteriorating -- the company donated a new space for Mr. Morstoel and his ice (which gets replenished periodically). T-shirts with the company tagline: ''Frozen Dead in a Shed, a Tuff Shed, That Is,'' are sold on the chamber's Web site, along with DVD copies of a documentary, ''Grandpa's Still in the Tuff Shed.''
In a place still tinctured by hippie-era tie-dye, where corporate franchises are widely unwelcome (people threatened to shoot out the Best Western motel sign when that company had the temerity to come to town some years back), the idea of Dead Guys going brand name has already set off a heated discussion.
''Anything corporate and people would be angry for sure, myself included,'' said Jon Ridnell, 46, a musician. ''That's why we live here -- to get away from that stuff.''
Other residents said they thought Frozen Dead Guy Days had already drifted beyond its original roots -- for the worse, some said, in its emphasis on alcohol -- and that it could perhaps use a little cleanup.
''By noon, everybody is three sheets to the wind and you want to get your kids out of there,'' said Joe Cleveland, 35, a construction contractor who has 5-year-old twins with his wife, Stephanie Bowyer, 38.
Others say that in a town dependent for its livelihood on tourism, a new festival owner with deeper pockets could only be a good thing.
''It brings in revenue -- we depend on it,'' said Heather Taylor, 31, an artist. ''Besides, I was Ice Queen once -- I can't complain.''

HEADLINE: Mayors See End to Wars as Fix for Struggling Cities

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
BALTIMORE -- While states are seeing their tax collections begin to rise again, much to the relief of budget-battered officials, the nation's cities are having a far rougher time, with many losing state and federal aid just as the burst housing bubble is belatedly driving down property taxes.
Providence and Hollywood, Fla., issued layoff notices to police officers this month that will cut jobs in the coming weeks unless the cities get more union concessions. Lansing, Mich., and New York are threatening to close fire stations. Teachers are getting pink slips in Philadelphia, and schools in Montgomery, Ala., are being closed. Libraries are open less. And potholes are staying unfilled longer in cities like Minneapolis.
Local governments shed 28,000 jobs last month, the Department of Labor reported, and have lost 446,000 jobs since employment peaked in September 2008. 
So when downturn-weary mayors from around the country gathered here on Friday for the annual meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, they decided to make a statement: they introduced a resolution calling for the speedy end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and calling on Congress to use the $126 billion a year the wars cost for urgent domestic needs.
The resolution, which will be decided Monday, seems likely to pass. ''There are so many better uses for the money,'' said Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore. Mayor R. T. Rybak of Minneapolis lamented that cities across the nation were being forced to make ''deeply painful cuts to the most core services while the defense budget continued to escape scrutiny.'' And Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles said that the idea ''that we would build bridges in Baghdad and Kandahar and not Baltimore and Kansas City absolutely boggles the mind.''
The rare foray of mayors into foreign policy -- 40 years after the conference approved a resolution calling for an end to the Vietnam War -- reflects not just the nation's increasing war weariness but a growing concern about the expense as Washington seems intent on cutting domestic spending even as many localities are struggling.
Many cities are hurting. They are losing federal aid, and at least 18 states are cutting aid to local governments. Ohio is planning some of the deepest cuts to local aid; Mayor Michael B. Coleman of Columbus said, ''The state cut is a punch in the gut, and in the jaw, and for some cities, it's going to knock them out.''
And because it often takes several years for property tax assessments to catch up with the state of the housing market, the real impact of the housing implosion is only now being felt in many cities. For the first time since the Great Recession began, property tax collections fell during the last three months of 2010, according to an analysis of data by the Rockefeller Institute, and many mayors expect the declines to continue.
Mayor Virg Bernero of Lansing, Mich., said that some of his constituents wondered why things were still so tight at the local level. ''Our cities -- and it ain't just Lansing -- our cities are stumbling, many of them, on the edge of receivership,'' he said. ''We rely on property taxes. The silent scream that is happening out there is this continued foreclosure crisis. The unemployment rate is unacceptably high. But the foreclosure rate is outlandish. We rely on those property taxes, and they are in steep decline.''
Lansing's property values have declined by $1.4 billion since the market peaked in 2007, and tax collections are coming in lower. After voters rejected a proposal to raise the tax rate this year, Mayor Bernero moved to make the first major cuts to the city's police and fire departments: 44 police officers and 44 firefighters face layoffs at the end of the month if no deal is reached with the unions, and the city will lose two of its eight fire houses. ''I'm providing 2011 services with a 2001 budget,'' the mayor said, adding that even the high cost of gas is a strain.
Providence saw more than $3 billion of its property values evaporate after its last revaluation. Now the struggling city is raising its property tax rate, forcing homeowners to pay more taxes on homes that are worth less money. It is also laying off 78 of its 468 police officers at the end of this month if the union fails to make concessions, laying off teachers and closing six schools to save money. ''We're on a precipice,'' its mayor, Angel Taveras, said in an interview here. ''And we can go over it. I'm doing everything I can to make sure that doesn't happen.''
In Atlanta, where property tax collections have fallen from $209.5 million in 2010 to an estimated $179 million in the coming fiscal year, Mayor Kasim Reed is pushing the City Council to take the extremely rare step this month of reducing the pensions of current employees. The pensions were sweetened several times over the last decade -- always in election years, Mayor Reed noted -- and are now underfinanced. ''The money is not there,'' he said in a phone interview.
And here in Baltimore, property values have been falling for the last two years, and are expected to continue. Because of complicated formulas that phase in the increase of property taxes when values rise, the city still expects to collect a little more this year than last year. But next year officials expect revenues to fall for the first time in recent history. The city has resorted to ''rolling brownouts'' that close three fire stations each day, furloughs that keep city workers home for several days each year and cuts to its pensions, among other things.
The news is not all grim. Some cities are beginning to restore some of the harshest cuts they made earlier in the downturn. San Diego is ending its rolling brownouts of fire stations. And Colorado Springs, which turned off a third of its streetlights last year to save money, has turned the lights back on.
But with the end of the stimulus, and with cuts to the federal Community Development Block Grants program worrying many mayors, some seemed to look at one of the conference's newest members, Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, who was President Obama's chief of staff, as a potentially powerful ally.
At a news conference, Mayor Villaraigosa of Los Angeles joked that Mr. Emanuel had ''a key to the front door, and the back door, of the White House.''
''I'm not giving it up!'' Mr. Emanuel responded.
''You don't have to give it up!'' Mr. Villaraigosa said. ''Just let the rest of us in.''

HEADLINE: Sprint in Deal With Troubled Wireless Broadband Venture

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED. 
Floyd Norris, whose Off the Charts column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.

 BODY:
8:46 p.m. Updated
LightSquared, the wireless broadband venture controlled by the billionaire hedge fund manager Philip A. Falcone, has reached a 15-year agreement to jointly develop and operate a 4G network with Sprint Nextel, a reprieve for a company that has come under fire recently for its wireless ambitions.
The roughly $15 billion deal would allow LightSquared to piggyback on Sprint's network instead of having to build its own, according to a letter Mr. Falcone sent to investors in his hedge fund, Harbinger Capital Partners. For Sprint, the deal gives it a partner to bear the cost of an expensive build-out and gives it access to LightSquared's high-speed wireless service. The exact terms of the deal are still unclear. 
Mr. Falcone has been under pressure on multiple fronts. Most recently, his company has been facing down concerns that its wireless venture will interfere with GPS signals, a condition that could pose problems for technologies as diverse as medical services and car systems.
A report by LightSquared on the extent of the potential interference has been delayed until July 1, but the looming issue had raised questions about the viability of Mr. Falcone's venture, which cannot move forward under its current plans until the conflict is resolved. A spokesman for Mr. Falcone declined to comment.
Mr. Falcone, 48, rose to prominence in 2007 when his hedge fund placed a major bet against the subprime mortgage market that made him an instant billionaire. Known as a tough investor, Mr. Falcone built his reputation by buying up shares in troubled companies and finding creative ways to turn them around. But in recent years, Harbinger's large ownership stake in LightSquared has frightened his investors.
Indeed, the wireless venture was the latest in a long line of actions that Mr. Falcone had taken that alienated Harbinger investors. His funds were down heavily during the financial crisis, and he refused to let clients pull out their money for fear of selling assets into a falling market. But during that same period, Mr. Falcone borrowed $113 million from one of his funds to pay a tax bill, prompting regulators to take a closer look at him and Harbinger.
Problems have grown worse for Mr. Falcone since then, as investors have withdrawn their money in droves and the size of his bet in LightSquared has swelled.
Mr. Falcone caught the attention of Washington lawmakers, who raised questions about why LightSquared was given a rare waiver by the Federal Communications Commission on the company's operations. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, sent a letter to the F.C.C. requesting copies of all communications between the agency and Mr. Falcone and his companies.
The confrontation with GPS users has been the most recent hurdle for Mr. Falcone's grand ambition, which is to create a broadband provider to help relieve the country's overloaded wireless networks. Some have raised questions about the viability of any deal struck between the company and Sprint, given the uncertainty over the GPS issue.
Analysts figure that in addition to the GPS question, Mr. Falcone must raise billions of dollars more to pay for whatever deal he has worked out with Sprint to build the network they would share. LightSquared must also find customers and clean up some patches of its spectrum, or wireless capacity.
The deal, which was reported earlier by Bloomberg News, includes an upfront cash payment to Sprint as well as caveats should the GPS issue prove damaging to LightSquared's ambitions, according to a person who has been briefed on the terms.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For Want of One-Word Tweak, Arizona Jobless Lose Benefits

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
One word, just one little word.
That's all that Frank Ballesteros, a 62-year-old desperate for work, needs to stay afloat. The word is not ''hope'' or ''God'' or ''patience.'' It is, improbably, ''three.''
Arizona's legislature has resisted making a small word change, from ''two'' to ''three,'' in its statutes. Only if it does will Mr. Ballesteros continue to receive jobless benefits through November, allowing him to pay his mortgage and medical bills.
Otherwise, his checks stop next week. 
''It is almost 100 degrees out there, and I am walking door to door handing out resumes,'' said Mr. Ballesteros, who worked for 21 years at a nonprofit group in Tucson before getting laid off when funding dried up. ''Now Arizona decided to kill the benefits extension from the federal government because some legislator decided we're just sitting around on our butts waiting for a check.''
That last extension of unemployment benefits -- typically received in weeks 80 through 99 of unemployment -- is paid for entirely with federal money and does not affect state budgets. But because of ideological opposition and other legislative priorities, Arizona and a handful of other states, like Wisconsin and Alaska, have not made the one-word change necessary to keep the program going.
Right now about 640,000 jobless Americans are receiving this last tier of benefits, according to the National Employment Law Project. The money, appropriated in the 2009 federal stimulus package, was initially intended for states with jobless rates higher than they were two years earlier. Since the recovery has been much slower than predicted, though, Congress decided last December to allow states to continue receiving the money if their unemployment rates were higher than they were three years earlier. States simply needed to change ''two'' to ''three'' in the relevant state law.
Some economists say that cutting off the long-term unemployed from extended federal assistance could backfire by putting further strain on state economies instead. Indeed, most states were quick to make the one-word change, counting on the federal money not only to support ailing families but also to serve as a strong stimulus (jobless benefits are normally spent more quickly than, say, tax refunds). Nearly every state -- Arizona included -- had opted into the extended benefits program when it was introduced.
But now Arizona is reluctant. When Gov. Jan Brewer called a special session to address the issue last week, legislators didn't introduce a bill. Republican legislators said they would consider the change only if it were packaged with other provisions, including tax cuts and stricter rules for receiving unemployment benefits in the first place.
''We prefer to look for long-term solutions so when the Obama administration money runs out Arizonans will have jobs,'' said Andy Tobin, the Republican speaker of the house.
Some Arizona lawmakers expressed discomfort with the prospect of accepting more federal money.
''This is not free money,'' said Al Melvin, a Republican state senator representing Tucson. ''This is America's money. We have a $14 trillion debt that has to be paid, and we need to stop spending money we don't have.''
The last tier of federal benefits injects about $2.3 million a week into Arizona, and Mr. Melvin says he believes ''every dollar's important.''
Arizona's deadline for continuing the federal benefits passed on June 11, though they could be reinstated retroactively. In the meantime, 15,000 workers have stopped receiving checks, and 30,000 more will most likely lose out on these benefits later this year, said Matthew Benson, a spokesman for Governor Brewer.
Mr. Ballesteros, who is on his 78th week of unemployment, is one of those workers. He receives $240 a week in benefits, or about $5 an hour for a full-time worker.
''These politicians just don't realize how important that one $240 check is,'' he said.
When he worked at a nonprofit managing a microloan program, Mr. Ballesteros earned $73,000 annually; now, he says, he is getting rejected -- or worse, ignored -- by employers who pay minimum wage.
''A grocery store here announced it had 100 positions available, and then they had 1,500 applying for the job,'' he said. ''I got there about 4:30 that first day but by that time it was too late. They told me they'd call me. That was a month ago.''
Five states -- Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana and Utah -- never accepted these federally funded benefits. Of those that did, some fought for months over whether to extend the program before finally acting as the deadline approached, including Florida, Pennsylvania and Nevada just this week. In North Carolina, the governor issued an executive order forcing the change after a long standoff with legislators.
Besides Arizona, two other states have not yet made the one-word change required to continue receiving the money. In Wisconsin, for example, the advisory council that refers bills on unemployment insurance to the state legislature has not even taken up the issue. The council comprises representatives from business and labor; the labor side has been too busy fighting back attacks on public unions.
''The management side is not inclined to approve this anyway absent concessions on their part,'' said James Buchen, the lead management representative on the council. ''The real question is whether there is still a need for extended benefits. We are increasingly hearing from people that they are having trouble hiring workers who are on unemployment because they want to wait until their benefits are exhausted.''
In Alaska, the issue has fallen by the wayside as well, and the state's legislature has already adjourned for the year. In separate moves, five states -- Illinois, Michigan, Florida, Arkansas and Missouri, according to the National Employment Law Project -- have cut the first 26 weeks of unemployment benefits, which are paid by the state rather than the federal government. Labor leaders have argued that cutting jobless benefits -- particularly money provided by the federal government -- may be self-defeating.
When the unemployed stop receiving federal money they will cut back on spending, which means less income for local businesses. Many of them may also start relying more heavily on state services like Medicaid and homeless shelters, which are already strained for cash.
''I hate the idea that I'd become indigent if I can't even get unemployment anymore,'' Mr. Ballesteros said, fighting back tears as he described his unpaid medical bills and his struggles to afford his cholesterol medication. ''I'm already afraid to get sick. I don't want to be standing in a stupid line waiting for food, too.''
''I'm physically fit, and there's no reason I don't have another five years in me where I'll be able to work,'' he said. ''For now I just need that stopgap.''

HEADLINE: No Season for Loners: People (and Penguins) Stick Together in Films

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- ''The films of a nation reflect its mentality in a more direct way than other artistic media.''
-- Siegfried Kracauer, ''From Caligari to Hitler.''
''I'm actually part of this weird wolf pack.''
-- Stu Price, ''The Hangover Part II.''
If the season's movies have a message, it doesn't have much to do with the existential heroism of a ''Die Hard,'' or the deep romance of a ''Titanic.'' This year Hollywood is doing a group thing. 
To an extraordinary extent, the major studio films from early May through mid-June have been wrapped around ensembles and the core values and problems of friendship and belonging rather than the more traditional Hollywood themes of the committed loner or the triumph of romance.
In ''X-Men: First Class'' the many heroes fight in tribes -- after sorting themselves out in a bonding bash that would do the characters in ''The Hangover Part II'' proud. The ''Bridesmaids'' are about one another, of course -- never mind the lucky couple who survive the women's antics.
In another collective effort, a brave band of Spielbergian kids confront an alien with their home-movie camera in ''Super 8,'' from the director J. J. Abrams. Next comes ''Mr. Popper's Penguins,'' in which Jim Carrey gets his priorities straight by hanging with a gang of birds.
That a certain clinginess has crept into the blockbuster season owes something to Hollywood's demographic obsession.
It is easier to cover the bases with a mass audience when plot points are spread among characters who are diverse in their ethnicity, sex or, in Mr. Carrey's case, species.
No spring hit has relied on the sort of star power Will Smith brought to ''Hancock'' or Tom Cruise to the ''Mission: Impossible'' series. Johnny Depp was prominent in the advertising for ''Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,'' but the film proved to be an ensemble adventure.
The season's closest approach to a solitary hero is Hal Jordan, the renegade test pilot played by Ryan Reynolds, who becomes the earth's protector in ''Green Lantern,'' which opened on Friday. Jordan wrestles with the memory of a dead parent (as do several other protagonists, including Po in ''Kung Fu Panda 2''), and he goes his own way -- until eventually he connects with a corps of 3,600 Green Lanterns.
Siegfried Kracauer, a scholar, now long deceased, who studied the psychology of pre-Hitler Germany through its popular cinema, would probably find meaning in the wolf-pack ethic of ''The Hangover Part II,'' or in the fact that Thor, hero of Marvel's action film of the same title, bonds with buddies in a bar and depends on an extensive crew of fellow gods and monsters when faced with a challenge.
Stephen Ujlaki, the dean of the Loyola Marymount School of Film and Television here, suspects that economic stress is now pushing people, and their movies, toward a more communal posture.
''There is understandably less focus on one's individual satisfaction and more interest in emphasizing man as the 'social animal,' '' Mr. Ujlaki wrote in an e-mail this week. A number of scholars, he noted, have been examining the notion that the human evolutionary advantage, particularly in tough times, is the collaborative impulse.
The character clusters in our current films are certainly haunted by a yearning for togetherness -- tinged with nostalgia for simpler times, back when gas was cheaper, perhaps, and theme songs by Billy Joel, Wilson Phillips or Salt-n-Pepa were still fresh. ''X-Men: First Class'' ends with two bands of mutants split like Democrats and Republicans, if not Crips and Bloods: Is the plot yearning for a less partisan moment? ''I just wanted things to stay the same,'' says Zach Galifianakis's character in ''The Hangover Part II.'' He might just as easily be speaking for Kristin Wiig in ''Bridesmaids'' or Kate Hudson and Ginnifer Goodwin in ''Something Borrowed'': Like Mater, the buck-toothed tow truck who is temporarily banished from the gang in ''Cars 2,'' these friends are looking in the rearview mirror.
Many of the plots involve banishment and return. That is as true of the hero of ''Thor,'' who is tossed out of Asgard, as of Alan Garner (Mr. Galifianakis) in ''The Hangover'' sequel, who is grudgingly let back into the pack.
Lovers may connect on screen this season, but just barely. By and large, romance disrupts the friendship dynamic -- so Penelope Cruz is left high and dry in ''Pirates,'' as is Natalie Portman in ''Thor.'' But there is still time for food, like the noodle soup of ''Kung Fu Panda 2.'' And plenty of drink, as in ''The Hangover'' sequel and another half-dozen spring-summer films, including ''Bridesmaids'' and ''Something Borrowed.''
In most studio films this season, the value system mimics peer loyalty in a small military unit: When push comes to shove, it's the few of us against all of them.
Authority figures may be as feckless as the doddering King George in ''Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides''; as annoying as the domineering father, Dexter Thaler Sr., in ''Something Borrowed''; or as dangerous as the politicians and generals who set up the Cuban missile crisis in the background of ''X-Men: First Class.''
Here and there, the films stretch toward a political point. In ''Thor,'' ''X-Men'' and even ''Cars 2,'' various characters suffer harsh interrogation. ''We have turned him into an enemy,'' we are told of a rampaging alien who is tormented by the authorities in one of two interrogation scenes in ''Super 8.'' A ''we create terror'' theme also becomes central to ''Green Lantern.''
Another theory suggests that the group impulse isn't nostalgic but technological -- that this year's movies are catching up with an ethos born of our constant immersion in other media.
''The truth is, we're more communal than ever before,'' said Craig Mazin, a writer of ''The Hangover Part II.'' He speculates that social media like Facebook and Twitter may have made viewers more receptive to friendship-driven plotlines.
Scot Armstrong, who also has a writing credit on ''The Hangover Part II,'' cautions that comedy is inherently prone to multiple characters and plotlines.
''I can't speak to that -- I don't know,'' Mr. Armstrong said of the possibility that the movie actually says something about the people who watch it.

HEADLINE: Stopping the Pirates Who Roam the Web

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Internet Piracy and How to Stop It'' (editorial, June 9):
We agree with your conclusion that a bill before Congress, Senator Patrick J. Leahy's Protect IP Act, is necessary legislation aimed at curtailing access to rogue sites based overseas that steal American products. Sadly, the music community knows firsthand the damage caused by these illicit foreign sites.
This bill targets only the worst of the worst sites -- those that have no commercially significant use other than to offer pirated material and for which infringement is central to the activity of the site. This is not YouTube. This is the Pirate Bay, a Web site whose founders were convicted of criminal copyright violations by a Swedish court in 2009. 
The definition is tight and narrow; I disagree with assertions like yours that it is overly broad.
No legislation, including this bill, will eradicate piracy altogether. There will always be dedicated users and businesses with little respect for our copyright laws that will find ways to steal others' works. But what this bill will do is provide some accountability for sites that dupe consumers and pretend to be legal, all while making it harder for the casual fan to steal music easily.
We all agree that something meaningful needs to be done to stop the rampant theft of our products, and this bill is a thoughtful and measured step in the right direction. There's a reason it won unanimous support from the Judiciary Committee, which reflects the broad geographic and ideological range of our nation, and that, of course, is that the bill does in fact strike a terrific balance.
MITCH BAINWOL Chairman and Chief Executive Recording Industry Assn. of America Washington, June 9, 2011
To the Editor:
Your editorial concludes that the Protect IP Act would not effectively combat online piracy but would instead interfere with the inner workings of the Internet. We in the tech industry agree.
As a longtime member of a State Department panel that sees information freedom as a human rights issue, I'm especially concerned about blessing Internet filtering and censorship for seemingly noble reasons.
Serious threats to Internet freedom come not just from intolerable direct assaults like the Internet shutdown in Egypt and Syria, but also from overzealous efforts to address Internet content. Tools to police content, once developed, will be used by other governments to patrol for whatever content they don't like.
Censorship-type restrictions, which chip away at Internet freedom, whether sweeping or incremental, are a dangerous trend. Freedom is relinquished more easily than it is reclaimed.
ED BLACK President and Chief Executive Computer and Communications Industry Association Washington, June 10, 2011
To the Editor:
You are wrong to take shots at legislation cracking down on foreign criminal Web sites that put stolen movies and video online. The Protect IP Act is narrowly crafted, with strong judicial safeguards that promote due process. The tools that would deal with rogue sites are already used today to block spam and viruses.
Content theft hurts everyone except the thieves who profit from it, but it especially hurts the people and businesses who make a living, feed their families and put their kids through school by making magic onscreen. This year alone, eight new TV series will start filming in New York, creating 4,700 jobs, and maybe more in the future. But when rogue Web sites siphon away wages, benefits and investments in new productions, what happens to those jobs?
This bill would protect millions in the creative community by cutting off blatantly criminal rogue sites that steal their hard work. You should stand with them.
SUSAN CLEARY MICHAEL O'LEARY Washington, June 9, 2011
The writers are, respectively, vice president and general counsel of the Independent Film and Television Alliance; and executive vice president of government affairs, Motion Picture Association of America.
To the Editor:
Your editorial suggests that because advanced users will be able to evade some of the technical countermeasures in the Protect IP Act, these provisions should be eliminated. As you acknowledge, allowing Internet service providers to block access to rogue sites by not resolving Web addresses will not stop all piracy. Likewise, locking the doors on your car will not stop all thieves. Yet we still lock our doors.
The point is that the legislation will deter some users from obtaining infringing content, leading to benefits for our economy. With piracy causing billions of dollars of harm every year, every effort counts.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Those taking part in the bipartisan budget talks being led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. have characterized them as civil, constructive and productive. What the discussions have not been to date is decisive.
With time growing short before an Aug. 2 deadline to raise the federal debt limit, Republican and Democratic lawmakers meeting with Mr. Biden behind closed doors are just beginning to weigh the big fiscal trade-offs necessary for a compromise that could clear the way for a Congressional vote.
An accelerated schedule of meetings for next week will test whether the six members of the House and Senate talking with the White House are willing to entertain the serious political concessions and to make the hard choices needed to cut a deal in time. 
In the colorful phrasing of Mr. Biden, the moment has arrived to find out who is willing to trade their side's bicycle for the other side's golf clubs.
''The really tough stuff that is left are the big-ticket items,'' Mr. Biden said Thursday at the conclusion of the week's third bargaining session, meetings that took lawmakers and administration officials to every corner of the federal budget in a search for consensus on ways to save federal dollars.
Lawmakers and aides say the negotiators quickly gobbled up low-hanging fruit like trimming agriculture subsidies and selling more of the telecommunications spectrum to generate revenue. There is a general consensus that federal workers are going to have to contribute more to their pensions, though the details are still to be determined. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will collect higher fees from stable companies, and some idle federal property could be up for sale.
But those actions are not going to produce anywhere near the $2 trillion or more in savings that both sides agree is the level required to win a debt limit increase while putting the government on course to save $4 trillion over the next decade -- a goal set by Mr. Biden.
To get there, negotiators are going to have to make some excruciating choices about federal health care and safety-net programs, as well as the tax structure. At the same time, they need to reach a deal that not only can be sold to a bipartisan majority in the House and Senate, but also is credible enough to assure investors worldwide that Washington is getting serious about taking care of its financial health.
Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee and a participant in the talks, said one reason for setting three-hour meetings four times next week is to gauge whether he and his fellow budget bargainers can ever come to terms.
''We are picking up the pace in a big way, recognizing that we've got to determine whether we can reach agreement in principle or recognize that we are not able to bridge our differences,'' he said.
Watching the clock, Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, on Friday called on the negotiators to keep working through the Fourth of July recess if necessary.
To Democrats, a major impediment is the Republican position against relying on any significant new revenues as part of the deal, insisting that most of the $2 trillion or more come from cuts in federal spending -- although not from Pentagon spending, a major potential source of savings.
Democrats say they will never be able to sell a compromise without some new revenue to their colleagues in the House and Senate. They say the most affluent Americans should contribute to the debt limit deal through new taxes on hedge fund operators or by phasing out tax deductions for those at the highest levels of earnings.
But Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader who is representing House Republicans in the talks, on Thursday reiterated the deep Republican opposition to higher taxes.
''Our side will not support any attempt to raise the debt ceiling that is not accompanied by the kinds of cuts necessary or reforms necessary,'' he said. ''Nor will we support an attempt to raise the debt limit that raises people's taxes. That, we don't want to do.''
Republicans want to see Democrats embrace more changes in Medicare and Medicaid, the federal health programs for older Americans and the poor.
Democrats have so far pushed for modest changes like allowing the government to negotiate prescription prices with drug companies and to require drug industry rebates for people eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid -- a proposal that could potentially generate tens of billions of dollars. But Democrats will not support any major Medicare overhaul, saying they believe that they have the political high ground on the issue at the moment.
To get a deal, lawmakers on both sides are going to have to bend considerably and back unpopular positions. They are then going to have to sell the plan to their rank and file on the grounds that they need to avert the economic disarray that could result from a failure to raise the debt ceiling.
Both sides say that all those in the talks want to reach a compromise. ''There is no principal in that room that doesn't want to get agreement,'' Mr. Biden said.
Yet that is no guarantee that the deal will be done.
''I'm confident,'' said Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, another top Democrat in the talks. ''But I've been confident before and come up short.''

HEADLINE: Medvedev Distances Himself From Putin, a Little at a Time

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
ST. PETERSBURG, Russia -- With the country's next presidential election scheduled for March, the incumbent, Dmitri A. Medvedev, complicated the riddle at the center of Russian politics by delivering a speech on Friday that implied criticism of his predecessor and presumed rival for the job, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin.
In the speech, an address to foreign investors and heads of state at an economic forum here, Mr. Medvedev warned of a new era of stagnation if the state continued to control the Russian economy. And he spoke, as he has before, of the inherent risks in a political system built around one man's personality. 
''We should say goodbye to bad habits,'' Mr. Medvedev said after describing government meddling in the economy when Mr. Putin was president from 2000 until 2008. He did not, however, mention Mr. Putin by name.
Throughout the speech, Mr. Medvedev veered repeatedly toward staking out an independent position, but would pull back before making explicit any substantive disagreement with Mr. Putin.
Investors like those in attendance on Friday carefully parse Mr. Medvedev's public comments for just this type of delicate positioning, because he is seen as occupying a politically precarious spot this summer.
To emerge from Mr. Putin's shadow and become a credible candidate in the eyes of urban middle-class voters, his core constituency, Mr. Medvedev needs to demonstrate his independence. But he must take care not to appear openly disloyal to the man who is considered the most powerful in Russia.
Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev have said that they will reach an agreement privately on which of them will run for president next year, and Kremlin officials say the announcement will come in September or October.
Mr. Medvedev used the occasion of the economic forum to highlight his credentials as a liberal reformer.
''If everything starts to work on a signal from the Kremlin -- we have all been there, and I know from personal experience -- it means the system is unsustainable and must be organized around an individual,'' he said. ''This is bad. It means the system should be changed.''
Remarking on the practice of state companies bulking up on assets, which was common during Mr. Putin's presidency, Mr. Medvedev said, ''There could be another stagnation hiding behind the so-called stability.''
''Private entrepreneurs should rule the Russian economy,'' he said, adding, ''Economies are like parachutes: they only work when they are open.''
Internal Kremlin politics have seeped into the public sphere several times this year, often in the form of Mr. Medvedev responding to comments by Mr. Putin with a retort so mild that it might go unnoticed in other countries, but is seized on here as important.
Daniel Treisman, a political science professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, described Mr. Medvedev's maneuverings as ''a passive-aggressive verbal strategy'' for expressing his political views.
The divergence in their public positions also suggests that they are trying to appeal to different audiences, Mr. Treisman said. Mr. Medvedev is more popular with Western leaders and foreign investors of the type attending the economic forum, where the president traditionally delivers an economic policy speech.
This year, the message seemed mostly that Mr. Medvedev disagreed with Mr. Putin on economic policy. ''Medvedev hints he is very upset about something, but nothing ever comes of it,'' Mr. Treisman said.
There are occasional hints of a more substantive breach. This week, the newspaper Vedemosti reported that Mr. Medvedev had fired Aleksei Anichin, a deputy interior minister and one of Russia's most senior police officials. Mr. Anichin was a classmate of Mr. Putin's.
The Russian government is trying to sell $30 billion worth of shares in state companies that it intends to privatize. The chief executives of Citigroup and Bank of America, Vikram S. Pandit and Brian T. Moynihan, were among those in St. Petersburg this week to discuss the opportunities. Speaking of his economic agenda, Mr. Medvedev said, ''This project should be realized regardless of who occupies which job in our country for the next few years.''
He then offered this riddle: ''I will guarantee this personally, as the president of the state, together with my colleagues.'' It was hard to see how he could do that without winning another term in office.

HEADLINE: Debt Limit Endgame: We fear that damage control may be the best outcome to hope for

 BODY:
The White House has said not to expect any back-nine breakthroughs on the debt limit when President Obama and the House speaker, John Boehner, get together for a game of golf on Saturday. 
Unfortunately, the White House isn't even pushing for the real breakthrough the economy and this debate need. The Republicans, as ever, are playing partisan brinkmanship with no apparent thought to the cost of a protracted standoff.
So what would be a real breakthrough? It would be an agreement to delink the need to raise the debt limit by Aug. 2 from the hard, longer-term work needed to tame the budget deficit.
The limit must be raised so the government can borrow what it needs to meet its obligations; failure to do so would imperil the nation's creditworthiness, causing potentially profound disruptions in already volatile global financial markets. As for Republican demands for steep near-term cuts, that is precisely what the economy, which has been weakening all year, doesn't need.
Instead of explaining the need for new spending now and deficit reduction as the economy recovers -- and developing a plan for both -- the White House is negotiating what is essentially a big spending-cut package.
Within those parameters, there is no breakthrough to be had. There is only damage control.
That means getting a deal that does not worsen the economy and that does not lock in such deep spending cuts that Republicans feel no pressure to accept tax increases in a future budget deal.
So what is the minimum the White House must insist on? A deal will probably include caps on discretionary spending, with agreed-upon targets for debt and deficit levels in years to come. Any spending cuts must be phased in gradually, so they don't hit the economy just as federal stimulus is ending and as states are cutting back to balance their own budgets. Even a phased-in package has to exempt the most vulnerable Americans, like poor women and children who depend on federal aid for food and shelter. That will require careful tailoring of any discretionary spending cap to protect poverty programs. It will also require avoiding a cap that would imperil safety-net entitlements, like food stamps.
The White House must also demand real concessions from the Republican leadership. At the least, that would include extending federal unemployment benefits beyond their expiration at year-end. In addition, the deal must have an enforcement mechanism that keeps both sides honest. If agreed-upon debt and deficit targets are not met, both spending cuts and tax increases must kick in.
Republicans, clinging to their no-new-taxes-ever ideology, would prefer a trigger that causes only spending cuts. But last week, 33 Senate Republicans signaled that they might be open to new tax revenues when they voted to end a $6 billion annual ethanol subsidy. That's not much in a $3.5 trillion budget, but it suggests that at least some members of the party have figured out that there is no way to tackle the deficit without more revenue.
Finally, because Americans need their lawmakers to focus on bigger problems, like job creation, a deal should extend the debt limit for at least two more years, beyond the next election. Maybe by then, a serious budget summit -- without posturing and brinkmanship -- will take the place of a golf summit.

HEADLINE: Cup Upset Was Strange, Not Inexplicable

BYLINE: JEFF Z. KLEIN and STU HACKEL


HIGHLIGHT: The underdog Bruins' domination of the Stanley Cup finals owed much to their scrappy physical play in the most rancorous series in decades.

 BODY:
The Stanley Cup finals that ended Wednesday were among the strangest ever, apart from what happened in the streets of Vancouver afterward.
The Canucks were favored, having won the regular-season title with the league's most productive offense, its most efficient defense, very good goaltending by Roberto Luongo and excellent special teams. After a big scare in the first round against their bete noire, Chicago, they won 8 of their next 11 games to get to the finals.
Yet Boston wound up outscoring them by 23-8 (and by 21-4 in the last five games). The Bruins' 15-goal advantage was the biggest for any best-of-seven finals in N.H.L. history. The previous record was the 13 by which the 1970 Bruins beat St. Louis - in a sweep.
The dimensions of the Bruins' victory over the Canucks were those of a runaway sweep, not a seven-game marathon. Vancouver scored the fewest goals by a team in a seven-game series, and during the 420 minutes 11 seconds of play, the Canucks led for only 32:32, less than 8 percent of the time.
How did that happen?
The scrappy Bruins, backstopped by the game's top goalie, Tim Thomas, planned to physically confront Vancouver, especially its mobile defensemen and the high-scoring Sedin twins, Daniel and Henrik. The Canucks, with players like Alexandre Burrows, who bit the finger of Patrice Bergeron in Game 1, gladly took up the challenge.
One result was the most rancorous Cup finals in a couple of decades. It was less about the best hockey of the year and more about biting, taunting, slashing, cheap shots, late shots, high-sticking, slew-footing, diving, embellishing, brawling, trash-talking and name-calling. Pushing and shoving after the whistle became the norm, and by the end, the teams had combined for 342 penalty minutes, the most in the Cup finals since 1986.
Before Game 7, the TSN analyst Bob McKenzie called the series "Revenge of the Twerps," noting that the two best skaters for each team through the first six games were superpests, Boston's Brad Marchand and Vancouver's Maxim Lapierre.
Although they won the first two games at home, the Canucks' fortunes went downhill immediately. They lost defenseman Dan Hamhuis in Game 1 after he injured himself by flipping Boston's Milan Lucic over his back. Coach Alain Vigneault moved Aaron Rome up the depth chart, but he had trouble with the pace against frontline players.
In Game 3 in Boston, Rome's mistimed check concussed Nathan Horton, earning an ejection and a four-game suspension. For the second time, Vancouver had to play with five defensemen and began to tire, giving Boston too much space, which the Bruins exploited by displaying unexpected skill in an 8-1 victory. Thomas's play early in the game made the outcome possible, and Marchand's short-handed tally broke Vancouver's spirit.
Game 4 was more of the same, with Thomas stopping everything en route to a 4-0 shocker in which Marchand scored and later clotheslined Christian Ehrhoff and lowbridged Daniel Sedin on the same play.
Luongo sparkled in a 1-0 decision as Vancouver took a 3-2 series lead. But returning to Boston, he again turned porous behind additional defensive blunders, and the Bruins won, 5-2. Marchand scored the first goal and later repeatedly punched Daniel Sedin in the head.
In Game 7, the home-ice pattern was broken when Bergeron and Marchand each scored twice in a 4-0 victory, capitalizing on the battered Canucks defense and little response from the Sedins.
The shutout was Thomas's second of the finals, and he set records for most saves in the playoffs and in the finals. It is worth noting that Daniel Sedin took 27 shots in the series, more than any other player, but Thomas, the most valuable player in the postseason, stopped 26 of them.
After Thomas, the best player and most compelling figure was the 5-foot-9 Marchand. His 11 playoff goals, second most for a rookie, and 19 points were essential, but his physical agitation symbolized the temperament of these strange finals.
Thomas finished the finals with a save percentage of .967. His overall save percentage in the playoffs was .940, best among all goalies. And that came on top of his .938 mark during the regular season, an N.H.L. record.
Such sustained excellence may have been made possible by Thomas's relatively light regular-season workload, 57 games. No Stanley Cup-winning goalie in the last seven years has played as many as 63 regular-season games.A City Where Rioting Is Oddly Familiar
Americans reacted with surprise that Vancouver, site of an Olympics featuring huge street parties suffused with good feeling, could descend into the kind of sports rioting seen in recent years in Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, Denver, Boston and Montreal, and at Ohio State, Michigan State and several other universities.
But Vancouverites are all too aware of their city's history of rioting, and not only over lost hockey games.
In addition to Wednesday's chaos and the 1994 Stanley Cup mayhem after the Canucks lost Game 7 to the Rangers, the police and protesters clashed during a 1997 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference and in 1998 over a visit by Jean Chretien, then prime minister of Canada.
In 2002, fans made a commotion when Axl Rose did not show up for a Guns N' Roses concert, rioting after a Rolling Stones concert in 1972 and so on going back through the years.
"It's terrible," Henrik Sedin, the Canucks' captain, said after Game 7.
The next morning, hundreds of volunteers cleaned up broken glass downtown, and the Vancouver police were receiving thousands of tips identifying the rioters.

HIGHLIGHT: Rewriting the past to lose the future.

 BODY:
OK, starting to clue back in, although not arriving in Cambridge until tomorrow.
What strikes me most, reading the current discussion of economic policy, is the extraordinary extent to which the Serious position depends on sending what actually happened over the past few years down the memory hole.
In the United States, we learn that Barney Frank was responsible for the housing bubble and the financial crisis. Who knew that a member of the minority party in the House, at a time when Republicans not only ruled the House with an iron fist but also controlled the White House, had such power?
In Europe, the new president of the Bundesbank tells us that
The current crisis is no crisis of the euro. It is a sovereign debt crisis of individual, smaller countries in the euro area, which is caused not least by the disregard of the rules. 
which you can see clearly in the case of Ireland and Spain below:

HEADLINE: The Other Major Anderson

BYLINE: LOIS LEVEEN


HIGHLIGHT: Joseph Reid Anderson was the South's most influential industrialist.

 BODY:
Robert Anderson and Joseph Reid Anderson had more in common than a surname. Though not kin, both men were Southerners by birth and educated in the North, at West Point. The two even dined together in early 1861 at Fort Sumter, where Robert Anderson led the Union forces under seige. But when Robert Anderson and his men came under fire a few weeks later, the first shell was launched from a mortar manufactured by Joseph Anderson, the man who came to be known as the "Ironmaker of the Confederacy." 
Joseph Reid Anderson first joined the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, Va., at age 28 as the company's commercial agent, eventually leasing and then purchasing the expanding plant. Ideally situated between the James River and Kanawha Canal, the foundry grew under Anderson's direction to supply the military and Southern states with ordnance, ships, locomotives, rail bridges and machinery. The firm also produced mills and engines of various sorts for individual plantations. 
When the secession crisis broke out, the pro-slavery, pro-South Anderson hoped Tredegar could prove to be one of the Confederacy's most valuable assets. But that would only happen if Virginia seceded, which as late as the beginning of April, it seemed unlikely to do. In the months leading up to and the hectic hours and days following the firing on Sumter, he joined the pro-secession partisans in pushing his state to leave the Union. But Anderson's efforts to profit from secession undercut conventional ideas about the role of the free market in Southern life.
With labor, raw materials and markets for ironmaking concentrated in the Northeast, Tredegar was a regional anomaly, the only factory of its scale in the region. More than a decade earlier, Anderson had begun marketing his products aggressively throughout the South; weekly ads in one Charleston newspaper stressed Tredegar's value as a "Southern Iron Works" that "Employed Slave Labor." The values were pro-slavery and pro-South, but the underlying message was to drum up business.
For Anderson, politics and profit were always intermingled. Throughout the 1840s and '50s, he lobbied for protective tariffs to benefit Virginia ironmaking. Through much of his tenure at Tredegar, he served first on Richmond's city council and then in Virginia's state legislature. He began as a Whig, but joined the Democratic Party in 1856, afraid that Whigs would not protect Southern economic interests, especially slavery. 
But Anderson's business interests and political beliefs didn't always align. In the aftermath of John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, Anderson vowed not to favor any Northern suppliers with his hard-earned capital - until it became clear that Tredegar's unending need for machinery, raw materials and labor gave him little choice over whether to continue to patronize Northern sources. And despite publicly extolling his own use of "slave labor," Anderson found he could not do without skilled white workers, even though they challenged his otherwise tight control over the factory. Many of them were Northern- or foreign-born, with Irish puddlers, Welsh heaters and English rollers supported by German and Irish workers in unskilled positions. 
Nor was the use of slave labor as idyllic as Anderson's rhetoric suggested. Although Anderson and his partners owned a portion of the slaves working at Tredegar, as was typical in urban Richmond the majority of the slave laborers were hired out from other owners, mostly from eastern Virginia, where overworked plantations had little use for their extensive holdings of human chattel. As was true in other Richmond factories, skilled slave laborers could earn bonuses for working overtime or exceeding piecework requirements. But unlike other hired-out slaves in Richmond, slaves at Tredegar were boarded, lodged, clothed and given medical care on site, rendering the ironworks a sort of industrial urban plantation and leaving the slaves with far less freedom of movement than many other slaves in the Virginia capital.
Even with these tighter restrictions, slave labor didn't prove as lucrative as Anderson hoped. The number of slaves working at Tredegar spiked after an 1847 strike by white workers, going from 41 to 117 in a year, but it declined in the decade that followed. From 1850 to 1860, as the number of white workers tripled from 250 to 750, the number of slaves declined by 20 percent, from 100 to 80. Whatever Anderson wanted to believe about the benefits of slave labor, as a businessman he couldn't ignore its cost. The more successful slave trading - still Richmond's most lucrative business - became, the more expensive it was to hire out slaves, especially skilled laborers. 
Although Tredegar was not immune to the financial panic that rocked Southern markets and industries following Lincoln's election, Anderson successfully capitalized on political events in a campaign of solicitations to seceding Southern governors, who were rapidly arming themselves. By mid-January Tredegar was sending shot, shell and powder to South Carolina, along with 10-inch mortars. Newspapers as far away as New York reporting on the "[o]ne thousand kegs of powder and twenty thousand pounds of shot and shell" in the ironworks' first shipment to Charleston. Within a week, Tredegar was making nearly daily shipments to South Carolina, and by April 9, Charleston had received 11,516 rounds of cannon and mortar ammunition from Anderson's factory, along with seven mortars and three Dahlgren guns. 
In late February, Anderson personally accompanied a trainload of munitions to the city. In addition to negotiating new contracts for additional ammunition, he inspected weapons cast at Tredegar over the previous decade, positioned for anticipated action in Charleston's harbor. He also observed the object of their potential assault when he rowed out to Fort Sumter to visit his West Point artillery instructor, Maj. Robert Anderson. Abner Doubleday was horrified that the Virginia ironmaker "stated without reserve the object of his trip to the South," upon which disclosure "he met with a most cordial reception, was invited to stay to dinner, and when he left he was dismissed with a 'Good-bye! God bless you!'" from Major Anderson. 
Some might have thought Joseph Reid Anderson blessed indeed, as he continued on his six-week sales trip through the South, contracting with the Confederate States of America to provide columbiads, naval cannon and ammunition for the impending conflict. In correspondence following Lincoln's election and into the opening months of 1861, Anderson repeatedly stated his belief that Virginia would stand with her sister states of the South; his business dealings with those states might seem to underscore his commitment to their cause. 
During the same period, however, he continued to do business with the North, seeking raw materials, machinery, expertise and even opportunities to subcontract work Tredegar was doing for the state of Virginia - he even solicited new orders from the federal government. During December 1860 and the opening months of 1861, Anderson repeatedly sold gun metal, shot and shells from Tredegar to the Union government - even as he was eagerly arming South Carolina. 
Anderson returned to Richmond from his tour of the Confederate States just weeks before the first Tredegar-made guns were fired on Fort Sumter. When news of the battle reached the Virginia capital on Saturday, April 13, Anderson, eager to harness public excitement, hired the State Armory band and led a procession along Main Street to Tredegar, where his employees raised a Confederate flag above the works as a crowd of 3,000 cheered to "La Marseillaise" and "Dixie." Tredegar workers fired off a salute, on a cannon they had cast for the Confederate government; they fired seven rounds - one for each state in the Confederacy - and then a final, louder, hopeful round for Virginia.
But secession, which came a week later, was a mixed blessing for Tredegar. Anderson's perennial labor woes worsened upon secession, even as demand for its products accelerated. Many Northern- and foreign-born workers soon left the city, the remaining Irish workers at Tredegar struck for higher wages a few months later, and the most dedicated of Southern employees enlisted to fight on behalf of the Confederacy. 
Anderson and his partners attempted to have a number of their former workers discharged from Virginia forces back to the ironworks; they hoped to stanch further departures by forming a Tredegar Battalion. These four companies - limited to infantry because Virginia refused to assume the cost of supplying the Tredegar Battalion with cannons - served under the command of newly minted Maj. Joseph Reid Anderson, and by design they saw little military action, until Richmond was in desperate need of defense in the final year of the war. 
Yet even Anderson himself could not resist the call to arms he'd helped ensure Virginia would issue, and in the summer of 1861, he requested a full-time military appointment from the Confederacy, which Jefferson Davis himself granted. But Anderson, shaped more by his years in business than his education at West Point, resigned his military commission after serving less than a year, to return to supervising Tredegar. 
Anderson's business acumen served the Confederacy well - Tredegar produced over 1,000 cannons during the war, along with additional munitions and railroad supplies - and himself even better. Anderson was among a handful of Richmond business leaders who met with Abraham Lincoln when the president visited the captured Confederate capital on April 4, 1865, and in the following months he met repeatedly with President Johnson as well, successfully winning a pardon and thereby avoiding confiscation of his property. 
His beloved Confederacy may have lost the war, but Anderson saved Tredegar, which continued production throughout the 20th century, supplying the military with munitions during the Spanish-American War, both world wars and the Korean War. Today, the restored buildings of the Southern iron works that employed slave labor house the American Civil War Center, described as "the nation's first museum to interpret the Civil War from Union, Confederate and African American perspectives."

HEADLINE: Poverty and Politics in Mauritania

BYLINE: NOREEN CONNOLLY


HIGHLIGHT: Noreen Connolly, one of two "Win-a-Trip with Nicholas Kristof" winners, writes about interviewing a Mauritanian activist who is not afraid of Al Qaeda, which has a strong presence in the country.

 BODY:
Saumya Dave, a student, and Noreen Connolly, a teacher, are the 2011 "Win-A-Trip" winners and are currently traveling with Nick through parts of North and West Africa. Noreen's first post is from Mauritania. 
When weeks before we were to leave for Africa I filled out my visa form for Mauritania, I was told to write that the purpose of the trip was "to accompany journalist Nicholas Kristof as he reports on Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) and interviews local politicians and leaders." I was a little taken aback. I had thought we would be visiting only schools and health clinics. The Arab Spring changed things. 
I have to admit the prospect of talking to people about Al-Qaeda in a place where its members actually hung out was mildly unnerving. So when I joined Nick, Saumya and Thomas in a corner of the lobby of the Tfeila Hotel In Nouakchott, Mauritania, to interview the writer and commentator Abderrahmane Weddady, I wasn't sure what to expect of him or myself.
Our first morning in Mauritania, we all sat around a small coffee table with Nick directly opposite a maybe 40ish bearded man with wavy dark hair, sparkly eyes and a short beard. Over his street clothes he wore a soft blue cloak with some gold applique at the neck, a boubou, the traditional dress of Mauritanian men. I was the last to arrive and he stood to greet me - shook my hand vigorously - and smiled widely. I was immediately taken with him. He was smart, voluble and compassionate. And he loved Mauritania. 
Unlike me - and probably many other Americans - he wasn't afraid of Al-Qaeda. It's not that he particularly liked the organization but he understood its members and where they were coming from. He could explain why Al-Qaeda has been able to recruit hundreds of young Mauritanians and even defeat the Mauritanian army when it was ordered into Mali to fight against them.
Mauritania, he told us, has an unemployment rate of 40 percent. In his own clan of more than 300 people, only four are working. It is one of the poorest countries in the world. The new president is out of touch - talks about the threat of Al-Qaeda but not about the loss of hope among his people, especially the young people. 
There were some anti-government protests this spring but Abderrahmane told us that they stopped in late May. He laughed and said, "People are waiting for a coup - again," adding that a coup d'etat is the most frequent way the government changes here. There had been a few years of real hope for change during the last administration, but now with a new president, himself the beneficiary of a coup and of the ubiquitous corruption, citizens have again become dispirited. 
Ninety percent of AQIM are young Mauritanians. They are young men without hope, so now they sign up to fight with AQIM. I've heard this explanation of the attraction of Al-Qaeda before, but never so eloquently and passionately stated from such an optimistic and delightful person, who lives right in AQIM's backyard.
Terrorism was not all we talked about. Lighting a second cigarette and apologizing for his English (which was completely understandable if a little odd grammatically) he launched into a spirited explanation of Berber culture, the long commercial history of Mauritania and its age-old respect for its women. 
He loves Mauritania -- he does not want to live any place else -- and believes that if democracy can eventually succeed here, Al-Qaeda will disappear. 
Later that morning as I left the hotel to take a walk around the deserted, sandy streets that were full of mangy dogs and empty shops, I thought about Abderrahmane, his beautiful blue cloak and his joyful, energetic optimism about Mauritania. Al-Qaeda seemed a lot less scary.

 BODY:
SEPARATED BY THEIR SEX
Women in Public and Private in the Colonial Atlantic World
By Mary Beth Norton
Illustrated. 247 pp. Cornell University Press. $29.95.
I wonder how today's advice columnists might handle a query John Dunton received in 1691. A London printer and bookseller, Dunton was the great-granddaddy of all agony aunts and uncles. He had offered to answer questions from readers of his periodical, The Athenian Mercury. Someone asked him what a man should do if his mother and his sweetheart were in equal peril at the same time. Which one should he save? Dunton suggested that ''we esteem it more generous, were it possible, to die himself than lose either.'' Gallant Mr. Dunton appears nearly halfway through Mary Beth Norton's suggestive if idiosyncratic new book, ''Separated by Their Sex.'' He is a villain in the story, since Norton assigns him the role of defining women as suited to the soft glories of home life and men as strivers in the public world. His chivalry was part of a larger effort to keep the ''fair sex'' away from political power. Or so it seems. 
Norton, the Mary Donlon Alger professor of history at Cornell, contends that in or about the years between 1640 to 1760 men were increasingly viewed as public beings and women as private ones. Her book presents case studies (in five chapters and four interludes) from both sides of the English-speaking Atlantic world to argue for a fundamental shift in definitions of political capacity. At first, status mattered more than gender. That ''before'' picture was wonderful for female aristocrats. They could sometimes vote, and they intervened in political affairs early and often. In Norton's first chapter, for example, Lady Frances Berkeley, the wife of Virginia's governor in the late 17th century, insults three of her husband's opponents by sending the public hangman to wait upon them, as if they were criminals who deserved no better servant. But by the end of the book, even female aristocrats had been shooed home and their views of public affairs reduced to tea-/table gossip. Politics was now a masculine /preserve.
Norton analyzes tightening verbal associations -- ''public'' equals men and ''private'' equals women -- in several kinds of writing. These include published literature that told men and women how to behave, as with Dunton's Mercury. She also dissects unpublished writings that showed some acceptance of the changing behavioral norms, as in two interludes that examine the diary of the American colonist Sarah Kemble Knight (part of the ''before'' picture) and the correspondence of Hester Granville Pitt, Lady Chatham (''after'').
The materials are rich, but most historians will be surprised that Norton goes after them with the equivalent of a power tool that has lost its edge. The idea of separate spheres for men and women has been a point of analysis, if not contention, for at least a generation of women's historians. Many scholars have concluded that any notion of a complete separation is misleading, because exceptions and crossovers were so frequent. For that reason, it is hard to tell whether Norton is right. Her cases may match her analysis, but are they the only ones that existed?
Moreover, Norton characterizes her book as descriptive -- it explains what happened, but not why. That weakens its impact. Near the book's end, she lists several factors that might have encouraged the separation of the sexes: /changes in political ideas, commercialization of economic relations and new theories about male and female bodies. But given her emphasis on language, it is not clear why she offhandedly lumps the topic of political thought in with economics and medical science. Shouldn't the language of political ideology have been what she explored and defended? The timidity of the summary doesn't match an otherwise bold book.

HEADLINE: Culinary School Thrives, but Neighbors Stay Poor

BYLINE: By KARI LYDERSEN. 
klydersen@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
After graduating from the Washburne Culinary Institute at City Colleges of Chicago in 2009, Clarence Robinson was determined to start his own restaurant.
Mr. Robinson lives in Englewood, where Washburne opened three years ago to anchor the neighborhood and to provide career training for low-income residents. But Mr. Robinson, whose car was stolen outside Washburne as he filled out paperwork for his diploma, knew that Englewood was not a viable place to open his business.
That impoverished South Side neighborhood is losing residents, and ''people have no jobs -- going to a restaurant is the last thing on their mind,'' Mr. Robinson said. ''The gas and light bills come before a Philly cheese steak.'' 
He also knew that outsiders were unlikely to patronize a restaurant in Englewood because of the area's high crime rate. ''It's still a pretty rough area; the type of people I wanted to attract were the type who wouldn't go to Englewood at this moment,'' Mr. Robinson said.
So last month he opened Reecee's Cafe next to the Morse Avenue L stop in Rogers Park, on the far North Side. The casual atmosphere -- hand-drawn Magic Marker signs in the windows, simple glass-topped tables, a big chalkboard menu -- belie the ambitions of dishes like wild mushroom chowder and Mr. Robinson's signature Philly cheese steak with Mornay sauce made from fresh bechamel and local cheese.
Investing in Englewood and providing job opportunities for low-income residents were the reasons William Reynolds, the Washburne provost, left his job as vice president for continuing education at the prestigious Culinary Institute of America to open Washburne on Kennedy-King College's new campus.
Originally a trade school, Washburne started its culinary program in 1937 on the Southwest Side. In the late 1990s, city officials sought to revitalize it as part of City Colleges and hired the Culinary Institute of America as a consultant. The institute, in upstate New York, was also looking to open a campus in Chicago and sent Mr. Reynolds, with a partnership in mind. Mr. Reynolds said he found a dilapidated school ''with about 40 cooking students and 4 welding students.''
''The kitchen was in such bad shape -- burners didn't work, pots and pans didn't have flat bottoms because they were so overused,'' he said. ''But what amazed me was nobody was complaining. Here I was working at C.I.A., where they have the best of everything, and the students were always complaining. Washburne staff had somehow built a mystique that not having all you need makes you stronger.''
The culinary institute ultimately decided against the satellite campus. But Mr. Reynolds was intrigued by the idea of an affordable inner-city cooking school. When City Colleges offered him a job as Washburne's provost, he accepted.
Eleven years later and three years after the school moved to the South Side, the results are mixed. Many residents who could not afford more expensive culinary schools have attended Washburne and snared good jobs or opened their own businesses. But graduates have not gotten much traction in Englewood, where the economic climate has not improved. Last winter Washburne's on-site fine-dining restaurant, Sikia, closed to the public because of lack of customers.
''Unfortunately, Englewood is nowhere near in the condition it was supposed to be 11 years later,'' Mr. Reynolds said.
Mr. Robinson is among Washburne's success stories. He and his wife, whose nickname is Reecee, support eight children, so he could not afford to attend some schools he considered. At Washburne, financial aid and student loans covered almost the entire cost of the two-year program.
Many Washburne students describe similar experiences. Shakira Robinson, a South Shore resident (and no relation to Clarence), said she had given up on the idea of culinary school until she found Washburne, where financial aid helped her complete her studies ''virtually for free.''
Ms. Robinson wants to start her own small restaurant as well as teach cooking to special-education students. For now, she is working downtown at the Buckingham Fountain Cafe, which is staffed by Washburne students and alumni. It is now open for its third summer.
Another successful school enterprise is Parrot Cage Restaurant at the South Shore Cultural Center, where Washburne students work as part of their curriculum. This year, for the first time, Cajun food from the restaurant will be featured at Taste of Chicago. About three-quarters of Washburne's 320 students live on the South Side, and Mr. Reynolds said that the school was looking to expand with an additional campus elsewhere in the city.
Mr. Reynolds said he remained determined to foster better dining and eating options in poor South Side neighborhoods. Washburne rents affordable kitchen space for small catering businesses. Soul Vegetarian, a popular vegan restaurant in the nearby Park Manor neighborhood, prepares its catered food there.
Although it has been closed to the public, Sikia, which specializes in African food, still hosts special events several times a week. Among them is a series called Young Natives, at which local high school band members jam with professional musicians.
In the fall, Sikia plans to start serving a lunch buffet for the public twice a week, but until then, Englewood has no sit-down restaurant options except fast-food places.
''We're not giving up,'' Mr. Reynolds said.

HEADLINE: You Versus a 12th Grader

 BODY:
WHO was the first president of the United States? If only history were that easy. Only 12 percent of a representative sample of the nation's high school seniors demonstrated proficiency in the subject last year, according to the results of a test released last week, the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Think you can do better? Here's a sample of the 111 multiple-choice questions. Sharpen your pencil.
1. In United States politics, third parties such as the Populists and the Socialists have: 
a) won presidential elections during times of economic and political distress
b) often taken control of Congress from the two major parties
c) contributed ideas and issues to the debates between the two major parties
d) appealed predominantly to conservative voters.
2. One of the important effects of the Second Great Awakening was:
a) the weakening of the Methodist Protestant denomination
b) the growth of reform movements that addressed issues in many areas of United States society
c) a decrease in the participation of women and African-Americans in religious revivals
d) the unification of various Protestant denominations in Eastern states
3. ''We hold, that on their separation from the Crown of Great Britain, the several colonies became free and independent States, each enjoying the separate and independent right of self-government; and that no authority can be exercised over them or within their limits, but by their consent. It is equally true, that the Constitution of the United States is a compact formed between the several States.''
--From ''Address to the People of the United States,'' issued by the South Carolina Convention of 1832
This passage highlights a tension between:
a) urban and rural interests
b) East and West
c) states' rights and federal authority
d) government economic subsidies and free enterprise.
4. Why did Missouri's application for statehood in 1819 cause a political crisis?
a) The United States had equal numbers of slave and free states, and Missouri's entry would have upset the balance.
b) The United States had never before established a state west of the Mississippi, and Missouri's entry would have likely caused conflict with American Indians.
c) Missouri was a center of abolitionist activity, and its admission would have antagonized Southern states.
d) Missouri was a center of secessionist activity, and its entry would have antagonized Northern states.
5. Shays' Rebellion (1786) was important because it:
a) led many people to believe that the central government was too weak
b) led to the end of public support for the First Bank of the United States
c) made many people fear the tyranny of the president more than the tyranny of England
d) convinced many people in the North that slavery should be expanded to new territories.
6. ''To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority ... that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. ... We conclude that in the field of public education separate but equal has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.''
The 1954 Supreme Court decision overturned which earlier decision?
a) Marbury v. Madison, 1803
b) McCulloch v. Maryland, 1819
c) Dred Scott v. Sandford, 1857
d) Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896
7. Which statement about the War of 1812 is accurate?
a) The United States enjoyed military superiority for most of the war.
b) In some regions many people did not support the war.
c) The peace treaty that ended the war doubled the size of the United States.
d) Almost all of the land and sea battles were fought at great distances from United States territory.
8. One of the central ideas of President George Washington's foreign policy was that the United States should:
a) play an active role in European affairs
b) expand its influence throughout the Americas
c) support democracies and oppose monarchies
d) avoid permanent alliances with other countries
9. ''We hold, that on their separation from the Crown of Great Britain, the several colonies became free and independent States, each enjoying the separate and independent right of self-government; and that no authority can be exercised over them or within their limits, but by their consent. It is equally true, that the Constitution of the United States is a compact formed between the several States.''
--From ''Address to the People of the United States,'' issued by the South Carolina Convention of 1832
This passage supports the:
a) Northwest Ordinance
b) Great Compromise
c) Emancipation Proclamation
d) Ordinance of Nullification
1. C (73 percent of students answered correctly) 2. B (64 percent) 3. C (76 percent) 4. A (45 percent) 5. A (59 percent) 6. D (51 percent) 7. B (29 percent) 8. D (34 percent) 9. D (15 percent).

HEADLINE: Funny, but I've Heard This Market Song Before

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
''SOUND familiar?'' the e-mail asked. It came from Birinyi Associates, a research firm, and contained a list of financial headlines from several news organizations, including this one.
''Concerns Over Europe Flare Again, Pushing U.S. Shares Lower,'' one said. ''Fear of a Double Dip Could Cause One,'' said another. ''Slowdown Fear Hits Market,'' a third declared.
There was a catch, however. 
Although the headlines aptly described events of the last two months, they were published in May and June 2010. All of them.
What should we make of this odd recurrence? ''History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes,'' as Mark Twain is often reputed to have said. (I've found no compelling evidence that he ever uttered that nifty aphorism. No matter -- the line is too good to resist.)
In a telephone interview, Laszlo Birinyi, the veteran market strategist, said he selected those headlines to make a point. ''If you feel you've seen this before, well, you have,'' he said. ''The market is in a correction -- but so what? We've had about five corrections of one kind or another in this bull market. It's not the end of the world.''
But during long stretches this spring, it may have seemed that it was. The market managed the barest of gains last week, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edging up a mere 0.3 percent. Until then, it had declined for six consecutive weeks, with the S.& P. dropping almost 7 percent, wiping out nearly all its gains for 2011. Market declines of that duration are unusual: the S.& P. last dropped for six weeks in 2002, with a total decline of almost 15 percent, according to Yardeni Research.
Still, considering the scale of the rally that began in March 2009, the recent losses have been modest. As a technical matter, the decline isn't even a correction, because stocks haven't fallen 10 percent from their recent peak. Over all, the S.& P. 500 remains almost 90 percent above its 2009 low.
Even if the market's fall has not been severe, it could easily become so. There are numerous reasons for this spring's unpleasantness, and they have been alternating in the headlines. On the top of the charts last week: the Greek debt crisis and fears of contagion throughout Europe and beyond.
On Wednesday, for example, Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW in Los Angeles, an asset manager, said that there had been a ''very substantial'' decline in Treasury yields as investors moved to safer positions. Why? On that particular afternoon, he said, traders worried ''that the day of reckoning for Greek bonds'' -- in which bondholders take losses as a requirement for bailouts -- ''may be coming sooner than the market had expected.''
The same day, the Irish finance minister said bondholders should share in the losses of battered Irish banks. And Moody's Investors Service placed three of the largest French banks on review for a downgrade because of their holdings of Greek debt -- illustrating the ramifying effects of the debt problems in Europe.
European officials were thrashing out these issues over the weekend, but other troubles are weighing on the markets, too. Take your pick.
It can be argued that investors have been reacting primarily to a slowdown in economic growth in the United States and other developed countries. Rising interest rates in emerging markets like China, where authorities are trying to control inflation by curbing growth, have not helped, either. Nor has a spike in energy prices, albeit one that has abated in recent weeks.
Americans tend to focus on the domestic economy, which grew at a rate of only 1.8 percent in the first quarter. A Labor Department report on June 1 shook up the markets. It said that unemployment had gone back up to 9.1 percent, and that only 54,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were created in May, down sharply from 244,000 in April.
''The monthly jobs report was probably the single most disturbing piece of data'' among many items suggesting that the economy is sputtering, said Rich Bryant, head of Treasury trading at MF Global.
Then there is the awkward timing of the Fed's experiment in quantitative easing, its purchases of longer-term securities. Last August, amid talk that a double-dip recession was imminent, the Fed signaled that it would resume these purchases -- promptly dubbed QE2. That announcement helped end the summer doldrums, sending stocks on another leg upward.
But from the very first, QE2 was scheduled to start winding down at the end of this month. Fed officials now say they may delay actually shrinking their gargantuan portfolio -- it has swollen to more than $2.8 trillion -- until economic conditions improve. Further details may be forthcoming after Fed policy makers meet in Washington this week.
Crucially, however, Fed officials have indicated that they intend to keep short-term interest rates near zero for months to come. If inflation stays low and the economy remains weak, the bond market could well rally further, pushing down yields on 10-year Treasuries to as low as 2.5 percent, Mr. Bryant said.
That assumes timely resolution of another big problem: the dispute over the federal debt ceiling. If Congress doesn't act by Aug. 2, the United States could default on its debt, an event that could be calamitous.
''The market is assuming that won't happen,'' Mr. Bryant said.
Mr. Rivelle assumes that there will be no default, but that Congress and the White House ''will continue wrangling'' about budget deficits for months while the economy remains weak. ''That would be positive for bonds and negative for stocks,'' he said.
As for Mr. Birinyi, he cites what he calls ''the Cyrano Principle'': ''If the problem is as obvious as the nose on your face, the chances are that everyone else knows it, too.'' The markets, he said, are very good at digesting this news and adapting to it. Sooner or later, he says, ''unless there is some truly dramatic surprise -- and not just something the market is well aware of'' -- stocks will resume what he expects to be a long run higher.

HEADLINE: Suburbia, but Not the Cookie-Cutter Kind

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
ADRIENNE NATRILLO and her husband, Javier Gomez, moved to Berkeley Heights, N.J., from Connecticut four years ago because the town was 15 miles from her office in East Hanover and had houses they thought were much better buys than those in nearby communities.
Now Ms. Natrillo, a scientist, and Mr. Gomez, who is in the insurance business, are rediscovering Berkeley Heights, an architecturally eclectic town of 13,000 in western Union County, as they pilot their 4-month-old son's stroller down its rolling, shady streets.
''Unless something happens with our jobs,'' she said, ''I feel like we're going to be here 30 years.''
Real estate brokers say Berkeley Heights has been a relatively easy place to sell homes, even in a recession, because it is less than 30 miles from Manhattan, with easy accessibility to a commuter train line and Interstate 78, in the southern part of town. 
But Ms. Natrillo and Mr. Gomez, who bought a four-bedroom 1980s colonial for $700,000, enjoy the place for what is right there: the great outdoors, for one, and residents who say hello.
Berkeley Heights was a sleepy, rural community until the American Telephone and Telegraph Company built a research facility in 1941 in its southeastern corner. Bell Laboratories, which later became Lucent Technologies, straddled Berkeley Heights and New Providence and brought thousands of workers to western Union County.
Seventy years later, however, the general effect remains uncluttered, almost rural -- much more like a town much farther from New York City, like Sparta, the previous hometown of Joseph Bruno, the mayor. ''We have a lot of folks here who want to live in the country but also want to live close to work,'' he said.
''It's kept its small-town charm as long as I've been here,'' said Mr. Bruno, who has lived in three houses in Berkeley Heights since moving to the township in 1992.
Mr. Bruno, a store manager for J. C. Penney not far away in Wayne, took on the part-time job of mayor this year. As in other places, the township has had to run on a shoestring budget recently, he said, but not to the point that services have been cut.
Although Berkeley Heights is within minutes of Interstate 78, the lifestyle is quiet, and residents tend to stay put. Mr. Bruno, who bought a four-bedroom house seven years ago for $640,000, describes the town as ''multigenerational'' and cited two neighbors who are putting additions onto their houses to avoid having to move.
Kenneth B. Baris, the president and broker for Jordan Baris Realtors, whose main office is in West Orange, says he has had a number of clients choosing to stay in town when they trade up to larger houses, ''which is a very positive statement.''
The quality of the local schools is a selling point, as are the tax rates, which tend to be lower than in similar bedroom communities in nearby Essex County. The town, nestled in the Watchung Mountains, feels more spread out, less densely populated.
Yimin Tang and his wife, Bei Jiang, are engineers. They just paid $490,000 for a four-bedroom 1963 bilevel. He said they had looked nearby in New Providence, Mountainside and Warren Township, but felt Berkeley Heights offered the best deal. ''This is big enough for us,'' he said. ''And there's some potential for the future.''
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
The township, area 6.3 square miles, is bordered by the Passaic River to the north and I-78 to the south. It sticks out of Union County like a hitchhiker's thumb, with Morris County to the north and Somerset County to the west and south. Two thoroughfares cut east to west: Mountain Avenue and Springfield Avenue, the commercial strip.
To the east on Springfield, near New Providence, is a sprawling shopping center. To the west, Springfield looks a lot more like Main Street U.S.A., with American flags fluttering above a block that includes a bagel store, a barber shop (with a barber pole) and a hardware store.
''Berkeley Heights is really a small town at heart,'' said Mary Ann Walsh, a RE/MAX agent who moved here with her husband 13 years ago from Maplewood to raise their children. ''We have every amenity as any other place, but when I got here, I felt very welcome. It's a very friendly town. We feel like we got the best of both worlds.''
The Berkeley Heights train station -- near the intersection of Springfield and Plainfield Avenue, the main north-south road -- is at the center of town. Several restaurants, a park and a variety of businesses are within walking distance of the station, including a garage, a dry cleaner and a plant nursery. Signs for yard sales are stapled to utility poles.
The landscape to the south, moving along Plainfield away from the river, is hilly and verdant. Tall hardwoods drape a variety of houses that run the gamut from older frame structures, to 1960s-era split-levels, to recently built brick colonials in the Cinnamon Ridge section. Most houses have front yards large enough to play catch.
''It's not like other towns,'' Ms. Natrillo said, explaining that even with subdivisions, the styles vary enough that ''as you go down the street, you pass all different types of houses.''
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
A recent look at the Garden State Mutiple Listing Service showed 80 residential properties for sale, ranging from a two-bedroom condominium, for $259,000, to a five-bedroom custom-built colonial for $1.35 million. A three-bedroom ranch built in 1956 is listed for $500,000, with an annual tax bill of $8,000.
Robert Edgar, the township's tax assessor, said 135 houses sold in Berkeley Heights from July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010, for an average of $558,000. He said 58 houses sold from July 1, 2010, to March 31 of this year, with an average sale price of $577,000.
According to Trulia.com, the median sale price in Berkeley Township between November and January was $547,950, or 4.8 percent higher than the median price in the corresponding period one year earlier.
Mr. Baris says there are sometimes bidding wars for houses within the zone for the Thomas E. Hughes Elementary School. Average sales prices in that section of the school district over the past year are $713,000, with 15 percent of houses selling in 30 days.
According to Mr. Baris's data, 62 percent of houses listed from $600,000 to $699,000 sold in the past year, with an average of 35 days to sale. As he put it, ''What we're finding is that this is a real sweet spot for the town, pricewise.''
THE COMMUTE
New Jersey Transit has two direct trains to New York Pennsylvania Station each weekday morning on the Morris and Essex line, and two direct trains each weekday evening for the return trip. Travel time is 50 to 56 minutes, and a monthly pass costs $308.
There are also eight morning trains that require a transfer at Summit or Newark Broad Street to get to Penn Station. Parking at the train station for residents is $285 a year. There is a three-year waiting list for spots, but Mr. Bruno says the township is planning to expand the lots.
Another option is Lakeland Bus Lines, which offers service to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Five buses make the trip, scheduled for 55 minutes to one hour, each weekday morning, making three stops along the way. A 10-trip ticket is $88.80.
WHAT TO DO
Berkeley Heights is surrounded by open space. At the northern edge of the township, only a block from Springfield Avenue, is the Passaic River County Park, part of which is in the Union County parks system. To the south is Watchung Reservation, Union County's largest park, at 1,945 acres. People go there to hike, fish, canoe, ride horses and picnic.
Among summer programs offered by the township's recreation department: a playground camp for students in Grades 1 through 7; concerts and movies; lessons and camps in tennis, table tennis and gymnastics; and several adult fitness programs. Family membership at the Berkeley Heights Community Pool is $425 a year for residents.
THE SCHOOLS
The system has an early-childhood center for prekindergarten through first grade, three elementary schools for Grades 2 through 5, a middle school and Governor Livingston High School. Average class size at Hughes Elementary is 18.6 students, about the state average.
The high school has about 1,000 students in Grades 9 through 12. SAT averages last year were 573 in math, 547 in reading and 552 in writing, versus 520, 496 and 499 statewide. The graduation rate for the class of 2010 was 100 percent, versus 94.7 percent statewide.
THE HISTORY
In 1845, David Felt built a mill, a general store-cum-church and about half a dozen other buildings on Watchung Reservation land bought from the descendants of Peter Willcox, the first European settler. The community, called Feltville, survived for about 15 years, and in 1882 was used as a summer resort, Glenside Park. The Union County Park Commission bought the land in the 1920s, and some of the Feltville buildings still stand, off Glenside Avenue.

HEADLINE: Big Movies Coming in Short Packages

BYLINE: By JOHN ANDERSON

 BODY:
DEB SHOVAL is overjoyed that her movie, ''AWOL,'' will be shown as part of the Palm Springs International ShortFest in California this week, even if she hasn't had time to think about it lately. After all, the crops are in.
''It's the first week of C.S.A.,'' she said from her northeastern Pennsylvania farm, referring to the subscription program Community Supported Agriculture. ''People become members, and they get vegetables, and this was the first week.''
At the 2011 ShortFest many of the directors have fairly predictable backgrounds, like acting, photography, fine arts, news, advertising and design. Others, like Ms. Shoval, have more unusual entries on their resumes. Astrophysics. Medicine. Law. Professional snowboarding. Like an increasing number of filmmakers who've found their way to Palm Springs, Sundance or other festivals friendly to shorts (usually defined as 40 minutes or less) Ms. Shoval has taken a wildly circuitous journey to arrive behind the camera.
''When I was 19, I went to work on an organic farm in Maine,'' said Ms. Shoval, 33, whose family expected her to become a lawyer. ''I was not into it. On this farm they taught you everything. One day I was canning jelly, the next day I was slaughtering sheep.'' 
At Hampshire College in Massachusetts she majored in sustainable agriculture, got involved in educational drama for children, wrote plays (including ''A Sense of Humus''), toured with a theater group, survived a bout with ovarian cancer and decided she had stories to tell. And that film was the way to tell them.
At Palm Springs, alongside ''AWOL,'' a drama about a soldier on leave and her married lover, is ''Just Be Frank,'' a portrait of a blind Manhattan jazz singer. Its director, Elise Bialylew, an Australian, had her own moment of truth about film while studying medicine in Melbourne. She was dissecting a female cadaver.
''I held her brain in my hands in complete awe,'' said Dr. Bialylew, 32, who is currently studying psychiatry. ''It made my own life feel somehow very fleeting and insignificant. Filmmaking for me is in many ways an anatomical journey.''
For others it's the logical segue from an entirely different field. ''Being a snowboarder, there are three ways to make money,'' said Orlando von Einsiedel, a 30-year-old Londoner whose ''Skateistan,'' about a skateboard school in Kabul, Afghanistan, was shown at Sundance this year. ''One is winning competitions, one is wearing a brand of clothing, and the last way is 'photo incentives': for whatever media coverage you get, you receive a fee from your sponsors.''
Competitors end up filming one another, he said, adding, ''Eventually I learned I liked making the snowboarding films more than the actual snowboarding.''
Now he makes short documentaries for nongovernmental organizations in African conflict zones, where he can exploit both his knack for on-the-fly filmmaking and his master's degree in anthropology from the London School of Economics.
Whether the incongruous backgrounds of so many shorts makers means an infusion of new blood into Greater Cinema remains to be seen; the traditional route, starting with film school, remains the best-trod path to auteurship. But better, cheaper technology, combined with the increasingly visual nature of our culture, has meant more opportunities.
Kathleen McInnis, film curator and director of industry programming at Palm Springs, said that although she's received entries from more countries -- 50 this year, up from 40 in 2010 -- ''there's much more complex storytelling.'' She added: ''I'm of the belief that complex storytelling comes from some level of maturity. And I'm not seeing as many of those films that feel like immature stories from people without much life experience.''
Not everyone agrees that the non-filmmaker filmmaker will be the salvation of cinema. ''The cream rises to the top, and most often the cream is from people who define themselves as filmmakers,'' said Sharon Badal, head shorts programmer at the Tribeca Film Festival. ''That being said, beyond the film-festival circuit you have all these corporate competitions going on, every company wants original branded content they can own. You're opening up the field to the public at large. It's a small investment in time and technology, and you have a lot of people who are not 'filmmakers' making films.''
While most filmmakers involved in the virtually commerce-free world of shorts would ultimately like to make features, there are practical reasons to think small.
''In an industry where enormous sums of money must be raised to make and release a single movie, and in which you have to cater to as broad a demographic as possible in order to see a return on investment,'' said the ShortFest programming director, Darryl Macdonald, ''the short-film medium allows new talent to emerge without the high-risk stakes.''
And the short film by nature is a welcoming medium. ''There are no real rules,'' said Kim Yutani, who has been programming shorts for Sundance since 2006. ''A lot of people were afraid that because it's so much easier to make films that look good, that there was just going to be a ton of junky films, but I actually don't find that to be the case. I think when I started we got 4,200 shorts. We now get 6,200. That bump is huge. But it's just given us a lot more options.'' She added, ''Films that are taking chances get our attention.''
One that did this year was ''Pioneer,'' a revisionist bedtime story whose producer, James M. Johnston, 37, is also a director. (His latest, ''Knife,'' is just hitting the festival circuit.) He also happens to be the executive chef at Spiral Diner & Bakery, a vegan outpost in Fort Worth.
''I never went to school for film or food,'' Mr. Johnston said, although his wife, Amy McNutt, went to the University of Southern California and worked in the film industry for a few years before returning to Texas and opening the diner. Mr. Johnston would like to make films full time, ''but I don't want to live in L.A. or New York,'' he said. ''I like being in Fort Worth, where hardly anyone else is making films.''
Filmmaking in New York can be a menagerie. Jessica Oreck, 26, has already made the transition to feature documentaries (''Beetle Queen Conquers Tokyo''), though she had a short (''Venus'') in Sundance this year despite the demands of a day job: she's an animal handler at the American Museum of Natural History, where she spends part of her time in the Butterfly Conservatory.
''You watch people come through and see a huge range of reactions,'' she said. ''Butterflies are like the pandas of insects,'' meaning that people project themselves on the animals, ''and it's been a big inspiration to me regarding how to make something on film as complete an experience as possible.''
George Zaverdas, whose ''David and Goliath'' will be playing Palm Springs, found his inspiration in a setback. ''I worked in market research for Nielsen for 16 years, testing movies,'' Mr. Zaverdas, 47, said. ''And then about two years ago, with the economic crisis, I was let go along with 35 co-workers. At first I flipped out, but I got a severance package and unemployment, and I said: 'You know what? I've always procrastinated about making my own film.' '' The film, about a Czech Jew being pursued by the Nazis but saved by a dog, was named best narrative short at the Los Angeles Jewish Film Festival.
Though he found a job at another company that tests movies, Mr. Zaverdas said, ''In a way losing my job fulfilled my dream.''

One may not expect to see murals and graffiti on display in a museum. But these examples of street art -- along with music and fashion -- are the focus of El Museo del Barrio's sixth biennial of work by Latino, Caribbean, and Latin American artists in the New York region, which opened Tuesday . The biennial, called the (S) FILES 2011, showcases 75 emerging artists in seven locations around the city, including El Museo, the Lehman College Art Gallery and Socrates Sculpture Park.
The curators of this year's biennial focused on the street to call attention to the impact of economic and political crises on art production. The exhibition explores themes like the influence of New York urban styles, text and art made from debris. The artists' materials include found objects, colored sand, crocheted plastic bags and glitter.
Since starting in 1999 the (S) Files have brought attention to Latino artists including the Puerto Rican-based Allora & Calzadilla, who are representing the United States at this year's Venice Biennale. Other notable alumni include Margarita Cabrera, Pablo Helguera, Tamara Kostianovsky and Ivan Navarro. 
In addition to its overall focus on New York artists The (S) Files 2011 celebrate the Biennial of the Central American Isthmus by showcasing the work of a group of artists featured in its most recent edition.

Tony Award season sure does feel like a protracted battle sometimes, and in the aftermath of this bloody (if mostly predictable) affair Broadway shows will shutter one by one over the next couple of months. So, for the sake of balance, let us turn our attention to the nurturing and the new.
LCT3, Lincoln Center Theater's initiative geared toward the development of new voices, is offering ''4000 MILES,'' a play by Amy Herzog , a Yale School of Drama graduate who gave us the well-received ''After the Revolution'' at Playwrights Horizons last fall. She's taken a character from that play about a family of American radicals, the gritty grandmother Vera, and placed her in another story that takes place a decade later. In ''4000 Miles'' Vera gets a visit from her grandson who has just trekked cross country and is mourning the death of a close friend. In previews, opens June 20, closes July 2, Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org.
Second Stage Theater also has a new works series, and the first of two summer shows is now running there: Michael Mitnick's ''SEX LIVES OF OUR PARENTS.'' That title conjures images of things we don't necessarily want to be conjuring, which seems apt for a comedy about a woman about to be married who learns some things she might prefer never to have known. In previews, opens June 22, closes July 3, McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, third floor , (212) 246-4422, 2st.com.

In France any chef can wear the pleated white toque and the expression of having sniffed curdled milk. But those who don the blue-white-and-red collar have to earn it. (Frauds can face jail time.) It's enough to make grown men cry. And they do, again and again, in ''KINGS OF PASTRY,'' Tuesday on PBS, in which the filmmakers Chris Hegedus and D. A. Pennebaker go behind the scenes of the Meilleurs Ouvriers de France finals in pastry making. ''My nightmare is I'm competing and that always something goes wrong,'' says the Alsace-born Jacquy Pfeiffer, a founder of the French Pastry School in Chicago, who has been training like an Olympian for the right to spin, blow and pull sugar to astonishing heights at this three-day contest in Lyons, held every four years. From delicate puffs tufted with cream and chocolates crowned by flecks of gold leaf to nougat-and-jam-filled wedding cakes and the bijou -- a museum-quality sugar sculpture presented in a glass box -- every morsel counts for the 16 chefs who hope to reap a medal, a title, and the handshake from President Nicolas Sarkozy. But a shot at stardom can crash and burn as quickly as a six-foot-tall sugar sculpture can disintegrate into shards. Get out the Kleenex.
''STATEN ISLAND CAKES,'' Tuesday on WE, ventures into the bakery with Vinny Buzzetta, the boy wonder behind some of that borough's most coveted confections, and his raucous Italian clan. No stereotyping allowed. The 21-year-old Mr. Buzzetta graduated first in his class from the French Culinary Institute in New York in 2008, becoming the youngest person to complete the program.
Film
Neil Genzlinger
''The subject matter of this film is morally repellant both in theme and treatment,'' the National Legion of Decency said of ''BABY DOLL'' when it came out in 1956. ''It dwells almost without variation or relief upon carnal suggestiveness in action, dialogue and costuming.'' Whew! The film, directed by Elia Kazan and written by Tennessee Williams, involves a young woman who has married a considerably older man but becomes involved with a younger fellow. Those seeking more details about what the legion called the film's ''unmitigated emphasis on lust'' can ask Baby Doll herself on Thursday when Carroll Baker, who played the role, appears at a screening of the movie at Cinema Arts Center on Long Island. The league, needless to say, gave the film a rating of C -- for ''condemned.'' At 7:30 p.m., 423 Park Avenue, Huntington, (631) 423-7611, cinemaartscentre.org; $15.
Chess fans who can't afford premium cable still have a chance to see ''BOBBY FISCHER AGAINST THE WORLD,'' Liz Garbus's documentary about the chess champion, which had its premiere on HBO this month. The Museum of the Moving Image screens the film Wednesday at 7 p.m. Beforehand, beginning at 6, Frank Brady will be signing his new book, ''Endgame: Bobby Fischer's Remarkable Rise and Fall -- From America's Brightest Prodigy to the Edge of Madness.'' Dylan McClain, chess columnist for The New York Times, will join Mr. Brady for a discussion after the screening. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens; (718) 777-6800, movingimage.us; $15.

Moving air will take on three dimensions and dance in Jody Sperling's ''Turbulence.'' The new work for six women from her company, JODY SPERLING/TIME LAPSE DANCE, is derived in part from patterns of air disturbance that Ms. Sperling will solidify into choreography filled with spirals, ripples and waves. The shifting rhythms of the commissioned score by QUENTIN CHIAPPETTA, to be played live by the percussionist TIGGER BENFORD, will also contribute to the sense of turbulence. And so will historical precedent. A dance researcher as well as a performer, Ms. Sperling is an authority on Loie Fuller ( 1862-1928), a pioneer of modern dance who became celebrated for her own ways of making moving air visible by wearing costumes that swirled about her body as she progressed across the stage, creating fantastic changing shapes. In homage to Fuller, Ms. Sperling is having her dancers wear ever-billowing and undulating voluminous silk capes. Ms. Sperling's program looks to the future as well as the past, for it includes ''Not Here Yet,'' a solo tribute to expectant motherhood, to be danced by Ms. Sperling, who is seven months pregnant.
Wednesday through Friday at 6:30 p.m., Saturday at 2 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, Studio 6A, 450 West 37th Street, Clinton, $40 Wednesday (benefit), other performances $15, $10 for students and 60+, $5 for children, (800) 838-3006, timelapsedance.com/BAC2011.

The delightful Italian word ''ghiribizzo'' means caprice or whim. Nicolo Paganini, that giant of the violin, used it for dozens of short, charming pieces he wrote. But these ghiribizzi were not for the four-stringed instrument usually found tucked under a chin, but the guitar. For Paganini's prodigious talent included a virtuoso guitar technique, and he composed a vast quantity of solo guitar works and pieces for guitar and violin.
The Italian guitarist LUIGI ATTADEMO pays homage to Paganini with an intricately planned Bargemusic concert on Friday. He has divided the program into three parts, each representing an element of Paganini: virtuosity, melancholy and irony. Within each part ghiribizzi and other Paganini guitar pieces alternate with a contemporary work.
The day before at Bargemusic, Mr. Attademo pays his respects to another guitarist, Heitor Villa-Lobos, performing five of his preludes and eight etudes, separated by a Bach Chaconne, from the Partita No. 2 for violin, BWV 1004. On Saturday another guitarist takes his turn: Paul Galbraith plays his own arrangements for eight-stringed guitar of works by Schumann, Haydn, Hindemith and Bach. Concerts at 8 p.m.,Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35.

Another week, another plethora of opportunities to revisit the 1990s, when bands were dirtier, less danceable and deeply ambivalent about their firm grasp on beauty. DEERVANA, the alias of the rough-edged but amiable country-rockers Deer Tick when in Nirvana-cover-band mode, do work toward restoring that band's elegance, while also dulling its teeth -- a not-quite-fair trade, but an interesting one. Sunday at 9 p.m., Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 963-3369, brooklynbowl.com, $15.
More than a decade after they split ARCHERS OF LOAF return with a tour to celebrate a coming reissue of their 1993 debut ''Icky Mettle,'' which sounds no less rowdy in the rear view, though it remains to be seen if the singer Eric Bachmann's pipes can still take the old level of abuse. Saturday at 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 486-5400, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; sold out.
Also mining its back catalog is DINOSAUR JR., which is performing in tandem with its cassette-only (!) reissue of its third album, ''Bug'' -- from 1988, though that seems more like a technicality than anything else. As seen in the current wave of '90s revivalist bands, Dinosaur Jr. casts a long shadow. At this show, where it will play ''Bug'' beginning to end, the band will be interviewed on stage by Henry Rollins, and there will be opening sets by hard-core eminences grises Off! (featuring Keith Morris, who Mr. Rollins replaced in Black Flag) and the decreasingly disorderly Canadian punk band with a name that defies printing (but not shouting) and a lovely new album, ''David Comes to Life.'' Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Terminal 5,610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-6600, terminal5nyc.com, $30 advance, $35 day of show.

HEADLINE: Cup Upset Was Strange, Not Inexplicable

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN and STU HACKEL

 BODY:
The Stanley Cup finals that ended Wednesday were among the strangest ever, apart from what happened in the streets of Vancouver afterward.
The Canucks were favored, having won the regular-season title with the league's most productive offense, its most efficient defense, very good goaltending by Roberto Luongo and excellent special teams. After a big scare in the first round against their bete noire, Chicago, they won 8 of their next 11 games to get to the finals.
Yet Boston wound up outscoring them by 23-8 (and by 21-4 in the last five games). The Bruins' 15-goal advantage was the biggest for any best-of-seven finals in N.H.L. history. The previous record was the 13 by which the 1970 Bruins beat St. Louis - in a sweep. 
The dimensions of the Bruins' victory over the Canucks were those of a runaway sweep, not a seven-game marathon. Vancouver scored the fewest goals by a team in a seven-game series, and during the 420 minutes 11 seconds of play, the Canucks led for only 32:32, less than 8 percent of the time.
How did that happen?
The scrappy Bruins, backstopped by the game's top goalie, Tim Thomas, planned to physically confront Vancouver, especially its mobile defensemen and the high-scoring Sedin twins, Daniel and Henrik. The Canucks, with players like Alexandre Burrows, who bit the finger of Patrice Bergeron in Game 1, gladly took up the challenge.
One result was the most rancorous Cup finals in a couple of decades. It was less about the best hockey of the year and more about biting, taunting, slashing, cheap shots, late shots, high-sticking, slew-footing, diving, embellishing, brawling, trash-talking and name-calling. Pushing and shoving after the whistle became the norm, and by the end, the teams had combined for 342 penalty minutes, the most in the Cup finals since 1986.
Before Game 7, the TSN analyst Bob McKenzie called the series ''Revenge of the Twerps,'' noting that the two best skaters for each team through the first six games were superpests, Boston's Brad Marchand and Vancouver's Maxim Lapierre.
Although they won the first two games at home, the Canucks' fortunes went downhill immediately. They lost defenseman Dan Hamhuis in Game 1 after he injured himself by flipping Boston's Milan Lucic over his back. Coach Alain Vigneault moved Aaron Rome up the depth chart, but he had trouble with the pace against frontline players.
In Game 3 in Boston, Rome's mistimed check concussed Nathan Horton, earning an ejection and a four-game suspension. For the second time, Vancouver had to play with five defensemen and began to tire, giving Boston too much space, which the Bruins exploited by displaying unexpected skill in an 8-1 victory. Thomas's play early in the game made the outcome possible, and Marchand's short-handed tally broke Vancouver's spirit.
Game 4 was more of the same, with Thomas stopping everything en route to a 4-0 shocker in which Marchand scored and later clotheslined Christian Ehrhoff and lowbridged Daniel Sedin on the same play.
Luongo sparkled in a 1-0 decision as Vancouver took a 3-2 series lead. But returning to Boston, he again turned porous behind additional defensive blunders, and the Bruins won, 5-2. Marchand scored the first goal and later repeatedly punched Daniel Sedin in the head.
In Game 7, the home-ice pattern was broken when Bergeron and Marchand each scored twice in a 4-0 victory, capitalizing on the battered Canucks defense and little response from the Sedins.
The shutout was Thomas's second of the finals, and he set records for most saves in the playoffs and in the finals. It is worth noting that Daniel Sedin took 27 shots in the series, more than any other player, but Thomas, the most valuable player in the postseason, stopped 26 of them.
After Thomas, the best player and most compelling figure was the 5-foot-9 Marchand. His 11 playoff goals, second most for a rookie, and 19 points were essential, but his physical agitation symbolized the temperament of these strange finals.
Thomas finished the finals with a save percentage of .967. His overall save percentage in the playoffs was .940, best among all goalies. And that came on top of his .938 mark during the regular season, an N.H.L. record.
Such sustained excellence may have been made possible by Thomas's relatively light regular-season workload, 57 games. No Stanley Cup-winning goalie in the last seven years has played as many as 63 regular-season games.A City Where Rioting Is Oddly Familiar
Americans reacted with surprise that Vancouver, site of an Olympics featuring huge street parties suffused with good feeling, could descend into the kind of sports rioting seen in recent years in Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, Denver, Boston and Montreal, and at Ohio State, Michigan State and several other universities.
But Vancouverites are all too aware of their city's history of rioting, and not only over lost hockey games.
In addition to Wednesday's chaos and the 1994 Stanley Cup mayhem after the Canucks lost Game 7 to the Rangers, the police and protesters clashed during a 1997 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference and in 1998 over a visit by Jean Chretien, then prime minister of Canada.
In 2002, fans made a commotion when Axl Rose did not show up for a Guns N' Roses concert, rioting after a Rolling Stones concert in 1972 and so on going back through the years.
''It's terrible,'' Henrik Sedin, the Canucks' captain, said after Game 7.
The next morning, hundreds of volunteers cleaned up broken glass downtown, and the Vancouver police were receiving thousands of tips identifying the rioters.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Portals To Power

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
SHE looked like money, the woman with the sleek long legs, tanned a light toast color, and with a mane highlighted by honeyed streaks conjured by some magician at Frederic Fekkai.
Her suit was Chanel but emphatically not matronly Chanel. Her wrists were manacled with slave bracelets from Cartier. Her shoes were Manolo Blahniks because not only did she look like money, she was money. And women in her position, the early adopters of high-end acquisition, have shifted footwear allegiance lately, abandoning Christian Louboutin with his flashy, too-obvious red soles and returning to Mr. Blahnik, the cobbler who first brought the world a $750 stiletto so comfortable a woman could wear hers to scale Mount Everest.
It was the handbag that told the story, of course, as a handbag often does. Taking a seat on a terrace table at lunch, the woman slung her purse onto an empty chair.
The bag, it almost goes without saying, was a Birkin from Hermes, the fastening straps left unclasped with accustomed and deliberate nonchalance. Not an ordinary Birkin, something basic and valued at $10,000 in calf leather, the bag this woman threw around with a casualness that belied its value -- a 40-centimeter model in single skin crocodile tinted a subtle brown -- sells for about the price of a new Lexus sedan. 
She ordered ... well, what does it matter what she ordered? As Marlene Dietrich once observed, New Yorkers (and particularly those of a certain social stratum) are hungry for everything except food. And for those New Yorkers and their kind, those used to breathing the rarefied air of great wealth, there is a particular gathering place in Manhattan, a quiet six-story annex of a Midtown office building, unmarked and inconspicuous, where they can be among their kind. That place is the Core club.
This private, members-only club on East 55th Street was created six years ago to serve as place where, The New York Times reported before it opened in 2005, a geographically and socially diverse set of wealthy people might ''gather and meet others of the same disparate tribe.''
It might surprise some to learn that, despite the battering the economy has taken since then, the tribe remains populous and robust. What tribe is it, exactly, and what is its composition? Unlike the traditional clubs in this city, bastions of exclusivity and homogeneity engineered to preserve a certain social order by keeping, as The Times also noted, ''new and different people away,'' the Core club is a democratic place.
It is open to all -- or at least, in an essential way, to all those in the top 1 percent of United States households: families with earnings the Tax Policy Center estimates will be $3,061,546 on average this year for a family of four, as well as those from an even more-elevated category that the nonpartisan, nonprofit group calls the ''ultra rich.''
The estimated income this year for households occupying that particular niche -- a mere 0.1 percent of all United States households -- will be $13,719,746, according to the Tax Policy Center.
''The fat-cat hedge fund guys love the place,'' said Richard David Story, the editor of Departures, the glossy travel magazine distributed to holders of American Express Platinum and Centurion cards. ''These guys take their heartbeats per minute as seriously as they take their investment portfolios.'' As putative fat cats, the club's members, of which there are now 1,500, are presumably undaunted by the club's $50,000 initiation and $15,000 annual fees.
''My other club is the Century,'' said Mr. Story, referring to the Century Association, a private club established in 1847 by the editor William Cullen Bryant and his friends to promote the fraternal (the club first admitted women, by court order, in 1989) pursuit of fine arts and literature. ''This is a much younger, hipper crowd.''
Being ostensibly younger and possibly hipper but certainly richer and more unashamedly over-the-top than the literati and assorted members of the intelligentsia comprising the Century's roster (Mark Twain termed the place ''the most unspeakably respectable club in the United States''), Core club members are inured to the perks and entitlements of 21st-century wealth. Where many traditional New York clubs maintain strict dress codes and prohibit business meetings, cellphone conversations and the use of iPads or PDAs, the Core club at many times of the day resembles a trading floor.
''I've got a billion dollars to be deployed,'' a member remarked to his lunch companion over a recent midday meal of $22 Kobe beef sliders and $36 plate of lobster salad with pea leaves and carrot coulis. ''It's there and we need to get it moved.''
At a nearby table, a woman who had spent the morning at the club spa sat querying her companion about her complexion. ''Do I look scorched?'' she said.
''I'm going to Vietnam with the kids,'' the woman added, noting that for this particular trip the family would be taking the new Gulfstream VI.
By no measure could the Core be mistaken for the other private clubs in a city that is well supplied with hideouts for the privileged. It is not, in other words, remotely like the Colony Club, that Park Avenue monument to all things ladylike and proper.
Nor does it resemble the stately Union, often described as the first private social club in the United States (it was founded in 1836); or the Metropolitan, founded in 1891 by a Vanderbilt, a Whitney and J. P. Morgan when a member of their coterie was denied admission to the Union; or any of the other local institutions like the Harmonie or the Brook clubs, with exclusive membership policies and facilities vaguely modeled after Boodle's or White's, stuffy but venerable bolt-holes for English gentlemen.
While other local clubs may offer members well-waxed and cigar-scented havens burnished by custom and softened by wear, the Core club revels in the shiny aura of the newly arrived. In place of overstuffed armchairs squared off at the perimeter of Oriental rugs, private humidors and afternoon teas, the club features an extensive art collection on loan from its members, including a rotating roster of lobby installations, most recently a hallucinatory vinyl mural by Assume Vivid Astro Focus and David LaChapelle's photographs of the transgender vision Amanda Lepore.
''It's a quintessentially American conceit,'' said Paul Austin, referring to Core club ethos, one easy to equate with the gold digger's recipe for marrying money: mingle with the rich and marry for love.
Mr. Austin is a director of the Austin Advisory Group, consultants to the fragrance and fashion industries. He is also -- like Steven Roth, the chairman and chief executive of Vornado Realty Trust, and Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chairman of the Blackstone Group, and Aby Rosen, the real estate mogul, and Ari Emanuel, a chief executive of William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, and J. Christopher Burch, a venture capitalist, and Patricia Kluge, the multimillionaire divorcee-turned-vintner -- one of the founding members of the Core club, people who anted up an initial investment of $100,000 when the club was conceived.
''In a more traditional gentlemen's club, even bringing out a piece of paper, let alone a cellphone, is looked down on,'' Mr. Austin said. ''Here people are very much encouraged to network, to have working meals.''
The Core club ''does a strong power lunch,'' said Pablo De Ritis, the club's cultural curator. For that matter, it does a strong power breakfast, power cocktails and power tea. The latter is often taken in the club's stylish library or in a conference dining room fitted out with state-of-the-art teleconferencing technology, along with a secret entrance and private stairway to accommodate members who travel with security details.
''You're not going to find an unhappy person in the Core club,'' said Jennie Saunders, the founder of the Core Group, the club's parent company. ''If someone on the staff is having a bad day, an off day, we tell them to stay home,'' Ms. Saunders added, over a power breakfast that she likes to take standing up and with her laptop perched on a ledge. ''We don't have negative energy entering the Core club universe. And there is an acute awareness of the need to execute the right judgment at all times.''
Recently, when a bartender's judgment faltered and the club ran out of one member's favorite imported beer, Ms. Saunders ran to a nearby specialty shop and bought a six-pack herself.
''It's a 24/7 service business,'' she said, as she conducted this reporter to the sixth-floor spa. There, according to its operator, the former Dangene McKay-Bailey (she recently altered her surname to Enterprise), a fair number of Core club members start each day. ''We have a publishing executive who comes every day before the gym and work for a little tune-up,'' Ms. Enterprise noted, referring to the tools of her trade: dermabrasion, Fraxel laser, ultrasound treatment that purportedly infuses stem cells into aging skin. ''Why not? In his business you have to look good.''
And if a blemish should happen to emerge on a member's expensively maintained surface, said Talya Taylor, a spa therapist, the Dangene crew is at the ready with skin-care triage: ''In an emergency, if someone calls us and says, 'I'm going to pop this pimple myself if you don't see me,' we get them right in.''
As in seemingly all places frequented by the new rich, art is a central Core club theme, there in the ostentatiously bogus wood paneling commissioned for the club library from the artist Richard Wood; there in works hung throughout the club by artists as disparate as Alexander Calder, Andy Warhol, David Salle and Richard Prince; there in a vaguely sinister light installation placed in the elevator by Leo Villareal; and there in ''Flood,'' a great tsunami of red pigment by Barnaby Furnas that hangs above the bar.
''There are less rules than traditional clubs'' at the Core club, Beth Rudin DeWoody, the art collector and philanthropist, said last week by telephone from South Africa, where she was traveling to seek out big game and new art.
''Like anything that happens in New York, you gather people and you network,'' Ms. DeWoody added. ''But it's also just a nice place in Midtown to relax during the middle of the day when you don't have time to go home and change.''
A visitor to the Core club could be forgiven for thinking that few members squander much time relaxing and that each encounter there is a fixed point in the arc of a potential deal. ''Time optimization is part of the DNA of the Core club,'' said Ms. Saunders, an intense woman who grew up in Yonkers, where her father, a Sicilian immigrant, earned the money to pursue a dental degree by driving a garbage truck.
Cultural ''optimization'' is also a part of the club's makeup; anyway, there is an amorphous operative notion that members share what Mr. DeRitis, the cultural curator, calls a ''sensibility.''
What that amounts to may not be clear, although as at even the most fuddy-duddy of institutions, the Core club does arrange special member nights on Broadway, imports guest speakers (the Jets head coach Rex Ryan was one), stages movie screenings at its luxurious private theater and offers a Father's Day brunch.
Before being approached to join the Core club, Irwin D. Simon, the chief executive officer of Hain Celestial Group, the natural foods empire, took a Groucho Marx view of club membership. ''The Met, the Harvard Club, the Harmonie, I never joined,'' and never wanted to, he said. ''At those other clubs, you had to know the same people and have gone to the same schools. The Core club felt different and not at all stodgy.''
At the Core club, members have things more unusual in common than Mayflower bloodlines or shared memories of freshman year at Deerfield. They have what the woman with the crocodile Birkin would seem to, an almost cartoonish relationship to conspicuous consumption and the unwavering conviction that Thorstein Veblen had it all wrong.
''At least three members I can think of offhand were interested in buying the Mets,'' said Mr. DeRitis, citing James F. McCann, the founder of 1-800-Flowers.com; Anthony Scaramucci, the manager of a $7-billion hedge fund; and Steven A. Cohen, the hedge fund mogul who is currently both a front-runner to be the Mets' new owner and under investigation by the S.E.C. ''That pretty much says it all.''
Correction: June 26, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the Core Club, a private club in New York, misstated the year the Union Club, another such organization, was founded. It was 1836, not 1863.

HEADLINE: Yemen's Unfinished Revolution

BYLINE: By TAWAKKOL KARMAN. 
Tawakkol Karman, a leader of Yemen's democratic youth movement, is the founder of Women Journalists Without Chains. This article was translated by Garrett Davidson from the Arabic.

 BODY:
Sana, Yemen
AFTER more than five months of continuous protests, I stand today in Change Square with thousands of young people united by a lofty dream. I have spent days and nights camped out in tents with fellow protesters; I have led demonstrations in the streets facing the threat of mortars, missiles and gunfire; I have struggled to build a movement for democratic change -- all while caring for my three young children.
We have reached this historic moment because we chose to march in the streets demanding the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, an end to his corrupt and failed regime and the establishment of a modern democratic state. On June 4, our wish for Mr. Saleh's departure was granted, but our demand for democracy remains unfulfilled. 
Following months of peaceful protests that reached every village, neighborhood and street, Yemen is now facing a complete vacuum of authority; we are without a president or parliament. Mr. Saleh may be gone, but authority has not yet been transferred to a transitional presidential council endorsed by the people.
This is because the United States and Saudi Arabia, which have the power to ensure a peaceful transition to democracy in Yemen, have instead used their influence to ensure that members of the old regime remain in power and the status quo is maintained. American counterterrorism agencies and the Saudi government have a firm grip on Yemen at the moment. It is they, not the Yemeni people and their constitutional institutions, that control the country.
American intervention in Yemen is a product of the war on terror. In exchange for military and intelligence partnerships established after the bombing of the American destroyer Cole in 2000, the United States provided the Saleh regime with increased economic aid and military assistance. Because American security was given priority over all other concerns, counterterrorism agencies paid no attention to the human rights abuses being committed by their local partners.
Indeed, American officials chose as local partners the Central Security Forces, the National Security Agency and the Republican Guard, all of which are controlled by Mr. Saleh's sons and nephews. As a result of their partnership with United States counterterrorism agencies, these organizations received generous American financing as well as guidance and technical assistance.
Because America has invested so heavily in Yemen's security forces, it now seems that a transition to democracy will depend on whether Washington believes that investment will remain secure. The establishment of a new government will therefore be contingent on American officials' approving the country's new leaders. Sadly, it seems likely that the United States will support figures from the old regime rather than allow a transitional government approved by the people to take control of Yemen. This would be a grave mistake.
American policy makers must understand that the activists and young people who started Yemen's peaceful revolution deeply respect the United States and Western civilization. Indeed, it was in Washington and other capitals throughout the free world that many of these activists learned the peaceful methods they employed during our revolution.
We call on American officials to engage with the leaders of Yemen's democracy movement and abandon their misplaced investment in the old regime's security apparatus, which has killed more innocent women and children than terrorists.
We understand America's concerns about terrorism and recognize your right to attack terrorist sanctuaries. We have no objection to agreements that protect your security interests. We only ask that you respect international standards on human rights and the Yemeni people's rights to freedom and justice.
On behalf of many of the young people involved in Yemen's revolution, I assure the American people that we are ready to engage in a true partnership. Together, we can eliminate the causes of extremism and the culture of terrorism by bolstering civil society and encouraging development and stability.
We also call upon our Saudi neighbors to let us pursue a democratic path. For 50 years, the Saudi government has provided a special committee of its ministers with an enormous annual budget to intervene in Yemeni affairs. Over the years, this committee has consistently meddled in Yemen's domestic politics and exerted considerable influence over the country's development. In many cases, Yemeni tribal leaders and other prominent individuals have received far more generous aid payments from Riyadh than from the Yemeni government.
Saudi interference in Yemen is also motivated by a fear that the Arab Spring, which spread from Tunis and Cairo to Sana, might soon reach Riyadh. But the fear that our revolution will cross the border is unfounded. This is an information age revolution; it spreads through Facebook, Twitter and other social media, which are not subject to political boundaries.
We ask our neighbors in Saudi Arabia to stop hindering the rule of law and healthy economic development through the purchase of politicians and tribal leaders. We also call on the Saudi government to stop pursuing policies that undermine the people's desire for democratic change. Saudi initiatives that aim to remove the president while keeping the old regime and its security apparatus intact risk unleashing a civil war, which would no doubt have dire consequences for Saudi Arabia as well as for Yemen.
The young people of this revolution have made their demands clear: authority must be handed over to a transitional presidential council approved by the people. This council will manage the country until a constitutional referendum and elections can be held. And the government's security forces must never again be used to serve the personal agendas of government officials or to establish a monopoly on power.
Yemen's people have charted the course of revolution and we will follow this course to its end. We have left our authoritarian past behind. Now, we ask our friends in Washington and Riyadh to help us build a democratic future.

 BODY:
The annual cost, in millions of dollars, of insuring $10 million in Greek sovereign debt for five years as of Thursday. Greece's financial and political crisis, compounded by new fears about the pace of the economic recovery in the United States, sent financial markets reeling last week. The worry is that in the worst case, a Greek debt default would lead to damaging losses for European banks and replay the global panic of 2008. Markets calmed a bit after Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany retreated from her demand that private financial institutions be pressured to help rescue the Greek economy. But the potential for trouble in Europe remained.

HEADLINE: Legalization Won't Kill The Cartels

BYLINE: By SYLVIA LONGMIRE. 
Sylvia Longmire, a former officer and investigative special agent in the Air Force, is the author of the forthcoming book ''Cartel: The Coming Invasion of Mexico's Drug Wars.''

 BODY:
St. Louis
FOR a growing number of American policy makers, politicians and activists, the best answer to the spiraling violence in Mexico is to legalize the marijuana that, they argue, fuels the country's vicious cartels and smugglers. After all, according to official estimates, marijuana constitutes 60 percent of cartels' drug profits. Legalization would move that trade into the open market, driving down the price and undermining the cartels' power and influence.
Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Marijuana legalization has many merits, but it would do little to hinder the long-term economics of the cartels -- and the violent toll they take on Mexican society. 
For one thing, if marijuana makes up 60 percent of the cartels' profits, that still leaves another 40 percent, which includes the sale of methamphetamine, cocaine, and brown-powder and black-tar heroin. If marijuana were legalized, the cartels would still make huge profits from the sale of these other drugs.
Plus, there's no reason the cartels couldn't enter the legal market for the sale of marijuana, as organized crime groups did in the United States after the repeal of Prohibition.
Still, legalization would deliver a significant short-term hit to the cartels -- if drug trafficking were the only activity they were engaged in. But cartels derive a growing slice of their income from other illegal activities. Some experts on organized crime in Latin America, like Edgardo Buscaglia, say that cartels earn just half their income from drugs.
Indeed, in recent years cartels have used an extensive portfolio of rackets and scams to diversify their income. For example, they used to kidnap rivals, informants and incompetent subordinates to punish, exact revenge or send a message. Now that they have seen that people are willing to pay heavy ransoms, kidnapping has become their second-most-lucrative venture, with the targets ranging from businessmen to migrants.
Another new source of cartel revenue is oil theft, long a problem for the Mexican government. The national oil company, Pemex, loses hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of petroleum every year to bandits and criminal gangs who tap into pipelines and siphon it off. Now the cartels are getting involved in this business, working with associates north of the border to sell the oil to American companies at huge markups.
In 2009 a federal court convicted an American businessman of helping to funnel $2 million in petroleum products stolen from Pemex by a Mexican cartel, eventually selling it to a Texas chemical plant owned by the German chemical company BASF. The chemical company claims never to have known where the products came from.
Cartels are also moving into the market in pirated goods in Latin America. The market used to be dominated by terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, who operated in the triborder area of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. Now the field is being overtaken by Mexican cartels, which already have so much control over the sale of pirated CDs, DVDs and software that many legitimate companies no longer even bother to distribute their full-price products in parts of Mexico.
Taking another page from traditional organized crime, cartels are also moving into extortion. A cartel representative will approach the owner of a business -- whether a pharmacy or a taco stand -- demanding a monthly stipend for ''protection.'' If those payments aren't made on time, the business is often burned to the ground, or the owner is threatened, kidnapped or killed.
A popular cartel racket involves branded products. For example, a cartel member -- most often from Los Zetas and La Familia Michoacana, two of the largest and most diversified cartels -- will tell a music-store owner that he has to sell CDs with the Zetas logo stamped on them, with the cartel taking a 25 percent cut of the profits. Noncompliance isn't an option.
With so many lines of business, it's unlikely that Mexican cartels would close up shop in the event of legalization, even if it meant a serious drop in profits from their most successful product. Cartels are economic entities, and like any legitimate company the best are able to adapt in the face of a changing market.
This is not to say that drug legalization shouldn't be considered for other reasons. We need to stop viewing casual users as criminals, and we need to treat addicts as people with health and emotional problems. Doing so would free up a significant amount of jail space, court time and law enforcement resources. What it won't do, though, is stop the violence in Mexico.

HEADLINE: All Units Are Unique, Some Uniquely So

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
REAL estate brokers often describe the properties they market as ''unique.'' (Roughly 99.9 percent of the time.)
But Tim Cass of the Corcoran Group, who is listing a $21.4 million penthouse at 50 Gramercy Park North this weekend, does have a point in this case.
An Icelandic couple bought two apartments in the building, a duplex and a simplex, in 2007. They paid a total of about $14 million, in cash. At the time, the $10.18 million investment in the duplex penthouse alone was one of the highest prices ever paid for an apartment south of 42nd Street. 
An Icelandic bank is now selling the penthouse, which it acquired for $22 million in February, property records show. The couple, Jon Asgeir Johannesson, the founder of the Baugur Group, a once wildly successful Icelandic holding company with investments in grocery, fashion and real estate, and Ingibjorg Palmadottir, now his wife, had intended to combine the duplex and the simplex on the floor below as a pied-a-terre, Mr. Cass said.
Then the global recession intervened, and the company suffered a reversal of fortune. The couple wound up renting out the $4 million simplex apartment, for $26,000 a month.
And here is where things get a little unusual: In February 2010, the renter filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court accusing the landlords, who had promised to equip the apartment with a kitchen in a timely fashion, of ''willfully'' installing an ''ugly'' kitchen with Ikea furniture. Ikea is generally known to ''offer low-budget furniture,'' the complaint read, and the renter argued that this kitchen was not only unsuitable in an Ian Schrager tower with expensive and lavish kitchens, but was ''the source of embarrassment for plaintiff and the subject of remarks by guests.''
The lawsuit, which has since been dismissed, stated that the renter suffered other indignities, including the discovery of 30 chewed-through chicken wings dropped onto the renter's terrace from the Icelandic couple's duplex while the renter had guests in attendance, according to the complaint.
The renter still lives in the unit, Mr. Cass said.
He had represented the couple in an unsuccessful attempt to sell the co-op, until it was taken off the market and then bought by the bank. He said the current asking price, more than double the original sale, was justified by the unlikelihood of a similar property's ever coming on the market, given that it has the amenities of a luxury hotel and a location on Gramercy Park.
Mr. Cass said he was happy to have the listing back, especially as the luxury market had picked up in recent months. The three-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath co-op has 4,235 square feet of space and ''quite a unique history,'' he said.
A Developer
On the Move Again
WELL, that was quick: William Lie Zeckendorf, a developer of 15 Central Park West, who made a $30 million profit on the sale of his penthouse in the building late last year, is already selling the new unit he bought in December, according to brokers familiar with his decision.
Brown Harris Stevens is listing his co-op at 927 Fifth Avenue, currently configured with five bedrooms and five and a half baths, for $31.5 million this weekend. Mr. Zeckendorf paid $29.1 million, records show; the seller was the estate of Bruce Wasserstein, the chairman and chief executive of Lazard who died in 2009. Given the list price, Mr. Zeckendorf obviously isn't expecting to realize the dizzying profits of his 15 Central Park West apartment, for which he paid $10 million. Brokers said the reasons for his selling again were unknown at this point. (Another well-known resident of the Fifth Avenue building: the red-tailed hawk Pale Male.)

HEADLINE: Costs Are High For Convictions Of Wrong People

BYLINE: By KARI LYDERSEN. 
klydersen@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
On a cool September evening in 1981, a 44-year-old woman was getting into her car on the roof level of a Rush Street parking garage when a man pushed her into the front seat, then beat and raped her as she struggled in vain to get a good look at him.
The man stuffed the bleeding woman into the trunk and tried to drive away, but he was stopped by an alert cashier who recognized the car but not the driver. When she heard the woman screaming and pounding from the trunk, the man jumped out of the car and ran.
A few days later, the cashier picked Jerry Miller out of a police lineup. Mr. Miller, who had never been arrested before, had been stopped by an officer in the area several days earlier while seeking a job at a doughnut shop. The officer thought he resembled the composite sketch of the rapist. 
Mr. Miller was convicted of rape, robbery and aggravated kidnapping and spent 25 years in prison. Robert Weeks, the man later linked to the rape by DNA evidence, went on to rape or assault four more women, injure police officers in three other attacks and commit other robberies and beatings over 23 years.
Mr. Weeks was eventually convicted of two of the rapes and sentenced to life in prison. Mr. Miller received $6.3 million in the settlement of a lawsuit against the city.
Mr. Miller's case is one of 85 analyzed in a sweeping report being released Monday by the Better Government Association and the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University School of Law.
The association, a nonprofit watchdog and advocacy group, said the study was the first to document the economic and social costs of the 85 convictions in the state that were overturned between 1989 -- the advent of modern DNA testing -- and 2010. In all, the study said, those wrongful convictions have cost Illinois taxpayers $214 million, and the amount will probably increase to $300 million once 16 pending lawsuits are settled.
''The public pays in multiple ways'' for errors or willful misconduct by law enforcement officials, said John Conroy, a veteran reporter, association senior investigator and co-writer of the report. ''The whole community pays when the real criminal is left on the street and goes out and commits other felonies.''
The perpetrators of crimes for which others were convicted went on to commit at least 94 more felonies, including 14 murders and 11 sexual assaults, according to the study. It said 83 men and 2 women spent a total of 926 years behind bars for crimes they did not commit.
''These numbers are dramatically high,'' said Thomas Sullivan, a former United States attorney and chairman of the Illinois Capital Punishment Reform Study Committee. ''If they are correct or anywhere near correct, it certainly is another indication of why special care is needed in these prosecutions to avoid convicting someone who's innocent and failing to convict someone who is guilty.''
In 81 of the 85 cases, the study found what it said was either misconduct or error by state officials -- in 66 cases by the police, in 44 by prosecutors and in 29 by forensic specialists.
''These aren't garbage men; these are highly trained police officers and prosecutors who passed bar exams and took an oath on the Bible to do their jobs,'' said Andy Shaw, executive director of the association. ''But they didn't.''
In Mr. Miller's case, his lawyers alleged police misconduct, including suppression of a photo lineup in which the parking garage cashier and another witness may have identified people other than Mr. Miller. The lawyers also said the state crime lab's early DNA testing was erroneous and was contradicted by independent experts.
Government bodies have paid $156 million in settlements or judgments in lawsuits over the wrongful convictions cited in the study, and $32 million in legal fees to private lawyers on those cases. The State Court of Claims has also paid $8 million in compensation for wrongful convictions. About $18.5 million has been spent incarcerating people later cleared of crimes.
In many wrongful convictions, the perpetrator has never been caught or even investigated, even if the police and prosecutors have clues to his identity. The study said law enforcement had an incentive not to go after the real criminal once a wrongful conviction had been revealed, because evidence that might come to light could be used in suits by wrongfully convicted people to show misconduct or incompetence.
The study recommended several reforms, including the videotaping of interrogations related to all violent crimes, not just murders; an overhaul of error-prone lineup procedures; a ban on court testimony by jailhouse informants; and increased transparency in the review process for complaints of police abuse. Mr. Shaw said the recommended reforms were standard practice in other states.
The wrongfully convicted have described the pain of losing years of their lives, their inability to visit family members who were dying, struggles to make a living after they were released and chronic mental and physical illness.
''The anger never goes away,'' said Alton Logan, who spent 26 years in prison after being convicted of killing a security guard in 1983.
After Andrew Wilson, a convicted police killer, died in prison in 2007, his lawyers revealed his sworn confession to killing the guard; attorney-client privilege prevented them from speaking up earlier, they said.
Mr. Logan, 57, is suing Jon Burge, a former Chicago police commander; the City of Chicago; and other city employees. Mr. Burge, now serving a four-and-a-half-year sentence for lying about police torture, was one of the officers who arrested Mr. Logan.
Like most of those exonerated, Mr. Logan got a payment from the Court of Claims -- in his case, $40,000. At his girlfriend's Bronzeville apartment last Sunday, he kept redoing the math on his cellphone calculator; he said he could not believe his compensation equaled about $30 per week of incarceration.
''You get much more than that on public aid,'' said his girlfriend, who asked that her name not be used.
Alan Beaman said he tried to understand how prosecutors who helped convict him of the 1995 murder of his ex-girlfriend could have failed to investigate another of her former boyfriends, a known drug dealer with a history of violence toward women.
In 2008, the Illinois Supreme Court overturned Mr. Beaman's conviction, ruling that prosecutors violated his constitutional rights by failing to reveal evidence regarding that former boyfriend and otherwise misleading the jury.
At a dress rehearsal at the Starlight Studio and Theater at Rock Valley College in Rockford last week, Mr. Beaman, 38 and now a theater employee, adjusted more than a hundred colored lights as a Prohibition-era romp played out onstage.
He said he struggled to catch up on the lighting technology that had developed during his 13 years in prison. Had he not been locked up, Mr. Beaman said, he believes he could have achieved his dream -- a full-time theater job -- by now.
''That was a crime committed against me that made me lose 13 years of my life,'' he said.

PERSON: Jim Rodnunsky 

HEADLINE: Jim Rodnunsky Dies at 54; Created Camera of Thrills

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
Jim Rodnunsky, whose film work above the Canadian ski slopes resulted in the Cablecam, a rope-mounted, remote-control camera system that provides overhead and rapid-moving shots for televised sporting events and films, died on June 10 at his home in Granada Hills, Calif. He was 54.
The cause was brain cancer, said his wife, Lisa. 
Cablecam, a device that is familiar to television viewers, slithers across the screen like a marauding insect on broadcasts of football games, horse races and other events, giving spectators swooping, eagle-eye views of quarterbacks maneuvering in the pocket and roaring packs of racecars zooming around tight curves.
But it is not the only technology designed to do so. A predecessor, Skycam, invented by Garrett Brown (who also invented the Steadicam), is still in use in sports television; the two devices, which yield similar images, were once competitors, but they are now owned by the same company, Outdoor Channel Holdings.
''I taught him Steadicam operating at one of our workshops in the early '80s,'' Mr. Brown recalled about Mr. Rodnunsky in an e-mail. ''We have been friendly 'flying camera' rivals for 20 years.''
Still, there are a number of differences between the two camera systems, though both are used by television networks.
''It's really a matter of the preference of the individual director,'' said Ben Simpson, Cablecam's vice president for operations.
Cablecam uses a system of synthetic ropes rather than optical cables to support and guide the cameras through the air, and it can carry more weight, meaning it can support the larger cameras used in big-budget moviemaking and is generally preferred by film companies and directors.
Since 1989, Cablecam has been used in dozens of music videos, commercials and Hollywood features, including ''Con Air,'' ''True Lies,'' ''Batman Begins'' and ''Hook,'' Steven Spielberg's take on Peter Pan. Mr. Rodnunsky, along with others, earned three Academy Awards for the continuing development of the device as a filmmaking tool.
Mr. Rodnunsky, formerly a professional freestyle skier, was seeking film images for the development of a skiing simulator in the late 1980s when Cablecam was born. To film skiers above the Saudan Couloir at Blackcomb Mountain in British Columbia, he rigged a system of ropes fitted with an aluminum basket as high as 80 feet above the ski run and, with a partner (who was responsible for plying the brakes), hurtled down the mountain, feet first, face down, running a camera. He founded a company, Cablecam International, which was hired for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.
''Originally, the system was hydraulically controlled,'' Mr. Simpson said. ''It had a 2,000-pound man-dolly, with two people riding in it. It was what we called a one-axis system'' -- that is, it could move along only one path -- ''and over time, it transitioned to electronic winches and a rope-based system with gyroscopic levelers, remotely controlled.''
James Lewis Rodnunsky was born July 18, 1956, in Edmonton, Alberta; his father, Albert, was a concert pianist and the founding conductor of the Lethbridge Symphony Orchestra in Alberta. He moved as a teenager to California and graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he studied political science and economics. He studied photography and acting, competed professionally as a freestyle skier and worked in television as a film editor.
In addition to his wife, the former Lisa Cooperstein, whom he married in 1996, he is survived by two brothers, Serge, of Calabasas, Calif., and Pierre, of Simi Valley, Calif.; a son, Daniel; and two daughters, Tatiana and Alexandra.
He met his wife, a former ski instructor, in New York City while she was working as a magazine executive; she had shown up at a fitness club where he was installing his skiing simulator. At their wedding, a cake in the shape of Vail Mountain was served.
''He skied on the simulator in his tuxedo,'' Mrs. Rodnunsky said.
Online Correction: June 18, 2011, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the location of Saudan Couloir. It is at Blackcomb Mountain, not Blackstone Mountain.

HEADLINE: How Divorce Lost Its Groove

BYLINE: By PAMELA PAUL

 BODY:
A COUPLE of months ago, Susan Gregory Thomas, a writer in Brooklyn, was at a friend's 40th birthday party when she was approached by a woman familiar to her ''from the whole Park Slope mommy culture.''
''So you're Susie Thomas,'' the woman practically shrieked upon introduction. ''You're famous.'' Taken aback, Ms. Thomas asked what she meant.
The woman swiftly backpedaled. ''Oh, you just come up in these conversations all the time,'' she said.
''I was like, just give me the hemlock,'' Ms. Thomas, 42, recalled. 
Though she wasn't entirely surprised. Ever since her divorce three years ago, Ms. Thomas said, she has been antisocial, ''nervous about what people would say.''
After all, she had gone from Park Slope matron, complete with involved husband (''We had cracked the code of Gen X peer parenthood'') and gut-renovated brownstone, to ''a Red Hook divorcee,'' she said, remarried with a new baby and two children-of-divorce barely out of preschool. ''All of a sudden, this community I'd lived in for 13 years became this spare and mean savannah,'' she said.
It was as if, she said, everyone she knew felt bad for her but no one wanted to be near her, either. Even though adultery was not part of the equation, Ms. Thomas said, ''I feel like I have a giant letter A on my front and back.''
That a woman who has been divorced should feel such awkwardness and isolation seems more part of a Todd Haynes set piece than a scene from ''families come in all shapes and sizes'' New York, circa 2011. But divorce statistics, which have followed a steady downward slope since their 1980 peak, reveal another interesting trend: According to a 2010 study by the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, only 11 percent of college-educated Americans divorce within the first 10 years today, compared with almost 37 percent for the rest of the population.
For this cross section of American families -- in the suburban playgrounds of Seattle, the breastfeeding-friendly coffee shops of Berkeley, Calif., and the stroller-trodden streets of the Upper West Side -- divorce, especially for mothers with young children underfoot, has become relatively scarce since its ''Ice Storm'' heyday.
For every cohort since 1980, a greater proportion are reaching their 10th and 15th anniversaries, said Stephanie Coontz, author of ''Marriage, a History.''
Teresa DiFalco, a 41-year-old mother of two from a suburb of Portland, Ore., recalled being shocked when her husband wanted to split up three years ago.
''I had this sense of: 'You're kidding me. We have children. It's not allowed,' '' she said. Divorce was not a part of her children's landscape, Ms. DiFalco said. Her son had just one acquaintance whose parents were divorced, her daughter none.
Similarly, Molly Monet, a professor of Spanish at Mount Holyoke College who separated from her husband in 2007, said she felt out of sync, ''like the ultimate bad mom.''
''Now my children were from a 'broken home,' '' she said. ''My first response was, Is this going to devastate the kids?''
Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University, said: ''The shift in attitudes and behavior is very real. Among upper-middle-class Americans, the divorce rate is going down, and they're becoming more conservative toward divorce.''
Dr. Cherlin, author of ''The Marriage-Go-Round: The State of Marriage and Family in America Today,'' attributes the swing to multiple factors, among them, a generational makeover.
It's as if the children of Manhattan and Roslyn, N.Y., and Bethesda, Md., reflected on their parents' sloppy divorces and said, ''Not me.'' For Ms. Thomas, whose parents separated when she was 12, ''Divorce had pretty much defined everything in my life.'' In her divorce memoir, ''In Spite of Everything,'' to be published this summer, Ms. Thomas recalls telling her ex-husband many times during their 16-year marriage, ''Whatever happens, we're never going to get divorced.''
Now that the children of a divorce generation have grown up and have children of their own, it is inevitable some will divorce, despite their worst fears and best intentions. Most marriages that end in divorce fall apart in the first 10 years. But according to the widely cited Marriage Project study last year, among college-educated couples who married in the mid-1990s, the likelihood of divorcing in the first 10 years of marriage fell 27 percent compared with college-educated couples who married in the 1970s.
In a 2008 survey, only 17 percent of college-educated Americans agreed with the statement, ''Marriage has not worked out for most people I know,'' compared with 58 percent among the less educated.
The experience of being a divorced woman has changed, along with the statistics. ''The No. 1 reaction I get from people when I tell them I'm getting divorced is, 'You're so brave,' '' said Stephanie Dolgoff, a 44-year-old mother of two elementary-school daughters who was separated last year. ''In the 1970s, when a woman got divorced, she was seen as taking back her life in that Me Decade way. Nowadays, it's not seen as liberating to divorce. It's scary.''
Ms. Coontz, whose most recent book, ''A Strange Stirring: The Feminine Mystique and Women at the Dawn of the 1960s,'' examines the changes in marital expectations for women, said that for many women of that earlier era: ''Divorce was freedom. Many of these marriages in the '70s were fundamentally unequal. With the women's movements, they learned that there were alternatives, and that made divorce kind of a liberation.''
But in an era of peer marriages, in which both partners are expected to contribute and truck along, that mentality appears to have diminished. As noted by the National Marriage Project study, ''Highly educated Americans have moved in a more marriage-minded direction, despite the fact that historically, they have been more socially liberal.''
''What happened?'' asks the writer Claire Dederer in her memoir, ''Poser,'' which examines life as a new mother in Seattle. In the 1970s, ''the feminists, the hippies, the protesters, the cultural elite all said, It's O.K. to drop out.'' In contrast, ''We made up our minds, my brother and I and so many of the grown children of the runaway moms, that we would put our families first and ourselves second. We would be good, all the time. We would stay married, no matter what, and drink organic milk.''
Which takes us back to brownstone Brooklyn.
''One of the hardest things about divorce today is that you feel like you have to explain or apologize for it,'' said Stacy Morrison, author of ''Falling Apart in One Piece,'' another divorce memoir. (Did anyone even write searing divorce memoirs in the '70s?)
''The notion of divorce has become one of failure again,'' said Ms. Morrison, 42, a resident of Park Slope. ''It used to be, 'You're free, rock on!' Now it's, 'You couldn't make it work, you failed.' '' Ms. Morrison described people's reaction as ''the two-second blink'' when she says something along the lines of, ''Zack is with his father today.''
Among a certain demographic, marriage is viewed as something that, like work-life balance, yoga and locavore cuisine, needs to be continually worked at and improved upon. When Ms. Dolgoff tells others about her divorce, their response, with disquieting frequency, is ''Yes, well, marriage is hard'' as in, ''You knew that getting in.''
Blogs and child-rearing books suggest a subtle -- and sometimes not-so-subtle -- social pressure to tough it out. From the 1970s to the 2000s, the percentage of highly educated Americans who believe that divorce should be made more difficult rose from 36 to 48 percent.
''It could be that among college-educated couples, the men are behaving better and the wives aren't as interested in getting out,'' said Andrew Hacker, a professor emeritus at Queens College who has written frequently about social currents. ''Guys are doing more cooking, and they're not bad at it!''
(Indeed, according to many divorced men, now more involved in their children's lives than their predecessors, they do not feel the same level of scrutiny.)
The shift contains an economic as well as a social component.
''That this change has occurred mainly among the affluent suggests it's not just a reaction to the divorce epidemic of the '70s,'' Dr. Cherlin said. ''The condemnation of divorce is also coming from the group that is most confident it can make its marriages succeed, and that allows them to be dismissive of divorce.''
From this perspective, splitting up with tender, vulnerable children in the mix is seen as a parental infraction.
''I've definitely experienced judgment,'' said Priscilla Gilman, author of a new memoir, ''The Anti-Romantic Child,'' which deals in large part with her 2006 divorce. ''Everyone said: 'Isn't there anything more you can do? Your kids need you to be together. They're so little.' '' At the time, Ms. Gilman knew only one other person who was divorced. ''I had progressive, feminist friends. None of them were getting divorced, none of them.''
Several divorced women suggested that the news of their marital unraveling seemed to unnerve other couples in their social circles, prompting unease about their own marriages. (That anxiety may not be entirely unfounded. One study out of Harvard, Brown and the University of California, San Diego, last year found that divorce actually is contagious: when close friends break up, the odds of a marital split among their friends increase by 75 percent.)
''There has been a striking shift in both beliefs and behavior towards marriage among educated and affluent Americans,'' said W. Bradford Wilcox, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Virginia and director of the National Marriage Project. ''There's a tacit or explicit recognition among well-educated parents that their kids are less likely to thrive if Mom and Dad can't be together.''
Is this, then, the revenge of the children-of-divorce generation, rebelling against the experiences of their mothers and fathers? When I asked people who divorced in their 20s and 30s while researching my 2002 book, ''The Starter Marriage,'' about why they divorced with such alacrity, the response was near universal: ''I wanted to do it before it was too late -- before we had kids.''
Whereas their parents were divorce pioneers in the '70s, unsure of how marital dissolution affected children and letting caution blow in the wind, today's splitting couples are viscerally aware of how divorce feels to a 7-year-old.
''Since the 1990s, we've been trying to come up with a process that is more emotionally humane and accounts for the interests of children,'' said Joanna Roth, a Harvard-educated lawyer in Seattle who entered divorce law after she and her husband split up. ''The parents I see through this process have their children foremost in mind.''
Dr. Monet, of Mount Holyoke, and her ex-husband eat dinner together on Fridays with their 9-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter. Birthdays and holidays are spent in each other's company.
''Once I realized that we could raise the kids together and still be a family,'' said Dr. Monet, who started a blog called Postcards From a Peaceful Divorce last year, ''I realized it wasn't divorce that's devastating, it's the way divorce is handled.''
When Nina Collins, 41, a former literary agent, divorced her husband, she said both her lawyer and therapist emphasized: ''Divorce is completely different from when your parents split up. If your kids feel loved and they don't see hideous behavior, they'll be fine.''
''Of course, there's still trauma,'' Ms. Collins said. ''But I think it's gotten a lot more humane for everyone.''
A common belief is that if the divorce is done properly, the children benefit more from the separation than from living in a family with a compromised marriage. Ms. Gilman, echoing the sentiments of many divorced mothers, said, ''In the end, I actually think it was a very positive thing we did for the kids.''
In another unexpected twist, some divorced women say they detect an unspoken envy. Other wives and mothers, they explained, were ''battling it out'' while dealing with the unceasing tasks of wifedom, motherhood and work.
''What I get from a number of married women in my community is jealousy of my new lifestyle,'' Dr. Monet said. ''Dating, going to yoga five times a week, having time for myself. Raising young kids with a spouse doesn't afford you much time.''
Ms. Morrison also sees a subtle, unexpected reaction. ''Among my college friends and my closest friends, I'm still the only one who's divorced,'' she said. ''In a funny way, I think I may have turned into the groovy one.''
That does not necessarily make divorced motherhood any easier.
''I spent an enormous amount of energy making everything friendly and loving with my ex and his wife,'' said Isabel Gillies, an actress who is following up her divorce memoir, ''Happens Every Day,'' with a book about divorce's aftermath, ''A Year and Six Seconds.''
When her ex-husband visits their children in Manhattan from Ohio, he and his wife stay in Ms. Gillies's apartment and she moves out.
''It's a bit more seamless than it was in the '70s,'' she said. ''Instead of the kids back and forthing, we're the ones who maneuver.''
Enter the latchkey moms.

HEADLINE: Standing Up to the King

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
CASABLANCA, Morocco
Perhaps no Arab ruler responded as wisely to this year's pro-democracy protests as the king of Morocco -- although that is an exceptionally low bar.
When other dictators in the Arab world answered protesters with gunfire, King Mohammed VI grudgingly accepted demonstrations, at least when he was in a good mood. His regime claimed that antigovernment activism underscored the country's openness, and on Friday the king announced constitutional reforms that seem likely to reduce his own role in governing the country.
These days, as much of the Arab Spring has faded into an Arab winter of repression, Morocco still feels fairly spring-like. You can tell that from the denunciations of the regime thundered freely on the streets. 
''We're not a democracy,'' Sami Mellanki, of the Moroccan Association of Human Rights, told me emphatically. ''Morocco is a police state!''
Well, yes, Morocco remains repressive and utterly undemocratic. But in most police states, people don't dare call it that -- at least not with their names attached. Fouzy Houssan, a high school student activist wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt and looking like a protester from central casting, told me that the government was undoubtedly watching us -- and then carefully and fearlessly spelled out his name for me to use.
I'm starting my annual win-a-trip journey, with a student, Saumya Dave, and a teacher, Noreen Connolly. We're beginning in Morocco partly because it's a somewhat hopeful entry point to Africa.
Morocco was once an exceedingly brutal tyranny, but it began to moderate in the 1990s. King Mohammed eased up further on human rights abuses after taking power in 1999. He released many political prisoners, allowed a truth and reconciliation commission, and promoted women's rights. Under the king's auspices, Morocco even has begun training female Islamic clerics, a bit like imams, called Mourchidat.
Yet the opening has been inconsistent, new political prisoners have been tossed into jails, freedom of the press is still a dream, and repression is particularly suffocating in the Western Sahara region that Morocco annexed while Spain was giving up its colony there. King Mohammed's reign has also overseen a staggering rise in economic corruption. An American diplomatic cable, released through WikiLeaks, suggests that the palace uses government institutions ''to coerce and solicit bribes.''
Indignant citizens used Facebook to organize major protests early this year. The king (who declined to be interviewed) seemed to take heed, for in March he promised substantial reforms.
His speech on Friday was an outline of what will change under a revised constitution. Among the reforms are a supposedly independent judiciary, a prime minister with increased powers, and official recognition of the minority Berber language. It amounts to a step away from autocracy, though not nearly creating the democracy that protesters want.
It's troubling that even as the king has been talking about reform, he has engaged in a violent crackdown on peaceful protesters in the last few months. One demonstrator died, apparently from his injuries. But the repression was just harsh enough to inflame protesters, not terrifying enough to scare them into staying home.
''Everybody gets hit,'' Aymane Aoudi, a 20-year-old college student and activist, told me. ''They even hit women and children.''
Another student, Imad Iddine Habib, proudly told me that he had been arrested three times this spring, and beaten two of those times. But the beatings become badges of honor among young people -- more of an inducement to protest than a deterrent.
The king perhaps realized that he was digging himself deeper, because this month the regime has mostly refrained from beatings. The government now seems at a turning point.
The king can follow Bahrain's example and use extreme violence to crush protesters. Or he can grit his teeth and put up with them -- but then he will have to endure more criticism and accept more compromises.
If he does embark on wider democratic reform, he could make Morocco -- already a pretty remarkable and wonderful country, where the semi-banned Islamist movement is so mellow that it has a female spokesman who advocates for women's rights -- even more of a trailblazer. Morocco would show Middle Eastern rulers that they can respond to popular pressure with ballots rather than bullets.
In my conversations with protesters here, I keep noting how much better off they are than those in Syria or Yemen. But they don't care about that: they keep noting how repressed they are compared with Americans or Europeans. Maybe Morocco can help bridge that gap.
I don't know if King Mohammed will do the right thing, but there's a whisker of hope. If he moves over time toward turning Morocco into a British-style limited monarchy, that might be a historic step from a stormy Arab Spring to a balmy Arab summer.

HEADLINE: Bay Area Underground Market Draws Authorities' Notice

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
For the past two years, the San Francisco Underground Market has served up bacon-laced chocolates, sea salt and chili truffles, and other haute fringe food.
But on June 11, the monthly market, which now draws more than a thousand visitors, received an unwelcome serving of its own: a cease and desist order from the San Francisco Department of Public Health. 
The market had positioned itself as a members-only club to circumvent the department's retail food-safety permitting process.
''They have significantly changed the scope of their operations,'' raising health concerns, said Dr. Rajiv Bhatia, the director of environmental health for the health department. ''If you have untrained vendors selling food to 1,200 people, you have a high-risk situation.''
The market, founded by ForageSF, a business dedicated to wild food, has been held in a warehouse-size gallery space in the city's Mission District that has applied for a permit but not yet received one.
The market started small but has become a kind of foodie phenomenon. The idea has been to provide an incubator for the Bay Area's fledgling food entrepreneurs, many of them young people who said they could not afford the steep fees of a conventional farmers' market.
The department has not received complaints of illness, Dr. Bhatia said, but given the popularity of the market -- arguably no longer ''underground'' -- it now does not qualify as a club but is a retail food establishment under state law and subject to the standard permit process.
A permit requires that food be derived from ''traceable sources,'' he said, and cooked in an approved commercial kitchen.
Recent deaths in Germany from organic bean sprouts contaminated with E. coli have underscored the need for vigilance, Dr. Bhatia said -- in this case, the issue of ''keeping things hot or cold, and how you clean the spoon between servings.''
''We value micro-enterprise,'' he added. ''We have 6,000 food establishments doing creative things in San Francisco.''
Iso Rabins, 30, the market's founder, said Friday that he planned to meet with the city attorney to discuss how the market might be ''legitimized,'' possibly by establishing a communal commercial kitchen.
''It's a chance to take the next step,'' he said. ''It's an opportunity to start a conversation.''
The city is open to working with the market on potential solutions, which might include a collective permit, Dr. Bhatia said.
Ahram Kim, 35, whose culinary piece de resistance is pork sausage topped with kimchi, has his own theory about the crackdown. ''I immediately thought: 'Of course. The state is broke,' '' he said.

MALCOLM X
A Life of Reinvention
By Manning Marable
Illustrated. 594 pp. Viking. $30.
''His aura was too bright,'' the poet Maya Angelou said of her first meeting with Malcolm X. ''His masculine force affected me physically. A hot desert storm eddied around him and rushed to me, making my skin contract, and my pores slam shut.'' Malcolm X had that same sort of bone-deep, visceral impact on America. He got under everyone's skin -- either in the sense that he seeped into your pores and transformed you the way the great love of your life does, or in the sense that he annoyed or scared the living hell out of you. There is no middle ground with Malcolm. If you hate him or distrust him, you should consider giving him another try: officers assigned to monitor the wiretaps on his phones sometimes ended up being flipped, because close listening led them to believe that his programs and philosophies were sensible and righteous and that law enforcement agencies should not have been working against him at all. 
And while Malcolm's ideas changed America, his life journey has captivated us even more. He went from a petty criminal and drug user to a long-term prisoner to an influential minister to a separatist political activist to a humanist to a martyr. Throughout his life he continually grew upward, unafraid to challenge or refute what he believed, giving hope that any of us can rise above even our deepest convictions to become better people.
The prime document that has kept Malcolm's story alive over the dec/ades since his assassination in 1965 is ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X.'' That book has changed countless lives and made Malcolm a central influence on generations of black men who admire his force, his courage, his brilliance, and his way of merging the protean trickster and the bold intellectual activist and the inspiring preacher. But all autobiographies are, in part, lies. They rely on memory, which is notoriously fallible, and are shaped by self-image. They don't really tell us who you are but whom you want the world to see you as. Did Malcolm X consciously lie in his autobiography? In some cases, yes -- he wanted us to believe he was a bigger criminal than he actually was, so that his growth into a Nation of Islam figure would seem a much more dramatic change. He also wanted us to think it was a friend who did sexual things with another man and not Malcolm himself. Sometimes he just left out details that didn't fit his political agenda or the literary agenda of his co-author, Alex Haley. Some of those choices were right for what they were creating.
For a more complete and unvarnished -- yet still inspiring -- version of Malcolm's life, there's ''Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention,'' by the late Columbia scholar Manning Marable. It's the product of more than 10 years of work and draws on Malcolm's letters and diaries; the results of surveillance conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York Police Department; and interviews with Malcolm's contemporaries, including Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, whom Marable talked to for nine hours. Farrakhan has said that Malcolm was like ''the father I never had.''
The loudest rumor before the book's release was that it would shed light on Malcolm's secret homosexual past. When he's a young hustler, we find him apparently being paid to do things with one rich, older white man, but this moment is brief and anticlimactic and does not convey the impression that Malcolm was bisexual. Besides, there are far more titillating things in this book, which dives deep into Malcolm's sex life. Marable obtained a letter Malcolm wrote in 1959 to Elijah Muhammad, then the leader of the Nation of Islam, in which he complains about his wife, Betty Shabazz: ''At a time when I was going all out to keep her satisfied (sexually), one day she told me that we were incompatible sexually because I had never given her any real satisfaction.'' Marable describes Malcolm as a virulent misogynist and a horribly neglectful husband who repeatedly got his wife pregnant, perhaps to keep her from making good on threats to cuckold him, and also made a habit of leaving for days or months immediately after the birth of each child.
That's a Malcolm we all haven't seen before. Meanwhile, the Malcolm we do know starts coming into view far earlier than expected, given that he's known for metamorphosis. Born in Omaha in 1925, Malcolm was drilled as a child in the principles of Marcus Garvey -- nationalism, separatism, Pan-Africanism, black pride, self-reliance, economic self-/empowerment -- by his parents, Earl and Louise Little. Malcolm's father was a particularly powerful role model: a devoted Garveyite who in 1930s Michigan stood up for what was right for black people, even in the face of death threats, and then paid for his bravery with a gruesome end. The apple did not fall far at all. And as a young man working the streets of Harlem, Malcolm came to know most of the stars of '40s jazz and absorbed their example, learning to use pace, tone and space in jazz/like ways and perhaps to become a sort of jazzman of the spoken word. ''He lived the existence of an itinerant musician,'' Marable writes, ''traveling constantly from city to city, standing night after night on the stage, manipulating his melodic tenor voice as an instrument. He was consciously a performer, who presented himself as the vessel for conveying the anger and impatience the black masses felt.''
As Malcolm moved away from the insular religiosity of the Nation of Islam, which at the time counseled members not to vote, and into political issues, his relationship with Elijah Muhammad began to rupture. Many know that Muhammad's womanizing -- the married minister fathered children with several young women -- was one cause of the break between them, but few know how close their sexual paths ran. Evelyn Williams, one of the most fascinating characters in the book, fell in love with Malcolm when he was a street hustler, then moved to Harlem and joined the Nation after he became a minister. Malcolm proposed to her but changed his mind days later. After he became engaged to Betty, Williams ran screaming from the mosque. She was soon sent to Chicago to work for Muhammad and later had his baby.
That must have been painful for Malcolm, but Marable does not cite Muhammad's womanizing as the main reason Malcolm broke with the Nation. Instead, he points to an incident in Los Angeles in 1962, when police officers burst into a mosque and shot seven Nation members, killing one and paralyzing another. Malcolm moved to create a squad that would assassinate members of the Los Angeles Police Department, and when Muhammad vetoed that idea, Malcolm lost faith in him, wondering if he really cared about his people's lives. Right there the bond was irreparably shattered. Later, Malcolm told Farrakhan, a protege turned rival, about Muhammad's affairs, a conversation Farrakhan said he would have to report to the minister. This set Malcolm's death spiral in motion.
Malcolm saw the end coming months in advance. He said, ''There are a lot of people after me. . . . They're bound to get me.'' He spoke of living like a man who was already dead. He survived narrowly several times and yet did nothing to insulate himself. He could've moved to Africa for a few years, could've used armed bodyguards, could've had the audiences at his rallies searched, could've carried a weapon. But he did nothing, even as his inner circle screamed that he needed protection. Some who were close to him wonder if Malcolm wanted to die or if he had embraced death as an inevitability. Marable names the men who killed Malcolm and describes his last moments in such excruciatingly visual detail that it could bring tears or cause nightmares. He makes it plain that Nation of Islam figures ordered the killing, planned it and carried it out, but he also speculates that both the man who ordered it and the man who fired the fatal shot may have been F.B.I. informants. Did the bureau have Malcolm killed? Did it stand by and knowingly let him be killed? Marable is unsure.
As the book reveals, the F.B.I. struggled with how to deal with Malcolm -- i.e., how to discredit him -- because he was so disciplined, so law-/abiding and too smart to actually create the violence that would allow him to be arrested. Marable shows us Malcolm in Africa, watched by the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., and points out ''the David-versus-Goliath dimension'': ''Malcolm had few resources and was traveling without bodyguards, yet the attorney general and the F.B.I. director were so fearful of what he alone might accomplish that they searched for any plausible grounds to arrest and pros/ecute him upon his return.'' Of course, they found nothing. Similarly, an exhaustive biographer combing through Malcolm's days pulls away the curtain to show us the entirety of his life, and the emperor remains clothed. He has some failings, but Malcolm is still the empowering figure his autobiography showed us he was.

HEADLINE: How People's Opera Orchestrated Its Peril

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN and DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
AT first glance New York City Opera would appear to have been blessed with a full chorus of advantages.
For 46 years it was a fixture at Lincoln Center, operating at the city's premier cultural hub in an elegant theater overlooking the plaza fountain. Most of its utility expenses were paid by the city, which owns the building.
It split other expenses with the New York City Ballet, which shares the space. And when the opera sought a renovation, a generous donor and the city stepped forward with $125 million to pay for it.
But now, less than two years after that expensive makeover, City Opera is homeless. Last month the company announced that it is leaving Lincoln Center for stages unknown because it can no longer afford to operate there. 
A review of the opera's financial records reveals yawning, longstanding gaps between its income and its expenses. Though the company has been critically acclaimed, internal documents show its performances now run less than half full on average, and its net assets have plummeted by more than 80 percent in the past seven years to $9.6 million.
How did one of New York's major cultural attractions, an institution that Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia called ''the people's opera'' and that cultivated young stars like Placido Domingo and Beverly Sills, fall so far?
Times are tough for arts organizations across the country, but City Opera became particularly vulnerable. For years it lived beyond its means, exhibiting a brand of financial carelessness that largely went unnoticed until the economic downturn and the company's own bad bets made the pattern plain, financial records and dozens of interviews with past and present opera officials show.
Deficits have been mounting since 2003, a situation that has led some to call the opera's new logo of a black dot ''the black hole.''
''The company over a long period of time grew much larger than it could afford to be,'' said Michael M. Kaiser, the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, who in 2009 served as an unpaid adviser to City Opera.
And then a few years ago the opera's board members -- who many contend did not do enough to control expenses or build revenue -- made a fateful decision: pressing forward with the renovations, which required them to shut down productions and all but eliminate ticket revenue for the year that ended in June 2009.
Ticket sales, which had been about $14 million annually, never recovered.
For the past two seasons the company has run a much smaller schedule in its 2,600 seat theater -- about 40 performances, down from more than 100. It realized $3 million in annual ticket revenues, which covered 10 percent of its budget.
In 2000, by contrast, ticket sales covered nearly half of the company's expenses.
''City Opera's programming failed to engage its audience because it was dark for a season and then came back with esoteric choices that didn't suit the people's opera,'' said Joseph Volpe, the former general manager of the Metropolitan Opera. ''If you can't sell tickets, you can't raise money.''
Given the opera's fixed costs, which account for a large portion of its $31 million budget, did it make sense to reduce the schedule?
''You do more shows, you lose more money,'' said City Opera's general manager and artistic director, George R. Steel. ''You have to raise money to cover the difference.'' Mr. Steel said sluggish ticket sales were not the primary financial problem, though; it was the opera's unsuccessful attempt to raise more money. ''The shortfall in ticket sales did not make or break the budget this year,'' he said.
Mr. Steel said the opera has now embraced a scaled-down business model that will liberate it artistically and financially, and lift the burden of filling so many seats.
But many are questioning the opera's viability after it leaves Lincoln Center. If it does survive, it will be as a modest, itinerant troupe far removed from its glory days.
''It's obviously a huge gamble,'' said John Allison, the editor of Opera magazine in London. ''When a company is associated with one place, getting an audience to follow is a tough thing.''
Several major figures in City Opera's history are concerned that the company's departure from Lincoln Center could signal the beginning of the end. ''An absolute world cultural capital like New York cannot afford to let an institution like City Opera fail,'' said Placido Domingo, who had early successes there. ''It would be a blot on the reputation of the city.''
But there's also a larger question: Can New York, like London and Berlin, sustain more than one major opera company?
It has for nearly 70 years, with City Opera operating alongside the Metropolitan Opera with a mandate to present more progressive, affordable productions and promote American singers.
But between 2000 and 2008 City Opera's budget grew by nearly 30 percent to $46 million, even as its revenues were stagnant. For a few years the company was saved by large, last-minute donations. When the situation became truly grim in 2008, the opera secured permission from the New York attorney general to take cash from its endowment for operating expenses, an extreme measure that undercut its long-term financial health.
The company's new chairman, Charles R. Wall, who took over in January, said the budget must be balanced in the future. But opera can be an expensive endeavor.
Much of the current $31 million budget is spent on salaries, many of them set by union contracts' minimums. Add to that the cost of scenery, costumes and props, along with marketing and fund-raising.
''The company has tried any number of approaches to build income to match the expense side,'' Mr. Steel said. ''They've all been unsuccessful.''
Fund-raising has been flat, though in the past year, Mr. Steel said, donations rose to a projected $18 million, up $3 million from last year. Still, that was well short of the $22 million that had been budgeted.
Critics say City Opera has not done enough to attract new blood to its board, and that trustees have failed to support the opera's long-term health adequately. This year, as of April, board members had contributed $6.8 million outside of special events, a mediocre amount for a New York cultural institution of City Opera's size. Recently, though, Mr. Wall -- the City Opera chairman and a former Philip Morris executive -- donated another $2.5 million.
At least some of the company's drift is attributable to a period when it operated without hands-on leadership.
When Paul Kellogg departed as general manager in May 2007, his successor, Gerard Mortier, directed the company for more than a year from Paris, where he had another job. He visited New York four days a month but resigned in November 2008 in a budget dispute with the board.
Mr. Steel, who had just spent 14 weeks running the Dallas Opera, took over in January 2009. He had previously run the Miller Theater at Columbia University, a small house with a modest budget that did relatively little opera. Some have questioned whether Mr. Steel and the team he brought in had the requisite experience or programming vision.
Last year's eclectic mix of productions -- including an updated Donizetti; a Leonard Bernstein New York premiere; a new work by the composer of the Broadway musical ''Wicked,'' Stephen Schwartz; a lesser-known Strauss; and a bill of three contemporary one-acts -- failed to catch on with traditional operagoers or audiences seeking something new.
''Has anyone ever heard of any of those things they were selling?'' said Carol Vaness, the soprano and a onetime City Opera star. ''They didn't do the operas people wanted to see.'' Meanwhile the Met also had begun to present more daring productions and to make opera available to the masses in movie theaters.
Mr. Steel defended his choices. ''Operas we've put onstage the last two years make a powerful artistic case for the company, and they have met with extraordinary audience acclaim and critical acclaim,'' he said.
Most agree that a decisive factor in the company's fortunes was what has come to be known as the Mortier debacle. In the spring of 2006 City Opera's chairwoman, Susan Baker, attended a dinner at the French consulate in New York. She was in the market for a new leader since Mr. Kellogg had announced his departure. Seated next to her was Mr. Mortier, the charming Belgian opera impresario.
City Opera's finances were already in the red, with an operating deficit of $8 million, and there was talk of a move. For years the company complained about the acoustics at its theater and sought a permanent home to escape the shadow of the Met and establish a separate identity.
Mr. Mortier said he could help City Opera, and he was hired the next year. His plan was a reimagining that would require a budget of $60 million, one third more than the company had ever spent.
Mr. Mortier also said that, rather than move, the opera should stay and renovate. A donor, David H. Koch, the conservative business leader and philanthropist, agreed to cover most of the renovation costs. But how would the opera replace the ticket revenue when it shut down?
Publicly the board said it would stage concert performances off site and step up fund-raising. Privately, according to Mr. Mortier, the company planned to use the endowment and replace it down the road.
''You first have to show people something before you get the money,'' he said in an interview.
But the board was unable to raise anywhere near the $60 million Mr. Mortier said he was promised. In 2008 when he was presented with a $34 million budget, he quit, saying he couldn't transform the company on such an amount.
The renovation went forward anyway. In the prior season the opera had lost $12 million. Now the company shut down for its 2008-9 season, and its total revenue dropped by half. Fund-raising could not keep pace with the losses.
City Opera tried to cut costs and shaved $20 million from its budget. It still ended up with a $10.7 million deficit for the year. The only way to close the gap was to raid its endowment and it did, using $23.5 million to cover expenses.
Last month when City Opera said it was leaving Lincoln Center, it gave no clue as to where it might end up. Mr. Steel said its plans will be made public in a few weeks.
Wherever it goes, City Opera will drastically contract. Mr. Steel said he hopes to reduce the operating budget to $13 million from $31 million, in part through administrative restructuring and renegotiated union contracts.
Already he has eliminated 14 of the 48 administrative jobs. But his work to rethink the company has been complicated by the resignations of two members of his inner circle, the chief financial officer and the director of artistic planning.
Can a shrunken, wandering company attract big audiences, major donors and star singers? Experts said the cachet of Lincoln Center had helped the opera draw crowds and provided a prestigious hall for fund-raising galas.
Still, Mr. Steel said he is not worried. ''I hope to be known as the general manager who found a new stable footing for City Opera,'' he said.
The move, he said, frees City Opera from the ''the cultural gigantism that created Lincoln Center'' and the pressure to do big works to fill the house. ''The new model is both financially stable and artistically liberating,'' he said. ''It's an incredibly exciting prospect.''
Joseph V. Melillo, the executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy of Music -- a prospective site for future City Opera performances -- agreed that a peripatetic City Opera was viable. ''Opera and music can be performed in new and unusual places throughout New York City,'' he said.
But many opera veterans are skeptical.
''I have loved City Opera since the late '50s, and it makes me very sad to see it in such a terrible state,'' said Speight Jenkins, the general director of Seattle Opera. ''I don't frankly understand how you can perform in several locations and keep your subscriptions.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A cover article this weekend about New York City Opera's financial troubles misstates the amount that the opera company's board contributed in the past year. It is $6.8 million, according to the opera, because the $1.9 million contribution cited in the article and listed in a May staff report to the board did not include $4.9 million contributed by board members during a special campaign.

HEADLINE: The Big Switch, One Step at a Time

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
PITY the company that is looking for a whiz at HTML5, the up-and-coming Web language. Or the business seeking people to develop mobile applications or a social media strategy. There aren't enough of these types to go around, and positions remain vacant despite the urgent need.
Why, then, is the unemployment rate at 9.1 percent? Partly because there is so much less need for real estate agents, desktop-computer hardware designers, administrative assistants and others. The skills mismatch between demand and supply is acute. 
At this point, a frustrated mortgage loan officer who has applied for hundreds of jobs may be wondering: Should I just give up and become a skin care specialist -- one of the fastest-growing job categories listed by the Labor Department?
Switching to a new career is a drastic step. Before you pursue it, ask yourself: Is your skill becoming obsolete, or is it just in a cyclical funk? Construction managers may be having a hard time now, but they will eventually be in demand again. A government-sponsored site, acinet.org, projects growth for various professions.
Also, do you consider your career to be your true calling, or is it something you chose almost at random? A dead-end job search may be a perfect jumping-off point to explore other industries that lead to fulfilling work.
Are you at the beginning of your career, or do you have many years of experience? Is your life flexible enough to accommodate at least a temporary salary drop, and do you have time to attend school again?
If you make a career switch, you may face a decline in salary because ''you're moving away from your core expertise'' -- one that probably gives you more earning power, said Katy Piotrowski, a career counselor in Fort Collins, Colo. But she said she had seen some people reach their former income levels or surpass them, particularly after several years.
For midcareer people, it's risky to make a wholesale career switch, said John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm. Unless they are at the beginning of their working lives, he said, many people can't afford to give up the time and the income required to develop entirely new skills.
Rather than changing your function, consider changing industries, he said -- for example, an accountant at a manufacturing company could apply for an accounting job at an energy business.
As you explore another field, become familiar with its distinct vocabulary. This will lower the resistance of hiring managers, said Pamela Mitchell, author of ''The 10 Laws of Career Reinvention.''
''I recommend that you read the industry trades and you follow the blogs of a particular industry because they're not translated for the general public,'' she said.
If you do think you want to make a big change, there are ways to explore the possibility without upending your life, Ms. Piotrowski said. And it helps that skills acquired in one industry can often be transferred or modified to be useful in another.
Your goal is to find out where your skills and interests are needed, Ms. Mitchell said. And be aware of both local and global trends. ''You need to be reading your local paper and your local business journal,'' she said. Use these to find out which businesses are opening, closing and expanding.
Suppose you are in a field that isn't hiring and you want to explore an area that is in demand and interests you. Join user or industry groups in that field and connect with professionals there and on LinkedIn, Ms. Piotrowski said. Ask them: ''If you were in my shoes, what would you suggest I do?''
Determine whether you need training in the new field. Going back to school for another degree is costly, and pursuing a skill that requires a shorter-term certification program is often more realistic. ''I've seen hundreds of M.B.A.'s who are not able to use their degree, and they wonder why they got it,'' Ms. Piotrowski said.
WHEN you feel ready to begin, don't just run off and start a goat cheese farm, Ms. Mitchell said. ''Start with mini-reinventions,'' she advised.
Try to find a part-time job or internship in the new field, Ms. Piotrowski said. It may be for as little as three hours a week, she said, and you may not even be paid, but it will provide valuable real-world experience.
Offer your help without pay on short-term projects, Ms. Mitchell said. Then show those projects to prospective clients in the hope that you will reach a point where you can start charging for your work.
Say you want a job in that white-hot field, HTML5, which is changing the way Web sites are designed. After you gain proficiency in it through classes and gather information and connections via industry professionals, offer to create a Web site for a small business -- at no charge.
You can then add that to your resume, and it can be the first entry in your HTML5 portfolio -- leading eventually, perhaps, to your first HTML5 job.

HEADLINE: Backlog Of Cases Gives A Reprieve On Foreclosures

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Millions of homeowners in distress are getting some unexpected breathing room -- lots of it in some places.
In New York State, it would take lenders 62 years at their current pace, the longest time frame in the nation, to repossess the 213,000 houses now in severe default or foreclosure, according to calculations by LPS Applied Analytics, a prominent real estate data firm.
Clearing the pipeline in New Jersey, which like New York handles foreclosures through the courts, would take 49 years. In Florida, Massachusetts and Illinois, it would take a decade. 
In the 27 states where the courts play no role in foreclosures, the pace is much more brisk -- three years in California, two years in Nevada and Colorado -- but the dynamic is the same: the foreclosure system is bogged down by the volume of cases, borrowers are fighting to keep their houses and many lenders seem to be in no hurry to add repossessed houses to their books.
''If you were in foreclosure four years ago, you were biting your nails, asking yourself, 'When is the sheriff going to show up and put me on the street?' '' said Herb Blecher, an LPS senior vice president. ''Now you're probably not losing any sleep.''
When major banks acknowledged last fall that they had been illegally processing foreclosures by filing false court documents, they said that any pause in repossessions and evictions would be brief. All of the major servicers agreed to institute reforms in their foreclosure procedures. In April, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other regulators gave the banks 60 days to draw up a plan to do so.
But nothing is happening quickly. When the comptroller's deadline was reached last week, it was extended another month.
New foreclosure cases and repossessions are down nationally by about a third since last fall, LPS said. In New York, foreclosure filings are down 85 percent since September, according to the New York State Unified Court System.
Mark Stopa, a St. Petersburg, Fla., specialist in foreclosure defense, has 1,275 clients, up from 350 a year ago. About 75 clients have won modifications, dismissals or sold their properties for less than they owed. All the other cases are pending.
''Banks aren't even trying to win,'' said Mr. Stopa, who charges his clients an annual fee of $1,500.
J. Thomas McGrady, the chief judge of Florida's Sixth Circuit, which includes St. Petersburg, agreed. ''We're here to do what we're asked to do. But you've got to ask. And the banks aren't asking,'' he said.
A spokesman for Bank of America said, ''Any suggestion that we have a strategy to delay foreclosures is baseless.'' A Wells Fargo spokeswoman blamed changes in state laws governing foreclosure for any slowdown. A GMAC spokeswoman said it was following ''regulatory and investor expectations.'' JPMorgan Chase declined to comment. Servicers said some of the decline in foreclosures could be traced to an improved economy.
There are many reasons that foreclosure, which has been slowing ever since the housing bubble burst, has been further delayed in many states.
The large number of cases nationally -- about two million, plus another two million waiting in the wings -- have overwhelmed many lenders and the courts.
Lenders, who service loans they own as well as those owned by investors, tried to circumvent the time-intensive process by using ''robo-signers'' who mass-produced documents, many of which made inaccurate claims. When the bad practices were discovered last fall, the lenders were forced to revisit hundreds of thousands of cases.
Over the last two years, most defaulting homeowners were people who had lost their jobs. Housing analysts say these homeowners are more likely to hire a lawyer and fight repossession than borrowers who had subprime loans that swelled beyond their ability to pay.
Judges these days are also more inclined to scrutinize requests for eviction rather than automatically approve them. The so-called foreclosure mills -- law firms that handled many of the suits for the banks -- are in retreat under law enforcement pressure. And some analysts suggest that banks are reluctant to take too many houses onto their books at any one moment for fear of flooding a shaky market.
In New York, lenders seeking to repossess face additional hurdles. The legislature has mandated that borrower and bank meet to discuss terms under the auspices of the court, but these conferences have turned out to be anything but brief or simple. Instead of one conference, 10 are often needed, court officials say.
And many foreclosure lawyers seem unable to meet a requirement, made last October by the New York Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman, to affirm the accuracy of their documentation.
''The affirmation has had a pretty chilling effect,'' said Ann Pfau, New York's chief administrative judge. ''The attorneys for the banks tell us they can't get through to the right people at their clients who can verify the information.''
Last September, before the documentation crisis, nearly 1,500 New Yorkers lost their houses as a result of foreclosure, according to LPS. The average over the last six months: 286. That is far lower than at any point since the recession began.
Similar foreclosure cases can have different fates. To increase their odds of staying put, the foreclosed who can afford it are hiring lawyers, a move that can drastically slow down a case.
Mr. Stopa, the Florida lawyer, said he divided his clients into three groups. Some are unemployed or disabled and just getting by. Others are able to save money and improve their financial situation as their case drags on. The third group are those who have strategically defaulted. They can afford to pay but are taking advantage of the banks' plodding pace. Often the members of this group rent out the foreclosed home and keep the proceeds.
Though delays in foreclosure might seem like a gift to those behind on their mortgage, the foreclosed themselves do not necessarily feel that way.
Margaret Bellevue waited nervously in a Miami courtroom early this month. She and her husband, Roland, an architect, are among 97,000 households facing foreclosure in Dade County, where the average time to foreclose is 738 days and climbing, according to LPS data.
Ms. Bellevue was on her third lawyer in a case that has stretched on as many years. ''A friend of mine got her mortgage lowered through a modification,'' Ms. Bellevue said. ''I'd like to do that too.''
When her case came up, the judge told the lawyers they should try to work out a deal. They huddled outside the courtroom and agreed to meet again.

HEADLINE: Historic Preservation and Our Cities

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Death by Nostalgia'' (Op-Ed, June 11):
Sarah Williams Goldhagen is right to point to the ''the weakness, and often absence, of ... urban planning offices and professional, institutionalized design review boards'' as contributing to American historic preservation efforts that serve narrow political or development interests. She contrasts that with Europe, where preservation is part of a broader effort to make vibrant cities.
In Europe, however, understanding a shared architectural and urban legacy and its relation to the opportunities of contemporary culture is part of a liberal education and the civic dialogue. The same cannot be said for the United States, where nostalgia and greed are allowed to have an outsized influence on urban design. 
Given that the offices and boards Ms. Goldhagen is promoting are part of a democratic political process, their role can only be as thoughtful as the citizens they serve. This does not bode well for finding the most appropriate role for preservation in the planning processes in American cities.
DAVID EISEN Boston, June 11, 2011
The writer is a principal at Abacus Architects + Planners and the author of ''Boston Modern: The Spirit of Reinvention.''
To the Editor:
Sarah Williams Goldhagen is correct to defend the historic preservation movement for supporting the interests of local communities against private developers who would tear down viable housing and replace it with taller, bulkier and often less attractive buildings. But she is wrong to focus only on aesthetics, for historic preservation has emerged in recent years as an effective strategy for defending working- and middle-class urban communities against upscaling for more affluent residents.
''Upscaling'' destroys authentic communities in two ways. First, developers replace low structures with giant towers that insulate residents from the social life of the surrounding neighborhood.
Second, rents in new buildings are always higher than in the housing they replace; even providing some ''affordable'' housing -- a step that must be voluntarily accepted by the developer, usually in return for local government subsidies -- cannot sustain a neighborhood's social character.
Ms. Goldhagen praises European cities for blending old and new buildings without sacrificing development. To the degree they succeed, however, it is not because of their powerful city planning agencies. It is because they maintain a commitment to social housing at modest rents. We admire their authenticity because they are neither homogenized nor totally gentrified.
SHARON ZUKIN New York, June 11, 2011
The writer, a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College and the City University Graduate Center, is the author of ''Naked City: The Death and Life of Authentic Urban Places.''
To the Editor:
Thanks to Sarah Williams Goldhagen for her penetrating critique of the sentimental landmark movement that stunts the evolution of New York City. An additional unintended (or perhaps intended) consequence is that when great swaths of neighborhoods are landmarked, the opportunity for a truly economically integrated neighborhood begins to disappear.
Property owners are lured into believing that their property is more valuable. A result: more deep-pocket lobbying against rent control laws, higher condo and co-op prices, higher commercial rents on adjacent streets, and no opportunity for new development of affordable housing.
LAURA JERVIS Exec. Dir., West Side Federation for Senior and Supportive Housing New York, June 13, 2011
To the Editor:
I disagree with Sarah Williams Goldhagen's description of preservation as a ''four-headed monster: a planning tool, a design review tool, a development tool and a tool to preserve genuinely valuable old neighborhoods and buildings.'' In fact, it plays these four often-underestimated roles in American life.
I agree with Ms. Goldhagen that systems to vet buildings and urban design quality at the federal, state and local levels have never been institutionalized, and that the quality of life in American communities has suffered greatly as a result.
I think it's high time that American law and culture recognize that training in aesthetics and urban issues plays a truly important role in improving urban life and policy, and that preservation plays a key part in that effort.
MARTHA FRISH OKABE Chicago, June 12, 2011
The writer is an instructor in the Historic Preservation Program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
To the Editor:
Studies show that the preferences of ''professionals trained in aesthetics'' (discretionary design review) are out of touch with those of the public. What the ''aesthetic experts'' like, the public dislikes, and vice versa, and public impressions do not change with continued exposure to a disliked design.
Discretionary-design-review decisions can be capricious. My studies of 120 people in two cities evaluating almost 200 projects found no difference in preference for buildings that went through design review and those that did not. Discretionary design review wasted private and public time and money.
But design review, like the neighborhood design review program in Seattle, can be effective in protecting and improving visual quality. It needs to have evidence-based guidelines (called administrative review) for both the applicant and the review board; streamlined procedures to avoid delay; and a review board that mixes residents, developers and designers.
JACK L. NASAR Columbus, Ohio, June 11, 2011

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
9 P.M.

One may not expect to see murals and graffiti on display in a museum. But these examples of street art -- along with music and fashion -- are the focus of El Museo del Barrio's sixth biennial of work by Latino, Caribbean, and Latin American artists in the New York region, which opened Tuesday . The biennial, called the (S) FILES 2011, showcases 75 emerging artists in seven locations around the city, including El Museo, the Lehman College Art Gallery and Socrates Sculpture Park. 
The curators of this year's biennial focused on the street to call attention to the impact of economic and political crises on art production. The exhibition explores themes like the influence of New York urban styles, text and art made from debris. The artists' materials include found objects, colored sand, crocheted plastic bags and glitter.
Since starting in 1999 the (S) Files have brought attention to Latino artists including the Puerto Rican-based Allora & Calzadilla, who are representing the United States at this year's Venice Biennale. Other notable alumni include Margarita Cabrera, Pablo Helguera, Tamara Kostianovsky and Ivan Navarro.
In addition to its overall focus on New York artists The (S) Files 2011 celebrate the Biennial of the Central American Isthmus by showcasing the work of a group of artists featured in its most recent edition.
Through Jan. 8, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem; (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org.

HEADLINE: And Baby Makes Four

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
AT the apartment in Brooklyn where George Russell spends four nights each week, he checked the clock: 7:09 p.m. Wasn't it 7:05 about 20 minutes ago?
Never had time moved so slowly. Was the clock even working?
They had tossed the ball around, chased each other, done the book about a bear. Now the dreaded bedtime video. Every night, Griffin, who was 18 months old, insisted on this DVD about race cars, space ships and motorcycles, narrated by a saccharine pair named Dave and Becky. Mr. Russell found them galling. Once, while watching, he said, it made him ''feel a profound despair like when I read 'The Bell Jar.' ''
He slid in the disc. Soon, his thumb was punching fast-forward. ''It's so much better at double speed, isn't it, Griffin?''
Darkness had dropped softly. Rain drummed on Plaza Street East. 
Mr. Russell regarded Griffin and his curly blond hair. ''He looks just like me when I was little,'' he said. ''I don't feel paternal toward him. Yet it's odd when I look at him and I see me.''
The setup is complicated. Griffin's mother, Carol Einhorn, a fund-raiser for a nonprofit group, is 48 and single. She conceived through in vitro fertilization with sperm from Mr. Russell, 49, a chiropractor and close friend. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday nights, Mr. Russell stays in the spare room of Ms. Einhorn's apartment. The other three days he lives on President Street with his domestic partner, David Nimmons, 54, an administrator at a nonprofit. Most Sundays, they all have dinner together.
''It's not like Heather has two mommies,'' Mr. Russell said. ''It's George has two families.''
Two addresses, three adults, a winsome toddler and a mixed-breed dog officially named Buck the Dog. None of this was the familial configuration any of them had imagined, but it was, for the moment, their family. It was something they had stumbled into, yet had a certain revisionist logic.
Such is the hiccupping fluidity of the family in the modern world. Six years running now, according to census data, more households consist of the unmarried than the married. More people seem to be deciding that the contours of the traditional nuclear family do not work for them, spawning a profusion of cobbled-together networks in need of nomenclature. Unrelated parents living together, sharing chores and child-rearing. Friends who occupy separate homes but rely on each other for holidays, health care proxies, financial support.
''Some of the strictures that were used to organize society don't fit human change and growth,'' said Ann Schranz, chairwoman of the Alternatives to Marriage Project, a 10-year-old organization. ''What matters to us is the health of relationships, not the form of relationships.''
And so here on Plaza Street, four people are testing the fuzzy boundaries of an age-old institution, knowing there is no single answer to what defines family or what defines love.
Griffin, now almost 3, calls Mr. Russell ''Uncle George'' and Mr. Nimmons ''Dave.'' At some point, Ms. Einhorn intends to tell her son the truth. Mr. Russell worries about that moment. He never wanted to be a parent; he saw the sperm donation as a favor to a friend. He did not attend the birth or Griffin's first birthday party. His four sisters were trying to figure out whether they were aunts.
Once a week, Ms. Einhorn went out, and Mr. Russell baby-sat. But only after Griffin was asleep -- Uncle George was like the night watchman. Until March 2010, when Mr. Russell agreed to put Griffin to bed and see how it went.
There was a routine that had to be followed or it was tantrum world. A bath, dinner, a story, the hated video, then a circuit of the apartment to say good night to everything.
Mr. Russell loathes television, an aversion he connects to his father's seeming to have kept it on permanently. ''Carol can watch, like, 52 'Law & Order's back to back to relax,'' he said. ''She likes shows like 'Army Wives.' I can't even say the words 'Army Wives' without irony or cringing.'' He snapped off the television and announced, ''It's time to take a walk.''
Barefoot, he hoisted Griffin into his arms and felt the pleasant response. They said good night to the kitchen.
Good night, dining room.
Good night, plant.
Good night, George's room.
Good night, outside world.
Mr. Russell gave Griffin a bottle, and lowered him into his crib.
Not bad at all. ''I certainly don't want to be the child's parent,'' he said. Then: ''What can I say, it's lovely to hold a child in your arms.''
CAROL EINHORN once wrote a song called ''Canyon.'' It addressed the void left by her father, who died when she was 5, after pancreatic cancer came without proper notice.
She and an older brother grew up on the Upper East Side. Both parents worked in finance; both had been only children. Mom remarried, but they broke up. That angered Ms. Einhorn, the small family always shrinking. For herself, she wanted two or three children, an orbit of relatives.
Ms. Einhorn went to Wesleyan University and became a singer and songwriter, once singing backup for Roberta Flack. (Ms. Einhorn's professional name is Caroline Horn.) She quit performing in 1998, eventually becoming editorial director of a publication for young people, Music Alive! She nearly married a medical student, but reached her 40s with no Mr. Perfect or even Mr. Near-Perfect. In 2004, she decided to have a baby anyway, and began researching sperm donors.
Mr. Russell had been a year ahead at Wesleyan. They bumped into each other after graduation and became great friends. She thinks of him as a brother, especially since her actual brother is a troubled recluse she has no contact with.
Mr. Russell grew up in Connecticut, where his sisters teasingly called him the Godlet because they felt he was favored as the only boy.
His father worked at the State Department of Environmental Protection and now lives with dementia in a center in Baltimore. His mother, who died in 1999, professed to want 10 children, but, awakened by Betty Friedan, had her tubes tied after 5. She returned to school and became a college professor. Mr. Russell grew to view children as obstacles to ambition.
He came out in college, and afterward was a modern dancer, with a side job as a legal secretary. At 34, he returned to school, and four years later became a chiropractor.
He sees utility in odd rituals. Sometimes he asks clients to scribble what bothers them on a piece of paper, fold and staple it. Then he writes ''Gone'' or ''Goodbye'' on the papers, and either burns them and tosses the ashes in the river or drops them in a mailbox, no doubt baffling letter carriers.
When Ms. Einhorn told him her baby plans, Mr. Russell was shocked, wondering ''if she wanted to be crawling around on the floor at 45.'' Later, listening to her concern about ''an empty space where the father would be,'' Mr. Russell said, well, he would be the donor.
Getting pregnant was wrenching -- a miscarriage, autoimmune issues leading to a trip to Mexico for a treatment unapproved in this country. The fifth round of IVF was to be the last. Griffin was born on Oct. 21, 2008.
Then came postpartum depression. Griffin was colicky. One day, Ms. Einhorn wrote in her journal, ''I love my baby, I hate my life.''
THE double households began because of economics.
The tattered economy rocked Mr. Russell's business -- without jobs, people let their musculoskeletal systems go -- and his loans became a $250,000 whirlpool of debt. He eventually filed for personal bankruptcy.
He had met Mr. Nimmons in 2007 at a retreat in upstate New York. One of four children of a New York public-relations man turned California college administrator and a homemaker, Mr. Nimmons describes his family as being ''as close to the perfect American family as you could get.'' He worked as a freelance writer, an editor at Playboy and a speechwriter for Geraldine Ferraro, and he wrote a book on gay life before becoming special projects director at the Family Center, a private agency helping families in crisis.
Mr. Nimmons lived on the bottom two floors of a brownstone he owned in Park Slope, Brooklyn. He and Mr. Russell each had recently ended a long relationship when they fell in love; they were not ready to cohabitate again full time. Ms. Einhorn said Mr. Russell could stay at her place part time. For Griffin, that would mean a visible male presence, the thing missing from her youth.
So in July 2009, the four of them embarked on a provisional commingling until whatever came next.
On President Street, the men split the grocery and cable bills. Mr. Russell covers the housekeeper ($70), since he's fussier about unkemptness. Same with the electric bill, because he always leaves lights on. Mr. Nimmons handles the mortgage; Mr. Russell pays him some rent.
On Plaza Street, Mr. Russell gives Ms. Einhorn $100 a week for food and $60 of the $100 for her biweekly housekeeper. He bought an air-conditioner for his room; she paid for the installation. Keeping the refrigerator in balance with Mr. Russell there part time, Ms. Einhorn finds, ''is like working an algebraic equation.''
MR. RUSSELL fixed the food: flounder and pizza. Ms. Einhorn wondered who was the edgiest person he could imagine as a Chia Pet. Mr. Russell offered, ''Mother Teresa?''
It was family dinner night. Simon and Garfunkel oozed from the stereo. Mr. Nimmons was on his way; Mr. Russell mentioned something about trying not to shut him out of the conversation.
Griffin watched a Thomas the Tank Engine video. Checking it out with half an eye, Mr. Russell said, ''I'm thinking of doing a doctoral dissertation on this.'' He asked Ms. Einhorn, whose Music Alive! job had recently been eliminated, if she had considered working on the railroad.
They had so much fun together. They called each other Sweetie Cat and did cat riffs; when she learned she was pregnant, Ms. Einhorn texted: ''I am with kitten.''
The Plaza Street apartment is elegant, a baby grand piano ruling the living room. Two bedrooms plus the pint-size office where Mr. Russell unfurled a bed on the floor, what he called his ''camping existence,'' until last April, when Ms. Einhorn bought him a trundle bed.
When Mr. Nimmons and Mr. Russell met, Project Griffin was already under way, which Mr. Nimmons said he saw as ''another data point, and not a big one.'' He and Ms. Einhorn like each other, but are not close. As for Griffin, Mr. Nimmons said, ''I have a certain distant avuncular feeling.''
At dinner that Sunday, Ms. Einhorn veered into a story. Many years ago, her mother was giving a party and a souffle didn't rise because of the weather; she called Craig Claiborne, who actually answered, and told her to use cream of tartar.
''She was a pistol,'' Ms. Einhorn said. ''She sent a telegram to the White House when Ford pardoned Nixon.''
Ms. Einhorn asked Mr. Nimmons what was going on, and he said, ''Oh, I'm working like a fiend.''
She told Mr. Russell she had gotten a light for him as well as the bed. ''Not only did I make your bed with sheets and lay down the rug,'' she added, ''but I scrubbed the shower mat.''
He said, ''You're a good person.''
The night faded and Mr. Nimmons left. Ms. Einhorn and Mr. Russell liked to end evenings with a ritual. For a while, they recited ''intentions,'' lists of aspirations. Then they switched to ''gratitudes.''
Ms. Einhorn started: ''I had a really nice Saturday. I'm really grateful for both play dates. And I'm grateful that this was my last week of work at a place where I was underappreciated and underutilized. I'm grateful that I have a financial cushion. I'm grateful that Griffin has grown just as he should and is saying other words. ... I'm grateful that despite all the wacko middle-of-the night wake-ups, I haven't gotten sick.''
Mr. Russell: ''I'm grateful for the yummy dinner. I'm grateful that Dave is starting to understand my experiences and validate them rather than just listening and putting a checkmark. I'm grateful that business has gotten better. ... I'm grateful for my new bed and my light. I'm grateful that I don't have to sit here with allergies.''
IT should be noted that Ms. Einhorn's mother, Madeline Glick, who is 80 and lives on the Upper East Side, adores her grandson and visits frequently. Ms. Glick and her second husband don't speak; Ms. Einhorn, though, regularly takes Griffin to visit him.
Though Ms. Glick finds Mr. Russell delightful, she views the whole arrangement as peculiar. ''Though I recognize that male companionship is important to Carol, I think he's a little bit taking advantage of it,'' she said. ''I think his coming and going at will is sponging off her. If he's trying to figure out his relationship with Dave, he shouldn't be using her place to figure it out.''
As for Griffin, Ms. Glick thinks Mr. Russell's relationship to him should be as a trusted family friend, not as a father. ''Maybe it's narrow of me,'' she said. ''George is pursuing a gay lifestyle and all, and I kind of want Griffin to have a view of male masculinity greater than George.''
Thanksgiving got messy. Ms. Einhorn planned on dinner with her mother and Griffin; Mr. Nimmons and Mr. Russell had invited friends to President Street. Mr. Nimmons told Ms. Einhorn to drop over with Griffin, but not her mother. Ms. Einhorn was offended but said only that they would pass.
Then, a few days before the holiday, Mr. Nimmons asked Mr. Russell to see if Ms. Einhorn had a roasting pan he could borrow. She was furious -- disrespecting her mother, then wanting a pan!
Mr. Nimmons wrote her an e-mail saying he didn't remember saying he didn't want her mother to come, and if he had, he hadn't meant it. Ms. Einhorn did not think that was enough.
They had their separate Thanksgivings, and Mr. Nimmons skipped the next Sunday meal. He had lunch with Ms. Einhorn to smooth things over; she put it behind her, but was still uncomfortable that he had forgotten an important conversation.
Sunday dinners resumed.
YEARS ago, over the Internet, Mr. Russell became a minister of the Universal Life Church: a dozen couples owe married life to him. He adapts weddings to their wishes. Once he was told not to mention ''lifetime commitment.'' In another, one compulsory vow was never to watch a movie starring Helen Hunt. Last summer, on a lake in the Poconos, the groom came by rowboat, the bride by canoe.
On the way to the Poconos, Mr. Russell was moody and quiet, making Mr. Nimmons feel abandoned.
Mr. Russell has a deep playlist of anxieties. He is uneasy in public places (''I have a nervous system like an air-traffic controller''); begins days feeling dread (''I used to say I crawled up to self-esteem''); and feels the need to audibly criticize movies while in theaters. He is disorganized: he did not use a wallet until he was 45, because he found it hard to arrange.
He loses keys, phones, everything. He'll neglect to insert coffee in the coffee maker and brew hot water. He left the stove on; forgot to baby-sit for Griffin. He is not shy about seeking help: ''I've been going to therapy since God was a child. I think I actually counseled Freud.''
Mr. Russell finds Mr. Nimmons too upbeat about everything. Mr. Nimmons finds Mr. Russell too downbeat.
''George is vexed by things I don't understand,'' Mr. Nimmons said. ''There was a time last year when I asked him how he was and he said, 'I'm bleak, I'm despairing.' I said, 'Oh, my God, those are heavy words.' ''
And: ''There will be times I'll say I notice we just spent 20 minutes talking about what happened to you today. I haven't had a question yet. I had a day, too.''
Mr. Russell on Mr. Nimmons: ''He wants to hear about the most interesting thing with me, and I want to vent.''
And: ''I greatly admire and deeply love Dave. One of his deficits is his denial.''
IN the kitchen, at 6:30 a.m., Ms. Einhorn told Mr. Russell about her dream: ''I was swimming in a pool and I looked up and saw a plane and I said, 'What is that?' and the woman said, 'That's the fighter jet.' Not a fighter jet, the fighter jet. And then the fighter jet did a water landing.''
''Hmm,'' Mr. Russell said.
''And I didn't even watch 'Army Wives.' ''
Griffin smacked a plant standing on the countertop, and Ms. Einhorn told him not to assault plants.
She was a few weeks into a new job at Midori and Friends, a nonprofit agency that puts music programs in New York schools. She was eager to succeed.
Mr. Russell said, ''One thing I've observed is that if every time you turn water into wine, it doesn't go well. They don't write a book about you or anything. They just keep on drinking.''
He tousled Griffin's hair and said, ''The question is, will the saintly little messiah eat fruit salad?''
''I doubt it,'' Ms. Einhorn said.
Uncle George was drawing closer to Griffin. He had taken him to the botanic garden. Put his picture on Facebook, though the caption was cryptic: ''He's my nephew. But biologically he's my son.''
It bothered Mr. Russell if Griffin was peremptory. He also did not appreciate the ''chopped liver effect.'' The other evening, he was reading a story when Griffin said, ''I want Mommy.'' Mr. Russell said, ''Oh yeah, chopped liver moment.''
They will not be celebrating Father's Day. For one thing, Mr. Russell does not think of himself as a father; what's more, he views all holidays as ''premeditated disappointments.'' Years ago, he invented the Russell Alternative Holiday, observed on a floating date. He and Mr. Nimmons and some of his sisters marked the most recent R.A.H. by going to see a Revolutionary War re-enactment and parade. Actually, they were late, so they missed the re-enactment.
Ms. Einhorn and Mr. Russell joked about how they couldn't believe they had not gotten sick of each other by now. Yes, sometimes he found her bossy and caustic. Sure, it annoyed her when he got didactic and made her feel talked down to. Yet they rarely argued.
The nanny arrived, and it was time to go to work. ''We have had 1 hour and 20 minutes of playtime, and it's not enough,'' Mr. Russell said. ''It's a little like 'Letterman' when you have insomnia.''
''I FEEL I'm more involved with your friends than you are with my friends,'' Mr. Nimmons said to Mr. Russell.
They were at the apartment on President Street. They made a point of having unexpurgated discussions about festering issues. Buck the Dog was stamping around.
Mr. Russell: ''I never bring up your friends as your friends, but you always bring up my friends as my friends. It's as if there was this big blackboard, this tit for tat, and it's way loaded on my side. There's this weird rhetoric where I feel I owe you something.''
Mr. Nimmons: ''No, I just don't get that much out of them. And they're not all people I would spend that much time with.''
Mr. Russell: ''I think you're pretty good about refusing time with my friends you don't like.''
Mr. Nimmons: ''Well, this is not an attack.''
Mr. Russell: ''It feels like it.''
Mr. Russell mentioned how unsettled he felt: ''All my knickknacks and things are in the basement in boxes. I don't see how there will ever be any place for them. But maybe I'll never live here full time.''
Mr. Nimmons: ''That's funny, because as I look around I see a lot of things that aren't mine.''
Mr. Russell: ''Like what?''
Mr. Nimmons: ''That couch.''
Mr. Russell: ''But we never use it.''
Mr. Nimmons: ''I look at this bookshelf and I'm not sure where my books are. The TV came with you. The cat lamp came with you. The box that it sits on came with you.''
Then Mr. Nimmons added: ''I had two rules of relationships that we violated. One: It's never a good idea to meld things into someone's space. Two: You shouldn't move in together until you're absolutely sure you can't not.''
So they talked about the future.
Mr. Russell: ''I don't really know what I want to happen. I'm grateful to spend time here with you, but this house doesn't really pull me. There's no space in this house that feels like my space.''
Mr. Nimmons: ''To me, it's less about the space than about how we're developing as a couple.''
Mr. Russell: ''To not even have a space is yucky. I don't have a place at Carol's that's mine except a bed and a plastic box with my clothes in it.''
Then he said: ''I like living partly with you and partly with Carol. I liked living by myself. But I actually think it's healthier living around people. I didn't expect that.''
Then Mr. Russell said he had to go to Plaza Street, his musical-house existence. He had laundry to fold.
MS. EINHORN unpacked the takeout Thai; she hadn't the energy to cook. Mr. Russell and Mr. Nimmons were in Italy. Ms. Einhorn, who had not dated since getting pregnant, was missing her roommate.
Something was going on with her and this improvised family. She remembered the hollow feeling when Griffin's birth certificate came with a blank space for father. She felt better when she included Mr. Russell on her census form.
They were soul mates, that was for sure. She remembered that first time she visited her father's grave, in the icy rain, and he came along. The name on the tombstone was obscured by an overgrown bush. Mr. Russell knelt down and pruned it, making it right.
''I've ended up in an unconventional setup, and it's a setup that agrees with me,'' she said. ''Sure I want love, I want intimacy, I want romance, but is this desire to get married a beautiful dress that just doesn't fit? I look at my married friends and there aren't many I'm jealous of. Some of them say they're jealous of me.''
She added: ''You know, I got this rustic cabinet for $10 and stored it in the office. When George came here one night, he said, 'I've been meaning to tell you how much I love that cabinet.' He said, 'Never leave me.' ''
Suddenly, one night, they were talking about it.
Ms. Einhorn: ''So this was supposed to have been this little stopgap maneuver and now it's, what, almost two years?''
Mr. Russell: ''Yes. It's really fun living over here.''
Her: ''It's fun having you. I don't know if either of us has any urgency to change this arrangement.''
Him: ''No. It's outrageous -- who would choose this, living in two people's houses? But it's only gotten better over time.''
Yes, but.
''You empty the dishwasher, you cook, but I wonder if you should do more things,'' Ms. Einhorn said. ''Like if a light went out, I don't know if it would occur to you to change that light. Because you wouldn't know where the light bulbs are. And that seems unusual.''
Him: ''Well, if a light bulb went out, I would replace it. And I do know where the light bulbs are. But your point is well taken.''
Her: ''How does what I say feel on your end?''
Him: ''I don't actually know.''
Her: ''Do you feel like the helpful guest?''
Him: ''Sort of.''
''I don't have any time,'' he added. ''So the thought of doing more is very threatening.''
''It's just conceptual,'' she said.
ANOTHER evening slipped into dark on Plaza Street. Refreshed by seltzer, the cohabitants kept alive a conversation about the weirdness of a new opera centered on Anna Nicole Smith, and how there was once a musical about Hiroshima, and how good the movie about Joan Rivers was, and how Ms. Einhorn had never had escargots. Etc.
Mr. Russell had a headache and rattled out a couple of ibuprofen. He told Ms. Einhorn how smart it was that they had bought the big bottle.
Curled up in a crib in the other room was a small child who one day will find out that Uncle George is not exactly his uncle. ''I'm fearful that he will be angry or demanding, either one of which would be hard for me,'' Mr. Russell had said. ''I'm worried he might say, 'Well, why didn't you decide to be my father, being that I don't have a father?' ''
They plopped down in the living room and played a poetry game. Each wrote a line and the other had to invent the next one, rhyming off the last word. They sniggered at the results, the nonsense of it all.
Then they prayed that Griffin would not awaken at the zombie hour of 4:45 as he had been. Mr. Russell hoped for 7:10. Ms. Einhorn, 7:12.
That bit of futility dispensed with, they turned to their bedtime ritual. Not the gratitude list. This time, they would sing. They chose ''Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya,'' a Tibetan chant.
''Om namo,'' they began. Their voices intersected and became one. Outside came the sough of wind. They kept going. They sang. Yes, they sang.

HEADLINE: U.T. Experiment Grapples With Essence of Gravity

BYLINE: By MICHAEL HOINSKI. 
mhoinski@gmail.com

 BODY:
We have all experienced gravity, but even to the brightest minds in science, it remains largely a mystery. Gary J. Hill, an astronomer at the University of Texas at Austin, is trying to change that.
''We don't know why there's gravity,'' said Mr. Hill, one of the lead astronomers on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment, or Hetdex, which could turn gravity's time-honored laws on their head. ''We have a pretty good theory of it. It may be that our observations could have a bearing on finally formulating why gravity exists.''
Mr. Hill has teamed with Karl Gebhardt, an astronomy professor at U.T., on the $36 million project, which has prevailed despite the threat of natural disasters, potential lack of financing and all the kinks that can throw off a long-term project. The experiment's goal is to analyze our understanding of how the universe is expanding -- with ramifications on gravity, the Big Bang theory and the fate of the universe. 
''Not only is the universe expanding, but it's accelerating,'' Mr. Gebhardt said. ''And so that's what we call dark energy -- the existence of the acceleration. And that's the huge thing that no one can explain.''
Granted, in a time of high unemployment, crazy gas prices and water shortages, studying the swelling of the universe might seem out of touch. But when asked about its importance, Steven Weinberg, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist at U.T., said, ''Do you really need a sermon on why settling questions about the fundamental laws of nature are worth pursuing?''
For Mr. Hill, 48, and Mr. Gebhardt, 46, even to be in position of rewriting the books is fortunate. The McDonald Observatory -- where the dark-energy observations, made with the third-largest telescope in the world, are set to begin next spring after nearly 10 years of development -- is about 425 miles west of Austin, in Fort Davis. In April, the Rock House Fire, which started 35 miles south of there, in Marfa, scorched the Davis Mountains surrounding the state-of-the-art observatory, putting it perilously close to going up in flames.
Mother Nature has not been the only threat. Lack of financing for an abstract experiment with little or no immediate pay-off has stymied several similar projects that sprang from the discovery of dark energy in 1998. Now, only a handful of those remain, and none have the proprietary will of Hetdex -- a testament to the ego of the state of Texas.
Nearly a third of the money raised for Hetdex, which includes a one-of-its-kind $16 million spectrograph created by Mr. Hill called Virus (Visible Integral-Field Replicable Unit Spectrograph), came from private in-state sources. The largest donor, Harold Simmons, a Dallas investor and U.T. alumnus whom Forbes magazine ranked as the 55th-richest person in the United States, gave two gifts totaling $6.5 million. (Mr. Simmons's family foundation is a major donor to The Texas Tribune.)
''I could see that figuring out the nature of dark energy would be of historic importance, not just in astronomy but for all science, and for all humankind,'' Mr. Simmons said in an e-mail. ''As a proud Texan, I wanted a Texas-based, Texas-led project to be first.''
Meanwhile, broader debate has recently emerged over the role of academic research in state universities, with some conservatives calling for a greater emphasis on teaching to improve efficiency. But many in the higher education community have argued that the benefits of research extend beyond universities' bottom lines.
''This is helping us train the next generation of engineers and leaders in these fields of technology,'' Mr. Gebhardt said of Hetdex, which derives about a quarter of its financing from U.T. and a $6 million special biennial line item in the state budget. ''And that's important because we don't have a lot of that in the country.''
The impact on education goes even deeper, Mr. Hill said, explaining: ''Kids, when they're 5 or 6 or 7, these are the ones who get interested in science through fields like paleontology and astronomy. These are exciting areas.''
Where the education system falls short, Mr. Hill added, ''is failing to take that excitement and actually train them so they remain excited through college.''
The McDonald Observatory's history also provides a valuable lesson in collaboration.
On a recent tour, Thomas Barnes, the observatory's superintendent, said U.T. did not even have an astronomy department in 1926, when William Johnson McDonald, a banker from Paris, Tex., bequeathed his $1.1 million fortune to start an observatory. U.T. enlisted the University of Chicago to design and build the operation under the direction of Otto Struve, a Russian-born, fourth-generation astronomer who operated the McDonald Observatory for 30 years, ushering it into the U.T.-led era.
''Better a foreigner than a damn Yankee,'' one of the U.T. regents at the time said of Mr. Struve's appointment, according to Mr. Barnes.
And now the U.T. astronomy department has a chance to enhance its history.
''There will only be one time when we figure out what is in the universe, and then it gets placed in the textbooks,'' Mr. Gebhardt said. ''We are basically living through that time now.''

HEADLINE: 'Underneath Every Hoarder Is a Normal Person Waiting to Be Dug Out'

BYLINE: By CARINA CHOCANO

 BODY:
In 1947, Erich Fromm, a humanist, psychoanalyst and philosopher, developed a theory of character that divided people into five ''orientations,'' mostly determined by their relationship to stuff. He characterized four of these -- the receptive, exploitive, hoarding and marketing orientations -- as part of the ''having'' mode, which is focused on consuming, obtaining and possessing. (The fifth orientation was ''productive,'' which focuses on experience and human connection.) Fromm specifically linked the hoarding orientation to the Protestant work ethic and the American merchant middle class and argued that this orientation is characterized by, among other things, being ''constipated and squinty.'' 
You have to wonder what Fromm would make of A&E's ''Hoarders'' or TLC's ''Hoarding: Buried Alive'' or Animal Planet's ''Confessions: Animal Hoarding'' or any of the other reality shows on which discreet cameras follow psychologists, professional organizers and specialized cleaning crews into the terrifying homes of people possessed by an uncontrollable need to buy, collect or keep every old magazine, novelty bunny purse, errant pen cap, fast-food wrapper, thrift-store find, broken lamp, stray cat, marked-down sweat pants, newspaper clipping, commemorative snow globe and/or petrified dog turd that has ever crossed their threshold.
The compulsion on display wouldn't have been totally alien to Fromm, because 1947 also happened to be the year the Collyer brothers, those legendary proto-hoarders, were found dead in their Harlem brownstone, buried under 120 tons of waste. But the public fascination with the Collyers' story was predicated at least in part on the fact that their predicament was exotic and rare. Even the most jaded 1947 tabloid reader would no doubt be shocked to learn that one day there would be enough hoarders living among us to keep three or more reality shows in original episodes week after week.
It would have been just as unthinkable to them, no doubt, as the idea that one day our economy would not only consume more than it produced but also rely on consumption and credit to drive it; that the resultant debt, combined with a government-sanctioned stint of willful blindness, would bring us to the brink of world financial collapse; and in the dark, queasy, anxious aftermath of all of this, that television shows about compulsive hoarders would suddenly place a stranglehold on our collective fascination. This, it seems, would have been harder to predict.
It's the self-imposed squalor that draws you in at first-- the abject horror of it. Piles of trash so high you can touch the ceiling from their summits. Desiccated rat carcasses buried under years' worth of newspapers. Rooms filled with enough handbags, shoes and clothes to stock a good-size store. Inaccessible beds, stoves and refrigerators. Fetid bathrooms. What kind of person lives like this?
Initially, at least, we watch these shows for the same reasons we troll Web sites like Awful Plastic Surgery -- to marvel at the human capacity for self-destruction, which can be so creative, so wildly inventive, so blind. But the popularity of hoarding shows -- and the rip-offs, spinoffs and homages they've inspired (''Storage Wars,'' in which treasure hunters bid on the unknown contents of abandoned storage containers, for instance, and ''Extreme Couponing,'' which is basically ''Hoarders'' for neat freaks) -- suggests that there's something else here that hooks us: the idea that our relationship to our stuff has the potential to distort and derail us.
This fear has always been with us. Plato and Aristotle wrote about hoarding money. Dante chastised hoarders; Dickens mocked them. The Maysles brothers abandoned their documentary about Jackie Kennedy upon meeting her flamboyant, reclusive cousins Big Edie Bouvier and Little Edie Beale. The filmmakers understood that the Beales, with their feral cats and their ancient playbills, were infinitely more interesting than the self-possessed Jackie, who famously displayed such mastery over her stuff, marshaling it in service of her image.
It's a philosophical question, of course. To resolve the constant tension between the spiritual and the material would be to learn how to live. You have to be soulless not to grapple with it once in a while, especially in a society like ours, where after an unthinkable national tragedy, our leaders instruct us to shop.
For a while, starting around the beginning of the aughts, the same networks that now take us into the homes of people who treasure their expired tuna cans more than they do their children specialized instead in a certain type of shopping and makeover show. The format rarely varied. Various style ''experts'' would go into the homes and closets of ''regular people'' and judge their contents. The participants would stand by, sometimes sadly, sometimes defensively, and allow themselves to be shamed into facing what bad shoppers they were, what subpar consumers, how they failed to stay on trend or dress appropriately for their age, rank or station. Participants were shamed into hauling the contents of those closets and living rooms out to trash bins and then treated to shopping sprees in which, say, $1,000 had to be spent in 15 minutes or else be forfeited. Somehow, the dissonance between the mindless shopping frenzy and the thoughtful remaking of the image -- how could years of buying the wrong thing be helped by racing through a discount store throwing whatever you could grab into your cart? -- was never addressed. The goal is to fill the space.
''Hoarders'' made its premiere in August 2009 (its fourth season starts this week) and ''Hoarding: Buried Alive'' followed not long after. Whether consciously or not, these shows present the other side of excessive materialism. The gleeful shopper barreling through the racks at Marshalls or Macy's, using her newfound ''skills'' to acquire a better wardrobe, has been replaced by the sheepish weirdo who spends six hours a day at her favorite consignment store and hasn't seen her floor in a decade. Either way, a void is suggested.
The show ''Hoarders'' reportedly started out on a lighter note, more along the lines of Style's ''Clean House,'' with its sassy host and its fun-times garage sales. It evolved into the reality horror show it is today when it became clear to producers what they were dealing with -- namely, the mentally ill. So the networks reoriented the shows to focus on the rescue. They come not to gawk at the hoarders but to help them. They explain that the looming piles of junk are merely the physical manifestation of psychic clutter. It's this promise of healing that makes it O.K. to embark on a horrifying tour into the helplessness of others: the promise that underneath every hoarder is a normal person waiting to be dug out.
Throughout history, compulsive hoarding has been regarded as a sin, an unsavory character trait (a form of miserliness), a sociological consequence of capitalism, an instinctual nesting behavior and a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder driven by anxiety. It wasn't until the beginning of the 20th century that psychologists began to see the drive to acquire as an integral part of identity formation. (Jean-Paul Sartre also believed that the self does not distinguish between what is ''me'' and what is ''mine''), and it wasn't until the 1990s that studies on compulsive hoarding were conducted. The first unexpected finding for the psychologist Randy Frost and Gail Steketee, dean of the School of Social Work at Boston University, was that the problem was much more prevalent than was thought. Their research lead to the classification of compulsive hoarding as its own syndrome (a disorder disorder!), now on its way to a likely inclusion in the pantheon of contemporary mental infirmities, the DSM-V.
It's now known that hoarders have trouble with impulse control. Like compulsive gamblers, they are driven by what Frost calls the allure of opportunity. There's a romance in trash that fits with this lottery or prospecting mentality. You see it at work in ''Storage Wars,'' as people bid on unknown objects. A kind of magical thinking takes hold. The bidders aren't looking for anything in particular. They're not dealers of antiques or art or rare toys who are hunting for specialized treasures. They're not applying their expertise in mysterious curios. What appeals is the idea that something -- anything -- of value lurks beneath the surface, a surface that looks to everybody else like a giant pile of junk.
Frost and Steketee also found that hoarders were not driven by anxiety to acquire or collect items but by positive emotions. Anxiety enters the picture only when they try to throw anything away. Hoarders see things in things that other people don't. They find value, comfort, solace, a buffer against loss, accumulated history in their stuff. Things become externalized parts of themselves -- their memory, their plans, their feelings. To discard objects intended for future use (a project, a plan, a projection) feels like dashing hopes, losing opportunities, squandering potential. They can't let go of anything. They are at a literal impasse. We judge them, but we're like them too. A New York playwright recently staged a piece about his real-life decision to abandon his career in the theater that involved giving away all his theater books to the audience. One reviewer complained that he felt as if he'd been asked to witness a suicide.
There's something particularly disturbing, especially for city dwellers who live in small spaces, about seeing all this square footage filled to the ceiling with trash. With their creepy music and their sudden reveals and their own sensational lexicon, hoarding shows represent the ''home'' -- the ultimate fetish object of the first part of the millennium -- as a nightmare space in which people are literally crushed or crowded out by their stuff. The junk in the house is referred to as ''the hoard.'' A packed house is ''hoarded out.''
It's the flip side of the American dream, and there's something particularly depraved about it: the terror of pointless excess, the middle-class home as trap. Or if what gets you is information overload, there's a connection to that as well. Hoarding, often co-morbid with A.D.H.D., can be a symptom of an inability to process information. You get the picture. Hoarding shows are themselves hoarded out with metaphors for our all of our modern predicaments. Watching the televised hoarders gingerly scale the hostile terrain of their modest rooms, with the precipitous heights and narrow passes, like a dazed herd of wayward Alpine goats, it's hard not to get anxious and apocalyptic about materialism and junk culture. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe the shows' popularity hints at a collective longing to sort it all out; at a feeling that there's something underneath it all that's worth digging out and holding on to; at a lingering hope that the experts will be along any minute now to coax us gently into letting go.
The Lonely Deaths of the Original Hoarders
The New York Times, April 9, 1947 Body of Collyer Is Found Near Where Brother Died
Langley Collyer was found dead yesterday in his old brownstone home at 2078 Fifth Avenue. His body, wedged in a booby trap set to keep out intruders, was lying in the same room where his blind brother, Homer, had been found dead on March 21. The time of his death was not fixed by the medical examiner pending an autopsy today at the morgue, but the police were sure that the 61-year-old recluse had died at least three weeks ago. The cause of death was unknown, but he apparently starved or suffocated, unable to get out of his own trap.
Langley's body was found in a mazelike tunnel just inside the hallway entrance to the room. He was lying on his right side, his head turned toward the front space where his paralyzed older brother spent his time. He apparently was carrying food to his ailing brother, whom he had carefully nursed since Homer was stricken in 1932. His body was ten feet from where Homer had been found.
Piles of newspapers, books, tin cans and old furniture filled the room . . . . Up to yesterday the police, together with laborers from the Public Administrator's office, had removed 120 tons of junk from the Collyer home. It included 14 grand pianos, an old generator, parts of a Model T Ford, more than 3,000 books, pictures of pinup girls -- enough to substantiate the legend of the Collyers.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Riff column on June 19, about hoarding, misstated the profession of Gail Steketee, who has done research on the subject. She is the dean of the School of Social Work at Boston University, not a psychologist.

HEADLINE: Immigration Law Backer Faces Recall

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
MESA, Ariz. -- It has been a rough year for Russell Pearce, the president of the Arizona Senate, as he has sought to solidify his state's reputation as the nation's incubator for hard-edged conservative policies.
He has seen fellow Republicans defy him and the Republican governor issue a raft of vetoes to keep his agenda in check. Now, so many critics in his suburban district have signed a recall petition that he will have to defend himself in a special election. 
''It's time for him to go,'' said Randy Parraz, a labor organizer from outside Mr. Pearce's district who has been leading the effort to oust him.
On Wednesday, Mr. Parraz, a Democrat, gathered with other members of Citizens for a Better Arizona outside the State Capitol to announce that Maricopa County had validated 8,239 signatures from Mr. Pearce's constituents, more than the 7,756 required to force a recall election.
Mr. Pearce won his previous contests by wide margins, and his political allies dismiss the recall as little more than an annoyance for such a proven campaigner. ''The best way to view it is as a gnat on the rump of an elephant,'' said John Kavanagh, a state representative and Pearce ally.
But those trying to oust Mr. Pearce say he is vulnerable if the right candidate challenges him -- preferably, they say, a Republican with ties to the Mormon Church, which counts Mr. Pearce as a member and is influential in his district east of Phoenix.
Even without Mr. Pearce, though, Arizona would remain a bastion of Republicanism, since the party controls all the top statewide offices, both United States Senate seats and both chambers of the Legislature.
Recall supporters have shied away from making it about illegal immigration, although that is Mr. Pearce's signature issue. He was behind the ballot measure that passed in 2004 requiring photo ID to vote and denying state services to illegal immigrants.
Senate Bill 1070, the legislation now tied up in the federal courts that would have police officers question people about their immigration status, was also Mr. Pearce's brainchild.
Recently, he pushed an effort to deny birthright citizenship to the offspring of illegal immigrants, but enough fellow Republicans backed away at the behest of the business community that a frustrated Mr. Pearce found himself without the votes.
Mr. Pearce also was caught up in a controversy over trips and game tickets that he and other politicians received from the Fiesta Bowl, forcing him to amend his financial disclosure reports. The bowl has been found to have misspent money by, among other things, illegally reimbursing employees who made campaign contributions to politicians.
Mr. Pearce's gruff manner, hard-charging style and aversion to compromise are what propelled him to the top of his party. Those same qualities are considered the reason for his growing cadre of critics.
Mr. Pearce did not respond to a request for comment last week, but in recent weeks he has criticized detractors, labeling recall supporters ''far-left anarchists,'' ''radical, radical extremists'' and a ''profit-over-patriotism crowd.''
To counter such charges, recall organizers invited to the microphone Mary Lou Boettcher, 78, a retired Mesa schoolteacher who considers Mr. Pearce hostile to the public schools. ''I am not an anarchist,'' she said. ''I had flags all over my house for Flag Day. I'm not a liberal, either. I've been a Republican my whole life.''
Mr. Pearce's political allies have used the recall as a battle cry to raise money on his behalf. Team America, a political action committee, issued a recent e-mail plea for donations, including from corporations, for a group called Citizens Who Oppose the Pearce Recall. State lawyers are currently reviewing whether corporate money is allowed in a recall campaign.
There has been just one successful recall in Arizona's history, of a judge who was removed in the 1920s, although Evan Meacham, the governor in 1988, was close to a recall vote when he was impeached and convicted of obstruction of justice and misuse of government funds.
The tactic of using recall campaigns to go after politicians appears to be on the rise. This year alone, Gov. Jan Brewer has been a target, as have several other Arizona officeholders, including a sheriff from Tucson and a councilman from Phoenix. There are also recall efforts under way in California, Nebraska and Wisconsin, among other states.
Joshua Spivak, a senior fellow at Wagner College's Hugh L. Carey Institute for Government Reform and founder of the Recall Elections Blog, said that of the 20 state legislators who had faced a recall in the last century, only two were leaders of their chambers like Mr. Pearce.
In 1994, opponents of gun control led a recall against David Roberti, who was the Democratic president pro tem of the California Senate. In 2008, advocates of tax cuts led a recall against Andy Dillon, then the Democratic speaker of the Michigan House. Both survived by wide margins.
Some states allow recalls only in cases of abuse of power, but that is not the case in Arizona, where anyone can be a target for any reason.
Mr. Pearce's critics oppose his policies, like his cuts to education and the recent failure to extend unemployment benefits, and say he has damaged the state's reputation. Among the distractions from the real issues of the state, they say, are bills to force presidential candidates to prove their citizenship and to expand gun rights to college campuses, both of which were done in by Mr. Pearce's fellow Republicans.
After the recorder's office finishes reviewing the remaining recall signatures, the matter will go to the secretary of state and then the governor, who will schedule a vote either this November or next March.
Mr. Pearce remains defiant in the face of the recall threat. ''I stand for what I stand for, and I've never varied,'' he said Thursday night on local television.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths HOLMES, DAVID L

 BODY:
HOLMES--David L. David L. Holmes, 67, most recently of Delray Beach, Florida, died peacefully in his sleep on Sunday, May 29th. David was born and raised in Mineola, NY, but spent most of his working and family life in New Haven, CT. There he served as the Director of Downtown and Harbor Development during the city's most vigorous period of growth in the 1970s and 1980s and was responsible for more than $750 million in development. 
Holmes was widely known as a force of nature outspoken, passionate, and tenacious in his quest to bring sustainable development to the City. Prior to that appointment, Holmes was a leader in the completion of the landmark Long Island Sound Study. Holmes spent several years at the Lawrence Investing Company of New York where he began his second career as an executive with that real estate development firm. This period was distinguished by the design, financing and construction of Audubon Court, an award-winning, $35 million mixed-use project in New Haven, CT. From Lawrence Investing, Holmes returned to public service with the City of Yonkers, NY, where he served as the Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Development. Among his accomplishments were the settlement of a nationally famous housing desegregation case and the transformation of the City's downtown and waterfront districts. Leveraging his unique experience in both private and public sector development, Holmes also made his mark in military base redevelopment as President and CEO of the Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corporation. Under his leadership, the 5,000-acre former Strategic Air Command (SAC) base in New York was thoughtfully converted for civilian use, creating thousands of jobs and millions in annual rent. In recent years, under the auspices of his own Holmes Development Group, along with Joel Schiavone, David connected once again to New Haven on projects for the Quinnipiac River Village neighborhood and the Chapel West project next to the Yale campus. David received his BA in Economics from Rockford College and studied City Planning at Yale University and Urban Geography at Southern Connecticut State University. He leaves behind his daughter Jessica Evans and son-in-law, Laran Evans of San Mateo, California, and his son Michael Holmes, of Seoul, Korea. David will also be missed by his grandchildren, Milo and Charlotte. He is survived by his sisters, April Holmes and Jill Holmes, and brother, Gary Holmes, all of the Charlottesville, VA area. David had hundreds of friends throughout the country who relished his larger-than-life persona, tremendous wit, irrepressible sense of humor and relentless curiosity. His life will be fully celebrated at a joyful gathering at 11:00am on Saturday, June 25th at the Neighborhood Music School, 100 Audubon S., New Haven, CT. An informal reception will follow. Please RSVP to Mike Watt at mike.watt@americanavc.com In lieu of flowers, David's family requests that donations go to CARE: www.care.org

HEADLINE: How Divorce Lost Its Groove

BYLINE: By PAMELA PAUL

 BODY:
A COUPLE of months ago, Susan Gregory Thomas, a writer in Brooklyn, was at a friend's 40th birthday party when she was approached by a woman familiar to her ''from the whole Park Slope mommy culture.''
''So you're Susie Thomas,'' the woman practically shrieked upon introduction. ''You're famous.'' Taken aback, Ms. Thomas asked what she meant.
The woman swiftly backpedaled. ''Oh, you just come up in these conversations all the time,'' she said.
''I was like, just give me the hemlock,'' Ms. Thomas, 42, recalled. 
Though she wasn't entirely surprised. Ever since her divorce three years ago, Ms. Thomas said, she has been antisocial, ''nervous about what people would say.''
After all, she had gone from Park Slope matron, complete with involved husband (''We had cracked the code of Gen X peer parenthood'') and gut-renovated brownstone, to ''a Red Hook divorcee,'' she said, remarried with a new baby and two children-of-divorce barely out of preschool. ''All of a sudden, this community I'd lived in for 13 years became this spare and mean savannah,'' she said.
It was as if, she said, everyone she knew felt bad for her but no one wanted to be near her, either. Even though adultery was not part of the equation, Ms. Thomas said, ''I feel like I have a giant letter A on my front and back.''
That a woman who has been divorced should feel such awkwardness and isolation seems more part of a Todd Haynes set piece than a scene from ''families come in all shapes and sizes'' New York, circa 2011. But divorce statistics, which have followed a steady downward slope since their 1980 peak, reveal another interesting trend: According to a 2010 study by the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, only 11 percent of college-educated Americans divorce within the first 10 years today, compared with almost 37 percent for the rest of the population.
For this cross section of American families -- in the suburban playgrounds of Seattle, the breastfeeding-friendly coffee shops of Berkeley, Calif., and the stroller-trodden streets of the Upper West Side -- divorce, especially for mothers with young children underfoot, has become relatively scarce since its ''Ice Storm'' heyday.
For every cohort since 1980, a greater proportion are reaching their 10th and 15th anniversaries, said Stephanie Coontz, author of ''Marriage, a History.''
Teresa DiFalco, a 41-year-old mother of two from a suburb of Portland, Ore., recalled being shocked when her husband wanted to split up three years ago.
''I had this sense of: 'You're kidding me. We have children. It's not allowed,' '' she said. Divorce was not a part of her children's landscape, Ms. DiFalco said. Her son had just one acquaintance whose parents were divorced, her daughter none.
Similarly, Molly Monet, a professor of Spanish at Mount Holyoke College who separated from her husband in 2007, said she felt out of sync, ''like the ultimate bad mom.''
''Now my children were from a 'broken home,' '' she said. ''My first response was, Is this going to devastate the kids?''
Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University, said: ''The shift in attitudes and behavior is very real. Among upper-middle-class Americans, the divorce rate is going down, and they're becoming more conservative toward divorce.''
Dr. Cherlin, author of ''The Marriage-Go-Round: The State of Marriage and Family in America Today,'' attributes the swing to multiple factors, among them, a generational makeover.
It's as if the children of Manhattan and Roslyn, N.Y., and Bethesda, Md., reflected on their parents' sloppy divorces and said, ''Not me.'' For Ms. Thomas, whose parents separated when she was 12, ''Divorce had pretty much defined everything in my life.'' In her divorce memoir, ''In Spite of Everything,'' to be published this summer, Ms. Thomas recalls telling her ex-husband many times during their 16-year marriage, ''Whatever happens, we're never going to get divorced.''
Now that the children of a divorce generation have grown up and have children of their own, it is inevitable some will divorce, despite their worst fears and best intentions. Most marriages that end in divorce fall apart in the first 10 years. But according to the widely cited Marriage Project study last year, among college-educated couples who married in the mid-1990s, the likelihood of divorcing in the first 10 years of marriage fell 27 percent compared with college-educated couples who married in the 1970s.
In a 2008 survey, only 17 percent of college-educated Americans agreed with the statement, ''Marriage has not worked out for most people I know,'' compared with 58 percent among the less educated.
The experience of being a divorced woman has changed, along with the statistics. ''The No. 1 reaction I get from people when I tell them I'm getting divorced is, 'You're so brave,' '' said Stephanie Dolgoff, a 44-year-old mother of two elementary-school daughters who was separated last year. ''In the 1970s, when a woman got divorced, she was seen as taking back her life in that Me Decade way. Nowadays, it's not seen as liberating to divorce. It's scary.''
Ms. Coontz, whose most recent book, ''A Strange Stirring: The Feminine Mystique and Women at the Dawn of the 1960s,'' examines the changes in marital expectations for women, said that for many women of that earlier era: ''Divorce was freedom. Many of these marriages in the '70s were fundamentally unequal. With the women's movements, they learned that there were alternatives, and that made divorce kind of a liberation.''
But in an era of peer marriages, in which both partners are expected to contribute and truck along, that mentality appears to have diminished. As noted by the National Marriage Project study, ''Highly educated Americans have moved in a more marriage-minded direction, despite the fact that historically, they have been more socially liberal.''
''What happened?'' asks the writer Claire Dederer in her memoir, ''Poser,'' which examines life as a new mother in Seattle. In the 1970s, ''the feminists, the hippies, the protesters, the cultural elite all said, It's O.K. to drop out.'' In contrast, ''We made up our minds, my brother and I and so many of the grown children of the runaway moms, that we would put our families first and ourselves second. We would be good, all the time. We would stay married, no matter what, and drink organic milk.''
Which takes us back to brownstone Brooklyn.
''One of the hardest things about divorce today is that you feel like you have to explain or apologize for it,'' said Stacy Morrison, author of ''Falling Apart in One Piece,'' another divorce memoir. (Did anyone even write searing divorce memoirs in the '70s?)
''The notion of divorce has become one of failure again,'' said Ms. Morrison, 42, a resident of Park Slope. ''It used to be, 'You're free, rock on!' Now it's, 'You couldn't make it work, you failed.' '' Ms. Morrison described people's reaction as ''the two-second blink'' when she says something along the lines of, ''Zack is with his father today.''
Among a certain demographic, marriage is viewed as something that, like work-life balance, yoga and locavore cuisine, needs to be continually worked at and improved upon. When Ms. Dolgoff tells others about her divorce, their response, with disquieting frequency, is ''Yes, well, marriage is hard'' as in, ''You knew that getting in.''
Blogs and child-rearing books suggest a subtle -- and sometimes not-so-subtle -- social pressure to tough it out. From the 1970s to the 2000s, the percentage of highly educated Americans who believe that divorce should be made more difficult rose from 36 to 48 percent.
''It could be that among college-educated couples, the men are behaving better and the wives aren't as interested in getting out,'' said Andrew Hacker, a professor emeritus at Queens College who has written frequently about social currents. ''Guys are doing more cooking, and they're not bad at it!''
(Indeed, according to many divorced men, now more involved in their children's lives than their predecessors, they do not feel the same level of scrutiny.)
The shift contains an economic as well as a social component.
''That this change has occurred mainly among the affluent suggests it's not just a reaction to the divorce epidemic of the '70s,'' Dr. Cherlin said. ''The condemnation of divorce is also coming from the group that is most confident it can make its marriages succeed, and that allows them to be dismissive of divorce.''
From this perspective, splitting up with tender, vulnerable children in the mix is seen as a parental infraction.
''I've definitely experienced judgment,'' said Priscilla Gilman, author of a new memoir, ''The Anti-Romantic Child,'' which deals in large part with her 2006 divorce. ''Everyone said: 'Isn't there anything more you can do? Your kids need you to be together. They're so little.' '' At the time, Ms. Gilman knew only one other person who was divorced. ''I had progressive, feminist friends. None of them were getting divorced, none of them.''
Several divorced women suggested that the news of their marital unraveling seemed to unnerve other couples in their social circles, prompting unease about their own marriages. (That anxiety may not be entirely unfounded. One study out of Harvard, Brown and the University of California, San Diego, last year found that divorce actually is contagious: when close friends break up, the odds of a marital split among their friends increase by 75 percent.)
''There has been a striking shift in both beliefs and behavior towards marriage among educated and affluent Americans,'' said W. Bradford Wilcox, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Virginia and director of the National Marriage Project. ''There's a tacit or explicit recognition among well-educated parents that their kids are less likely to thrive if Mom and Dad can't be together.''
Is this, then, the revenge of the children-of-divorce generation, rebelling against the experiences of their mothers and fathers? When I asked people who divorced in their 20s and 30s while researching my 2002 book, ''The Starter Marriage,'' about why they divorced with such alacrity, the response was near universal: ''I wanted to do it before it was too late -- before we had kids.''
Whereas their parents were divorce pioneers in the '70s, unsure of how marital dissolution affected children and letting caution blow in the wind, today's splitting couples are viscerally aware of how divorce feels to a 7-year-old.
''Since the 1990s, we've been trying to come up with a process that is more emotionally humane and accounts for the interests of children,'' said Joanna Roth, a Harvard-educated lawyer in Seattle who entered divorce law after she and her husband split up. ''The parents I see through this process have their children foremost in mind.''
Dr. Monet, of Mount Holyoke, and her ex-husband eat dinner together on Fridays with their 9-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter. Birthdays and holidays are spent in each other's company.
''Once I realized that we could raise the kids together and still be a family,'' said Dr. Monet, who started a blog called Postcards From a Peaceful Divorce last year, ''I realized it wasn't divorce that's devastating, it's the way divorce is handled.''
When Nina Collins, 41, a former literary agent, divorced her husband, she said both her lawyer and therapist emphasized: ''Divorce is completely different from when your parents split up. If your kids feel loved and they don't see hideous behavior, they'll be fine.''
''Of course, there's still trauma,'' Ms. Collins said. ''But I think it's gotten a lot more humane for everyone.''
A common belief is that if the divorce is done properly, the children benefit more from the separation than from living in a family with a compromised marriage. Ms. Gilman, echoing the sentiments of many divorced mothers, said, ''In the end, I actually think it was a very positive thing we did for the kids.''
In another unexpected twist, some divorced women say they detect an unspoken envy. Other wives and mothers, they explained, were ''battling it out'' while dealing with the unceasing tasks of wifedom, motherhood and work.
''What I get from a number of married women in my community is jealousy of my new lifestyle,'' Dr. Monet said. ''Dating, going to yoga five times a week, having time for myself. Raising young kids with a spouse doesn't afford you much time.''
Ms. Morrison also sees a subtle, unexpected reaction. ''Among my college friends and my closest friends, I'm still the only one who's divorced,'' she said. ''In a funny way, I think I may have turned into the groovy one.''
That does not necessarily make divorced motherhood any easier.
''I spent an enormous amount of energy making everything friendly and loving with my ex and his wife,'' said Isabel Gillies, an actress who is following up her divorce memoir, ''Happens Every Day,'' with a book about divorce's aftermath, ''A Year and Six Seconds.''
When her ex-husband visits their children in Manhattan from Ohio, he and his wife stay in Ms. Gillies's apartment and she moves out.
''It's a bit more seamless than it was in the '70s,'' she said. ''Instead of the kids back and forthing, we're the ones who maneuver.''
Enter the latchkey moms.

HEADLINE: Paying Off a Loan Early

BYLINE: By MARYANN HAGGERTY

 BODY:
JUST because you own a home doesn't mean you have to keep carrying a mortgage -- about a third of American homeowners don't, according to the Federal Reserve.
Assuming you have the cash -- perhaps in a savings account or certificate of deposit earning less than 1 percent interest -- should you pay off your mortgage early? It's a question that has both financial and psychological components.
''It's a slam-dunk to tell someone to pay off a credit card or pay off a car loan or pay off a line of credit,'' said Gary Schatsky, the president of New York financial planning firm ObjectiveAdvice.com, but paying off long-term debt like a mortgage is more complex. 
First, do you really have the cash? ''The overriding issue has to do with the sum of money you're not going to need for a prolonged period of time,'' Mr. Schatsky said. If you ever needed the money again, it could cost you hundreds, even thousands of dollars to borrow it back, assuming you could even get a new loan, he said. ''Will I regret giving up liquidity in exchange for a long-term debt reduction?''
And would you really want to forgo a low mortgage rate? ''Even though it feels good, you're probably never going to get a better rate to borrow at in your life,'' said Robert B. Walsh, a principal of Lighthouse Financial Advisors In Red Bank, N.J.
Clients who have a major chunk of income -- from an inheritance or the sale of a business, for instance -- will often ask about paying off the mortgage, said Timothy Parker, a financial adviser at Regency Wealth Management in Midland Park, N.J. Usually, he said, ''it's the wife who says, I just want to get the mortgage done.''
He said, ''When there's plenty of money left over, that's a fine thing to do.'' But make sure adequate cash remains. ''Being house-poor is not always the best thing to do.''
Don't neglect other financial priorities, either, Mr. Walsh said. ''Are you maxing out all your other savings?'' That includes individual retirement accounts, 401(k) plans and education savings plans. ''You have to make sure you have all those buckets filled before you look at paying it down.''
Is this the best investment for you? From a financial standpoint, the thinking should be, ''I'll pay off the mortgage if I can do better paying it off than I can do in the markets,'' said Lewis J. Altfest of Altfest Personal Wealth Management in New York City. A borrower paying 6 percent interest on a mortgage and earning just half a percent on a certificate of deposit might be in this category, he said.
Taxes play a role as well. The interest paid on first- and second-home mortgages up to $1.1 million is deductible, in effect cutting the interest rate paid. A homeowner in New York City could be paying 40 percent in city, state and federal taxes. A 4.5 percent mortgage would typically be equivalent to a 2.7 percent rate on any other debt, according to calculations from Ray Mignone of the New York financial planning firm Ray Mignone & Associates. In other words, very cheap debt.
If someone is in a lower tax bracket, and has a higher-rate mortgage, ''it would make sense to pay it off,'' Mr. Mignone said.
But the mortgage decision isn't all about money. ''There's a big psychological benefit for some people who just want to pay off their mortgage,'' Mr. Mignone said.
Mr. Altfest agreed. ''Many conservative people feel more comfortable when they pay off their mortgage,'' he said. ''It makes them feel their cost of living is lower.''
In his experience, these people won't give themselves permission to do anything else major with their money until their mortgage is gone. ''This is one of the most common things I see with conservative people,'' Mr. Altfest said, ''especially among people who are ready to retire.''
Mr. Parker added, ''It all depends on each individual's situation -- their income, their assets, and what keeps them up at night.''

HEADLINE: Those First 30 Days: Busy, Busy, Busy

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
Mayor Daley has been succeeded by Mayor Daily, a pinstriped heat-seeking missile with a bristly salt-and-pepper tip of hair.
Last Sunday Rahm Emanuel announced he would move 150 more police officers to the streets. Monday he brought word of taxpayer savings via city-county cooperation. Tuesday saw him heralding Motorola for adding 400 jobs.
Wednesday was Paddle-the-Teachers Day, with the new board of education killing a negotiated 4 percent pay hike, and unrelated word of big grocers' moves to help eliminate ''food deserts'' in poor neighborhoods. Thursday he disclosed a presumably handy, searchable database on lobbyists doing city work. 
And then there were kudos to the Lookingglass Theatre Company, co-founded by David Schwimmer, for winning a regional Tony Award, a plan to double the municipally owned LEED-certified buildings and more.
City Hall's new intensity was transparent Thursday as Mayor Daily, a k a the Missile, surfaced with a report card -- actually two very large poster boards -- on his initial 30 days.
This trumped by 70 days the cliched convention of 100-day assessments, a gambit traced either to the historic first 100 days of President Franklin D. Roosevelt or the Hundred Days of Napoleon, the period between his return from exile and the restoration of King Louis XVIII.
Mr. Emanuel's self-analysis listed 58 pledges and goals. While he conceded the obvious -- that he deserves an ''incomplete'' after a mere month of service -- a preternaturally cynical press corps should give him an A for animal-like ferocity. Some staff members may pray for his family's speedy return from Washington to provide distraction.
The 20 items checked off included hefty budget cuts and merging of administrative and operational functions. The unchecked ranged from a Web-based map of public spaces to the essential need to convene business leaders to develop strategies for job growth.
Certain big matters were absent, like the costly anti-patronage litigation known as the Shakman case. Let's hope that his new corporation counsel, who comes from a tony firm where he defended the tobacco industry, won't find contorted rationales to continue that 42-year-old mess.
The news conference underscored the job's potency and why Mr. Emanuel relishes it. Where else does decision-making have such an impact on people's lives? he asked. He could thus clearly tolerate a few television reporters' apple-polishing queries: Any disappointments so far? What's harder than you figured?
Most of all, there were questions prompted by the mayor's daring if predictable gambit -- not paying the teachers a previously negotiated 4 percent hike in the coming year.
Former Mayor Richard M. Daley improved the schools, even solidifying middle-class whites' confidence in the system. He was not a tower of power in union negotiations because of an abject fear of a strike. He worried about both re-election repercussions and accelerating a middle-class flight to the suburbs.
He was not alone. ''Class Warfare,'' a book on the school reform movement due in August from Steven Brill, details how Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York caved in to his city's teachers union in 2007 precisely because of re-election worries.
The Emanuel camp's calculation is that various realities make a walkout unlikely. Those include deficits, the system's sub-par image, the bargaining ramifications of a new state education law, and how a majority of teachers will get increases, distinct from the 4 percent now in jeopardy, based on years of service or added educational attainment.
The news media aped an official line on those hikes, namely that they're mostly between 3 and 5 percent. Actually, they average out to just over 2 percent. Still, it makes the union's case in the recession-ravaged court of public opinion more challenging.
That's the consensus, too, of officials and lawyers for other city unions. The competence of the moribund union's past leadership rivaled Italy's, and the new union chief, Karen Lewis, must somehow galvanize members over an issue, perhaps preserving their pensions.
As she contemplates making lemonade out of lemons, she could watch HBO's new ''Bobby Fischer Against the World,'' a documentary on the tormented chess icon.
In the first game of his epic 1972 match in Iceland against the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky, Fischer, the greatest player ever, lost after making a move so amateurish it bordered on the irrational.
A besieged Mrs. Lewis can at least hope the Missile -- a disciplined, brilliant fellow when it comes to government's workings -- improbably misfires, too.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Standards for Politicians

 BODY:
In our new Sunday Dialogue feature, we are inviting readers to respond to an interesting or provocative letter -- most recently, ''Invitation to a Dialogue: Standards for Politicians'' (June 15). Here is the original letter, followed by a sampling of reader responses, and a reply from the first writer.
The Letter 
To the Editor:
Re ''Politicians Behaving Well'' (column, June 10):
Why does David Brooks feel the need to refer back to Edmund Burke and Anthony Trollope to find an exemplary politician? We have one in the White House.
President Obama has been excoriated by both the left and the right with the most extreme and unrealistic invective used against any president in my lifetime, yet has never responded in kind. He has treated his opponents with respect, even when their opposition was beyond disrespectful.
He has taken the time to reflect and seek the counsel of the wise and learned, even when he was being accused of inaction, yet has acted decisively when necessary. And he has taken the opportunity to instruct us in our highest concerns, even when the throng was calling for soaring rhetoric.
In short, he has personified precisely the standards of political excellence Burke set forth. If only the American electorate cared.
DAVID BERMAN New York, June 10, 2011
Readers React
To the Editor:
I agree with David Berman's assessment of President Obama's restraint in responding to unfair attacks from both sides of the political spectrum. Most political consultants would probably take him to task for this.
(Isn't the preferred response to political distortion and outright lies to ''hit back''?)
But the president seems to respect our intelligence enough not to address the more absurd claims made by his opponents -- for example, that he's a ''socialist,'' that he's ''defeatist,'' that his worldview is informed by ''Kenyan, anticolonial behavior'' or that his policies are merely a continuation of George W. Bush's.
But I do think that David Brooks might have been on to something by invoking Edmund Burke. After watching the most recent debate among the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, I thought of this Burke quote: ''It is a general popular error to suppose the loudest complainers for the public to be the most anxious for its welfare.''
NIELS AABOE New York, June 15, 2011
To the Editor:
President Obama isn't a model of civility. When he was a United States senator, his stump speech accused Republicans of social Darwinism. In a speech to the House Democratic Caucus, President Obama suggested that Republicans don't have a sense of neighborliness or community, and are not willing to help people who are vulnerable.
In fact, Republicans do support some public assistance programs, and private charity as well. As such, President Obama's comments are just a derisive caricature.
Despite calling for civil debate, Mr. Obama nonetheless resorts to name-calling and demonizing, and does little to denounce fellow party members who do the same. He has praised Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, despite her claims that Republicans are waging war on women and the unemployed and have proposed a budget that is a ''death trap'' for the elderly.
When my opponents call me names, it's demonizing and abusive rhetoric; when I call them names, then it's tough but true.
ALASDAIR DENVIL Richmond, Va., June 15, 2011
To the Editor:
David Berman is correct that President Obama is more than the equal of the good-guy politicians touted by Edmund Burke or Anthony Trollope. But one must also remember that the Burke and Trollope statesmen operated in an elitist society marked by deference, aristocratic privilege, a rigid class structure and patriarchy.
These features make comparisons with our own time problematic, if not dangerously nostalgic.
ALAN POSNER East Lansing, Mich., June 15, 2011
The Writer Responds
To the Editor:
Regarding Niels Aaboe's letter:
David Brooks made clear that his nostalgia for Edmund Burke's ''standards of political excellence'' was a response to the degradations to which we've been recently subjected. I would say that these include Anthony D. Weiner's and Christopher Lee's self-portraits, John Edwards's indictment and Sarah Palin's bus tour to nowhere.
But these are cases so tawdry that Burke would probably not have stooped to comment. Considered the progenitor of modern conservatism, he would have reserved his rhetorical fireworks for today's American right wing. To its rigid and simple-minded ideologues he might have said, ''Circumstances are what render every civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious.''
To its laissez-faire capitalists: ''Free trade is not based on utility but on justice.''
To the antigay lobby: ''Toleration is good for all, or it is good for none.''
To the right wing's Second Amendment Sisters: ''What is liberty without wisdom, and without virtue? It is the greatest of all possible evils.''
True, as Alan Posner points out, Burke was of another time, and of a society more hierarchical than ours, but his strong sense of the duty of his class could certainly have instructed those Republicans pandering to the Tea Party: ''Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment, and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.''
And as for Alasdair Denvil's letter: Does he really mean to equate President Obama's use of the term ''social Darwinism'' with the comparisons of Mr. Obama to Hitler? And is he really ready to defend Republicans against the rather mild charge that they are unwilling to help the vulnerable?
The unemployed, the uninsured, the migrant workers who pick our fruit only to be deported, the poor who are losing Medicaid benefits this very month -- these are vulnerable people whom Republicans have been unwilling to help. As Burke said in the House of Commons, ''Let this position be analyzed, for analysis is the deadly enemy of all declamation.''

 BODY:
THE NEWS Anthony D. Weiner, the high-profile New York Democrat who publicly apologized on June 6 for carrying on lewd online exchanges with several women and then lying about it, resigned his seat in Congress. 
BEHIND THE NEWS First he tried to ride out the scandal in office, saying that he had been stupid but had broken no laws; then he floated the idea of a leave of absence for counseling. But one top Democrat after another told him he had become an embarrassing distraction and should just go. A move in the House to strip him of his committee assignments made it clear the jig was up.
THE NEWS Rami Makhlouf, one of the most powerful tycoons in Syria, said he was quitting business to do charity work, including donating profits from his 40 percent stake in Syriatel, the country's top mobile phone company.
BEHIND THE NEWS The step was seen as a major concession to antigovernment protesters, who despise Mr. Makhlouf as a corrupt crony of his cousin President Bashar al-Assad, with fingers in every lucrative slice of the Syrian economy, including banking, tourism and construction. He was the first member of Mr. Assad's inner circle to take a public fall since the protests began.
THE NEWS Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the chief of the Pakistani Army and the most powerful man in the country, is fighting to save his job, officials and people who have met him lately said.
BEHIND THE NEWS His problem is seething anger in the ranks over the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2. Under pressure from fellow top commanders, General Kayani has become much more prickly and obstinate in dealing with Washington, officials said. He has been trying to shore up army morale and his own standing with a highly unusual series of visits to garrisons and base mess halls.
THE NEWS Prime Minister George Papandreou of Greece struggled to hold his government's narrow majority together and pass deeply unpopular austerity measures to avoid a default that could ignite a European financial crisis.
BEHIND THE NEWS Greek politics is roiled by widespread anger that ordinary people are suffering unfairly from the government's fiscal blunders. A few of Mr. Papandreou's fellow Socialists in Parliament defected to the opposition, who rebuffed his efforts to form a unity government to tackle the mess; he even offered to resign, to no avail. He reshuffled his cabinet and vowed to press on.
THE NEWS Al Qaeda announced that Osama bin Laden's official successor was his longtime deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, a 59-year-old Egyptian.
BEHIND THE NEWS It was no surprise, but the long delay in naming him hinted to some analysts of a power struggle. Mr. Zawahri is said to lack Bin Laden's charisma and to rub many in the group, especially non-Egyptians, the wrong way. His whereabouts are murky; the F.B.I. has offered $25 million for a tip leading directly to his capture. Experts think Al Qaeda is likely to mount a terror attack soon to cement his control and retaliate for Bin Laden.

HEADLINE: Mr. Got Rocks Goes to China

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
ON this big night out, Gisele Bundchen, darling of the cameras, is decked out in diamond earrings from Van Cleef & Arpels. The cover girl Shalom Harlow wears rocks from Harry Winston. And Madonna, that proto-Gaga, is bejeweled in Cartier.
But none of the gems actually belongs to them.
At the May gala of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute, these A-listers are simply borrowing their baubles from some big names in diamonds, a common P.R. tactic in the high-glitz business of gems.
Yet jewels from Laurence Graff, perhaps the biggest dealer in seriously big stones, are rare this evening. 
''The people who wear Graff jewelry own it,'' says Henri Barguirdjian, who heads Mr. Graff's United States sales operation. ''I think it is a bit of an insult to our clients who actually purchased our jewelry,'' he adds, referring to the notion of non-owners wearing Graff jewels. ''If you spend $1 million, that is a lot of money. Do you want a little model wearing it?''
It might seem remarkable that anyone would spurn a little free fashion buzz, particularly in a business like diamonds, and particularly in tough economic times. Lending jewels to boldface names is standard practice.
Standard, perhaps -- but not at Graff Diamonds. The retail business, however, is only part of an empire that extends from luxe showrooms in London to gritty diamond mines in southern Africa to cutting rooms in Antwerp, Belgium, and beyond. It is a world that at times seems impervious to the fortunes of mere mortals, though not, it turns out, to the shifting sands of the global economy.
Beneath the headquarters of Graff on Albemarle Street, in the Mayfair section of London, is a warren of workrooms. There, 170 people produce the jewelry that Graff sells worldwide.
But now Mr. Graff is pushing into China, where the number of billionaires is climbing annually -- and ranks second only to that of the United States. Everyone else is piling in, too. The exploding market for diamonds in China, it seems, is yet another sign of its rising economic might, or at least the willingness of its ultrarich to spend -- and spend big.
''We make more sales to newer money than to older money,'' Mr. Graff says in explaining China's appeal. ''Americans are not attracted in the same way in spending money on jewelry as in the Far East.''
Let others fret over a mere carat or two. Mr. Graff's purchases of giant gems awe the diamond world. Over the decades, he has sold many major stones, including the Magnificence, a 244-carat white diamond, and the Maharajah, a 78-carat yellow diamond. Graff Diamonds hit the headlines in 2009 when robbers made off with $65 million of gems from its shop in Mayfair, in the largest jewel heist in British history. (The jewels have not been recovered.)
His customers have included Oprah Winfrey, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Denzel Washington, Victoria Beckham and Danielle Steel. In the past three years, Mr. Graff spent more than $100 million on four diamonds. That's right: $100 million to buy just four stones. For one of them, a flawless, 24.78-carat pink diamond, he paid a record $46 million last year at a Geneva auction.
And he is not likely to lend it to anyone for the evening.
Today, Mr. Graff's offerings include a necklace of 26 stones cut from the Lesotho Promise, a 603-carat rough stone that he bought for $12.4 million from the Letseng Mine in the African country of Lesotho. The company now values the necklace at more than $60 million. Also for sale is the Graff Constellation, a 102.79-carat flawless round diamond that was cut from the $18.4 million, 478-carat Light of Letseng.
Not that he buys only rough stones. He paid $24 million for the 35.5-carat Wittelsbach diamond, a fancy blue stone that is a rival to the Hope Diamond. In a controversial move, he recut the diamond to remove imperfections, prompting criticism that he had essentially painted over a Rembrandt. The Wittelsbach Graff sold recently for an undisclosed amount.
Mr. Graff oversees a network of 32 stores worldwide, and owns 12.14 percent of Gem Diamonds, a publicly traded mining company. Through a 51 percent stake, he controls the South African Diamond Corporation, which cuts and polishes diamonds; Safdico has 520 employees in places like Johannesburg, Antwerp, Mauritius and Botswana.
Though Hollywood celebrities are often photographed wearing big gems, ''they are not big purchasers,'' Mr. Graff, 73, says. ''They don't have that sort of money.''
Increasingly, the sort of money that moves this market is Chinese. Though buyers rarely disclose purchases, experts agree that the Chinese appetite for diamonds -- particularly for colored diamonds -- is growing.
The American diamond market, like the American economy, has slowed in recent years. Mr. Graff plans only one new store in United States, in San Francisco, a city that has many visitors from Asia. Graff already has three stores in East Asia, and plans to open one in mainland China and one on Taiwan.
The swing to Asia, and China in particular, has startled even Graff's veteran management. ''If you had told me five years ago that the biggest buyers would come from the People's Republic of China, we would have laughed,'' says Mr. Barguirdjian, Mr. Graff's longtime lieutenant. ''It took us by surprise. America used to be the No. 1 market. Now that is being challenged.''
Graff, of course, is hardly the only player in China. Competition there, even for Graff, is fierce. DeBeers has two stores in China and is opening three more this year. Tiffany & Company has 15 stores in China among its total of 240, and is planning more. Leviev, another major diamond dealer, has no stores in China, though it just finished a two-week exhibit in Shanghai and Beijing.
DIAMONDS are in many ways a hush-hush business. The inner workings of Graff, like those of most of the big players, are difficult to penetrate. While Compagnie Financiere Richemont, owner of Cartier and Van Cleef, is traded on the Swiss stock exchange, it does not break out those jewelers' earnings. Nor does DeBeers Diamond Jewelry, the retail operation DeBeers owns with the luxury giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, disclose the profits from its retail stores.
At Graff, one must depend on Mr. Graff's numbers.
Sitting in his elegant shop on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Mr. Graff, dressed in a tailored blue suit and blue tie, says 2010 was a good year for his empire. His companies, he says, generated worldwide sales of nearly $1 billion. Of that, $437 million came from Graff Diamonds, the retail arm, which turned a profit of $64 million after taxes.
The balance of his operations include his stake in Safdico, the diamond and polishing business, as well as Diamond Works, a wholesale diamond company. Those two are in turn under the umbrella of AE Holdings. All are based in countries known as tax havens -- AE in Switzerland, Safdico in Mauritius and Diamond Works in Luxembourg. Revenue from those businesses last year totaled $550 million, Mr. Graff says, but margins are far lower than in the retail business. (He declines to elaborate.)
All of this has been highly lucrative for him. The Sunday Times of London has estimated his wealth at $3.2 billion in 2010. His holdings also include a vineyard and a resort in South Africa, as well as an art collection that includes Picassos and Warhols. He gave up his British residency 11 years ago, moving to Geneva and Gstaad, Switzerland, where the personal income tax rate is far lower than in Britain.
Like Harry Winston, who died more than three decades ago, Mr. Graff has made his fortune selling big diamonds. But his beginnings were humble. The son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, he grew up in the hard-scrabble East End of London. ''From an early age, I could see a little area called Black Lion Yard where the Jewish people bought diamonds,'' he recalls. It was, he says, a place where people wanted to put their money in something that seemed safe, something tangible.
''It has been the same forever,'' he says. ''Whether it was royal families in different parts of the world, or today, when people worry that their dollars are worth nothing, they want assets that will increase in value -- silent assets that you can put in your pocket because tomorrow, anything can go wrong.''
As a young man, Mr. Graff was such a poor student that by the time he was 14, his mother had arranged for him to work as an apprentice for a jeweler, doing chores like washing floors and fetching sandwiches. He lost that job. ''I guess I was not good enough,'' he recalled.
Shortly thereafter, he went into a jewelry business with a partner. That venture went into debt, and Mr. Graff decided to take it over. Within six months he had paid off the debt and, displaying a certain panache for sales, began traveling around Britain, selling jewelry made with semi-precious stones. Mr. Graff later helped make some of the costume jewelry that Elizabeth Taylor wore in her film role as Cleopatra, alongside Richard Burton.
Soon Mr. Graff was traveling to Asia. His first coup was on a trip to Singapore, where a local department store bought his collection. By the 1970s, he was off to Japan, Hong Kong and the Middle East. ''I went everywhere,'' he says. ''I was the first real Westerner who came into that market as a wholesaler: a man carrying a case of jewels.''
Starting in the 1970s, Mr. Graff began selling jewels to the sultan of Brunei. Mr. Graff became close enough to the royal family that the sultan's brother lent him his Aston Martin during his visits. On a trip to the Philippines, he sold millions of dollars in jewelry to Imelda Marcos.
By the time wealthy Arabs arrived in London in the 1980s, Mr. Graff was the man to see. At that time, prices for big stones were beginning to rise. A watershed moment came in 1987: Francois Curiel, who heads the jewelry department for Christie's, president of Christie's Asia, recalled that in that year, a red diamond weighing 0.95 carat sold for $880,000, or $926,000 a carat. Before that, the highest price per carat for a diamond was $127,000. That was an anomaly, but prices for large colored stones have since been rising.
WHEN the petrodollars stopped gushing, Mr. Graff looked beyond the Middle East. In 1998, he bought his 51 percent of Safdico. Three years later, he opened his first store in the United States. To establish his brand here, he struck a deal to open a number of boutiques in Saks Fifth Avenue stores. ''That got our name out overnight,'' he says.
Despite all the publicity about major diamond sales, even experienced dealers still struggle to read the tea leaves.
At a Christie's jewelry auction in April this year, the Graff team decided to bid up to $2.6 million for a fancy blue 3.25-carat diamond that was estimated to sell for $3 million to $3.2 million. (On top of the auction price, buyers must pay Christie's an additional 20 percent.)
Graff's thinking was that a retailer could not possibly charge a big-enough mark-up over $3 million to spend more for the stone. When a buyer agreed to a total of $3.66 million, Mr. Barguirdjian concluded that the buyer was probably a private individual in Asia, because ''three carats is too small for an American.'' He was half-right: it was an individual, but from Europe.
Just how Graff manages to carry an inventory worth many hundreds of millions is one of the great puzzles of the diamond market. Even experts scratch their heads about its finances.
One veteran jeweler, who did not want to comment publicly on industry names, says of Mr. Graff: It is ''a mystery where he gets the financing to carry so much inventory.'' But Mr. Graff says that carrying the inventory is no problem.
While the world of Graff might seem unaffected by the ups and downs of the workaday economy, it was in fact hurt by the recent slowdown. In 2008 and 2009, even the superrich pulled back.
In 2008, Graff Diamonds turned a pretax profit of $77 million on sales of $538 million, according to its chief financial officer, Nick Paine. In 2009, sales dropped to $432 million, and pretax profits to $62 million. Last year, sales were virtually flat, but pretax profits jumped to $86 million, mostly because of sales of smaller pieces with higher mark-ups. Which raises the question of how large his inventory of large stones has become.
Mr. Graff says he can turn a bigger profit by buying large, rough stones. ''I will make my money on buying the rough, in my polishing it and getting it to a certain level of market price,'' he says.
It can take from three months to a year to cut a rough stone. Cutting the Lesotho stone into 26 pieces, for instance, took nearly a year and involved more than a dozen people, he says.
Over time, the appetite for big stones hasn't surprised Martin Rapaport, publisher of the Rapaport Diamond Report, an industry bible. Big diamonds are a way to move money without a trace. ''Billionaires everywhere in the world like to keep some of their wealth in something easily transportable,'' he says.
Mr. Graff, now in his eighth decade, is circumspect about the future. His son Francois, 47, works for him in London. But two years ago, a potentially smooth family transition seemed at risk. Mr. Graff and his wife of 47 years, Anne Marie, were set to divorce after Mr. Graff fathered a child with a woman who had worked for him. The London tabloids screamed that it would be the largest divorce settlement in British history.
At the last minute, the couple reconciled. And Mr. Graff is open in recognizing his daughter. ''She carries my name and her mother's name,'' he said last week.
The Graff family empire, flawless or not, seems to be diamond-hard.

 The Lesotho Promise, shown above, a 603-carat rough diamond, was bought by Laurence Graff for $12.4 million. It yielded the 26 multishaped polished diamonds at left, all of which were set in a necklace now valued at more than $60 million. Though Mr. Graff also buys highly priced finished stones, he says he makes much of his money by acquiring rough stones, polishing them and increasing their market value.

HEADLINE: Lawyers and Accountants Once Put Integrity First

BYLINE: By MARK W. EVERSON. 
Mark W. Everson, the commissioner of the Indiana Department of Workforce Development, was the commissioner of the I.R.S. from 2003 to 2007.

 BODY:
Indianapolis
NEARLY a year after President Obama signed into law a huge overhaul of financial regulations, little on Wall Street seems to have changed. Regulators appear to be dragging their feet on finalizing the tough new rules that the law, known as Dodd-Frank, authorized them to write. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has yet to get off the ground. State attorneys general are still pressing mortgage servicers for a financial settlement over the widespread fraud and abuse in lending practices.
It will take decades to fully untangle the causes of the 2008 financial crisis, but as our economy fitfully heals, it would be prudent to ask whether lawyers and accountants offer the same protection against corporate misconduct that they once did.
Three or four decades ago, investors and regulators could rely on these professionals to provide a check on corporate risk-taking. But over time, attorneys and auditors came to see their practices not as independent firms that strengthen the integrity of capitalism, but as businesses measured chiefly by the earnings of their partners. 
When my father finished Harvard Law School in 1948, he went to work at one of the best law firms in New York. It was an era in which top-end legal work for the nation's biggest companies was handled by a limited number of firms that drew their entering lawyers from a handful of schools. But that didn't mean instant prosperity for the new attorney. Earning $3,600 a year, my dad shared a two-bedroom apartment in Greenwich Village with three classmates. At the time a United States District Court judge was paid a salary of $15,000. Today, a judge's salary has gone up slightly more than tenfold, a bit more than the increase in inflation. A new lawyer at the firm where my father worked, however, is pulling down well over 40 times what my dad first earned.
I also began my career in New York, in 1976, as an auditor with one of what was then the Big Eight (now the Big Four accounting firms). Salaries were increasing, but top-tier accounting and law firms were still operating pretty much as they always had. To be sure, you lived well. But moving up the ladder, you didn't expect to get rich. Wealth was reserved for business owners (and generally for corporate executives), talented investors and investment bankers who risked their own capital. One's stature derived from the respect accorded an independent professional. The mission of the junior accountant or lawyer was clear to all: help clients adhere to professional standards and follow the law. Beyond that, do your best to differentiate your firm based on superior service.
Necessarily, the actions of outside professionals were guided by a cautious orientation. I remember one partner advising a bunch of young auditors examining the financial statements of several of the biggest companies in the world, ''If you try hard enough, you can always make the numbers add up.'' His point was clear: technical compliance alone was not sufficient. Substance mattered.
Recent decades have seen a new model take root: a business plan tied to partner earnings. Obviously, to pay employees more and to increase partner pay to its present, staggering levels, billings needed to grow. Perhaps today's approach to fee generation by leading law firms was best stated in a recent Wall Street Journal article about partners billing over $1,000 per hour. Said one such lawyer, ''The underlying principle is if you can get it, get it.'' Imagine a doctor saying that, for attribution, about an organ transplant.
Understandably, corporate clients are reluctant to pay through the nose for advice on how to color safely within the lines. Whereas concern for a company's reputation on the part of its executives historically served to reinforce the conservative influence of the outside professionals, it is well documented that attitudes have shifted within corporations themselves. One need look no further than General Electric's no-longer-obscure tax department to see how traditional law and accounting functions have morphed into profit centers.
Lawyers and accountants who were once the proud pillars of our financial system have become the happy architects of its circumvention. Nowhere is this more the case than in the world of tax law. Companies (and wealthy individuals) pay handsomely for tax professionals not just to find the lines, but to push them ever outward. During my tenure at the Internal Revenue Service, the low point came when we discovered that a senior tax partner at KPMG (one of the Big Four, which by virtue of their prominence set standards for the others) had advocated -- in writing -- to leaders of the company's tax practice that KPMG make a ''business/strategic decision'' to ignore a particular set of I.R.S. disclosure rules. The reasoning was that the I.R.S. was unlikely to discover the underlying transactions, and that even if we did, any penalties assessed could be absorbed as a cost of doing business.
Just what role outside professional firms played in the genesis of the financial crisis has not been adequately explored. Perhaps it never will be. But at a minimum, we know that the widespread documentation problems associated with bank foreclosures demonstrate that in too many instances, attorneys and accountants abandoned their duties to assure integrity. Further, it seems unlikely that professionals will, of their own initiative, return anytime soon to their traditional posts as vigilant sentries guaranteeing the financial system's integrity.
WHAT should be done? For starters, Congress should take a hard look at the doctrine of attorney-client privilege as it applies to corporations. Communications pertaining to patents, or threatened or actual litigation, should remain protected. But communications about, say, commercial transactions and financing and even government-mandated filings and disclosures might not. Simply stated, lawyers will be less likely to stretch the acceptable to earn a high fee or secure repeat business if their counsel is subject to more outside scrutiny.
This would no doubt change the way regulators and prosecutors examine the roles of outside lawyers and law firms when investigating significant corporate failures -- a good thing, in my view.
To open this can of worms would touch off howls of outrage from the American Bar Association and others. Nevertheless, such a debate would be healthy, especially when policy makers are struggling to find the proper distinction between the rights and protections afforded companies versus those granted to individuals, notably in the political process.
A second idea is for corporations to reassess their compensation practices for financial and legal executives. Just as some large businesses are moving to separate the position of board chairman from that of chief executive in order to provide for stronger governance, companies might also consider development of a new pay scheme for their financial and legal personnel. This would mean paying handsome, multiyear fixed salaries to the chief financial officer, the general counsel and their top deputies -- but without offering the opportunity for equity participation. Such an approach would sharply limit the temptation to inflate shareholder value at the expense of business substance.
Big businesses have always sought to gain competitive advantage over others and certainly to minimize taxes, as have any number of taxpayers. Fair enough. But we have seen that globalization, business complexity and an unworkable tax code have obscured the understanding of risk. Politicians are reviewing our system of corporate taxation -- none too soon if our nation is to prosper as it has in the past. We should look at all the moving parts in our financial system -- starting with the outside professionals -- not just Wall Street and Washington.

HEADLINE: Standstill Nation

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Early in June, President Obama and House Republicans met at the White House to bridge differences. Republicans complained that Mr. Obama was demagoguing their Medicare plan. The president said he knew a little about demagoguery as the ''job-killing, death-panel, probably-wasn't-born-here president.'' Seventy-five minutes later, they parted no closer to agreement.
If anything has defined the second half of Mr. Obama's term, it has been the politics of paralysis. On jobs and debt, health care and education, Washington seems stalled. In coming weeks, the president and Republicans presumably will cut a deal to slash spending while raising the debt limit, though even then it may not be a long-term solution to the nation's crushing problems. And then Democrats will go back to attacking Republicans, and Republicans will go back to attacking the president. 
Is this any way to run a country? As it happens, yes. Ideal it is not. Inspiring, hardly at all. But the fractious, backbiting, finger-pointing, polarizing, partisan, kick-the-can-down-the-road brinkmanship of Washington politics these days is, let's face it, the reality of American governance in the modern era. For all the hand-wringing about how the system is broken, this is the system as it was designed and is now adapted for the digital age. All the high-minded vows to put politics aside for the greater good ignore the fact that the system is built on politics, with the idea that politics, however ugly, eventually can produce a greater good, however imperfect.
No less an authority on Washington than Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a nearly four-decade veteran of the nation's capital, emerged last week to defend the system's ability to get things done despite all appearances to the contrary. It may be maddening, it may be drawn out, but he argued, at the end of the day, Washington does what it has to do.
''What is the shtick out there? 'This is a dysfunctional place, can't get anything done,' '' Mr. Biden told reporters on Thursday after a bipartisan meeting on deficit reduction. ''The single most important thing to do for the markets is to convince them that, no, no, that's not true, we can handle difficult decisions and make them.''
That remains to be seen, of course. And there is certainly room for doubt. In the nearly six months since divided government returned to Washington, Mr. Obama's domestic agenda has largely gone nowhere. On the home page of the White House Web site, the most recent entry under the heading ''Featured Legislation'' dates back to Jan. 4, a food safety act passed by the last Congress. No legislation passed and signed since then rates a mention.
As a Wall Street Journal editorial noted last week, the administration has also delayed moving forward even when it does not need Congress, including tightening regulation of carbon emissions and the financial investments known as derivatives. The Journal called this a ''hiatus from liberalism'' heading into an election year, a conclusion the White House rejects.
Both sides present the other as masters of inaction. Senator John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, complained last week that Democrats have failed to even pass a budget. ''We have not done a budget in 777 days,'' he said. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, parried by noting, ''It's been 163 days since the Republicans have taken over the majority of the House of Representatives, almost six months, and still no jobs bill on the floor.''
Both sides, naturally, call the other's claim misleading. But left hanging are the 14 million unemployed Americans, leading to manufactured expressions of outrage about the other side's supposed indifference. When Mr. Obama said there were ''bumps in the road'' to recovery, former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, a Republican presidential candidate, aired an ad with unemployed people standing up from the street to say, ''I'm an American, not a bump in the road.'' When the very well-off Mr. Romney later joked with jobless workers in Florida that ''I'm also unemployed,'' it became the Democrats' turn to express outrage.
Little wonder so many feel turned off by a process that seems so shallow and self-serving. Yet it is part of a cycle that is not new. For decades, Washington has lurched from periods of frenetic action to periods of aggravating stalemate. President Bill Clinton signed legislation overhauling welfare in 1996 only after vetoing two earlier versions. President George W. Bush pushed through far-reaching security legislation after Sept. 11, 2001, only to find his domestic agenda frozen when the Iraq war went south.
Mr. Obama signed plenty of legislation when Democrats ran Congress, capping last year with a bipartisan tax deal, a repeal of restrictions on gays and lesbians in the military and the ratification of an arms control treaty with Russia. The fallow period since then was broken mainly when he and Republicans reached a spending agreement to avoid a government shutdown.
''I see these travails and troubles as part of that process,'' said David W. Hobbs, who was White House legislative affairs director during Mr. Bush's first term. ''Not to be fatalistic about it, but at the end of the day when a deal has to get done, I still think they find a way. The system finds a way when you have to find a deal.''
Before joining the White House, Mr. Hobbs served as chief of staff to Dick Armey, then the House Republican leader. ''He always used to say this funny line: 'The pain is inevitable, the suffering's optional,' '' Mr. Hobbs recalled. ''It always got a good laugh, and he said it a lot. And then I got to thinking about it, and came to realize that it's not really true. It's the suffering that makes a deal really possible.''
Steve Elmendorf, Mr. Hobbs's opposite number as chief of staff to Dick Gephardt, House Democratic leader during the Bush administration, recalled a similar saying by his old boss. ''Gephardt used to say, 'Congress is a substitute for violence,' '' Mr. Elmendorf said. ''When you go around the world, they kill each other. Here we go down to the floor and argue with each other.''
After two decades in Washington, Mr. Elmendorf rejects the nostalgia for the supposedly good old days and the lament that it's so much worse now. ''This discussion comes up every couple years and I personally think that it's no different than it's ever been,'' he said. ''Congress is a partisan institution and elections make it more partisan and people fight, and when big things happen like 9/11 they come together, but then they go back to fighting some more.''
Moreover, it's useful to remember that the founders devised the system to be difficult, dividing power between states and the federal government, then further dividing the federal government into three branches, then further dividing the legislative branch into two houses. The idea, James Madison wrote, was to keep factions from gaining too much power, presuming that ''a coalition of a majority of the whole society could seldom take place on any other principles than those of justice and the general good.''
And to be sure, gridlock is in the eye of the beholder. For those whose ox would get gored -- for instance, those adamantly opposed to tax increases or to cuts in entitlement benefits -- a little stalemate may not seem like a bad thing if it prevents what they consider a worse outcome. One person's obstructionism is another's principled opposition. As Melinda Burns wrote in Miller-McCune magazine last year, ''The real outcome of most lobbying -- in fact, its greatest success -- is the achievement of nothing, the maintenance of the status quo.''
That's not to say the system doesn't have problems, and many disagree with Mr. Elmendorf, like Norman Ornstein, the American Enterprise Institute scholar who said on a panel the other day, ''I've never seen our politics this dysfunctional'' (a point he's made before). An example is the appointment process. While Ronald Reagan had 86 percent of his Senate-confirmed executive appointees in place by the end of his first year, Mr. Obama had just 64 percent, according to a study by Anne Joseph O'Connell of the University of California, Berkeley, law school.
The pace has worsened under Mr. Obama. ''It's more symptom of the paralysis than cause, but it has enormous impact on the ability to faithfully execute the law,'' said Paul Light of New York University, who has studied the trends. ''It tends to create a molasses-like paralysis inside the agencies as they consider rules and regulatory actions because they have nobody who really speaks with the full authority of the administration.''
Some have proposed reforms to circumvent paralysis. Alice M. Rivlin, a White House budget director under Mr. Clinton, has served on two commissions aimed at reducing the deficit, both of which found bipartisan consensus only to be disregarded by elected officials. ''There's a highly charged partisan atmosphere in electoral politics these days,'' she said. ''We just came off an election and we're already thinking about the next one. I think it's worse today and the problem is bigger.''
To Peter R. Orszag, Mr. Obama's first budget director, the solution to paralysis may be ... paralysis. Rather than fight the inevitable, he proposes turning it on its head by creating systems that move forward with, for example, Medicare cost restraints unless the president and Congress act.
''The question becomes: Is it possible to take legislative gridlock and use it to your advantage rather than disadvantage?'' he asked in a recent speech. ''In order to do so, the default has to be flipped, so that legislative inertia leads to good outcomes rather than bad outcomes.''
What would Madison think?

HEADLINE: Texas Leader Calls for Rightward Tilt

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, the latest Republican to muse openly about exploring a Republican presidential candidacy, drew booming applause here on Saturday for not only assailing President Obama but also lecturing some members of his own party on the importance of socially conservative principles. 
''It saddens me, sometimes, when my fellow Republicans duck and cover in the face of pressure from the left,'' Mr. Perry said, urging activists not to separate economic and social priorities. ''We need to redouble our efforts to elect more conservative Republicans.''
In an appearance at the Republican Leadership Conference, which served as something of a debut for Mr. Perry's presidential ambitions, hundreds of delegates chanted, ''Run, Rick, run!'' He smiled, waved and basked in the enthusiasm but did not say whether he would answer their call to join the party's unsettled field of presidential candidates.
Mr. Perry, who succeeded George W. Bush as governor and was elected to a third term last year, had long maintained that he had no interest in running for president. But in recent weeks, he has signaled that he is reconsidering and trying to determine if there is still time to piece together a credible candidacy.
He has sent his strategists to begin gauging the level of political support that would exist in early-voting states, along with financial support across the country, if he decided to jump into the race. His decision is still likely to be a few weeks away, his advisers said, adding that he realizes that time is running short to build an operation in Iowa, New Hampshire and beyond.
His afternoon speech in New Orleans, a finale to a three-day session that featured a handful of presidential candidates and party leaders, underscored the interest that is growing around Mr. Perry's potential presidential run. He promoted his record of creating jobs in Texas, which he said has one of the strongest state economies in the nation.
His scathing broadside against the Obama administration, which he called ''a mix of arrogance and audacity that is an affront to every freedom-loving American,'' is precisely the message that many Republican activists say is missing from the field of candidates. ''Americans voted for hope and got nothing more than greater economic misery,'' he said.
His campaign pitch, should he decide to run, would be rooted in an equal measure of inspiring economic growth and preserving social values. He did not mention that Texas ranks near the bottom on several measures, including among the lowest in education funding per student and spending on the environment. But he sought to highlight legislative accomplishments like requiring voters to have ID cards.
''Our loudest opponents on the left are never going to like us, so let's quit trying to curry favor with them,'' Mr. Perry said.
''The fact is, we may be out of time and this may not be able to work. We don't know,'' David Carney, his longtime political strategist, said in an interview. ''It's 50-50. There's nothing contrived about this.''

 BODY:
HALF A LIFE: A Memoir, by Darin Strauss (Random House, $13.) At 18, Strauss was behind the wheel when his Oldsmobile struck and killed a fellow high school student in suburban Long Island. In his subtle yet wrenching book, Strauss, the author of ''Chang and Eng'' (2000), explores memory, guilt and coming-of-age after a life-altering event.
THE LAKE SHORE LIMITED, by Sue Miller (Vintage Contemporaries, $15.) Miller's latest novel is a richly layered series of character studies. At the story's emotional center is Gus, who was on one of the planes that smashed into the World Trade Center; in alternating sections Miller traces four people touched by his death, including his older sister, Leslie, and his lover, Billy, a playwright who channels her conflicted feelings into her work. 
THE WAVE: In Pursuit of the Rogues, Freaks, and Giants of the Ocean, by Susan Casey (Anchor, $15.95.) Scientists, mariners, extreme surfers and mountains of water mix it up as Casey, the editor in chief of O: The Oprah Magazine and the author of ''The Devil's Teeth: A True Story of Obsession and Survival Among America's Great White Sharks'' (2005), examines big waves from every angle. Our reviewer, Holly Morris, called this a ''wonderfully vivid, kinetic narrative.''
CITRUS COUNTY, by John Brandon (McSweeney's Rectangulars, $14.) Brandon grippingly hybridizes the crime novel with the novel of adolescent longing: in the swampy backwaters of Florida, his smart, bighearted hero draws closer to the new girl in town -- even as he ravages her family's life with one horrifying act.
OBAMA'S WARS, by Bob Woodward (Simon & Schuster, $16.) Woodward's fifth book about wartime decision making in the White House draws on interviews, internal memorandums and classified documents to chronicle the Obama administration's efforts to construct plausible policies on Afghanistan and Pakistan.
FATHER OF THE RAIN, by Lily King (Grove, $14.95.) King's third novel exposes the dark side of a New England family riven by addiction. Simultaneously in thrall to and undone by her father, whose cruelty and alcoholism have pushed her away, King's earnest heroine yearns to fix his crumbling life, so as to mend her own. ''King is a beautiful writer,'' Liesl Schillinger wrote in the Book Review. ''Silently or aloud, her characters betray the inner tumult they conceal as they try to keep themselves together.''
GLOBISH: How the English Language Became the World's Language, by Robert McCrum (Norton, $16.95.) McCrum, a British author and editor who has co-written several editions of ''The Story of English,'' explains ''Globish'' as an economic phenomenon -- the world's aspirational language, the lingua franca of international culture and commerce. Here he combines a journalistic account of its worldwide use and a history of the development of English as it made its way around the world.
STRIP, by Thomas Perry (Otto Penzler/Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.95.) In Perry's rambunctious thriller, an aging strip-club owner and money launderer in Los Angeles is robbed of a night's take. His thirst for revenge leads to Joe Carver, an out-of-towner who, while blameless, is anything but harmless.

HEADLINE: Signs of Life Spotted in the Senate: Democrats, silent for months, are starting to speak up on Medicaid and job creation

 BODY:
Sitting in a defensive crouch for months at a time can get a little uncomfortable, and several Senate Democrats are finally starting to rouse themselves. In the last weeks, there have been some tiny but tantalizing hints that at least a few senators want to offer an alternative to the Republican cost-cutting frenzy and talk about ways to cut sensibly and help put people back to work. 
Last week, 41 Senate Democrats wrote letters to President Obama urging him to resist the Republican effort to sharply cut and transform Medicaid, the joint federal and state health program that primarily benefits poor children and pregnant women, disabled adults, and nursing home residents. Several senators have also broken through the wall of fear in Washington that prohibits discussion of stimulus spending.
These actions might seem unremarkable by Democrats in an ordinary year, but those in the Senate have largely been invisible in the current Congress, cowed by a noisy Republican majority in the House and afraid of losing their three-vote edge in the 2012 elections. Senate Democrats will not even put their priorities on the record by producing a budget, leaving it to the White House to negotiate with the House on matters like the debt ceiling.
The Republicans are desperate to show Tea Party voters that they can land a blow on an entitlement program. Medicare cuts are a political loser, but Medicaid -- serving a far less powerful clientele than the middle class -- has become highly vulnerable to their ax. Paul Ryan, the House budget chairman, has proposed turning Medicaid into a block grant program, giving states lump sums that could not possibly keep pace with rising costs, and allowing states the flexibility to drop coverage for millions.
With the White House eager to cut a deal, 37 senators, led by John Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, wrote President Obama last week urging him to stand firm against these Republican proposals, saying they would not let the government ''walk away from Medicaid's 68 million beneficiaries, the providers that serve them, and the urban and rural communities in which they live.'' Similar letters were sent by four other senators.
At the same time, Mr. Rockefeller, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, and a few other Democratic senators are urging the administration to stimulate hiring by spending billions to improve infrastructure. Speaking on the Senate floor last week, Mr. Harkin said the Republican focus on spending cuts would kill millions of jobs, and called for new spending to prevent a double-dip recession. Though Republicans will immediately ridicule the idea by repeating their mantra that the 2009 stimulus ''failed,'' Mr. Harkin and others have found their voice enough to respond that it actually saved or created at least four million jobs and probably many more.
These signs of a stirring in the Senate should inspire the rest of the caucus -- and a reluctant White House -- to their feet again. What's the point of having a majority if you don't use it?

HEADLINE: The Obstinacy of Error, Interest Rates Edition

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Keynes vindicated, but nobody notices.

 BODY:
Brad DeLong reposts something he wrote two years ago about interest rates; it was, I think, at least in part a followup to my slightly earlier post on liquidity preference and loanable funds. Brad and I both believe that the story of interest rates in this crisis is both remarkable and under-appreciated.
Here's how it went down. In early 2009 we were faced with the prospect of (a) huge borrowing by the United States and other advanced-nation governments, because the recession had savaged revenues and increased the costs of safety-net program (b) a protracted period of high unemployment, with monetary policy likely to be up against the zero lower bound for years to come.
Many private investors - plus economists and economic commentators who never understood Keynes - looked at (a) and confidently predicted soaring interest rates. Economists who did get Keynes looked at (b) and said that rates would stay low unless government borrowing was large enough to return the economy to something like full employment, which was unlikely.
The economic argument for rates staying low, by the way, wasn't complicated: it amounted to saying that the IS curve looked like this:
and that there was no reason for the interest rate to rise, even with large government borrowing, unless that borrowing shifted the IS curve enough to the right to bring the economy above the zero lower bound. The subtlety arose from understanding that at each point on that IS curve the supply and demand for loanable funds are in fact equal, that liquidity preference and loanable funds are both true.
And here we are, two-plus years later, and the interest rate on 10-year U.S. Treasuries is only 2.94 percent. This should count as a triumph of economic analysis: the model was pitted against the intuitions of practical men, making a prediction many people considered ridiculous - and the model was right.
And nobody noticed; economic discourse - and even a lot of investment strategy -- continues to rely on the supply-and-demand-for-bonds view, even though it has been thoroughly discredited by experience. 
How is this possible? 
One answer is that the Greeks muddied the waters. The solvency problems of the Greek government actually have nothing to do with the notion that we'll face crowding out because the government is selling too many bonds, even with the economy depressed; but many of the original crowding-out prophets nonetheless seized on Greece and claimed that it vindicated their views.
More broadly, I guess it turns out that Hicks/Keynes analysis is harder than it looks, and that even smart people - many of them with economics PhDs - just can't wrap their minds around the notion that sometimes just doing supply and demand isn't enough.
The result - that one theory has been proved wrong, another proved right, yet the world continues to believe in Theory #1 - is frustrating. It's also tragic, because that intellectual obstinacy is contributing to the "new normal" of permanently high unemployment.

HEADLINE: Early Music Festival: Weighing the Costs

BYLINE: ALLAN KOZINN


HIGHLIGHT: This successful, 30-year-old celebration of early music has been fighting the effects of the economic downturn just as other arts organizations have.

 BODY:
BOSTON - You would hardly know it, given the number of performances the Boston Early Music Festival and its related fringe festival have fielded this year, but this successful, 30-year-old celebration of early music has been fighting the effects of the economic downturn just as other arts organizations have. Financial support from foundations, corporations and individual donors has not quite recovered. But Kathleen Fay, the festival's executive director, said that the situation has improved greatly since the last festival, in 2009. 
That year the festival had to postpone its planned production of Graupner's "Antiochus und Stratonica" because it could not raise the $1.5 million needed to stage it. Instead the festival mounted a production of Monteverdi's "Incoronazione di Poppea," which cost about $800,000. It was a magnificent staging of a great work, but it was not what this festival normally does: revive unknown gems that have not been seen in centuries yet deserve to be heard. 
The Graupner was to have been done this year. Again it was beyond reach, though only slightly.
This year's production of Steffani's "Niobe, Regina di Tebe" cost about $1.2 million. And Ms. Fay said on Saturday that the Graupner, for which the staging and scenery have already been designed, will be on the schedule in 2013.
"We have two years to get there and we will," she added, though she now estimates the cost at closer to $1.6 million.
That said, ticket sales for "Niobe" were slower than Ms. Fay had hoped, particularly early in the run. (Though the festival ends on Sunday, "Niobe" is traveling to the Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center, in Great Barrington, Mass., on June 24 and 25.) 
"We have a reputation for uncovering lost gems," Ms. Fay said, "but that creates challenges. The biggest problem is that the works we do don't have the instant appeal that name recognition would give them. But it's what we do, and what we're committed to. We're not interested in pulling out the same pieces over and over." 
There are other challenges, too, including the timing of the festival. Because it is held in mid-June, after the school year has ended, it has access to performance spaces like Jordan Hall at the New England Conservatory. But with school out, a significant part of the Boston audience that would normally be drawn to the festival - music students and professors - have left town. Still, it draws an international crowd, which Ms. Fay estimated at about 15,000, comparable to previous years. 
Ms. Fay noted that the festival has increased its international reach, both through recordings of its opera productions, five of which have been released on the CPO label since 2005, and through its tours to Europe. Ms. Fay said that the festival will take "Niobe" to Europe in 2013-14, with the same cast and musicians who performed it here. Plans are afoot to record it as well. 
Also on her wish list is a New York home for the festival's large-scale opera productions. At the moment, the Morgan Library & Museum presents a Boston Early Music Festival series, which last season included performances of Handel's chamber opera "Acis and Galatea," a piece that was performed in Boston during the concert season and is to be repeated here on Saturday evening. 
"That was our way of putting our toe in the water, presenting opera in New York," Ms. Fay said. "But for the bigger productions, we need a larger venue. We're working on that."

HEADLINE: Did My Brother Invent E-Mail With Tom Van Vleck? (Part One)

BYLINE: ERROL MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: A series in which family history dovetails with the invention of e-mail begins with a look at the computer-programming revolution at MIT in the 1960s.

 BODY:
This is part one of a five-part series.
1.
A SHORT COMMENT 
...the computer is here, and no doubt it is going to develop. Everybody, or almost everybody, seems a little uneasy about this, and why not? This is man's first encounter outside himself with something that is exactly like some inside part of himself.
- E. E. Morison, from "Computers and the World of the Future" (based on a conference in 1961 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of MIT)
It was a short comment on my recent essay in The Times, "The Ashtray."
#82: Tom Van VleckOcean City, NJMarch 11th, 20119:44pm
...I had email today from another middle school student asking about Noel Morris's place in history as (a) creator of electronic mail.
Noel Morris's place in history? Noel Morris was my older brother, who had dropped out of MIT and spent most of his waking hours holed up in an apartment working at a computer terminal. This was in the '60s, long before there was anything close to a home computer. The name Tom Van Vleck was not unfamiliar. He was a friend of my brother's who worked with him at MIT in those days. 
I called him.TOM VAN VLECK: Hello? 
ERROL MORRIS: I'm trying to find Tom Van Vleck.
TOM VAN VLECK: Speaking. 
ERROL MORRIS: It's Errol Morris. 
TOM VAN VLECK: Oh, hello, Errol. How are you? 
ERROL MORRIS: I'm fine. I remember you from years and years and years ago. 
TOM VAN VLECK: Well, that's good. I remember meeting you the one time when Noel introduced us. And that's all I remember. 
ERROL MORRIS: Yes. And when would that have been? 
TOM VAN VLECK: It would have been in the '70s sometime. It was in Cambridge, pretty sure. Noel and I were probably working together at Honeywell. 
ERROL MORRIS: I came up here to live about 20 years ago, but it was after Noel had died. I somehow saw myself as taking his place in Cambridge. Not far from two places where he used to live. I don't know if you remember his apartments. 
TOM VAN VLECK: Yes, I do. 
ERROL MORRIS: Because I spent a summer with my brother in 1969. 
TOM VAN VLECK: Okay, well maybe that was when I met you. 
ERROL MORRIS: And he had a terminal in his apartment. I remember the terminal very well. I also remember how often he would work through the night. He would be up for hours on end. 
TOM VAN VLECK: Yep, we used to razz him about that. We would say, "Noel, you can't stay up all night and then be awake at the daytime." 
ERROL MORRIS: But he did anyway? 
TOM VAN VLECK: Oh, he would try. But he would be not so sharp. 
ERROL MORRIS: No, I was just surprised to see that comment in The New York Times. And I had - 
TOM VAN VLECK: It was sort of bait, you know? I was wondering if you would respond. 
ERROL MORRIS: I've meant to write something about Noel, and also about my mother as well. It's long overdue. I didn't have the heart to go back into our house after my mother died. And a lot of stuff got thrown out. I still have bits and pieces. I was going to try to collect some stuff about Noel. The one thing I would really like to find is the eulogy that my mother read at the funeral home, which was very, very moving. My mother was very eloquent. I hope I can find it somewhere, I don't know. 
I am very curious. If part of the bait was talking about my brother inventing e-mail, that of course, interested me. Why wouldn't it? I was hooked. 
TOM VAN VLECK: Well, that story is online on my Web page. [1]
Van Vleck's Web page provides a great deal of information. Including a history of the Van Vlecks. The mathematics building at the University of Wisconsin, where my wife and I went to school, is named "Van Vleck Hall." I went to lectures there. My wife asked me, "Find out if he's related to that Van Vleck." He is. Edward Burr Van Vleck, a cousin, a beloved professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin, and an obsessive collector of Japanese woodblock prints. And then there's John H. Van Vleck, Edward's son, a professor of physics at Harvard, a Nobel laureate and one of the fathers of the atomic bomb. [2] There is even a Van Vleck crater on the moon, named after yet another mathematician cousin, John M. Van Vleck. [3]
TOM VAN VLECK: In 1965, at the beginning of the year, there was a bunch of stuff going on with the time-sharing system that Noel and I were users of. We were working for the political science department. And the system programmers wrote a programming staff note memo that proposed the creation of a mail command. But people proposed things in programming staff notes that never got implemented. And well, we thought the idea of electronic mail was a great idea. We said, "Where's electronic mail? That would be so cool." And they said, "Oh, there's no time to write that. It's not important." And we said, "Well, can we write it?" And we did. And then it became part of the system. 
ERROL MORRIS: The original request for mail, did you keep it? 
TOM VAN VLECK: Yes. It's posted on the Web page. There's a link to it. [4] [5] 
ERROL MORRIS: That's fantastic. It's fortunate that we have the documents, and also that I am able to ask you about what they mean. So many documents have been lost. You probably know that our father died when I was only two years old. Noel was six years older than I was. He would have been 8. And our father died of a massive heart attack. It's so sad and strange. Noel, for a high school project, built a model of the human heart showing the circulation of the blood. It was constructed with painted plexiglass and plywood. And the lights were rigged so that you could turn a crank and see how the blood circulated through the arteries and veins. TOM VAN VLECK: Gosh.
ERROL MORRIS: And he won a prize for it, I know that. But I keep thinking about his model of the heart and what happened to him and to my father. My father dead at 43, and Noel dead at 40. I know that it destroyed our mother because it meant that she was going through the same thing that she had gone through some 30 years earlier. 
TOM VAN VLECK: Right, right.
ERROL MORRIS: I watched it turn her into an old woman. It was truly horrible. And so completely unexpected. 
*******
I remember the day. We were living in this nightmare apartment building on Seventh Avenue and 54th Street. Over the Stage Deli. Julia, my wife, had called my mother to get her recipe for potato pancakes. I had gone to my office on Broadway, about a block away. Julia called me and told me my brother had died. I immediately took the train to my mother's house and stayed with her for the next 10 days. 
It was all a blur. I had never seen my mother like that. She was one of the strongest people I have ever known. But she was inconsolable. And I was angry, but I didn't know at whom. 
The funeral was in Brookline, Mass., at the Levine Chapel. I knew that my brother had friends, but he worked unendingly, and I was worried that nobody would be there for the funeral. There was my mother, my step-father, and my two step-brothers and step-sister. And, literally, hundreds of people. It was absolutely filled. People were standing in the back. I had the picture of my brother as isolated. Julia asked me, "How did they all find out?" And I said, "They communicate with each other using computers."
*******
ERROL MORRIS: So, is this really true? Did Noel invent e-mail? 
TOM VAN VLECK: He and I, together, invented e-mail. That's right. Someone else said, "Let's have an e-mail," but he and I were the people who took that wish and wrote code that did it. Now, I don't say we were the first or the only inventors, because I'm not interested in that. But I know that Noel and I invented it, and furthermore, I know that the e-mail that we invented was the ancestor of the e-mail for the next operating system, Multics, that we worked together on for many years. And that mail command was the ancestor of the mail command for many other systems, Unix, in particular. And so, it influenced all subsequent mail systems. So Noel has a legacy. [6] 
ERROL MORRIS: It was the beginning of e-mail.
TOM VAN VLECK: Back in the '60s, there was one time-sharing system at MIT. It was called CTSS. 
ERROL MORRIS: What did that stand for?
TOM VAN VLECK: Compatible Time-Sharing System. If Noel and I wanted to communicate, especially if he was up late and I was keeping more normal hours, we could leave disk files. I could leave a file called "Noel, read me." And then he would leave a note on another file saying "For Tom," or something like that. And so we would read these back and forth. It enabled us to do what postal mail did, but much faster, and it enabled us not to have to call each other and wake each other up if we were sleeping or whatever. And so the mail system replaced that with something very similar to what mail is like nowadays. You log in, you say, do I have any mail, and it shows it to you, and you can say, "Well, I want to send a note to this person." 
ERROL MORRIS: Do you have any of those early e-mails?
TOM VAN VLECK: No. No. Foolishly, I junked all that stuff at some point when I moved on from somewhere to somewhere. And people often ask, "What was the first e-mail message that you sent?"
ERROL MORRIS: Of course, it's like Alexander Graham Bell. [7] 
TOM VAN VLECK: I truly can't remember. I used to send scraps of poetry and stuff like that. [8] You just needed some string of text to test things out, for instance. And I would send whatever was running around in my head at the time. 
********
Since my brother was six years older than me, he was very much my big brother. He had endless gadgets. Electronic devices and, in particular, the Morrismatic Door, the door to his bedroom, which could be opened from his bed with a complicated system of ropes and pulleys. It was the quintessential Rube Goldberg device. And his hi-fi sets. Our family were friends with friends of Joseph Grado, who made hi-tech turntables, wooden tone-arms and phono cartridges. My brother was given a set of them as a present. And endless records - which I wasn't allowed to go near. My mother had graduated from Juilliard in piano, I was a cellist and Noel played the clarinet. But he had a passion for organ music, particularly Bach. That and Mahler. My mother, who was as devoted to music as anyone I have ever met, told Noel that it made her nervous in the mornings to hear the opening chords of Mahler's 1st or the B minor Prelude and Fugue at deafening volumes. 
When I was five or six, I was home with our beloved housekeeper, Mary Jane Hardman ("Hardy"), and I took out an LP and put it on a small portable phonograph, but it was set on 45 r.p.m. rather than 33, and so I was listening to Mozart 36 percent faster and higher than normal. I was ecstatic. It seemed like the most beautiful thing I had ever heard. And I was playing it. Or at least I was playing the record. When they returned I told them about what I had done and realized my mistake almost immediately. I often (or at least I felt this way) ended up looking stupid in front of my brother. Years later, he and a friend (who later became an astrophysicist) were in our backyard with a telescope looking at the moons of Jupiter. Jupiter was near the horizon line, and I suggested moving the telescope over to the other side of the yard. They laughed. Of course, it wouldn't have made any difference. Again, I realized my mistake almost immediately. But too late.
********
ERROL MORRIS: I was having trouble graduating from the University of Wisconsin because I had gone climbing in Yosemite during my senior year, and I had to finish my math requirements. That meant another calculus course. That's why I was in Cambridge in 1969, because Noel was helping me with my calculus homework. We used his copy of Thomas, "Calculus and Analytic Geometry." I still have it among my books.
TOM VAN VLECK: Wow. 
ERROL MORRIS: But he had a low opinion of himself - which I think is so nuts - because he had trouble with chemistry at MIT, but it seems to me in those days, MIT was designed to make smart people feel stupid. 
TOM VAN VLECK: Yep. It definitely was. We always said it was like a railroad station. Nobody cared if you were there or not, you know? You were supposed to get through and get to where you were going, and you didn't come there for support or anything like that. 
ERROL MORRIS: Where are you from originally? 
TOM VAN VLECK: I grew up in the Chicago area. And then came out to MIT, and stayed in Cambridge for 20 years. Had my haircut at the Coop, the same barber for 20 years. Then went to Silicon Valley for 20 years, and now I'm in Ocean City, N. J. 
ERROL MORRIS: Why do you live in Ocean City, if I may ask? 
TOM VAN VLECK: Well, my wife's from Baltimore and summered here when she was a girl. And so it was heaven to her. When we lived in California, we wanted to live at the beach. Out here, real estate is reasonable. Compared to California, anyways. And so, we live about five blocks from the beach, and we take a five-mile beach walk almost every day we can. 
*******
ERROL MORRIS: Were you an undergraduate at MIT?
TOM VAN VLECK: Yes. I got out in '65. 
ERROL MORRIS: Which is when Noel would have graduated if he had stayed.
TOM VAN VLECK: That's right. He finally finished up a few years later thanks to Art Evans. [9] 
ERROL MORRIS: I was told that they graded on a curve and routinely flunked out a certain percentage of students. 
TOM VAN VLECK: Well, yes, they did. We took a perverse pride in that. But the attitude of MIT was that you were there to learn and if you weren't, there were other people who wanted to be there in your place. And it was competitive just because people all wanted to be the best. And there was the issue that if you didn't have good enough grades, you might lose any scholarship aid you had, and it was an expensive school. So that was an issue for a lot of people. But it was competitive and it was very free, you could basically sign up for just about any course. You could take as much as you thought you could handle, and if you couldn't handle as much as you thought you could handle, then you had to deal with it. So it was a very big step for many kids - including me and I think Noel - from a much less stressful high school experience. 
ERROL MORRIS: But you finished on time?
TOM VAN VLECK: I finished ahead of time, actually, because I'd skipped some calculus at the beginning. 
ERROL MORRIS: And so when did you first meet my brother?
TOM VAN VLECK: I may have met Noel when we took course 6.251 together, which is system programming. But we really didn't meet until the fall of '64 when we both started to work for Professor Ithiel de Sola Pool. 
ERROL MORRIS: What work were you doing?
TOM VAN VLECK: Data handling code for social scientists. So the first two programs that we worked on, one was a cross tabulation system. If you have survey data, you produce a table that says how many people had this and how many people had that. And the other one was a simulation program which simulated the diffusion of information within a social group. We may have been funded by the CIA, but nobody mentioned that at the time. [10] 
ERROL MORRIS: This is before you went to work for Project MAC?
TOM VAN VLECK: That's right. Project MAC had been founded by that time and had had its famous summer study. But the work that Noel and I were doing for political science was initially just using MIT computer center facilities and then later on, we got accounts on the Project MAC machine because they were trying to see what people would do with computers if they had access to them. [11] 
ERROL MORRIS: I remember that Noel had concerns about Pool's politics. Maybe that's all related to the CIA stuff. 
TOM VAN VLECK: I think so. Pool hobnobbed with a bunch of people from Washington, and we were dissuaded from asking questions about it, I guess you could say. He would say, "Well, I have to do something, I have to do some fundraising" or something, and he'd go off to Washington. Pool had been one of the people who helped with the Kennedy election back in whatever that was.
ERROL MORRIS: '60.
TOM VAN VLECK: '60, right. And you may have read a popular book called "The 480," which talked about survey analysts dividing the population into 480 different categories of socioeconomic status, and so on, and devising a pitch for each group. Well, Pool contributed to some of the theoretical underpinnings of that, which was supposedly part of Kennedy getting elected. [12] But I don't know whether Noel was concerned with that or not, or whether it was concerned with being cozy with Washington and possibly the CIA. I was naive and that all just went right over my head. There were later issues on the MIT campus when the anti-Vietnam War sentiment really became prevalent in the late '60s and early '70s. And at that time, Pool's work had metamorphosed into a social science research project which was called The Cambridge Project, which had Department of Defense funding, and provided data analysis tools that were used by government agencies. There were rabble-rousing articles against them, and it could have been by then that Pool's politics began to be suspect.
ERROL MORRIS: So, you and my brother found yourselves in the same office together? 
TOM VAN VLECK: Yes. We worked together and it turned out we got on pretty well. We worked effectively as a team encouraging each other and when one would be losing interest a little, the other would pull them along. And we accomplished a lot more than either one of us could have singly. I think two is just the right size for a lot of teams and certainly this worked great for us.
*******
Later, Tom kindly sent me his memories of my brother. They had met in 1963.
I knew Noel slightly from when we took class 6.251, "System Programming." The final set of exercises for the course had students submit batches of changes to an elementary machine language assembler: you got points for each of a set of possible improvements, some required, some optional. Noel and I tried to get as many points as we could, far beyond what was needed to get an A.
We applied for part-time student programming jobs in fall of 1964 for Prof. Ithiel de Sola Pool, who taught political science.
The first office Noel and I shared was in Building 14, the MIT library. There was a row of windowless offices on the second floor, on a corridor accessible through the stacks. Our office had a nameplate that said "T Lehrer / N Morris." (Yes, that Tom Lehrer. We shared an office with him but never met him. He had an appointment at Harvard, and also worked with the MIT Center for International Studies, which was the organization that paid our salaries too. If he used the office at all, it was in the mornings or early afternoon, when Noel and I had classes and labs. We were more the night shift. I once mentioned Lehrer to Mrs. Pool, who said, "He's quite nice, but very shy.") 
The great thing about the office was the IBM 1050 terminal, which had a golf-ball printing mechanism and could produce letter quality output.
The first program we worked on together was a "cross tabulation" system. That is, it read in survey data with one or more cards per response, each having responses punched in one or more columns. Our program counted how many responses picked each answer and printed totals, e.g. marital status versus number of dogs. The program was quite complex, adaptable to many kinds of coding schemes, and supported many ways of specifying tables and statistical calculations. For years after the MIT 7094 was gone, we would get queries from social scientists who wanted to use it. One thing we did was to write a memo describing the program, using RUNOFF, the brand new facility for editing a document online with the time-sharing system and printing it out nicely formatted, with justified right margins. 
I now believe that the Center for International Studies was paid for indirectly by the CIA. The source of funds was never mentioned to us. We did other work on a simulation of how people in Eastern Bloc countries got their information, e.g. by rumor, radio, etc. which was supposedly paid for by Radio Free Europe, the US funded station that broadcast across the Iron Curtain into the Communist satellites. We used the cross-tabs system to analyze some very poor survey data and try to match it up to the simulation output from a grad student's thesis.
Office space at any university is under a lot of pressure, and time-sharing terminals were scarce. The newly formed Project MAC had both available, and Prof. Pool arranged for us to get an office on the fifth floor of the new Tech Square building, right next to a public terminal room, in 1964. It was great. We could almost always find a free terminal, either next door or upstairs, and more importantly there were other programmers there at all hours. We learned from them, shared code, made friendships, tried to impress. The term "hacker" is now disreputable, but it was not so then, and we learned from some of the greatest hackers in the world.
I managed to graduate in February 1965 and was offered a full-time position on the MIT research staff, working for Prof. Pool. My stating salary was $550/month. I think Noel made the same amount. (This was slightly less than a substitute mailman made.) An important feature of a job on the MIT Division of Sponsored Research staff was that MIT would write to your local draft board requesting an occupational deferment. This was during the Vietnam War, and the draft was a serious consideration. (One reason I abandoned hopes of going to graduate school was that my Illinois draft board had indicated that it would not support educational deferments for graduate school.)
I don't remember when Noel stopped his studies and became a full-time staff member; it was probably in fall of 1964. After I became full-time too, our usual pattern was to come in to Tech Square by 10 or 11 o'clock, and work until quite late, perhaps 3 AM. We would usually go out to dinner somewhere: DSR staff could eat at the MIT Faculty Club if they wore ties, so we did that sometimes, or we would go to Jack and Marion's, or the English Room, or S&S in Inman Square. [13]
The offices in Tech Square were luxurious by modern standards. They had solid walls, doors that closed, and windows. Each programmer had his own desk, file cabinet, and bookcase. In our office we also had a 20-drawer file cabinet for punch cards, because we had program decks for lots of the Political Science batch programs. Noel always had a small hi-fi tuned to classical music in his office. The main feature of any system programmer's office in those days was stacks of paper: program listings and core dumps.
We disagreed sometimes. We argued. We fought. We solved our problems and went on. We tolerated each other, we defended each other, we learned from each other, we got stuff done. It was exhilarating and exhausting: work, go home and sleep, back to work, for days on end.
Outside of work we led independent lives. I dated several different women; if Noel dated at all I don't remember discussing it. I think he used to go folk dancing and attend concerts, with friends from outside work.
Noel lived on Lee St in Cambridge during part of the 60s; I moved every year, always looking for a better place.
In the Spring of 1965, we were working for Political Science, using CTSS, the Compatible Time-Sharing System, as our programming environment. We wrote code in MAD, a FORTRAN-like language, and in FAP, the assembly program for the IBM 7094. I wrote a few programs for the Computation Center's IBM 1401, which was used to create input and print output tapes for the 7094, but sat idle a lot. I had learned the 1401 from summer jobs in previous years, and I taught Noel the machine language.
CTSS was the cutting edge of computing in those days: using the computer on-line instead of running batch jobs was new and controversial; and Noel and I had offices on the same floor as the system programmers, and got to know them, got invited to meetings they attended, socialized and became friends. This was exciting and interested us more than adding features to the data analysis programs. We wanted to show the system folks what we could do and maybe eventually get jobs as system programmers.
In 1965, the system programmers at Project MAC were phasing out of developing CTSS. The IBM 7094 was stretched to its limit and often overloaded: one reason we worked late hours was to have access to the computer when it was less busy. Project MAC had obtained funding and begun to plan a new computer system, called Multics, Multiplexed Information and Computing Service. CTSS was the tool that the Multics programmers would use to build the first version of the new system. We were tantalized by discussions of the features that the new system would have, and in some cases, found ways to implement the new ideas on the old system, CTSS.

Van Vleck's account and the fragments of source code published on his Web site suggest an opportunity to look further. Did e-mail emerge in the process of building a time-sharing system? Or was it envisioned from the very beginnings. And if it was envisioned, who were the architects? Who were the builders? Would it be possible, digging into the code itself, to determine who wrote what, when?

[2] Van Vleck wrote in an e-mail, "I met John H. Van Vleck twice. When I had an office at MIT in the early 70s, I occasionally got mail addressed to 'John H Van Vleck, MIT' with no room number. I presume these were former colleagues of his who worked with him on RADAR at the MIT Radiation Laboratory during World War II. The MIT mail service matched the last name and would deliver his mail to me. I would stick them in an inter-department envelope and write John H Van Vleck, Harvard, and send them on. So one day, my office phone rang, and a voice said, 'This is your second cousin once removed!' It was Prof. Van Vleck, and he invited me to lunch at the Harvard Faculty Club. I said yes. I was a little shy of meeting a great man (this was before the Nobel Prize but I knew he was famous) and asked a friend who was a professor of Physics at MIT if he knew JHVV and what he was like. 'If the conversation gets dull, ask him about trains in Europe,' my friend advised. 'He has the timetable in his pocket.' Turned out I didn't need this advice: Prof. Van Vleck was wonderful, polite, charming, and full of anecdotes from the history of Physics...'"
[3] Van Vleck Crater, Lunar and Planetary Institute 
[4] Indeed. The document is posted and described by Tom Van Vleck in his Web page on electronic mail. A proposed CTSS MAIL command was described in an undated Programming Staff Note 39 by Louis Pouzin, Glenda Schroeder, and Pat Crisman. Numerical sequence places the note in either Dec 64 or Jan 65. PSN 39 proposed a facility that would allow any CTSS user to send a message to any other. The proposed uses were communication from "the system" to users informing them that files had been backed up, and communication to the authors of commands with criticisms, and communication from command authors to the CTSS manual editor." 
[5] I asked Van Vleck about the differences between the mail command proposed in PSN 39 and the mail command implemented by Van Vleck and my brother. He wrote back, "Noel and I thought it would be better to write a simple program that could send any message from any user to any other, and then use that as the basis for more complicated systems that had strictly formatted messages or where the recipient name came from a program. It was clear that one piece of the code would have to have special powers, and we thought it would be better if that piece could be compact and clear, so that it would be easy to make sure it had no bugs in it. A general purpose, very simple, MAIL program could be used to support various application patterns, without locking the system into limited patterns like those of LOG and REMARK, or entering addresses in binary from the console. [Take a look in the 1965 CTSS manual, section AH.9.02, where a command called LOG is described. It sent messages between members of the same project. Section AH.9.03 describes the REMARK command, which let a user type in a message that would be sent to the system programmers. (The manual section describes the function of REMARK as "Users talk to GOD.") These facilities already existed prior to PSN 39. The desire to communicate, to send messages from one user to another, was already in the air.] Pouzin, Schroeder, and Crisman had gone one step further in this direction, run into some disagreements and technical questions, and focused elsewhere. We saw a technical approach, the use of the new ATTACH. call, and a design approach, reducing function to the minimum, that made the facility work, and avoided arguments about features."
[6] Tom Van Vleck had written, "I was a new member of the MIT programming staff in spring 1965. When I read the PSN document [Program Staff Note 39] about the proposed CTSS MAIL command, I asked "where is it?" and was told there was nobody available to write it. My colleague Noel Morris and I wrote a version of MAIL for CTSS in the summer of 1965. Noel was the one who saw how to use the features of the new CTSS file system to send the messages, and I wrote the actual code that interfaced with the user." 
[7] The first telegraph message: On May 24, 1844, Samuel Morse sends the telegraph message "What hath God wrought?" from the Supreme Court chamber in the Capitol in Washington, D.C., to the B & O Railroad Depot in Baltimore, Md. The first telephone call: On March 10, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell makes the first telephone call to his assistant, Thomas Watson: "Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you."
[8] Van Vleck mentioned e.e. cummings and suggested that I read his Norton Lectures. Could e.e.cummings - who lived in Cambridge, Mass. - have been part of the first e-mail message? Or was it something far more prosaic? 
[9] Arthur Evans, later at Carnegie Mellon, wrote about my brother in response to a posting by Tom Van Vleck: "When I joined the MIT faculty in 1965 I looked him up, and we gradually became close friends. Noel was then one of those folks who have trouble completing an undergraduate program. He needed only a few credits and never quite got around to getting them. I persuaded him to earn academic credit by being a Teaching Assistant in the subject I was teaching, and later I persuaded the Undergraduate Educational Policy Committee (or whatever it was called) to award a few more credits for Noel's by-then extensive professional experience. I was pleased to have taken part in his receiving an MIT degree. He was surely a credit to the school." http://www.errolmorris.com/noel.html
[10] In an article in the Political Science journal Background written in 1966, Pool wrote, "The organization with which I am affiliated, the Center for International Studies of M.I.T. has in the past had contracts with the CIA. A year ago we decided regretfully not to take any new ones, not because of the fact that some people do not like the CIA but for the simple reason that the classification placed on the existence of contracts, even though the work was unclassified and published, prevented disclosure of whom the work was being done for. This was a condition we were unwilling to accept. We were perfectly willing to do public, published university research for the United States government via any of its departments, but we have to say who the sponsor is." Ithiel De Sola Pool, "The Necessity for Social Scientists Doing Research for Governments." Background, Vol. 10, No. 2 (Aug., 1966), pp. 111-122
[11] Project MAC was founded in 1963. MAC was an acronym that stood both for Machine Aided Cognition and Multiple Access Computer. Others joked that it stood for "More Assets to Cambridge." Political Science work began at MIT in 1955, under the aegis of the Department of Economics and Social Science. It became an independent department in 1965.
[12] Professor Pool responded to the criticisms and suspicion of his work in an article in the Chicago Sun-Times. He directly addresses "The 480": "...in the scarce literature about computers in politics, such as Eugen Burdick's 'The 480,' the computer is portrayed as somehow a diabolical, almost live, thing that manipulates men. This is science fiction, not reality. In truth, all a computer can do is to give a human being some knowledge which he must consider and act upon. Computers frighten people. It is not clear why. ... There was no 'people machine'; nor were there super-human manipulators pulling magic out of computers. Responsible people, not computers, ran the [1960 Kennedy] campaign."
[13] I remember, in particular, the menu for Jack and Marion's. They had enormous sandwiches. I was fascinated by "The Surprise Sandwich." The description in the fine print said, "Made only by Jack - Especially for you. We don't tell you what's in it or even the price.... So please do not ask your waitress..." And then, "P.S. A terrific profit item for Jack & Marion's, but you'll love it." They were shameless.

HEADLINE: The Failure of Rational Choice Philosophy

BYLINE: JOHN MCCUMBER


HIGHLIGHT: Today's zealous advocates of individualism invariably forget their origins in a long ago program of government propaganda.

 BODY:
According to Hegel, history is idea-driven. According to almost everyone else, this is foolish. What can "idea driven" even mean when measured against the passion and anguish of a place like Libya?
But Hegel had his reasons. Ideas for him are public, rather than in our heads, and serve to coordinate behavior. They are, in short, pragmatically meaningful words. To say that history is "idea driven" is to say that, like all cooperation, nation building requires a common basic vocabulary.
One prominent component of America's basic vocabulary is "individualism." Our society accords unique rights and freedoms to individuals, and we are so proud of these that we recurrently seek to install them in other countries. But individualism, the desire to control one's own life, has many variants. Tocqueville viewed it as selfishness and suspected it, while Emerson and Whitman viewed it as the moment-by-moment expression of one's unique self and loved it.
After World War II, a third variant gained momentum in America. It defined individualism as the making of choices so as to maximize one's preferences. This differed from "selfish individualism" in that the preferences were not specified: they could be altruistic as well as selfish. It differed from "expressive individualism" in having general algorithms by which choices were made. These made it rational.This form of individualism did not arise by chance. Alex Abella's "Soldiers of Reason" (2008) and S. M. Amadae's "Rationalizing Capitalist Democracy" (2003) trace it to the RAND Corporation, the hyperinfluential Santa Monica, Calif., think tank, where it was born in 1951 as "rational choice theory." Rational choice theory's mathematical account of individual choice, originally formulated in terms of voting behavior, made it a point-for-point antidote to the collectivist dialectics of Marxism; and since, in the view of many cold warriors, Marxism was philosophically ascendant worldwide, such an antidote was sorely needed. Functionaries at RAND quickly expanded the theory from a tool of social analysis into a set of universal doctrines that we may call "rational choice philosophy." Governmental seminars and fellowships spread it to universities across the country, aided by the fact that any alternative to it would by definition be collectivist. During the early Cold War, that was not exactly a good thing to be.
The overall operation was wildly successful. Once established in universities, rational choice philosophy moved smoothly on the backs of their pupils into the "real world" of business and government (aided in the crossing, to be sure, by the novels of another Rand-Ayn). Today, governments and businesses across the globe simply assume that social reality is merely a set of individuals freely making rational choices. Wars have been and are still being fought to bring such freedom to Koreans, Vietnamese, Iraqis, Grenadans, and now Libyans, with more nations surely to come.
At home, anti-regulation policies are crafted to appeal to the view that government must in no way interfere with Americans' freedom of choice. Even religions compete in the marketplace of salvation, eager to be chosen by those who, understandably, prefer heaven to hell. Today's most zealous advocates of individualism, be they on Wall Street or at Tea Parties, invariably forget their origins in a long ago program of government propaganda.
Rational choice philosophy, to its credit, made clear and distinct claims in philosophy's three main areas. Ontologically, its emphasis on individual choice required that reality present a set of discrete alternatives among which one could choose: linear "causal chains" which intersected either minimally, trivially, or not at all. Epistemologically, that same emphasis on choice required that at least the early stages of such chains be knowable with something akin to certainty, for if our choice is to be rational we need to know what we are choosing. Knowledge thus became foundationalistic and incremental.
But the real significance of rational choice philosophy lay in ethics. Rational choice theory, being a branch of economics, does not question people's preferences; it simply studies how they seek to maximize them. Rational choice philosophy seems to maintain this ethical neutrality (see Hans Reichenbach's 1951 "The Rise of Scientific Philosophy," an unwitting masterpiece of the genre); but it does not. Whatever my preferences are, I have a better chance of realizing them if I possess wealth and power. Rational choice philosophy thus promulgates a clear and compelling moral imperative: increase your wealth and power!
Today, institutions which help individuals do that (corporations, lobbyists) are flourishing; the others (public hospitals, schools) are basically left to rot. Business and law schools prosper; philosophy departments are threatened with closure.
Rational choice theory came under fire after the economic crisis of 2008, but remains central to economic analysis. Rational choice philosophy, by contrast, was always implausible. Hegel, for one, had denied all three of its central claims in his "Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences" over a century before. In that work, as elsewhere in his writings, nature is not neatly causal, but shot through with randomness. Because of this chaos, we cannot know the significance of what we have done until our community tells us; and ethical life correspondingly consists, not in pursuing wealth and power, but in integrating ourselves into the right kinds of community.
Critical views soon arrived in postwar America as well. By 1953, W. V. O. Quine was exposing the flaws in rational choice epistemology. John Rawls, somewhat later, took on its sham ethical neutrality, arguing that rationality in choice includes moral constraints. The neat causality of rational choice ontology, always at odds with quantum physics, was further jumbled by the environmental crisis, exposed by Rachel Carson's 1962 book "The Silent Spring," which revealed that the causal effects of human actions were much more complex, and so less predicable, than previously thought.
These efforts, however, have not so far confronted rational choice individualism as Hegel did: on its home ground, in philosophy itself. Quine's "ontological relativity" means that at a sufficient level of generality, more than one theory fits the facts; we choose among the alternatives. Rawls' social philosophy relies on a free choice among possible social structures. Even Richard Rorty, the most iconoclastic of recent American philosophers, phrased his proposals, as Robert Scharff has written, in the "self-confident, post-traditional language of choice."
If philosophers cannot refrain from absolutizing choice within philosophy itself, they cannot critique it elsewhere. If they did, they could begin formulating a comprehensive alternative to rational choice philosophy - and to the blank collectivism of Cold War Stalinism - as opposed to the specific criticisms advanced so far. The result might look quite a bit like Hegel in its view that individual freedom is of value only when communally guided. Though it would be couched, one must hope, in clearer prose.
John McCumber is Professor of Germanic Languages at UCLA. He is the author of "Time in the Ditch: American Philosophy and the McCarthy Era" (2001) and, two forthcoming books, "On Philosophy: Notes From a Crisis" and "Time and Philosophy: A History of Continental Thought."

HEADLINE: PNC Is Said to Be Near $3.45 Billion Deal for R.B.C. Unit

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The deal for Royal Bank of Canada's American retail banking unit would help the PNC Financial Services Group expand into the Southeast.

 BODY:
6:01 p.m. | Updated The PNC Financial Services Group is near a deal to buy the Royal Bank of Canada's American consumer banking operations for about $3.45 billion in cash and stock, people briefed on the matter said on Sunday.
The transaction, which would allow R.B.C. to shed a division that has been hobbled by the housing crisis, could be announced as soon as Monday, these people said. They cautioned that final details were still being ironed out and that the deal could still fall apart. PNC beat out a rival, the BB&T Corporation, in a race for the unit, RBC Bank, the people briefed on the matter said.
R.B.C. purchased Centura Banks in 2001 for nearly $2.2 billion, beginning a push into American retail banking. But the unit, renamed RBC Bank after a series of acquisitions, has failed to win significant market share.
RBC Bank was buffeted by the housing crisis, losing money for several consecutive years. It took a $1 billion write-down in 2009, leading to a reorganization that included eliminating jobs and reducing lending.
By contrast, PNC has performed well since the financial crisis. It has reported three consecutive increases in annual profit, earning $3.4 billion in 2010. Its last major deal was buying the National City Corporation in 2009 for about $4 billion.
Through the deal, PNC is hoping to expand into the Southeast, an area in which the bank currently has relatively little presence. RBC Bank currently has more than 420 locations in six Southern states, from Virginia to Florida.
While R.B.C. is pulling back from retail banking in the United States, it still has significant operations in the country, including an investment banking arm. 
Other Canadian competitors, however, have made big pushes into American consumer lending over the last year. The BMO Group agreed in December to buy Marshall & Ilsley, based in Milwaukee, for $4.1 billion. 
That same month, Toronto-Dominion struck a $6.3 billion deal for Chrysler Financial, the former lending arm of the eponymous car maker.
R.B.C. is only the latest bank to sell a major unit under pressure. Last week, the ING Group agreed to sell its American online banking arm to Capital One Financial for $9 billion as part of the requirements of its bailout by the Dutch government. 
Shares in R.B.C. rose 1.2 percent, closing at 54.33 Canadian dollars on Friday, after Bloomberg News reported that PNC had won the auction. Shares of PNC fell 2.8 percent, to $57.79, on Friday.
R.B.C. was advised by JPMorgan Chase, while PNC was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

HEADLINE: Blaming Incumbent for the Economy, a Political Tradition

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Even ardently Republican economists concede a different approach to the recession would not have made a great improvement.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - A recent Republican Party news release about President Obama, Democrats and the economy declared simply: "They own it."
As a matter of politics, that's indisputable. The burdens or benefits of economic conditions go to incumbents - an iron law of elections that makes Mr. Obama vulnerable in 2012.
As a matter of economics, the case is less clear. Mr. Obama's policies, for better or worse, have something to do with current employment levels and growth rates. But economic advisers to Republican politicians concede that most of the distress Americans feel now stems from the recession and financial crisis he inherited.
Glenn Hubbard, the Columbia Business School dean who led the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, criticized Mr. Obama's spending, tax and regulatory strategies for "actively" retarding the recovery. Yet he added, "There could have been policies that made a difference - but not a sea change."
Mark Zandi, the Moody's Analytics chief economist who advised Mr. Obama's 2008 opponent, Senator John McCain, went further. Had he been elected president, Mr. McCain's near-term policy choices would have largely overlapped with Mr. Obama's, he said - and the differences would have had only marginal effects by now.
"Broadly speaking, I don't think a President McCain would have responded meaningfully differently" to the economic crisis in 2009, said Dr. Zandi, a registered Democrat. Mr. McCain, too, would have struggled with external shocks like Europe's debt crisis and the Middle East turmoil.
"Four-dollar gasoline and the economic fallout from the Japanese quake would have been tough for even a strong economy to gracefully digest," Dr. Zandi said. Had Mr. McCain won the election, "The economy and the nation's fiscal situation would be in roughly the same place today."
Consensus on Relief
Backed by Senators Obama and McCain, the Troubled Asset Relief Program was signed into law by Mr. Bush in October 2008. Two months later, Mr. Bush and Congress extended aid to General Motors and Chrysler.
In both areas, Mr. McCain would have "pretty much followed the script President Bush was laying out" and Mr. Obama implemented, Dr. Zandi said. Mr. McCain also backed extending the Bush tax cuts, as Mr. Obama did in a deal with Republican legislators last fall.
Doug Holtz-Eakin, Mr. McCain's top policy adviser, said a President McCain would have also pursued an economic stimulus package - $400 billion instead of Mr. Obama's $787 billion, delivered through payroll tax cuts rather than spending programs.
Another McCain adviser, Kevin A. Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute, said Mr. McCain's proposal for a corporate income tax cut would have made a "a dramatic difference" in job creation. Instead of the "short-termism" of Mr. Obama's two-year stimulus plan, that permanent cut would have countered the "10 years of slow growth" that typically follow a financial crisis.
Dr. Holtz-Eakin said Mr. McCain would have improved economic performance another way: by avoiding the burdens of new health care and financial-regulation laws. That would have accelerated recovery by reducing uncertainty and anxiety among businesses.
But Dr. Holtz-Eakin doesn't argue that those choices would have produced a night-and-day difference.
Instead of today's sluggish growth - 1.8 percent in the first quarter and 2.5 percent for the year, according to International Monetary Fund projections - he speculated that the economy would be growing as fast as 3.5 percent.
On the unemployment rate, he said, "Maybe not from 9.1 percent to 5 percent, but a point, something"- perhaps 7.5 percent.
That would still be higher than the rate was in Mr. Bush's last full month in office, before the combined effects of the recession and the financial crisis hit with full force.
Unlucky Inheritance
Mr. Obama and his economic team insist that their actions accelerated recovery and prevented a potential depression. In any event, Americans haven't forgotten the dismal circumstances he walked into.
Growth remains weak, but in the fourth quarter of 2008, the economy shrank at a 6.8 percent rate. Payrolls grew by only 54,000 in May, but shrank by 619,000 in December 2008. The Congressional Budget Office projected a 2009 deficit exceeding $1 trillion before Mr. Obama took office.
In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week, 62 percent of Americans said current conditions reflected "a situation Barack Obama has inherited." Just 25 percent found his policies "mostly responsible."
Yet 54 percent disapproved of Mr. Obama's economic performance - and Republican presidential candidates pounded away at it during last week's debate in New Hampshire.
"The Obama administration is an antijobs, antibusiness, anti-American-energy destructive force," said Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker.
Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, said the president had "failed at a time when the American people counted on him to create jobs and get the economy growing."
In an electoral system offering binary choices, it's no surprise that Mr. Obama's political culpability exceeds his economic culpability. The actual impact of alternative policies, Mr. Hassett said, is "unknowable."
What is knowable with certainty is this: if a Republican were sitting in the White House, Democratic candidates would be doing exactly the same thing.

HEADLINE: An Aura of Hope, a Touch of Dread: Investors Provide Millions To Risky Start-Ups

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER; Jenna Wortham contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PALO ALTO, Calif. -- What if you threw a $41 million party and nobody came? A start-up company called Color knows how that feels.
In March, Color unveiled its photo-sharing cellphone application -- and revealed that it had raised $41 million from investors before the app had a single user. Despite the company's riches, the app landed with a thud, attracting few users and many complaints from those who did try it.
''It would be pointless even if I managed to understand how it works,'' one reviewer wrote in the Apple App Store.
Since then, Color has become a warning sign for investors, entrepreneurs and analysts who fear there is a bubble in start-up investing. They say it shows that venture capitalists, desperate to invest in the next Facebook or LinkedIn, are blindly throwing money at start-ups that have not shown they can build something useful, much less a business that can provide decent returns on investment. 
Color, which says it is overhauling its app, is just one of the start-ups that have set tongues wagging about bubbly excess in Silicon Valley. The Melt plans to sell grilled-cheese sandwiches and soup that people can order from their mobile phones. It raised about $15 million from Sequoia Capital, which also invested in Color.
Airbnb, which helps people rent rooms in their homes, is raising venture capital that would value it at a billion dollars. Scoopon, a kind of Groupon for Australians, raised $80 million; Juice in the City, a Groupon for mothers, raised $6 million; and Scvngr, which started a Groupon for gamers, raised $15 million. These could, of course, turn out to be successful businesses. The worry, investors say, is the prices.
They say they have paid two to three times more for their stakes in such start-ups over the past year. According to the National Venture Capital Association, venture capitalists invested $5.9 billion in the first three months of the year, up 14 percent from the period a year earlier, but they invested in 51 fewer companies, indicating they were funneling more money into fewer start-ups.
''The big success stories -- Facebook, Zynga and Twitter -- are leading to investing in ideas on a napkin, because no one wants to miss out on the next big thing,'' said Eric Lefkofsky, a founder of Groupon who also runs Lightbank, a Chicago-based venture fund with a $100 million coffer.
A decade ago, in the first surge of Internet investing, it was not unusual for tech start-ups to raise tens of millions of dollars before they had revenue, a product or users. But venture capitalists became more cautious after the bubble burst and the 2008 recession paralyzed Silicon Valley.
Meanwhile, it now costs less than ever to build a Web site or mobile app. So this time around the general philosophy has been to start small.
''By starting out lean, you have the chance to know if you're on to something,'' said Mark Suster, a managing director at GRP Partners. ''If you start fat and the product concept doesn't work, inherently the company will lose a lot of money.''
Two of Color's photo-sharing competitors, Instagram and PicPlz, exemplify the lean start-up ethos. They started with $500,000 and $350,000, respectively, and teams of just a few people. As they have introduced successful products and attracted users, they have slowly raised more money and hired engineers.
Color, meanwhile, spent $350,000 to buy the Web address color.com, and an additional $75,000 to buy colour.com. It rents a cavernous office in downtown Palo Alto, where 38 employees work in a space with room for 160, amid beanbag chairs, tents for napping and a hand-built half-pipe skateboard ramp.
Bill Nguyen, Color's always-smiling founder, has hired a team of expensive engineers, like D. J. Patil, a former chief scientist at LinkedIn.
''If I knew a better way of doing it, I would, but that's what my cost structure is,'' Mr. Nguyen said in an interview last week.
Michael Krupka, a managing director at Bain Capital Ventures and one of Color's investors, said Color needed to raise a lot of money because it planned to do much more than photo-sharing.
''When we get to the end product that we envision, people will realize how technically sophisticated it is, so we couldn't do it with four people,'' he said. ''That's expensive to do, so therefore I think the valuation's a fair one.''
A serial entrepreneur, Mr. Nguyen, 40, said he had always raised more money than he needed so that if his products faltered, he had enough to keep going longer than his competitors. But it also means he has to sell the company to a bigger company or to shareholders for a lot more money than if he had raised less.
He said the gamble was worth it, and it had paid off for him twice. He started a service for receiving faxes, e-mail and voicemail called Onebox.com, which Phone.com bought for $850 million, and Lala, a digital music service that Apple bought for $80 million last year. He also started a mobile messaging company called Seven, which has not yet sold.
Mr. Nguyen bounds around the Color office in bare feet and talks with implicit exclamation points at the end of each phrase, fueled by what he calls an addiction to Coke Zero. Despite his sprightliness, he says he has been chastened in the last three months.
''Your ego gets bruised a little bit,'' he said. ''There's no doubt I wish we would have launched and millions of people would have used it, but that didn't happen. The reality is we're going to plug away at it and take a much more traditional route to go from A to B.''
But he makes no apologies for the amount of money he raised.
''We live in a very favorable environment for start-ups right now, so if the number we raised was significantly larger than it would be at any other time, I'm not going to apologize for that,'' he said.
At its start, Color said it would usher in a new era of location-based social networking, letting people share cellphone snapshots with other Color users nearby. But though it had some success at big events like music festivals, those who tried it elsewhere found that there was rarely anything to see.
Mr. Nguyen said the company had taken the criticism to heart and charted a new course. He fired Color's president, Peter Pham, and its engineers are building a new version of the app to be released later this summer.
Mr. Nguyen outlined an ambitious plan to compete with Apple, Google and Facebook by tying together group messaging, recommendations and local search, all while making money through advertising. He plans to build applications that will use data from Facebook to create temporary social networks, say at a conference or sporting event, to help users meet people who grew up in the same town or like the same band.
''It's literally going to turn your Facebook network from 500 people to 750 million people,'' Mr. Nguyen said.
Photos might not even be a part of Color in the future, he said, though an engineer hired away from the computer-in-a-pen company Livescribe is working on ways for people to doodle on photos. Analysts are curious about whether Color can pull off a do-over -- and whether it and other high-priced start-ups can beat the long odds that all fledgling companies face.
''In every bust, there are ones that stand out and become Google, but that's the exception rather than the rule,'' Mr. Suster of GRP Partners said. ''For every success there will be 250 really dumb valuations.''

HEADLINE: An Aura of Hope, a Touch of Dread: Within the Industry, An Urge to Cash Out

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- While Silicon Valley and Wall Street debate whether a new technology bubble is in the making, some early Facebook employees are not taking any chances. They're leaving the company to cash out on millions of dollars in stock options while Facebook's valuation continues to soar.
''If you've seen the world blow up once, you just don't know what's going to happen a year from now,'' said one former Facebook employee, referring to the dot-com crash a decade ago.
He joined the company in its early days, and left a few months ago so he could sell some of his shares. A company policy bars current employees from selling stock. ''It seemed very risky to stay in a situation where all of your liquidity was tied up in what I consider a high-risk company,'' he said, declining to make his name public when discussing a financial decision, and also because he did not want to upset Facebook. 
He is hardly the only tech industry insider cashing in to minimize his financial risk in case the value of private companies starts heading south. Employees and investors at dozens of hot start-ups have sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of shares, fueling a booming market in private transactions.
Facebook has been driving the trend; last year, it accounted for nearly 45 percent of all the trades on SecondMarket, a leading marketplace for private company shares. Many of those trades came from Facebook's first 200 or so employees who joined before the fall of 2007 and own shares or stock options. (Those who joined later received restricted stock, which cannot be sold until Facebook goes public.) According to several former employees, about 100 of the early employees have left the company, a figure Facebook declines to confirm.
And although they have left for many reasons -- and Facebook insiders say that starting a new company is the most common one -- guarding against a decline in share price has been a consideration for some.
''I was happy to sell 5 or 10 percent, so I could have a cushion in the worst-case scenario,'' said another former Facebook employee who left in recent months, and who also would not make his name public.
Perhaps no company has seen its early investors and founders take so much money off the table so quickly as Groupon. The company is still losing money, but some insiders have already become rich on it. Out of $946 million that Groupon raised from investors last winter, $810 million went into the pockets of the chief executive, Andrew Mason; the chairman, Eric Lefkofsky; and others. In April 2010, many of the same insiders pocketed an additional $120 million.
Mr. Mason and Mr. Lefkofsky declined to comment, through a Groupon spokesman. The company, which recently filed to go public, is in a ''quiet period'' that restricts executives from discussing the business publicly.
Founders and early investors have sold shares in their start-ups for years, usually through brokers and a small network of funds specializing in private-company transactions. But such sales have expanded greatly in recent years, with early rank-and-file employees participating in deals in ever-growing numbers.
Employees have become more interested in selling, in part because companies are taking longer to go public. And workers' eagerness to see tangible reward has promoted the creation of a number of businesses to serve their needs. These include trading platforms like SecondMarket, specialized brokers like Felix Investments and even a new lender who will help employees turn their paper wealth into hard cash without having to sell their shares.
''In the last two years, a lot of employees in the Valley woke up to this market,'' said Hans Swildens, the founder and a managing partner at Industry Ventures, a decade-old company that has bought shares in companies like Facebook, Twitter, Chegg and eBags.
As Facebook's valuation has soared past $50 billion, making it by far the highest among Silicon Valley's crop of hot start-ups, many employees who own stock options and have been at the company since the early days after its founding seven years ago have been eager to profit.
Aware of that, Facebook has helped to broker sales for those employees twice -- in 2009, when it allowed insiders to sell $100 million to Digital Sky Technologies, a Russian venture capital firm, and again this year, in a deal through T. Rowe Price, the investment firm. Employees were limited to selling up to 20 percent of their vested shares. For some, it wasn't enough.
''Even if I could sell all 20 percent, having 80 percent of your wealth in one illiquid asset is pretty insane,'' said one of the employees who left recently. ''It's not enough to make yourself bulletproof if the world blows up.''
Still, fear of a bursting bubble is not the only factor behind sales of shares by employees. Early employees who leave Facebook or any other private start-up typically have 90 days to exercise their stock options. When they do, they face a high tax bill. An employee who exercises $10 million in shares may face some $3 million in taxes, and in many cases the only way the employee can pay those taxes is by selling some shares.
And plenty of employees believe their companies' values will keep going up. While they may need the money -- to buy a cottage in Palo Alto, for example -- they would prefer to hold on to their shares. A new, secretive fund, called 137 Ventures, is hoping to balance their desire for cash and their hope to profit from a boom, if it continues.
The fund plans to lend money to start-up employees who put up their shares as collateral, according to several people who have been briefed on the fund. As part of the deal, 137 Ventures will have a right to buy some number of shares from the borrower. The fund is expected to file regulatory forms on Monday indicating that it has raised $35 million, mostly from institutional investors. It has held preliminary talks with Zynga and others, to get authorization to cater to their employees. Justin Fishner-Wolfson, who heads the fund, declined to comment.
Some veterans of private company markets say they are not willing to say the tech industry is in a bubble yet, but they have started to worry. ''We are not sure that the valuations we are seeing are sustainable in the long term,'' said Kenneth B. Sawyer, the founder and managing director of Saints Capital, which has been active in secondary markets for more than a decade. Mr. Sawyer says there are only a handful of companies that merit high valuations. ''Just because a great company is valued highly doesn't mean there should be a halo effect on the others.''

HEADLINE: Many Cities Face a Long Wait for Jobs to Return

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Two years into a fitful recovery, unemployed Americans are getting painfully accustomed to the notion that it will take years to bring back the jobs eviscerated by the financial crisis.
In some regions, those years are in danger of turning into a decade. According to a report to be released Monday, nearly 50 metropolitan regions -- or more than one out of seven -- are unlikely to bring back all the jobs lost in the recession until after 2020.
Among those areas are Cleveland and Dayton, Ohio; Detroit; Reno, Nev.; and Atlantic City, according to the report commissioned by the United States Conference of Mayors. 
Detroit, which lost 323,400 jobs during the recession, and Reno, which lost 36,000 jobs, are not expected to regain all of those positions until after 2021.
With job creation having slowed to a crawl and the housing market depressed by foreclosures and falling prices, the economy is struggling to put 13.9 million unemployed Americans back to work.
According to the mayors' report, which was compiled by IHS Global Insight, the nation's 363 metropolitan statistical areas tracked by the Labor Department will generate enough jobs to get back to only the prerecession peak of employment in the first half of 2014, a dreary forecast that poses an increasing political challenge to the Obama administration. The areas lost 7.3 million total jobs during the recession from a peak of 118.3 million in the first quarter of 2008.
The report notes that metro regions account for about 86 percent of all jobs.
''It is striking, it's sobering and it's a call to action,'' said Antonio R. Villaraigosa, mayor of Los Angeles and the president of the Conference of Mayors. Mr. Villaraigosa suggested that the federal government invest in infrastructure as well as work force training. The mayors' report projected that the Los Angeles region, which lost 537,100 jobs during the downturn, would not gain them back before 2018.
The forecasts do not account for the number of jobs that need to be created just to account for normal population growth. As a result, said James Diffley, senior director at IHS Global Insight, even when the economy adds back the jobs lost during the recession, the unemployment rate, now at 9.1 percent, is likely to be significantly higher than the 4.4 percent it was before the crisis.
Among the largest metropolitan regions that will have a long road to recovery are manufacturing centers in Ohio and Michigan, where huge waves of layoffs at car plants and other factories affected thousands of workers.
''The type of jobs lost are not easily replaced,'' said Lucious Plant, work force development manager in Montgomery County, which includes Dayton and surrounding communities. The region was overwhelmed by thousands of job losses at plants operated by General Motors and the parts supplier Delphi Automotive.
Mr. Plant said that old-line factory workers did not necessarily have the skills for the jobs that are now being added by advanced manufacturers. Dayton, which lost 42,500 jobs -- or more than 10 percent of its labor force -- during the recession, has had some luck attracting new employers recently, landing a Caterpillar Logistics distribution center that is expected to eventually bring on 600 people. Also, the back-office operations of a law firm added about 200 jobs.
Since losing a job at Delphi in 2008, Josh Hamer has been taking odd jobs repairing computers and is attending community college on government grants to earn an associate's degree in network management. In the meantime, he has filed hundreds of job applications.
''I want anything that will pay the bills,'' said Mr. Hamer, 32. ''But they see Delphi and they see me applying for an office job, and they say, 'You can't do this job because you're not qualified for it.' They see grunt work, and they see a grunt.''
Other regions were hammered by the housing collapse and are having difficulty climbing back. In Naples, Fla., which lost 25,200 jobs during the recession, local economic development officials are focusing on small businesses in the technology and medical device sectors, industries that may not help unemployed construction workers. The mayors' report projects that the area will get back to its prerecession peak by 2017.
Tammie Nemecek, chief executive of the Economic Development Council of Collier County, Fla., said the region might not recapture all the jobs it lost. ''There's a lot of people saying I want a new economy so we can ensure that there's sustainability in it,'' she said.
The mayors' report does project faster recovery in some regions, including several metropolitan areas in Texas, as well as Denver; Raleigh, N.C.; and Washington.
Global Insight forecasts that the New York metropolitan region, which lost 385,200 jobs during the recession, will get back to its prerecession peak by 2013, in part because the financial sector did not lose as many jobs as feared. That could change as Wall Street, facing falling markets and an uncertain regulatory climate, plans further cuts to its work force.
Some metropolitan regions disputed the forecasts. In Cleveland, where Global Insight projects a return to peak employment in 2021, Mayor Frank G. Jackson's chief of staff, Ken Silliman, said that Cleveland's unemployment rate, 7.6 percent, was the seventh lowest of the metropolitan areas with more than 1.5 million people.
He added that a newly built medical center was ''staking out Cleveland as a national leader in medical technology'' and that the area would recapture the jobs it lost within three to five years ''without a doubt.''
Mr. Diffley of Global Insight said that many regions were trying to brand themselves as leaders in new sectors. ''It's not a zero sum game,'' Mr. Diffley said. ''But everybody can't be a leader in the field they'd like to be, by definition.''

HEADLINE: Get Radical: Raise Social Security

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEOGHEGAN. 
Thomas Geoghegan is the author of ''Which Side Are You On?: Trying to Be for Labor When It's Flat on Its Back.''

 BODY:
Chicago
AS a labor lawyer I cringe when Democrats talk of ''saving'' Social Security. We should not ''save'' it but raise it. Right now Social Security pays out 39 percent of the average worker's preretirement earnings. While jaws may drop inside the Beltway, we could raise that to 50 percent. We'd still be near the bottom of the league of the world's richest countries -- but at least it would be a basement with some food and air. We have elderly people living on less than $10,000 a year. Is that what Democrats want to ''save''? 
''But we can't afford it!'' Oh, come on: We have a federal tax rate equal to nearly 15 percent of our G.D.P. -- far below the take in most wealthy countries. Let's wake up: the biggest crisis we face is that most of us have nothing meaningful saved for retirement. I know. I started my career wanting to be a pension lawyer. In the 1970s, lawyers like me expected there to be big pots of private pensions for hourly workers. By the 1980s, as factories closed, I was filing hopeless lawsuits to claw back bits and pieces of benefits. Now there are even fewer bits and pieces to get.
A recent Harris poll found that 34 percent of Americans have nothing saved for retirement -- not even a hundred bucks. In this lost decade, that percentage is sure to go up. At retirement the lucky few with a 401(k) typically have $98,000. As an annuity that's about $600 a month -- not exactly an upper-middle-class lifestyle. It's too late for Congress to come up with some new savings plan -- a new I.R.A. that grows hair, or something. There's no time. We have to improve the one public pension program in place. Should we means-test it? No. I don't care if they go out and buy bottles of Jim Beam: let our elderly have an occasional night out at a restaurant.
The most paralyzing half-truth in this country is that people hate taxes. People are willing to pay taxes that they spend on themselves. Two-thirds of those surveyed in a CBS/New York Times poll in January were willing to pay more taxes to save Social Security at its modest level. To ''save'' it, most of us don't need to pay. We could lift the cap on high earners, the 6 percent of workers who make over $106,800 a year. If earnings above the cap were subject to the payroll tax with no increase in benefits to high earners, there would be no deficit in the Social Security trust fund in 2037, as projected.
If people are willing to pay more just to ''save'' Social Security, they should be glad to pay more to raise it.
What does it take to get Social Security up to half the average worker's earnings? According to the National Academy of Social Insurance, to close the deficit and raise benefits to nearly half of average worker earnings, we would need to find an additional 5 percent of taxable payroll, or find the money elsewhere. If we lift the cap on the payroll tax without paying more benefits to those above it, that gets us 2.32 percent (or a bit less if we slightly increase benefits to the rich). Dedicating revenues from the estate tax at its 2009 levels to Social Security gets another half percent. A few other tweaks, like covering new public employees, add another 0.42 percent. The remainder can be found by raising the payroll tax by roughly 1 percentage point for both employees and employers.
I can hear the argument: It will discourage jobs, blah, blah. While I sympathize with the health costs employers pay (I am an employer, at our tiny law firm), they have had a windfall on pensions. In 1975, when I left law school, around two-fifths of American workers were in defined-benefit plans. Now it's just a fifth, and dropping. For employers, that's not the real bonanza.
Retirees today are shortchanged on Social Security because they have been shortchanged on wages for their entire working lives. The labor economist Richard B. Freeman points out that the hourly earnings of workers dropped by 8 percent from 1973 to 2005 while productivity shot up 55 percent or more. The United States is one of the few developed countries where workers are routinely cheated of a share in higher productivity.
And where has the money from the extra productivity gone? It's gone right to the top, to the top few percent. If wages had been paid fairly based on productivity, there would have been enough money subject to the payroll tax to avoid even a modest shortfall.
As I write, the Democrats are proposing to cut payroll taxes -- supposedly to create jobs. But the last cut in the payroll tax, a few months back, led to little or no hiring. And did I mention the Paul Ryan plan? Just wait until the Democrats accept some ''reasonable'' version of this Republican document.
A bigger pension -- a raise in Social Security benefits -- is the stimulus this demoralized country needs. Come on, Democrats: think of F.D.R., Robert Wagner, or heck, even Lyndon B. Johnson. Let's ask ourselves: Who are we for?

HEADLINE: At High School in Queens, R.O.T.C.'s Enduring Influence

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
In 1994, when retired First Sgt. Richard Gogarty arrived at Francis Lewis High School in Queens to start an Army Junior R.O.T.C. program, only two staff members, one of them a custodian, would talk to him. The sergeant sat by himself in the teachers' cafeteria, hoping someone would say something, even if it was just ''please pass the salt.''
The union representative, Arthur Goldstein, did not want him there. ''I said, 'Oh my God, he's going to have kids marching in circles doing stupid stuff,' '' recalled Mr. Goldstein, who teaches English to immigrant students and describes himself as ''politically to the left.''
But Sergeant Gogarty, using his military training, disarmed Mr. Goldstein, volunteering to come in an hour early each day to tutor a Hispanic girl who was failing. ''She was completely lost,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''But something clicked. She started passing tests -- it was Richard reading with her in the morning.'' 
Every year since, the Reserve Officers Training Corps program has grown. With 741 students, it is the largest of the 1,725 high school chapters in the country. Francis Lewis has more graduates at West Point -- 15 -- than any other school this year except for one near the academy that serves military families. In 17 years, no senior in the program has dropped out of school.
At national J.R.O.T.C. drill competitions, Francis Lewis dominates. One of the unit's trophies is taller than Musa Ali Shama, the principal, who keeps it beside his desk. The junior cadets' purposefulness sets the tone for the entire school, Mr. Shama said. ''R.O.T.C. has the biggest impact of any program in our school,'' he said. ''Nothing comes close.''
The high point of Christina Liu's life so far was being part of the squad that won the national unarmed drill competition last year in Florida. ''I probably had pure happiness for 10 minutes,'' she said. ''I was able to experience a first place in my lifetime. What person can say that?'' Until her first competition, Christina had never left Queens; with R.O.T.C., she has been to seven states.
As much as they like R.O.T.C., most do not want to enlist in the service. ''The military -- I don't think that's for me,'' said Glen Higgins, a junior who is a member of the drum corps. ''I don't want to end up going to Iraq and risk my life or something.'' Christina, one of the highest-ranked cadets, wants to be a pharmacist. ''My mom always wanted me to be one,'' she said. ''You get to stand behind a counter all day and there's not much stress.''
Sergeant Gogarty is the antithesis of the high-pressured military recruiter out to fill a quota. ''If they say they're going to enlist when they graduate, I tell them to go to college first,'' he said. Only one or two students a year go straight into the Army.
The program -- which has a staff of six retired service members teaching 23 classes a day focusing on things like community service and public speaking -- costs $1 million a year, $180,000 of which is paid by the city.
Francis Lewis is so crowded -- 4,000 students in a building meant for about 2,500 -- that J.R.O.T.C. usually cannot get the gym, so cadets often have lengthy training sessions on Saturdays. Its drill teams use the cafeteria, but cannot practice the rifle toss, which could punch holes in the ceiling. Membership reflects the school's demographics: half are Asian, 20 percent Hispanic, 15 percent black and 15 percent white; 99 percent go on to college. On Wednesdays, all 741 wear their uniforms to school.
''It gives you something to look forward to,'' said David Artega, a senior. The military chain of command teaches them discipline, leadership and responsibility. ''You learn you have to be on top of yourself,'' said Ashley Schwartz, a senior.
Sergeant Gogarty knows his students are prepared when the Rockettes start to look sloppy to them. ''Not enough economy of movement,'' he said.
The senior cadets watch the freshmen make the same mistakes each year. ''They think they're fine the way they are,'' David said. Sergeant Gogarty teaches them: not by a long shot. In the beginning, they are afraid of Sergeant Gogarty. ''They think I know all their names and what they're up to,'' he said. ''I don't, but I let them think I do.''
Once he remembers, he does not forget. Dana Walcott, the daughter of the schools chancellor, Dennis M. Walcott, went through the program in the 1990s. ''Dana was a platoon leader,'' Sergeant Gogarty said. ''She was enthusiastic and focused. She loved to cook and bake.''
Jaisy Kim had no idea that he would pick her to be the unit's public information officer, what she called ''a big honor.'' ''I felt like nobody was watching me,'' she said. ''I didn't think he knew me. But all the actions I did somehow helped.''
''I noticed,'' Sergeant Gogarty said. ''I started watching very hard in January.''
The J.R.O.T.C. room, 219, is one of the few places where a freshman like Brian Eco can talk to a real-life senior like Ashley. ''She motivates young students like me,'' Brian said. ''She does not make mistakes, her uniform is tight.''
Several mentioned that the program helped them overcome shyness. ''Before, I couldn't give a speech to 30 people,'' Tom Saini, a senior, said. ''Now I can do 500, easy.''
Frank Chang said he was ''one of those Asians kids sitting in the corner who doesn't talk to anybody.'' Not only were all the J.R.O.T.C. activities good for getting him out of the corner, but they helped him build his resume for college. ''It got me up to two pages.''
Sergeant Gogarty no longer has to recruit. Jennifer Lewis was a member of the first cadet class, in 1994, and this year her daughter, Kiera, joined. Most likely next will be her little brother, Jaden, a fourth grader. ''He loves staring at all my ribbons,'' Kiera, a sophomore, said. ''He keeps asking, 'What's this one for? What's that one for?' ''
Memorial Day weekend the cadets marched all over Queens, in five parades. ''My last parade,'' said Frank, who will attend Queens College in the fall, ''a lot of things went through my head. I wanted to enjoy it, seize the moment.''
Mr. Goldstein, the union representative, said he had not heard anything disparaging about the program for years. ''No one works harder than the R.O.T.C. instructors,'' he said. ''If I leave the school at 6 p.m., there's always an R.O.T.C. teacher standing outside with 200 kids.''
He was surprised last year, when his daughter announced she was joining the J.R.O.T.C. program at her school. She told her father she wants to be a Marine.

HEADLINE: A Core Group Rode LinkedIn To a Big Payout

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
For Reid Hoffman, the chairman of LinkedIn, it took less than 30 minutes to earn himself an extra $200 million.
With the hours ticking down to his company's stock market debut, Mr. Hoffman dialed into a conference call from San Francisco's Ritz-Carlton hotel as his chief executive, Jeff Weiner, and a team of bankers raced up from Silicon Valley in a black S.U.V. to meet with potential investors.
Demand for shares was intense, and they decided to raise the offering price by $10, to around $45.
When trading began on May 19, LinkedIn did not open at $45. Or $55. Or $65. Instead, the first shares were snapped up for $83 each and soon soared past $100, showering a string of players with riches and signaling a gold rush that has not been seen since the giddy days of the tech frenzy a decade ago. 
Now there are signs that a new technology bubble is inflating, this time centered on the narrow niche of social networking. Other tech offerings, like that of the Internet radio service Pandora last week, have struggled, and analysts have warned that overly optimistic investors could once again suffer huge losses.
That enthusiasm was on full display in the blockbuster debut of LinkedIn, which provides a window into how a small group -- bankers and lawyers, employees who get in on the ground floor, early investors -- is taking a hefty cut at each twist in the road from Silicon Valley start-up to Wall Street success story.
''The LinkedIn I.P.O. will be used very powerfully over the next year as these companies go public and bankers deal with Silicon Valley,'' said Peter Thiel, the president of Clarium Capital in San Francisco and an early investor in PayPal, LinkedIn and Facebook. ''It sets things up for the other big deals.''
The sharp run-up after the initial public offering set off a fierce debate among observers about whether the bankers had mispriced it and left billions on the table for their clients to pocket. But the pent-up demand for what was perceived as a hot technology stock set the stage for easy money to be made almost regardless of the offering price.
Naturally, Wall Street is enjoying a windfall. Technology I.P.O.'s have generated nearly $330 million this year in fees for the biggest banks and brokerages, nearly 10 times the haul for the same period last year, and the most since 2000.
Besides the $28.4 million in fees for LinkedIn's underwriting team, which was led by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, there were also a few slices reserved for specialists like lawyers and accountants. Wilson Sonsini, the most powerful law firm in Silicon Valley, collected $1.5 million, while the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche earned $1.35 million.
Mr. Hoffman founded LinkedIn in March 2003 after making a fortune as an executive at PayPal, the online payments service, but even as LinkedIn grew and other employees and private backers got stakes, Mr. Hoffman retained 21.2 percent, giving him more than 19 million shares when it went public. He has kept nearly of all them, so for now his $858 million fortune -- it was $667 million before the last-minute price hike -- remains mostly on paper.
Mr. Weiner arrived more recently, in late 2008, after working at Yahoo and as an adviser to venture capital firms, but his welcome package included the right to buy 3.5 million shares at just $2.32. And they are not the only big winners who secured shares at levels far below the I.P.O. price.
For example, when LinkedIn raised cash in mid-2008, venture capital firms including Bessemer Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital, scooped up 6.6 million shares at $11.47 each in return for early financing. They have held on to the stock, but Goldman Sachs, which got 871,840 shares at $11.47, sold all of it for a one-day gain of nearly $30 million.
Scores of fortunate individuals also managed to profit.
Stephen Beitzel, a software engineer, worked at LinkedIn from its founding until March 2004, but kept his stock when he left. His shares are now worth $17 million, and he sold $1.3 million worth in the offering.
Mr. Beitzel, 43, said he planned to take a two-year sabbatical and practice his hobby, playing bagpipes, while his wife returns to graduate school. ''I try not to think too hard about it,'' he said in an interview. ''I made a lot of money, but it's a big crapshoot.''
Back in mid-2003, Andrew Beebe provided some of LinkedIn's earliest start-up financing. ''I put in much less than I could have and much less than I should have,'' said Mr. Beebe, a San Francisco sales and marketing executive who sold 3,000 shares in the I.P.O. that he had originally acquired for less than $5 each. ''But I don't live in regret mode, and I'm a very happy investor.''
The road to riches began in late 2010, when Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Weiner and their advisers made the decision to go public. They soon developed a game plan to closely control the offering.
As with the opening of a hot nightclub, it would be exclusive: only 9 percent of the company's shares would be issued. Of those shares, only 10 percent would be made available to individual investors, instead of the typical 15 percent.
Meanwhile, bigger institutions like Fidelity and T. Rowe Price would be favored over smaller ones, who might be more likely to flip shares for a quick buck. Over 500 institutional investors wanted the stock, but the 10 largest would get the largest share. And about one-third would not get any.
LinkedIn's top management closely monitored who got what, with Mr. Weiner using an iPad app created by Morgan Stanley to keep track of the process.
With few shares to trade, institutions reluctant to sell and plenty of retail demand, the stock opened at $83 and rose as high as $122.70 before finishing the day at $94.25.
Despite earning just over $15 million in 2010, LinkedIn had convinced the market it was worth nearly $9 billion.
That rarefied air proved fleeting. As of last Friday, the stock had dropped to $65.53, making the underwriters' prudent pricing look a bit wiser than it did initially.
Still, a few ordinary investors were agile enough to squeeze out a profit. Yves Duquella, a local banker and active investor in New York, bought 300 shares at $91 on the morning of the offering, and dumped them above $100 by noon.
''Some poor idiot bought it at $122 and never saw that again,'' he said. ''It's the greater fool theory, like we saw in 2000, but I'm going to do the same thing with Groupon.''

HEADLINE: Short-Term Increase In Debt Limit Suggested

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's top Republican is suggesting a short-term increase in the nation's borrowing limit unless there is deal soon that includes changes to big entitlement programs. 
''If we can't do something really significant about the debt ceiling, then we'll probably end up with a very short- term proposal over a few months, and we'll be back having the same discussion in the fall,'' Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said Sunday on the CBS program ''Face the Nation.''
Economists and Obama administration officials are warning of a calamity if the government defaults on its obligations. The default deadline is Aug. 2.
Still, a leading Democrat said the two parties were coming closer together on the debt limit and deficit reduction.
''Progress is being made,'' Senator Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat, said on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. ''We shouldn't wait until high noon'' to raise the debt ceiling because ''it will mean higher interest rates if we don't.''
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is leading bipartisan Congressional talks on the debt limit and cuts in federal spending.

HEADLINE: Afghanistan's Last Locavores

BYLINE: By PATRICIA McARDLE. 
Patricia McArdle, a retired foreign service officer and Navy veteran, is the author of the novel ''Farishta.'' She serves on the board of directors of Solar Cookers International.

 BODY:
Arlington, Va.
MANY urban Americans idealize ''green living'' and ''slow food.'' But few realize that one of the most promising models for sustainable living is not to be found on organic farms in the United States, but in Afghanistan. A majority of its 30 million citizens still grow and process most of the food they consume. They are the ultimate locavores.
During the 12 months I spent as a State Department political adviser in northern Afghanistan, I was dismayed to see that instead of building on Afghanistan's traditional, labor-intensive agricultural and construction practices, the United States is using many of its aid dollars to transform this fragile agrarian society into a consumer-oriented, mechanized, fossil-fuel-based economy. 
In 2004, the Department of Energy carried out a study of Afghanistan. It revealed abundant renewable energy resources that could be used to build small-scale wind- and solar-powered systems to generate electricity and solar thermal devices for cooking and heating water.
Rather than focus on those resources, the United States government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build large diesel generators and exploit the country's oil, gas and coal reserves. The drilling of new oil wells may provide unskilled, poorly paid jobs for some locals, but the bulk of the profits will likely flow overseas or into the pockets of a few warlords and government officials.
American taxpayers' dollars are also being used for energy-inefficient construction projects. During my year in Afghanistan, I sat for hours in meetings with local officials in remote mountain and desert locations, sweating or freezing -- depending upon the season -- inside concrete and cinder-block schools and police stations built with American aid. These projects are required to adhere to international building codes, which do not permit the construction of traditional earthen structures.
These structures are typically built with cob -- a mixture of mud, sand, clay and chopped straw molded to form durable, elegant, super-insulated, earthquake-resistant structures. With their thick walls, small windows and natural ventilation, traditional Afghan homes may not comply with international building codes, but they are cooler in summer and warmer in winter than cinder-block buildings. They also last a long time. Some of Afghanistan's oldest structures, including sections of the defensive wall that once surrounded the 2,000-year-old Silk Road city of Balkh, are made of cob and rammed earth. In England, people are still living in cob houses built before Shakespeare was born.
Renewable energy and sustainability aren't just development issues. They are security issues, too. Seventy percent of the Defense Department's energy budget in Afghanistan is spent on transporting diesel fuel in armored convoys. In a welcome attempt to reduce this dangerous and expensive dependence on fossil fuel, the Marine Corps recently established two patrol bases in Afghanistan operating entirely on renewable energy.
Unfortunately, it is too little, too late. Had a renewable energy program been initiated a decade ago, when the United States entered Afghanistan to help overthrow the Taliban, Washington could have saved billions of dollars in fuel costs and, more important, hundreds of lives lost in transporting and guarding diesel fuel convoys.
Along with advocating the construction of a pipeline to carry natural gas from Central Asia, across Afghanistan and into Pakistan, the United States is also helping to fund a 20th-century-style power grid that will compel Afghanistan to purchase the bulk of its electricity from neighboring former Soviet republics for decades to come. Even if this grid survives future sabotage and political unrest in Central Asia, its power lines and transmission towers will be carrying this imported electricity right over the heads of rural Afghans and into Afghanistan's major cities -- despite the fact that the United States Central Command has identified the lack of access to electricity in rural areas as a major obstacle to sustaining the gains achieved by our counterinsurgency strategy.
Sustainable development in Afghanistan has taken a back seat to ''quick wins'' that can be reported to Congress as indicators of success: tractors that farmers can't repair and that require diesel fuel they can't afford; cheaply built schools; and smooth but wafer-thin asphalt, which will never stand up to Afghanistan's punishing climate without costly annual maintenance.
If donor nations dismiss Afghans' centuries of experience in sustainability and continue to support the exploitation of fossil fuels over renewable energy, future generations of rural Afghans will be forced to watch in frustrated silence as the construction of pipelines, oil rigs and enormous power grids further degrades their fragile and beautiful land while doing little to improve their lives.
And long after American forces have departed, it will be these rural farmers, not Afghanistan's small urban population, who will decide whether to support or reject future insurgencies.

HEADLINE: How Greek Debt Could Hurt U.S.

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and REYNOLDS HOLDING

 BODY:
Europe is still embroiled in Greece's sovereign debt crisis. It has been more than a year in the making, allowing many American financial firms time to slash even their indirect exposure. But money market funds are still sitting on $360 billion worth of European bank short-term debt. That leaves open a trans-Atlantic channel for Greek turmoil to play havoc with United States markets.
True, the largest money market funds, which American savers see as alternatives to deposit accounts, have cut back lending to banks in peripheral countries like Italy and Spain and shut the door on those in Portugal and Ireland. But they've carried on their love affair with bigger European banks. 
Moody's last week put Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas and Societe Generale on notice for a possible downgrade because of their potential exposure to a Greek default. Yet money market funds have loans outstanding to French banks of around $200 billion, according to JPMorgan estimates. That's about 12 percent of the assets under management, a proportion that hasn't changed much over the last year, according to a Fitch survey of the 10 largest prime money market funds, despite Greece's financial woes.
This indirect exposure creates a potential flashpoint for American money market funds. As the events of 2008 showed, if a fund falls below par value -- known colloquially as breaking the buck -- investors can be badly rattled. And the temporary federal government backstop put in place during the crisis is no longer in force.
Money market funds probably wouldn't sit tight if a Greek default looked certain. They might not immediately start dumping European debt, but they'd be apt to lend for much shorter periods of time -- a sign of stress that broader financial markets could amplify.
Meanwhile, another European rescue for Greece is in the works. That would ease the pressure on European banks and American funds. But a Greek default could still be inevitable in the end. It's odd that money market funds haven't yet taken advantage of several reprieves to minimize their exposure. It may simply be that they find it tough to find alternative places to invest. But whatever the reason, there's still at least one financial Trojan Horse lurking in United States territory.
Anti-Hacking Overkill
Amid a global blitz of computer crime, accidental hackers risk going to prison. An American anti-hacking law is so broad that it may make any breach of an employer's computer policy a crime. Recent attacks against Citigroup, Sony, the International Monetary Fund and others feed demand for stiffer penalties. But prosecutors should avoid overkill with fat-fingered users of PCs and Macs.
Take the case against David Nosal, an executive recruiter. He is accused of getting information from his former employer's computer system through an ex-colleague and using it to help his competing business. If that's how it happened, the move violated the company's policy and possibly amounted to the theft of trade secrets. But hacking?
That's essentially the charge Mr. Nosal faces under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or C.F.A.A., an anti-hacking law that prohibits unauthorized use of computers. A California federal appeals court upheld the charge in April, but was asked last week to reconsider. The panel previously said employers' policies defined what was ''authorized,'' allowing prosecutors to argue that Mr. Nosal's breach was criminal.
Saying it is criminal for a Social Security Administration employee to fish unauthorized through confidential databases sounds reasonable. But allowing arbitrary corporate policies to define the law can easily seem excessive. That was true in Mr. Nosal's case, as well as in an earlier conviction under the law, that involved a case of bullying by computer. In that case, Lori Drew, a Missouri homemaker, was convicted of breaching MySpace's policies. That was overturned, after a judge found that the federal statute was too vague when applied in that case.
The problem with the act remains. If violating any company or Web site policy is potentially illegal, then even someone who checks personal e-mail or a racy Web site at work could theoretically end up in prison. That's surely not the intended result.
Rather than fix that problem, the Obama administration and lawmakers want to toughen the law. The House on May 25 considered a proposal to make all violations of the act felonies and increase maximum sentences to 20 years from five. But if Congress wants to get serious about hacking, it should first define the crime sensibly.

HEADLINE: Swisher Makes Cubs Pay For Strategic Decision

BYLINE: By BEN SHPIGEL

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- More people crammed Wrigley Field to watch the Cubs play the Yankees this weekend than for any three-game series in the venerable ballpark's 97-year-history, a figure that does not include all the patrons filling aluminum bleachers beyond the outfield walls. Those fans sitting high atop Sheffield Avenue on Sunday night very well could have thought a ball was zooming in their direction in the eighth inning.
That is how hard and far Nick Swisher seemed to crush the decisive hit in the Yankees' 10-4 victory, a tie-breaking three-run homer that landed three-quarters up the stands in right field. It was the Yankees' eighth win in 10 games, helping them keep pace in the American League East with the Red Sox, who hold a one-and-a-half game lead. When Swisher jogged out to right field in the bottom of the inning, many Yankees fans among the 41,828 -- the smallest crowd of the series, which drew 126,283 in all -- responded by genuflecting.
''More than anything,'' said Swisher, who is hitting .306 with a .453 on-base percentage and five homers in his last 22 games, ''I'm smiling more, I'm laughing more.'' 
The three eighth-inning runs -- and three more in the ninth -- rewarded C. C. Sabathia, earning him a victory after he recovered from a rocky beginning to work seven innings. Sabathia kept the Yankees close, helping them overcome a 4-1 deficit after three innings, before yielding to Dave Robertson, who silenced the Cubs in the eighth, and to Jeff Marquez, who worked the ninth. He was frustrated by his lack of command, but Sabathia, proud of his hitting prowess, only watched video of his three hitless at-bats.
''We've got some work to do before I go to Citi Field,'' Sabathia said.
By the time of that July 1-3 series against the Mets, Derek Jeter will probably have returned from his calf injury. In his absence, Manager Joe Girardi has employed a leadoff platoon -- Swisher against left-handers, Brett Gardner against right-handers -- and their production in six games has fueled the lineup, combining to hit .435 (10 for 23) and reach base in 16 of 30 plate appearances.
Gardner's on-base acumen won him a place atop the batting order; any power is a bonus. He sent Randy Wells's fourth pitch of the game into the right-field bleachers, the team's first homer at Wrigley since Robin Ventura's on June 8, 2003. His second time up, Gardner singled, the Yankees' only other hit off Wells until the fourth, when they capitalized on a misplay by the Cubs' young shortstop, Starlin Castro.
The Yankees can empathize, dealing with the topsy-turvy development of Eduardo Nunez, who when Jeter returns in about 10 days will again assume his role of dutiful understudy. Nunez's eight errors are part of his learning process, the Yankees believe, just as the Cubs will tolerate mistakes by Castro as he evolves into what they hope is an elite player.
In the fourth, Castro showed his inexperience. On a swinging bunt by Robinson Cano, Geovany Soto fired to second, but Castro took his foot off the bag too early. The relay throw to first arrived too late, and the Yankees had runners on first and second. Swisher grounded a single to right, scoring Alex Rodriguez, and after a walk to Russell Martin loaded the bases, Nunez knocked in Cano with a fielder's choice.
It was 4-3, Cubs, and the Yankees were, in a way, fortunate that they trailed by just one run. Only the Cubs' ineptitude with runners on base -- 2 for 14 through five innings -- prevented them from taking a larger lead on a night when Sabathia struggled to command his fastball. One of them wound up in the left-field bleachers, a three-run shot in the third by Alfonso Soriano, whose six homers off Sabathia are the most he has allowed to any player.
Girardi often praises Sabathia's ability to grind through starts, somehow giving the Yankees length on days when he cannot pitch off his fastball. His secondary pitches usually guide him, and Sabathia has confidence to throw them at any point in the count. He feasted on the Cubs' aggressiveness, retiring 12 of his final 13 hitters to finish seven innings at an economical 89 pitches.
''When you've got the offense that we have and you can really believe that if you can stop it right here, we've got a good chance of winning,'' Sabathia said. ''Some other teams that you play on, it's tough.''
That was the consensus, especially with the wind blowing out for the first time all series. Rodriguez ignited the Yankees' rally in the eighth with a single, and he advanced to third on a single by Cano. In came Chris Carpenter, a right-hander who, in Swisher's words, throws ''super hard.'' That decision by Cubs Manager Mike Quade, based on Swisher's trends, seemed a prudent one. Entering Sunday, 'Swisher, a switch-hitter, had fared far better against left-handers in batting average (.348 to .173) and slugging percentage (.565 to .280).
''That's what he's there for, and he's good at it,'' Quade said of Carpenter.
Except this time he was not, throwing two fastballs out of the strike zone before Swisher clobbered a third, giving it a nice, long look as it exited Wrigley.
''This game, it can beat you up, and it can put you on top of the mountain,'' Swisher said. ''You can have good times and you can have bad times, and tonight was definitely a good night.''
INSIDE PITCH
Alex Rodriguez played down a report on ESPNNewYork.com that he had been dealing with a left shoulder injury for the past few weeks. He said he had been receiving treatment on his shoulder for about 10 days, calling the soreness ''the bumps and bruises of a long season, nothing that jumps out at us.'' Joe Girardi said that ''it's not a strain.'' ...Phil Hughes's progress after a case of right shoulder inflammation continued Sunday, when, according to multiple news reports, his fastball topped out at 95 miles per hour and hovered around 92 to 93 m.p.h. in a start for Class A Staten Island. Hughes is likely to need at least three more starts in the minors before rejoining the rotation.

HEADLINE: A.E.P. Protests Too Much: One of the country's biggest power companies will try anything to weaken clean air rules

 BODY:
American Electric Power, one of the nation's largest utilities, warned last week that new air quality rules could force it to ''prematurely'' shut down about two dozen big coal-fired units and fire hundreds of workers. This is a deceptive and particularly cynical claim. The utility is making a business decision that has little to do with the rules.
Here is what A.E.P. is not saying: These units are, on average, 55 years old. Some are running at only 5 percent of capacity. Many had long been slated for retirement, in part to comply with a 2007 settlement with the George W. Bush administration in which the company agreed to settle violations of the Clean Air Act by spending $4.7 billion to retire or retrofit aging units. 
Blaming the rules is a transparent scare tactic designed to weaken the administration's resolve while playing to industry supporters on Capitol Hill. Fortunately, Lisa Jackson, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, which proposed the rules, refuses to be bullied.
Ms. Jackson called the A.E.P. charges ''misleading at best'' and made clear she would not retreat from her statutory duty to protect public health. She said she would stick to her timetable and make the rules final this year. We hope that the White House is equally determined.
Two rules are at issue. One, proposed last year, would require utilities to sharply reduce emissions of already-regulated soot and smog-forming pollutants like sulfur dioxide. The other, for the first time, would mandate reductions in toxic pollutants like mercury. Coal-fired plants, which generate the vast bulk of A.E.P.'s power, are by far the biggest producers of all these pollutants. Companies will have to begin complying with the soot and smog rules next year and the air toxics rule by 2015.
A.E.P. says this timeline is ''unrealistic'' and asks for a delay of up to five years; otherwise, it says, it will have to shut down one-fourth of its coal-fired capacity and lay off up to 600 workers. Yet in a June 1 meeting with investors, Michael Morris, the utility's chairman, who last week warned about the impact of the proposed regulations on ''our customers and local economies,'' told investors that the closings were ''the appropriate way to go'' for customers and shareholders.
As for the utility's claims of undue haste, they don't stand up to even minimal review. Both rules have been in the works since the Clinton administration, and companies that have made their plants more efficient or invested in cleaner-burning fuels or up-to-date pollution control technologies are by now well prepared to deal with them.
A.E.P., by contrast, has always seemed much more interested in fighting the Clean Air Act than in finding sensible ways to meet its requirements. It fought the statue after it passed in 1970 and resisted efforts to strengthen the law under President George H. W. Bush. Even now it is shopping a bill around Capitol Hill that would block or delay the proposed new standards.
The bill does not so far have a sponsor, though it will likely have plenty of sympathizers among Republicans and some Rust Belt Democrats. It does not reflect the interests or wishes of the vast majority of Americans, for whom cleaner air is rightly a higher priority than any company's bottom line.

HEADLINE: Gates Acknowledges Talks with Taliban

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates acknowledged on Sunday that the United States had begun preliminary talks with members of the Taliban as part of an effort to end the war in Afghanistan.
But as he pressed his case against withdrawing a significant number of American troops from the region this year, he said that he did not believe the negotiations would produce any positive results unless the Taliban continued to feel military pressure through the end of the year.
In an appearance on CNN's ''State of the Union,'' Mr. Gates cautioned that the talks were in such early stages -- having begun a few weeks ago -- that officials were still uncertain the Taliban participants were genuine representatives of the Taliban leader Mullah Omar. He said the effort was being carried out by American diplomats but did not directly involve the secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton. And he said several other countries were participating, though he did not specify which ones. 
''We have said all along that a political outcome is the way most of the wars end,'' Mr. Gates said. ''The question is when and if they are ready to talk seriously.''
Referring to his concerns about drawing down too many American troops this summer, he added, ''Real reconciliation talks are not likely to be able to make substantive headway until at least this winter. I think the Taliban have to feel themselves under military pressure and begin to believe they can't win before they are willing to have a serious conversation.''
Mr. Gates appeared on at least two Sunday morning programs as part of a final media tour before he leaves his post after having served under eight presidents over 40 years in government, including overseeing two wars and the recent airstrikes over Libya. In his comments, Mr. Gates said he understood the pressure by a war-weary, economically distressed nation to withdraw from Afghanistan.
However, he argued that it had been only in the last two years that the United States began committing sufficient resources to its fight there and made significant progress, pushing the Taliban out of its strongholds in Kandahar and Helmand, and killing the Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. Those gains could be lost, he said, if the United States were to withdraw its troops prematurely.
''I know the American people are tired of war,'' Mr. Gates said on CNN. ''But, look, the reality is the United States had a very limited commitment in Afghanistan until well into 2008. And we did not have the right strategy and the right resources for this conflict, those needed to do the job, until the late summer of 2010.''
As for withdrawal from Iraq, a war Mr. Gates said would ''always be clouded by the way it began,'' he said the United States had begun talking with Iraq about keeping a ''limited number'' of troops there beyond the end of the year to do training, oversee equipment and conduct counterterrorism operations. He did not give a specific number for how many troops might be needed except to say it would likely be a ''fraction'' of the 47,000 troops there now.
On ''Fox News Sunday,'' Mr. Gates defended President Obama's decision to deploy American military power to establish a no-fly zone over Libya without seeking congressional approval, echoing the White House's view that it did not violate the War Powers Act because the government was not engaged in ''hostilities.''
Mr. Gates described the United States' role in Libya as a ''limited kinetic operation.'' And referring to Mr. Obama, he said, ''I'm confident that he would not make judgments along these lines if he were not confident that he was acting in a constitutional manner.''
The Sunday talk shows also offered a preview of how the debate over Libya may play out in Congress, where President Obama may face criticism from some of his closest allies, including Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois. In an appearance on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Durbin said he would not support proposed measures to defund military operations in Libya. But he strongly rejected White House arguments that the United States air support to NATO did not amount to direct engagement in hostilities, and therefore did not require congressional approval.
''Hostilities by remote control are still hostilities,'' Mr. Durbin said. ''We are killing with drones what we would otherwise be killing with fighter planes. What we should do is act on a timely basis to pass congressional authorization under the War Powers Act.''
Senator Lindsey Graham , a Republican from South Carolina, pushed back against those in his party who have said that the United States has no strategic interests to justify its military campaign in Libya. At one point, Senator Graham said that the legislative debate over American involvement had encouraged the Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and Mr. Graham said, ''Congress should sort of shut up.''
Referring to Mr. Qaddafi, Mr. Durbin said, ''If we fail against Qaddafi, that's the end of NATO. Egypt is going to be overrun, and the 'mad dog of the Middle East,' as Ronald Reagan called Qaddafi, if he survives, you're going to have double the price of oil that you do today.''
On ABC's ''This Week with Christiane Amanpour,'' Senator John McCain said he and Senator John Kerry were prepared to introduce a measure this week that would cover the United States fighting in Libya.
''If we had not intervened, Qaddafi was at the gates of Benghazi,'' Senator McCain said. ''He said he was going to go house to house to kill everybody. That's a city of 700,000 people. What would be saying now if we had allowed for that to happen?'

HEADLINE: PNC Is Said to Be Near Deal for R.B.C. Unit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
6:01 p.m. Updated The PNC Financial Services Group is near a deal to buy the Royal Bank of Canada's American consumer banking operations for about $3.45 billion in cash and stock, people briefed on the matter said on Sunday. 
The transaction, which would allow R.B.C. to shed a division that has been hobbled by the housing crisis, could be announced as soon as Monday, these people said. They cautioned that final details were still being ironed out and that the deal could still fall apart. PNC beat out a rival, the BB&T Corporation, in a race for the unit, RBC Bank, the people briefed on the matter said.
R.B.C. purchased Centura Banks in 2001 for nearly $2.2 billion, beginning a push into American retail banking. But the unit, renamed RBC Bank after a series of acquisitions, has failed to win significant market share.
RBC Bank was buffeted by the housing crisis, losing money for several consecutive years. It took a $1 billion write-down in 2009, leading to a reorganization that included eliminating jobs and reducing lending.
By contrast, PNC has performed well since the financial crisis. It has reported three consecutive increases in annual profit, earning $3.4 billion in 2010. Its last major deal was buying the National City Corporation in 2009 for about $4 billion.
Through the deal, PNC is hoping to expand into the Southeast, an area in which the bank currently has relatively little presence. RBC Bank currently has more than 420 locations in six Southern states, from Virginia to Florida.
While R.B.C. is pulling back from retail banking in the United States, it still has significant operations in the country, including an investment banking arm.
Other Canadian competitors, however, have made big pushes into American consumer lending over the last year. The BMO Group agreed in December to buy Marshall & Ilsley, based in Milwaukee, for $4.1 billion.
That same month, Toronto-Dominion struck a $6.3 billion deal for Chrysler Financial, the former lending arm of the eponymous car maker.
R.B.C. is only the latest bank to sell a major unit under pressure. Last week, the ING Groupagreed to sell its American online banking arm to Capital One Financial for $9 billion as part of the requirements of its bailout by the Dutch government.
Shares in R.B.C. rose 1.2 percent, closing at 54.33 Canadian dollars on Friday, after Bloomberg News reported that PNC had won the auction. Shares of PNC fell 2.8 percent, to $57.79, on Friday.
R.B.C. was advised by JPMorgan Chase, while PNC was advised by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.

HEADLINE: Companies Push For a Tax Break On Foreign Cash

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
Some of the nation's largest corporations have amassed vast profits outside the country and are pressing Congress and the Obama administration for a tax break to bring the money home.
Apple has $12 billion waiting offshore, Google has $17 billion and Microsoft, $29 billion.
Under the proposal, known as a repatriation holiday, the federal income tax owed on such profits returned to the United States would fall to 5.25 percent for one year, from 35 percent. In the short term, the measure could generate tens of billions in tax revenues as companies transfer money that would otherwise remain abroad, and it could help ease the huge budget deficit.
Corporations and their lobbyists say the tax break could resuscitate the gasping recovery by inducing multinational corporations to inject $1 trillion or more into the economy, and they promoted the proposal as ''the next stimulus'' at a conference last Wednesday in Washington.
''For every billion dollars that we invest, that creates 15,000 to 20,000 jobs either directly or indirectly,'' Jim Rogers, the chief of Duke Energy, said at the conference. Duke has $1.3 billion in profits overseas. 
But that's not how it worked last time. Congress and the Bush administration offered companies a similar tax incentive, in 2005, in hopes of spurring domestic hiring and investment, and 800 took advantage.
Though the tax break lured them into bringing $312 billion back to the United States, 92 percent of that money was returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks, according to a study by the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research.
This money comes from overseas operations and in some cases accounting maneuvers that shift domestic profits to low-tax countries. The study concluded that the program ''did not increase domestic investment, employment or research and development.''
Indeed, 60 percent of the benefits went to just 15 of the largest United States multinational companies -- many of which laid off domestic workers, closed plants and shifted even more of their profits and resources abroad in hopes of cashing in on the next repatriation holiday.
Merck, the pharmaceutical giant based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., was one of those big winners. The company brought home $15.9 billion, second overall to Pfizer's $37 billion. It used the money for ''U.S.-based research and development spending, capital investments in U.S. plants, and salaries and wages for the U.S.,'' a Merck spokesman, Steven Campanini, said last week.
According to regulatory filings, though, the company cut its work force and capital spending in this country in the three years that followed.
Merck used the cash infusion to continue paying dividends and buying back stock for the benefit of shareholders and executives -- even as it was rocked by more than $8 billion in costs to settle a variety of disputes after executive missteps. Merck had to pay billions in back taxes to the I.R.S.; billions more to consumers suing because of the dangerous side effects of the painkiller Vioxx, and hundreds of millions to the Justice Department, which had accused the company of defrauding Medicare.
The tax break, part of the American Jobs Creation Act, lacked safeguards to ensure the companies used the money for investment and job creation in the United States, as Congress intended. ''There were no direct tracing requirements,'' said Jay B. Schwartz, head of Merck's international tax unit until 2006. ''So once the money came home, it gave you great flexibility.''
Finding Work-Arounds
Although the law forbade the use of repatriated funds directly for executive compensation or stock buybacks, companies found plenty of ways around it. ''Fungibility is one of my favorite words,'' Mr. Schwartz said.
As Congress was debating the tax cut in 2004, senior executives at Merck anxiously followed the battle through Congress. Some company officials were worried that the costs of the Vioxx lawsuits might top $10 billion and push the company to the brink of bankruptcy, Mr. Schwartz said. When the measure was finally signed into law by President George W. Bush in October 2004, ''there was a lot of excitement, a lot of cheering,'' among senior management, he said. Merck executives declined to comment.
Merck brought back $15.9 billion in October 2005. The next month, it unveiled a restructuring plan to cut 7,000 jobs. Over the next three years, about half those cuts were made in the United States, where the company's employment fell to 28,800 jobs, from 31,500.
How big the job cuts would have been without the tax break is unknown, though Mr. Schwartz said contingency plans called for painful reductions throughout the company.
That restructuring was harsh in places like Albany, Ga., one of the nation's poorest communities, where Merck closed its Flint River manufacturing plant and shed more than 400 workers.
''It was like going through a sudden divorce,'' said Connie McKissack, now 45, who had worked at the company for a dozen years as a systems analyst.
While it is impossible to pinpoint where its repatriated dollars went, Merck devoted much more money in the next few years to closing plants and dismissing workers. For the three years that ended in 2008, those outlays jumped to $455 million annually, from $107 million in 2004. (Merck officials declined to respond to detailed questions about how the repatriated money figured into its cash flow.)
Meanwhile, the company accelerated payments on its debt, kept its dividend steady and continued to buy back more than a billion dollars a year in its own stock -- cushioning the blow of immense legal costs to its shareholders and executives.
Drug companies benefited greatly from the tax break, but many companies in other industries did, too. Ford, Pepsi and Honeywell took advantage. Like Merck and Pfizer, Hewlett-Packard repatriated money, $14.5 billion, and soon after it announced it was eliminating jobs, 14,000.
The WIN America coalition, a multimillion-dollar campaign underwritten by dozens of global businesses, counters that many companies like Cisco Systems, Adobe and Qualcomm used some of the repatriated money to hire thousands of workers.
The group says another tax holiday would bring even more jobs now. Doug Thornell, an adviser to WIN America, cites a 2008 study commissioned by the corporations suggesting that it could spur 450,000 new jobs.
''This is about creating jobs, expanding U.S. businesses and strengthening American companies,'' said Representative Kevin Brady, a Republican from Texas, who has introduced such a bill.
Yet the author of the corporate study, Allen L. Sinai, has since cooled on the idea. His research was conducted during the financial crisis in late 2008. Then, corporations could not easily raise capital, Mr. Sinai, an economist at Decision Economics, explained in an interview last month. They were reluctant to hire workers or spend in other ways.
Rethinking the Plan
Today, credit is readily available. In fact, many of those pushing hardest for the break are sitting on billions in cash in the United States that they could use to hire if they chose.
The break would make sense, Mr. Sinai now says, only if Congress carefully restricted the proceeds to increases in domestic hiring and investment.
''Many who want this policy try to advocate it as a jobs-creation program, but that is not what I found,'' he said. ''What I found was that it would shore up the corporate balance sheets during the depths of the financial crisis and create some jobs. But the balance sheets are already so good that I don't think there's a rationale any longer that simply rebuilding the companies' finances will lead to hiring.''
Supporters of the measure had also promoted the tax law as good for investment in plants and research. An academic study, published in the National Tax Journal last December, said companies reported investing as much as $75 billion of the money in equipment and facilities.
For Merck, it was nearly a wash. In the three years beginning with the repatriation, the company increased its spending on research and development domestically by several billion dollars, according to regulatory filings. But its capital spending actually declined in that time.
Much the same happened elsewhere, according to a review of taxpayer data by the National Bureau of Economic Research. ''For every dollar that was brought back, there were zero cents used for additional capital expenditures, research and development, or hiring and employees wages,'' said Kristin J. Forbes, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management who was a member of President Bush's council of economic advisers and who led the study. A Short-Lived Boost
The break did provide the Treasury with a quick shot in the arm. When Merck brought its $15.9 billion back, it paid $731 million to the I.R.S. All told, companies brought back $312 billion in 2005 and paid $16 billion in taxes.
The numbers would presumably be much bigger now. Technology companies, in particular, have been holding more profits abroad. Companies based in the United States have increased their holdings offshore to more than $1.5 trillion, meaning the tax break could generate $50 billion in tax revenue the first year.
The budget aid could be short-lived, however. Because companies would be encouraged to bring back profits in one year, tax revenues would be smaller in future years. Furthermore, companies might park future profits offshore in hopes of another holiday. The Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan Congressional office, estimated the program's cost at $79 billion in lost revenues over 10 years.
Supporters of the proposal say that estimate is too high and predict that the repatriation holiday would pay for itself by encouraging hiring and other economic activity. Others say it is a reasonable price for economic aid from the private sector.
The Obama administration has been uncharacteristically harsh in its criticism of the idea. President Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner have said they will support it only if it is part of a corporate tax overhaul that results in no decline in federal revenues.
The prospect of profitable corporations getting a break as social programs are being cut has aroused tax protesters and labor organizations like the Service Employees International Union, which say it would reward companies for moving jobs and investment overseas.
US Uncut, a group that protests corporate tax avoidance, has criticized Apple for seeking tax breaks even as it racks up enormous growth and profits. The group has held dance-ins at Apple stores, demonstrated outside a company conference and released a video spoofing an iPod commercial, declaring ''I love my iPod, but iHate the tax cheat.''
But the break could still be part of a budget compromise. With the economy languishing, unemployment high and Congressional Republicans opposed to additional stimulus, the idea has gained some unlikely allies, including some Democrats, the organization Third Way and the onetime union leader Andy Stern.
''Even if it costs the government $80 billion in the long haul, it would be worth it to try to put people to work now,'' said Mr. Stern, the former president of the S.E.I.U., who suggests dedicating the tax revenue to an infrastructure bank that would support public works projects. ''Having it overseas doesn't help. And we have to do something.''
But Nobody Pays That: Articles in this series are examining efforts by businesses to lower their taxes and the debate over how to improve the tax system.

HEADLINE: Blaming Incumbent For the Economy, A Political Tradition

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - A recent Republican Party news release about President Obama, Democrats and the economy declared simply: ''They own it.''
As a matter of politics, that's indisputable. The burdens or benefits of economic conditions go to incumbents - an iron law of elections that makes Mr. Obama vulnerable in 2012.
As a matter of economics, the case is less clear. Mr. Obama's policies, for better or worse, have something to do with current employment levels and growth rates. But economic advisers to Republican politicians concede that most of the distress Americans feel now stems from the recession and financial crisis he inherited. 
Glenn Hubbard, the Columbia Business School dean who led the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, criticized Mr. Obama's spending, tax and regulatory strategies for ''actively'' retarding the recovery. Yet he added, ''There could have been policies that made a difference - but not a sea change.''
Mark Zandi, the Moody's Analytics chief economist who advised Mr. Obama's 2008 opponent, Senator John McCain, went further. Had he been elected president, Mr. McCain's near-term policy choices would have largely overlapped with Mr. Obama's, he said - and the differences would have had only marginal effects by now.
''Broadly speaking, I don't think a President McCain would have responded meaningfully differently'' to the economic crisis in 2009, said Dr. Zandi, a registered Democrat. Mr. McCain, too, would have struggled with external shocks like Europe's debt crisis and the Middle East turmoil.
''Four-dollar gasoline and the economic fallout from the Japanese quake would have been tough for even a strong economy to gracefully digest,'' Dr. Zandi said. Had Mr. McCain won the election, ''The economy and the nation's fiscal situation would be in roughly the same place today.''
Consensus on Relief
Backed by Senators Obama and McCain, the Troubled Asset Relief Program was signed into law by Mr. Bush in October 2008. Two months later, Mr. Bush and Congress extended aid to General Motors and Chrysler.
In both areas, Mr. McCain would have ''pretty much followed the script President Bush was laying out'' and Mr. Obama implemented, Dr. Zandi said. Mr. McCain also backed extending the Bush tax cuts, as Mr. Obama did in a deal with Republican legislators last fall.
Doug Holtz-Eakin, Mr. McCain's top policy adviser, said a President McCain would have also pursued an economic stimulus package - $400 billion instead of Mr. Obama's $787 billion, delivered through payroll tax cuts rather than spending programs.
Another McCain adviser, Kevin A. Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute, said Mr. McCain's proposal for a corporate income tax cut would have made a ''a dramatic difference'' in job creation. Instead of the ''short-termism'' of Mr. Obama's two-year stimulus plan, that permanent cut would have countered the ''10 years of slow growth'' that typically follow a financial crisis.
Dr. Holtz-Eakin said Mr. McCain would have improved economic performance another way: by avoiding the burdens of new health care and financial-regulation laws. That would have accelerated recovery by reducing uncertainty and anxiety among businesses.
But Dr. Holtz-Eakin doesn't argue that those choices would have produced a night-and-day difference.
Instead of today's sluggish growth - 1.8 percent in the first quarter and 2.5 percent for the year, according to International Monetary Fund projections - he speculated that the economy would be growing as fast as 3.5 percent.
On the unemployment rate, he said, ''Maybe not from 9.1 percent to 5 percent, but a point, something''- perhaps 7.5 percent.
That would still be higher than the rate was in Mr. Bush's last full month in office, before the combined effects of the recession and the financial crisis hit with full force.
Unlucky Inheritance
Mr. Obama and his economic team insist that their actions accelerated recovery and prevented a potential depression. In any event, Americans haven't forgotten the dismal circumstances he walked into.
Growth remains weak, but in the fourth quarter of 2008, the economy shrunk at a 6.8 percent rate. Payrolls grew by only 54,000 in May, but shrunk by 619,000 in December 2008. The Congressional Budget Office projected a 2009 deficit exceeding $1 trillion before Mr. Obama took office.
In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week, 62 percent of Americans said current conditions reflected ''a situation Barack Obama has inherited.'' Just 25 percent found his policies ''mostly responsible.''
Yet 54 percent disapproved of Mr. Obama's economic performance - and Republican presidential candidates pounded away at it during last week's debate in New Hampshire.
''The Obama administration is an antijobs, antibusiness, anti-American-energy destructive force,'' said Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker.
Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, said the president had ''failed at a time when the American people counted on him to create jobs and get the economy growing.''
In an electoral system offering binary choices, it's no surprise that Mr. Obama's political culpability exceeds his economic culpability. The actual impact of alternative policies, Mr. Hassett said, is ''unknowable.''
What is knowable with certainty is this: if a Republican were sitting in the White House, Democratic candidates would be doing exactly the same thing.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: War Crimes Charges Weighed As Crisis Continues in Syria

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration, seeking new ways to force the Syrian leadership to halt its violent crackdown on domestic dissent, is examining whether war crimes charges can be brought against President Bashar al-Assad, senior administration officials said. 
The officials said the effort was part of a broader government campaign to increase pressure on the Syrian leader as his security forces continue to kill and wound protesters.
One senior administration official disclosed that the United States was examining whether Mr. Assad's actions constituted war crimes and whether it was possible to seek international legal action against him, his government or Syria's police forces and military.
The official said the United States was ''looking into'' whether ''there are grounds here for charges related to war crimes, and whether referrals on that are appropriate.''
The official said the administration was also examining ''additional economic steps -- and one, in particular, has to do with the oil and gas sector in Syria.''
There has been wide anticipation that Mr. Assad would address the issues of internal dissent in a public address.
His crackdown has brought international condemnation of a leadership that has ruled Syria for more than four decades. In advance of any public comments by Mr. Assad on how to deal with dissenters, another senior administration official said, ''I think the Syrian people are going to be focusing a lot less on words and a lot more on what is the action, what are the changes that are on the ground.''
That official said the United States was ''working unilaterally, regionally and internationally in order to try to build a broad-based approach to how to respond to the need to increase pressure on the regime.''
Britain and France have proposed a Security Council resolution that would criticize Syria but not include military action or sanctions, like those in a resolution on Libya. Even the relatively mild language on Syria faces stiff opposition from Russia, a Syria ally, which has veto power as a permanent Security Council member. In an interview published Monday in the Financial Times, President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia practically ruled out support for such a resolution, saying he fears it ''may state one thing but the resulting actions may be quite different.''

HEADLINE: Nominees at Standstill as G.O.P. Flexes Its Muscle

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans are blocking a wide range of presidential nominees as a means of reshaping and restraining the Obama administration's economic policies on prominent issues like housing, finance, foreign trade and offshore drilling.
The list of vacancies in senior economic and regulatory positions has lengthened to roughly a dozen since last November, when Republicans won enough Senate seats to prevent confirmations. The White House has not tried to fill several of the positions. Some of the people it has named have been stuck in legislative limbo, while others have given up, including the Nobel laureate Peter A. Diamond, who withdrew his nomination for a seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.
Senators have long exercised their constitutional prerogative to derail nominations. And, for just as long, the party in the White House has accused its opponents of abusing that power. But several of the current standoffs differ in at least one respect: Republicans have said they are not opposing a particular nominee but rather any nominee, whoever it may be.
Republicans say the blockade reflects their frustration with the White House and the last Congress for passing broad policies without winning broad support. Republicans are consigned to defensive tactics because they lack the votes to pursue their own agenda. 
A group of 44 Republican senators say they will not confirm a commerce secretary, or any other trade official, until the conclusion of free trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia. They have also vowed to block any nominee to lead the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, instead demanding that Democrats agree to eliminate the position and curtail the agency's powers.
Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, blocked a vote on President Obama's nominee to lead the Fish and Wildlife Service until the government granted 15 permits for deepwater drilling. Those conditions were satisfied last month. A separate demand by Senator Mike Lee of Utah that the Interior Department release certain documents was met last week. Now the nomination is being blocked by Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, who wants a review of the protected status of wolves.
''The one leverage tool that the minority party in the Senate has right now is confirmations,'' said Joseph Engelhard of Capital Alpha Partners, a research firm that analyzes Washington for corporate clients.
''This isn't about any particular appointee -- Ben Franklin could come back to life and they would oppose him,'' said Mr. Engelhard, a former Republican aide on the House Financial Services Committee. ''There's just very strong concerns on their side that the process, that traditional way that the Senate likes to come to bipartisan compromise, isn't working.''
Democratic lawmakers, regulators and even some industry groups say they are increasingly concerned that the vacancies are impeding efforts to improve regulation and spur growth.
''It's important for agencies to have leadership that has been appointed and confirmed by elected officials,'' said Joseph A. Smith Jr., whose nomination to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency was blocked by Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. ''It confers legal authority and it confers moral authority. People are more likely to listen to you.''
''It doesn't matter that it's not me,'' Mr. Smith said. ''What's important is that they confirm someone.''
Almost a year has passed since Mr. Shelby and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, a Democrat who led the banking committee until he retired last year, sent a letter to the White House urging Mr. Obama to appoint a leader ''as soon as possible'' for the housing agency, which supervises the mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
''We also urge you to make timely appointments to fill the positions at other federal financial regulators.'' the letter said. ''A full contingent of federal financial regulators is crucial to maintaining adequate federal prudential regulation and consumer protections.''
Mr. Obama's nomination in November of Mr. Smith, the commissioner of banking in North Carolina, was cheered by banking and consumer groups. His confirmation began with warm praise from both North Carolina senators, one a Democrat and one a Republican.
Five days later, Mr. Shelby issued a statement describing Mr. Smith as ill suited for the job, saying he lacked experience and had not demonstrated independence from the administration.
''We need a watchdog, not a lapdog,'' Mr. Shelby said.
Professor Diamond, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was one of three people nominated to the Fed by Mr. Obama in April 2010. The others, Sarah Bloom Raskin and Janet L. Yellen, were confirmed in September, but Mr. Shelby demanded a new hearing on Professor Diamond, citing a range of concerns about his background and ideas.
Two weeks later, Professor Diamond was awarded a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on labor markets, a central focus of Fed research and policy. He said he had asked the prize committee for the value of gold in the medal to include it in his taxable income, particularly because he knew his tax return could be scrutinized.
Mr. Shelby opened the second hearing in March with a ringing condemnation of Professor Diamond's nomination, arguing that he lacked relevant experience and that he favored efforts by the Fed to stimulate the economy that were opposed by Mr. Shelby and other Republicans.
''Many of us believe that this is not the economic philosophy the Fed should be embracing at this point in our economic history,'' Mr. Shelby said. ''I encourage the president to withdraw this nomination.''
Professor Diamond, who withdrew from consideration this month, was philosophical in an interview last week, noting that the first piece of advice he received after accepting the nomination was not to sign a lease in Washington until the Senate gave its approval.
He said that he understood senators would vote against nominees whose views differed from their own, but added that he believed they should not prevent votes unless the nominee fell outside the mainstream.
''A conservative president gets conservative jurists, but not too conservative,'' he said. ''And it seems to me there should be a similar framing for the Fed. If instead the issue is putting too much pressure on how monetary policy is done, then we run the risk of having lower-quality monetary policy.''
Democrats are most infuriated by Republican opposition to any nominee to lead the new consumer bureau -- and indeed, to the existence of the position itself. ''A wall of opposition to any nominee is different than what has happened in the past,'' said Representative Brad Miller, Democrat of North Carolina.
Republicans counter that they see no practical difference in issuing a blanket objection, rather than waiting for the president to name someone, because the issues are the same in either case.
''The only thing that's unusual is that we're doing it publicly,'' said an aide to Mr. Shelby, speaking on condition of anonymity. He noted that senators often blocked nominations without any public acknowledgment or explanation.
''At least we're having a fair and open policy discussion,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Karzai Is Testing U.S. Patience, Envoy Says

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA and GINGER THOMPSON; Ray Rivera reported from Herat, and Ginger Thompson from Washington.

 BODY:
HERAT, Afghanistan -- The departing American ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl W. Eikenberry, lashed out at President Hamid Karzai on Sunday in a carefully calculated and candid rebuke of the Afghan leader's increasingly inflammatory criticism of the coalition forces.
''When Americans, who are serving in your country at great cost -- in terms of life and treasure -- hear themselves compared with occupiers, told that they are only here to advance their own interest and likened to the brutal enemies of the Afghan people,'' the ambassador said, ''my people, in turn, are filled with confusion and grow weary of our effort here.'' 
The admonition came the day after Mr. Karzai declared that NATO-led coalition forces were ''here for their own purposes, for their own goals, and they're using our soil for that.'' Last month, he threatened to denounce the coalition as occupiers if they did not stop attacks on Afghan homes.
Mr. Karzai also said Saturday that the United States had been negotiating with the Taliban. The American defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, acknowledged those talks publicly for the first time on Sunday, saying that the discussions were preliminary.
Mr. Eikenberry's comments, in a postscript to a speech in front of about 200 students and faculty members at Herat University, departed sharply from the normally tolerant public stance that Western diplomats had taken with Mr. Karzai. The ambassador never mentioned the Afghan president by name, but his comments were clearly intended as a warning that Mr. Karzai was testing American patience at a critical time, with President Obama weighing troop reductions and support for the war fast eroding in Congress and among the American public.
The ambassador has made similar comments in the past, but he went substantially further on Sunday, reflecting growing worries among Western diplomats over Mr. Karzai's repeated denunciations of the allied coalition. Mr. Karzai has been particularly critical of civilian casualties and the night raids and airstrikes that often lead to them, but he also frequently blames foreigners, and the way they deliver aid to Afghanistan, for feeding the widespread corruption that has stymied economic development.
''When we hear ourselves being called occupiers and worse,'' Mr. Eikenberry said, ''and our generous aid programs dismissed as totally ineffective and the source of all corruption, our pride is offended and we begin to lose our inspiration to carry on.''
President Karzai did not publicly respond to Mr. Eikenberry's comments on Sunday. His spokesman did not return phone calls or reply to an e-mail.
Western diplomats have rarely countered Mr. Karzai's criticisms, in the belief that he was mainly playing to a domestic audience. In private conversations with Western officials, diplomats say, he has expressed his concerns in softer, more tactful terms.
Last month, he threatened to take unspecified ''unilateral action'' against NATO if it did not stop bombing Afghan homes. He made the comments after a coalition airstrike aimed at insurgents in Helmand Province killed several civilians, most of them children.
''If they continue their attacks on our houses, then their presence will change from a force that is fighting against terrorism to a force that is fighting against the people of Afghanistan,'' he said. ''And, in that case, history shows what Afghans do with trespassers and with occupiers.''
In his speech on Saturday, broadcast live on state-run television, Mr. Karzai's criticisms were broader: he said that the coalition forces' motives were suspect and that their weapons were polluting Afghanistan.
Mr. Eikenberry acknowledged that American and NATO forces had made mistakes.
''Over the course of time here, our learning curve has been steep,'' he said. ''That is because Afghanistan's political, social and economic situation is complex. We do not speak your language and are far from home. But in spite of our mistakes, we are good people whose aim is to help improve our mutual security.''
Mr. Eikenberry's impassioned remarks may have been a parting shot as he prepares to step down. Ryan C. Crocker, a former ambassador to Iraq, has been nominated to succeed him.
''Mothers and fathers of fallen soldiers, spouses of soldiers who have lost arms and legs, children of those who lost their lives in your country, they ask themselves about the meaning of their loved one's sacrifice,'' he said. ''When I hear some of your leaders call us occupiers, I cannot look these mourning parents, mourning spouses and mourning children in the eye and give them a comforting reply.''
He closed to warm applause, saying: ''I've spoken frankly. I've spoken from my heart. I've spoken as your friend.''
As Mr. Eikenberry looked back on America's experience in Afghanistan, Mr. Gates addressed the United States' future there.
Pressing his case against withdrawing a significant number of American troops from the region this year, the defense secretary cautioned that he did not believe that negotiations with the Taliban would produce results unless the insurgents continued to feel military pressure.
Speaking on the CNN program ''State of the Union,'' he said the talks had only begun a few weeks ago and that officials were still uncertain that the Taliban participants were genuine representatives of the group's leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar. Several other countries were participating in the effort, he said, though he did not specify which ones.
''We have said all along that a political outcome is the way most of the wars end,'' he said. ''The question is when and if they are ready to talk seriously.''
Referring to his concerns about withdrawing too many American troops this summer, he added, ''I think the Taliban have to feel themselves under military pressure and begin to believe they can't win before they are willing to have a serious conversation.''

HEADLINE: Man Turns to Crime for Prison Health Care

BYLINE: ROBERT MACKEY


HIGHLIGHT: An unemployed man in North Carolina robbed a bank of $1 this month and waited for the police, hoping to take advantage of the free medical care in prison.

 BODY:
As if conjured up by a presidential speechwriter to star in an anecdote about America's dysfunctional health insurance system, James Verone, a 59-year-old with a bad back, a sore foot and an undiagnosed growth on his chest, limped into a bank in Gastonia, N.C., and handed the teller a note, explaining that this was an unarmed robbery, but that she better turn over $1 and call the cops. 
That, he figured, would be enough to get arrested and sent to prison for a few years, where he could take advantage of the free medical care.
Just to make sure that no one was confused about his intentions, Mr. Verone made sure to let the teller know that he would be sitting on a couch in the bank, waiting for the police. Before he set out for the bank the morning of June 9, he also mailed a letter explaining his scheme to a local newspaper, The Gaston Gazette.
"When you receive this a bank robbery will have been committed by me," the letter read. "This robbery is being committed by me for one dollar. I am of sound mind but not so much sound body."
In a television interview last week with WCNC-TV in Charlotte, Mr. Verone said he was hoping for a three-year sentence, which would give him a place to live and free health care until he was old enough to collect a social security check and buy a condo on the beach. "I'm sort of a logical person and that was my logic, what I came up with," he said.
According to Diane Turbyfill, a Gazette journalist who also interviewed Mr. Verone, there was one flaw in his cunning plan. "Because he only demanded $1, he was charged with larceny from a person," not bank robbery, Ms. Turbyfill wrote. "Still a felony, the count doesn't carry as much jail time as bank robbery."

HEADLINE: Managing Risk in Booming 'Global Bazaar' of Food and Drugs

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: America's food and drug agency scrambles to cut risks attending the globalization of food and drugs.

 BODY:
The Food and Drug Administration, racing to keep up with explosively growing global flows of food, drugs and other products it tracks, has released a report outlining how it plans to minimize threats to public health and welfare. 
Much of the report, "Pathway to Global Product Safety and Quality," centers on plans for sharing information and coordinating regulatory strategies. 
There is a parallel here to efforts to limit and manage global disease outbreaks through better information analysis and cooperation. 
For food, drugs and medical equipment, the challenge is exacerbated given how clampdowns on food safety and the like have sometimes seemed as much about protecting domestic constituencies (catfish farmers, for instance) as they are about protecting the public. 
Overall, the report does a better job of delineating the astonishing scope of the challenge than it does building confidence that the agency has the resources to handle the task. Take these statistics from the summary as a starting point: 
Nearly two thirds of the fruits and vegetables--and 80% of seafood--eaten domestically come from outside the U.S. Half of all medical devices used in this country are imported, while 80 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in medications sold here are manufactured elsewhere.
At the center of this global bazaar is the FDA. Today, nearly 25 cents of every dollar spent by Americans are on products regulated by the agency. FDA-regulated products account for about 10% of all imports into the U.S., arriving from more than 300,000 facilities in 150 different countries....
Just a decade ago, 6 million shipments of FDA-regulated goods passed through the nation's 300 ports of entry. This year the number will quadruple to 24 million shipments. Each year over the last seven years, food imports have grown by an average of 10%, while imports of pharmaceutical products have increased at nearly 13% and devices have grown at over 10%. Between 2007 and 2015, it is estimated that imports of FDA-regulated products will triple, corresponding to a 15% growth rate.
You can be sure the agency's budget is not on a similar trajctory. This means that new approaches to ensuring product safety will be vital, and -- as the agency notes -- more sharing of information has to be step one. 
Here's one set of steps that are being pursued: 
1) FDA, in close partnership with its foreign counterparts, will assemble global coalitions of regulators dedicated to building and strengthening the product safety net around the world.
2) With these coalitions, FDA intends to develop a global data information system and network in which regulators worldwide can regularly and proactively share real-time information and resources across markets.
3) FDA will continue to expand its capabilities in intelligence gathering and use, with an increased focus on risk analytics and thoroughly modernized IT capabilities.
4) FDA will effectively allocate agency resources based on risk, leveraging the combined efforts of government, industry and public- and private-sector third parties.
To make progress on this list, the agency plans to assemble a worldwide coalition of regulatory agencies.

HEADLINE: Bonus Cuts, Pay Raises, Then Layoffs

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Wall Street's new pay structure is now having an unintended consequence.

 BODY:
It's hardly surprising that Wall Street is bracing for layoffs. The European debt crisis is rocking the markets. New regulations are crimping bank profit centers. And smaller bonuses are sending other compensation costs soaring.
Scratching your head about that last one? 
In a nod to the fury and outrage from the financial crisis, Wall Street firms tempered their annual bonuses to employees last year, seemingly as a way to rein in pay. And the bonuses were largely paid in stock, aligning compensation more closely with the company's performance. 
But Wall Street did not necessarily cut the overall pay packages. The dirty little secret is that to make up for the lower bonuses, many firms simply raised the base salaries. The move has been described by some government officials as a "sleight of hand."
The new pay structure is now having an unintended consequence: It is perverting Wall Street's calculus during periods of weakness.
In the past, banks could cut variable costs like bonuses when profits slipped, rather than handing out pink slips en masse.
Now, fixed costs like salaries make up a higher portion of their expenses. So layoffs are starting to look more attractive.
 "An obvious short-term consequence of increasing base salaries on Wall Street is to weaken the pay-performance link -- which, in turn, makes it more likely that banks will fire low-performing employees rather than simply reducing their bonuses," said Robert J. Jackson Jr., who served after the financial crisis as a deputy to the Treasury Department's pay czar, Kenneth R. Feinberg.
 It remains to be seen how deeply Wall Street will have to cut. Kian Abouhossein, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Cazenove in London, says the layoffs could be painful, given the enormous fixed costs the firms face.
Mr. Abouhossein analyzed the major banks in Switzerland, which has stricter disclosure requirements than the United States but may be a good proxy for the rest of Wall Street. His research, which has been getting a lot of attention among Wall Street's higher-ups, found that 81 percent of Credit Suisse's compensation expenses are now fixed, compared with 66 percent in 2009. At UBS, they rose to 63 percent in 2010 from 55 percent.
 "Increasing fixed costs increases pressure on the cost base and offers a limited cushion in the form of variable cost to absorb the impact of revenue downturns," he wrote in a note to investors. The next downturn, he explained, "is likely to lead to material staff cuts."
Last week, my colleague Susanne Craig reported that Goldman Sachs was "certain" to reduce head count this year. She reported that in January, Barclays Capital cut 600 people, or more than 2 percent of its global staff, and she wrote that Morgan Stanley planned to cut at least 300 low-producing brokers in its wealth management division this year.
All of that may sound like small potatoes. But Wall Street is facing a new reality that it has yet to come to grips with. "Return on equity," perhaps the best metric for considering the health of the Wall Street, fell to 8.2 percent in 2010, according to Nomura. That is down from 17.5 percent in 2005, before the crisis.
By comparison, total compensation has hardly fallen at all. At Goldman Sachs, for example, compensation and benefit expenses fell 5 percent in the first quarter. Net revenue, however, fell 7 percent during the same period. In the firm's largest division, which includes fixed-income trading, net revenue fell 28 percent. And its annualized return on equity fell to 12.2 percent from 20.1 percent in the period a year earlier.
Alan Johnson, a pay consultant, who is still bullish on the employment market among banks, said salaries had risen 40 to 60 percent. Nevertheless, he said, "What's really happened is you've traded your salary going up by $100,000 for your bonus going down $100,000."
It is tough to find the right mix between bonus and salary. If banks got rid of bonuses altogether, they would lose the link between pay and performance.
Mr. Jackson, the former deputy pay czar, said he and Mr. Feinberg worried about this issue when they set pay limits under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Banks have used these compensation limits as a model, albeit less than many people wanted.
"At Treasury, we anticipated that banks would seek to raise salaries in response to new rules on pay," Mr. Jackson said. "That's why Ken Feinberg's rulings imposed a $500,000 cap on base salaries for most employees at the firms that received the most TARP help."
Others wanted higher salary caps and lower bonuses. But Mr. Jackson and Mr. Feinberg figured that bankers needed compensation to be tied at least in part to the overall health of the company.
Mr. Abouhossein suggests far direr consequences: "We see higher base salaries helping underperformers in a downturn at the expense of top performers, which could result in the best people leaving the industry in a downturn."
That could be a bit of a stretch -- and a bit self-serving for the industry. Some academics and Washington officials whom I spoke with said that any suggestion that lowering bonuses would cause layoffs was a ploy by Wall Street banks to roll back their compensation changes.
Lucian A. Bebchuk, the director of the Program on Corporate Governance at Harvard Law School, said he was not convinced that raising salaries was the problem at all. 
"Look, it makes things less flexible, but not in a bad way," he said. To Mr. Bebchuk, the larger problem is that overall compensation has not come down. "I'm surprised it hasn't come down more."

HEADLINE: Investing Should Be Dull

BYLINE: CARL RICHARDS


HIGHLIGHT: Were you tempted by the Pandora I.P.O.? Perhaps you ought to think harder about why you are investing.

 BODY:
Carl Richards is a certified financial planner in Park City, Utah. His sketches are archived here on the Bucks blog and on his personal Web site, BehaviorGap.com.
The last few weeks, we've seen multiple headlines about initial public offerings. Chatter around LinkedIn, Groupon, Pandora and even Facebook has made people excited about the potential of getting in at the beginning of what might be the next Google.
At the same time there's been debate about whether we're in another tech bubble. But it seems to me that everyone is skipping over the biggest question that tripped us up the last time I.P.O.'s were on everybody's mind: what's the actual value of the investment?
Let's be clear from the beginning: real investing is about understanding the value of your investment. And frankly, sorting that out is about as much fun as watching grass grow.
Doing that work is not sexy, and it doesn't generate big headlines. It's much more fun to stand around at the neighborhood barbeque and talk about what everyone else is talking about, which happens to be I.P.O.'s right now.
But they can be tricky. Much of what helps you determine the value of an investment is history. And while every company has to file a report with the Securities and Exchange Commission before going public, wading through that report can be time consuming.
I often joke that the only way to get people to read the reports that companies produce is to print them and stick them in envelopes marked "Top Secret." But instead of taking the time to read the report, people often jump on an I.P.O. because everyone else is doing it.
But come on now. Really? We used that excuse as children. If you end up buying any investment, let alone an I.P.O., just because your neighbor or friend happens to, you're assuming that at some point you'll find a bigger fool who also hasn't done the math yet.
Failing to do the math trips up even the most enthusiastic investor. Just look at what happened to Pandora last week. Now, Pandora may ultimately prove to be a great investment, but here are just a few things that may have contributed to Pandora's not so positive I.P.O. results: Pandora loses money on every transaction Pandora has no assurance that it can negotiate better terms when its current music royalties agreement expires in 2015 Pandora's revenue growth is slowingUnderstanding how issues like these affect the value of your potential investment is critical. But we have a bad habit of pretending that we're investing when in reality we're speculating. Remember: investing is about value, while speculating is about price. Pandora did come out strong price-wise, but by the second day of trading, its stock price had dropped below the initial public offering price.
While Pandora is just the most recent example of what can happen if you choose to skip the details, it won't be the last, nor is the risk limited to I.P.O.'s.
So are you prepared to gamble on whether someone will be a bigger fool after you and buy the investment you didn't check out carefully? It's much better to be bored than it is to be broke. The next time you feel the urge to invest, think long and hard, and ask yourself if the math adds up.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds a Shift Toward More Libertarian Views

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: On both the economic and social fronts, more people are telling pollsters that they think government should do less.

 BODY:
Libertarianism has been touted as the wave of America's political future for many years, generally with more enthusiasm than evidence. But there are some tangible signs that Americans' attitudes are in fact moving in that direction.
Since 1993, CNN has regularly asked a pair of questions that touch on libertarian views of the economy and society:
Some people think the government is trying to do too many things that should be left to individuals and businesses. Others think that government should do more to solve our country's problems. Which comes closer to your own view?
Some people think the government should promote traditional values in our society. Others think the government should not favor any particular set of values. Which comes closer to your own view?
A libertarian, someone who believes that the government is best when it governs least, would typically answer yes to the first and no to the second.
In the polls, the responses to both questions had been fairly steady for many years. The economic question has showed little long-term trend, although tolerance for governmental intervention rose following the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The social libertarian viewpoint - that government should not favor any particular set of values - has gained a couple of percentage points since the 1990s but not more than that. 
But in CNN's latest version of the poll, conducted earlier this month, the libertarian response to both questions reached all-time highs. Some 63 percent of respondents said government was doing too much - up from 61 percent in 2010 and 52 percent in 2008 - while 50 percent said government should not favor any particular set of values, up from 44 percent in 2010 and 41 percent in 2008. (It was the first time that answer won a plurality in CNN's poll.)
Whether people are as libertarian-minded in practice as they might believe themselves to be when they answer survey questions is another matter. Still, there have been visible shifts in public opinion on a number of issues, ranging from increasing tolerance for same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization on the one hand, to the skepticism over stimulus packages and the health-care overhaul on the other hand, that can be interpreted as a move toward more libertarian views.
The Tea Party movement also has some lineage in libertarian thinking. Although polls suggest that many people who participate in the Tea Party movement have quite socially conservative views, the movement spends little time emphasizing those positions, as compared with economic issues.

HEADLINE: Documentaries Delve Into the Sushi Economy

BYLINE: DAVID JOLLY


HIGHLIGHT: Two filmmakers set out separately to explore the rise in sushi's international popularity, then found themselves focusing on the environmental implications of overfishing.

 BODY:
In the greater Paris region, where I live and work, there are more than 1,600 sushi restaurants. They are springing up faster than can be counted in Eastern Europe, India and China, not to mention Los Angeles and New York.
Yet the authenticity of many of them is dubious. Some were transformed from cheap Chinese restaurants to cheap Japanese restaurants with the aid of kits and machines provided by helpful industry vendors; others belong to the growing number of fast-food-style sushi franchises. All are in the business of selling fish and vinegared rice.
Mark S. Hall, director of "Sushi: The Global Catch," winner of a special jury prize this month at the Seattle International Film Festival, first sampled sushi as a student in Tokyo in the 1980s, but he did not get to thinking about the sushi economy until a few years ago.
"I was working in Warsaw as part of a cooperative that was building a pretty interesting organic agriculture business," Mr. Hall said in a telephone interview from Austin, Tex., where he lives today. "We were at a meeting, and when we broke for lunch I assumed we'd go for bigos [a kind of cabbage stew] or sausages. Instead we went for sushi. I got to wondering how, in a culture where they hadn't known it even a few years before, it had gotten so popular. And it wasn't the same, it really wasn't anything like the experience I'd had in Tokyo. It just floored me."Mr. Hall's documentary starts by tracing sushi's traditions, focusing on Mamoru Sugiyama, chef at Sushiko in Tokyo, a Michelin-starred restaurant that dates back to the 19th century. We learn that in Japan, budding sushi chefs must go through a long apprenticeship to become masters, enduring the drudgery of washing dishes, preparing rice and cutting vegetables before they even begin to start cutting fish. Only in the fifth year do they begin slicing fish in earnest. 
In their seventh year, the apprentices graduate to serving and conversing with customers. That's the same length of time it takes to both earn a bachelor's degree and graduate from medical school. With qualifications like these, sushi might have stayed in Japan.
The turning point, according to a French television documentary released last year -- "World Sushi: Dead Oceans Ahead" -- was the rise of California sushi, and in particular the phenomenal career of the celebrity chef Nobuyuki Matsuhisa. Mr. Matsuhisa was born in Saitama Prefecture in Japan and opened his breakthrough Beverly Hills restaurant in 1987, and sushi quickly acquired a certain chic. He went on to build a Nobu empire that stretches from the West Coast to New York, Melbourne, London, Hong Kong, Mykonos and Milan. 
America rose quickly to the challenge of democratizing sushi, managing to condense those seven years of training to three months or even less, as Trevor Corson notes in "The Story of Sushi."
Both documentaries offer a penetrating introduction to the workings of the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, the world's largest, as well as the growing "local" character of sushi in the West. In my particular favorite example from Mr. Hall's documentary, a Japanese sushi chef in Texas makes ''Longhorn rolls'' with rib-eye steak, cream cheese and avocado, served with a green sauce made of cilantro and jalapeno.
Of course, that's only half the story, the other half being the overfishing that has proved so devastating to many species of fish. Both documentaries shift abruptly from the sushi tale to the conservation story, with the narrative alternating between those who are hoping that informed consumers can help to rescue the seas by eating only "sustainable" sushi, and those who believe in untrammeled fishing regardless of the costs. 
"I thought it was very important that people understood the unintended consequences that globalization was having on endangered fish," Mr. Hall said. 
Sushi demand is hardly the only reason for the decline of fish populations, but it is a critical element in the case of some. The bluefin tuna, currently the subject of perhaps the highest-profile conservation campaign undertaken for any fish, is the primary example. While pretty much everyone agrees that the bluefin, the most valuable fish in the sea, is endangered, not everyone agrees that it requires official protection. 
One of the most telling moments in the French documentary comes as the crew follows Mr. Matsuhisa to a fish market and asks him about the ethics of serving bluefin in his restaurants.
"Nobody knows about 50 years later," he replies. "I buy the fish from the fish company, the fish company has a license to buy the tuna. Then why does Greenpeace attack us?" Then he suggests a change in subject.
Sushi's rise to globalism has attracted a lot of attention in recent years, notably from the American journalist Sasha Issenberg, in his book "The Sushi Economy," and from Theodore C. Bestor, a Harvard anthropologist and the author of "Global Sushi: Soft Power and Hard Realities." The new documentaries are both useful additions to the literature. 
Like "The End of the Line," , a 2009 documentary by the investigative reporter Charles Clover, "World Sushi: Dead Oceans Ahead (whose original French subtitle read "Tomorrow, Our Children Will Eat Jellyfish") is an excellent primer on the problems caused by overfishing. It looks at the workings of the international fish trade through a wide geographical lens, including fishermen and markets in Japan, the Mediterranean, Senegal, Peru and the United States. 
First screened in Europe at 90 minutes on Canal Plus television in February 2010, the documentary shrank to just 56 minutes in its international English-language version. ''That was a decision of the agency," Jean-Pierre Canet, one of the directors, told me."Maybe the Americans and the Norwegians don't have the attention span for a longer one.''
Interestingly, both Mr. Hall and Mr. Canet said that when they began their projects, they planned to focus on sushi and its rise to world food status, but then found that the environmental issues turned out to be the more important story.
'Instead of the original project I'd imagined on the tradition and consumption of sushi with a little discussion of the environmental issues, I realized I had it backwards. So I refocused on the environmental issues, with overfishing being the most urgent topic,'' Mr. Canet said.
''I like sushi -- I'm not the Taliban," he said. "But we have to do it a lot more intelligently than we are currently. We have to change the mindset that sees wild fish as a commodity like wheat or corn. It's impossible to imagine that the system we have now can continue.''
Mr. Hall noted that the prospects for some fish, especially those at the top of the food chain, do not appear to be good. He said he hoped that consumer education would help. 
"I'm probably more optimistic than I should be," he said. "Maybe that means I'm naive. But I think doing something is better than doing nothing."

HEADLINE: A Tech Entrepreneur's Plan for Grilled-Cheese Sandwiches

BYLINE: CLAIRE CAIN MILLER


HIGHLIGHT: The creator of the Flip video camera says his new grilled-cheese sandwich chain is a logical choice for technology investors.

 BODY:
Jonathan Kaplan, who created the Flip video camera and sold it to Cisco Systems for $590 million, surprised a lot of people when he announced that his next start-up, the Melt, would make grilled-cheese sandwiches. 
Also surprising: Sequoia Capital, known for investing in tech companies like Google and Pure Digital, which made the Flip, financed the Melt, leading some technology analysts to wonder whether this was the latest sign of a bubble in tech investing. 
To be sure, the Melt is a tech company in addition to being a restaurant. Customers will order sandwiches and soup from their mobile phones, and chefs will start cooking when customers scan an image called a Q.R. code in a restaurant with their phones or approach a restaurant, so people will not have to wait in line. 
But since Mr. Kaplan clearly knows how to build and make a lot of money on technology, why not just create the software and sell it to restaurants? Why make grilled-cheese sandwiches and open stores, too? 
"Because grilled cheese makes people happy," Mr. Kaplan said. "Software technology that I sell to Burger King doesn't make anyone happy except the I.T. guy. What fun is that?" 
The Melt will open five stores in San Francisco and Palo Alto starting in August, and Mr. Kaplan plans to open 50 nationwide next year and 500 in five years. The company's Web site promises that the Melt will "pinch the bread to form air pockets for the cheese to melt into," and finish sandwiches with a dusting of parmesan - not Sequoia's usual area of expertise. 
"Today you'd probably say, 'Why would a venture firm invest in a restaurant business? That doesn't make any sense,'" Mr. Kaplan said. "But just go to Chipotle and look at its market cap." (It's $8.6 billion, in case you were wondering.) 
Venture capitalists have invested in mass-market restaurant chains before - like Starbucks, Pinkberry and P.F. Chang's China Bistro. 
"I wouldn't judge anybody for building a retail business that has a chance for a national footprint," said Mark Suster, managing director of GRP Partners, a venture firm that invested in Starbucks and P.F. Chang's. "It can be a very good business." 
Mr. Kaplan declined to say how much the Melt had raised in venture capital, but said it raised enough to open 20 stores at a cost of between $500,000 and $1 million each. 
While some are wary of the bubble-iciousness of the Valley's more offbeat start-ups, Mr. Kaplan says he is actually playing it safe. He financed the Melt himself at first, to prove that the idea was workable, before asking venture capitalists for money. 
He also staffed his board with people who know a thing or two about food and retail. In addition to Michael Moritz of Sequoia and Bruce Dunlevie of Benchmark Capital, the Melt's directors are the chef Michael Mina and Ron Johnson, who has been in charge of Apple's retail stores and was just named chief executive of J.C. Penney. 
The Melt will also let customers round up purchases to the next dollar - a soup and sandwich will probably cost $7.95 - and donate the extra proceeds to hunger-fighting charities, Mr. Kaplan said. 
The idea is not actually so different from the Flip camera, he said. 
"Of course there are high-end grilled cheese restaurants just like there were high-end camcorders, and of course there are cheap ones, but there was no product that could capture the hearts and minds the way the Flip did, and the Melt is going to be the same," Mr. Kaplan said.

HEADLINE: Will Business Buy In to Early Childhood Education?

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: With so much evidence that investing in early childhood education pays huge dividends, an economist asks, why is business reluctant to support it more forcefully?

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
Economists disagree about a lot of things, but many agree that public investments in early childhood education pay off. The social benefits far exceed the social costs.
A recently released study of 1,000 poor children who benefited from Chicago's Child-Parent Center Education Program (which includes intensive preschool, parent training and support for students through third grade), suggests that every dollar spent on the program yielded nearly $11 to society, including increased tax revenue and reduced spending on child welfare, special education and grade retention.
Many other detailed cost-benefit analyses, ably summarized in Timothy Bartik's new book, "Investing in Kids," document a high social rate of return, with the potential to encourage local economic development as well as improve productive skills.Enthusiasm crosses the political spectrum. James Heckman of the University of Chicago, a Nobel laureate who is hardly a big advocate of government spending, is famously insistent on the benefits of early childhood education. Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is another strong supporter.
Last year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce published a report, "Why Business Should Support Early-Childhood Education," that includes a summary of efforts by some chamber groups to promote early childhood education on the state and local level.
Such efforts go beyond charitable giving and on-site learning centers for employees with children to strong political commitments to expand our educational system significantly. 
Public support could take many different forms, including the voucher-based systems advocated by two Federal Reserve economists, Arthur J. Rolnick and Rob Grunewald.
Why, then, hasn't the business community thrown more of its political weight behind increased public support for early childhood education?
In the push to cut all social spending, both federal and state programs have gone on the chopping block. Republicans in the House of Representatives have mounted a major effort to reduce Head Start, Early Head Start and the Child Care Development Block Grant, as well as many other programs directed at young children.
State preschool spending per child declined last year to a level below that of 2001-2 and is likely to decline further as federal stimulus money peters out.
None of the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination has expressed intereste in the issue. As governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney vetoed a bill that would have required the state to develop prekindergarten education programs for every child 2 to 4.
While many Democrats staunchly defend the principle of early childhood education, their willingness to fight for it has been dissipated by deficit anxieties.
Maybe information about the payoff on investments in early childhood education just hasn't sunk in. Maybe appreciation of the benefits requires a longer time horizon than most politicians or business leaders can reach for.
Or perhaps those in the best position to pay the costs are not interested in the benefits. Broader global horizons make businesses less dependent on the labor force in the United States than they have been in the past. A growing number of businesses have the potential to take their operations elsewhere to find the skilled labor they need at the price they want to pay.
Businesses that rely on American workers are not facing labor shortages. They see a large reserve army of the unemployed, especially among workers in their 20s.
So why should businesses invest in early childhood education when there are more direct ways to reduce public spending related to crime, child welfare and education? Budget cuts across the board can shift costs back to low-income families and communities in the form of reduced opportunities and lower living standards.
In economic terminology, incentives are misaligned.
While the social rate of return on public investments in children is high for taxpayers, businesses may not be able to capture a significant share of that return. They may be tempted by more profitable investments -- contributions to candidates and elected officials whose top priority is to lower the cost of doing business. 
On the other hand, many business owners are citizens and taxpayers who care about the well-being of the next generation. Those are the ones who will buy in to early childhood education. They had better do it soon.

HEADLINE: Big Banks Lose Ruling On Research

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The appeals court decision in support of theflyonthewall.com was a victory for Internet companies, but media companies also cheered.

 BODY:
A federal appeals court ruled on Monday that investment banks could not stop a financial Web site from immediately publishing the research recommendations of their stock analysts, delivering a blow to Wall Street and a win for the investing public.
Perhaps more significant, the decision was a victory for Internet companies whose business models depend upon summarizing and commenting on others' original content. Yet media businesses also cheered the ruling because it left in place legal protections against rogue competitors who copy and resell original news reporting at little or no cost.
"It's a great decision for the free flow of information in the new media age," said Kathleen M. Sullivan, a lawyer who filed a brief in the case on behalf of two clients, Google and Twitter.
In a lawsuit closely followed by the world's largest financial, media and technology businesses, a panel of three judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan ruled that Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America could not dictate who reported news about their stock research - nor when they reported it.
The decision leaves in place all traditional federal copyright protections. For example, a site can report on the content of Wall Street research, meaning that it could run a headline like "Morgan Stanley's semiconductor analyst upgrades Intel." But the site would violate copyright law if it reprinted the analyst's report on Intel verbatim.
"A firm's ability to make news - by issuing a recommendation that is likely to affect the market price of a security - does not give rise to a right for it to control who breaks that news and how," Judge Robert D. Sack wrote in the court's 88-page opinion.
The ruling reversed a controversial lower court decision made last year that required a financial Web site, theflyonthewall.com, to wait until 10 a.m. to publish news about Wall Street research that had been issued before the stock market's 9:30 a.m. opening bell. The site was also ordered to delay its headlines during the day by two hours.
The ruling effectively gave the banks' clients a chance to digest market-moving research before everyone else.
The banks had argued that the Web site's publishing headlines about a bank's upgrade or downgrade of a company's stock - often before the information was fully disseminated to the banks' clients - was tantamount to stealing intellectual property. They contended that delivering stock recommendations exclusively was key to their business because clients were more likely to trade with them if they learned of a stock recommendation from them rather than elsewhere.
Benjamin E. Marks, a lawyer for the banks, said in a statement that they were "disappointed in the court's decision, and we are reviewing the decision to determine our next steps." He added: "Each of the plaintiffs remains committed to protecting their equity research against unauthorized appropriation."
The banks' lawsuit against theflyonthewall.com was based on a legal doctrine called "hot news misappropriation," which is meant to protect organizations from stealing original content generated by competitors and reselling it. The original "hot news" doctrine evolved from a famous Supreme Court case in 1918, when The Associated Press successfully prevented the International News Service from appropriating its wire reports on the war in Europe.
With the rise of the Internet and digital media, the largely dormant "hot news" doctrine has become more relevant, as competitors can now copy content and repackage it as their own product with just a few keystrokes.
While the Second Circuit upheld the viability of a "hot news" claim - where one organization copies and resells news originally gathered by another - it said that the banks' case did not fall within this law. In this instance, the court said, the Web site was not "free-riding" on Wall Street firms' stock recommendations.
"The firms are making the news; Fly, despite the firms' understandable desire to protect their business model, is breaking it," Judge Sack wrote.
Corynne McSherry, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet freedom advocacy group, said that while the ruling preserves the protections of the "hot news" doctrine, it seems to limit its use.
"While it may have survived this case, it now appears to have been narrowed to within an inch of its life," Ms. McSherry said.
Media outlets applauded the ruling. The Associated Press, which submitted a brief to the court along with 13 other news organizations, including The New York Times, said in a statement that it viewed the decision "as a victory for the news media and the public."
"The ruling upholds the traditional protections of the news media against competitors who would copy the gathered news and resell it in direct competition with the original news gatherer," Andrew L. Deutsch, a lawyer who filed the brief on behalf of the companies. "It preserves the economic incentive to engage in news gathering."
Lawyers for Google and Twitter had argued that it was antiquated for a court to ban a Web site from immediately disseminating news. A Web site's swift republishing of facts - whether a bank's investment recommendation or a scoop from The New York Times - has become a firmly entrenched part of the news reporting ecosystem, they said.
"This ruling acknowledges the reality of new media," said Ms. Sullivan, the lawyer for the Internet companies. "Hot news goes cold in a nanosecond."
Theflyonthewall.com, a small outfit in Summit, N.J., has exploited this new reality. The site, which charges $65 a month and has thousands of subscribers, has called itself the "fastest news feed on the web" and "a one-stop solution for accessing analyst's comments." In a statement, the company called the ruling "a complete victory in its long-running battle with the investment firms."
Even though the ruling directly affects cases only in the Second Circuit - New York, Connecticut and Vermont - the decision by the influential court is expected to reverberate in cases across the country.
Judge Sack is considered one of the country's leading experts on copyright law, which could enhance the ruling's influence.

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
Today's Times The House is likely to vote on a measure this week that would limit financing for the American military efforts in Libya, taking advantage of the chamber's appropriations powers to push back against the White House, Jennifer Steinhauer of The Times reports. The question of financing the operations gained urgency over the weekend after it was revealed that President Obama had rejected the views of top lawyers at the Pentagon and Justice Department in deciding that he had the legal authority to continue American participation in the NATO-led air strikes in Libya without Congressional authorization. In April, Jon M. Huntsman Jr. resigned from his post as President Obama's ambassador to China. On Tuesday he will announce his next step - running for president. His decision to start a campaign intended to unseat Mr. Obama presents a rare moment in American history: a member of a presidential administration deciding to run against his boss, Jim Rutenberg of The Times reports. Mr. Huntsman's campaign has prompted a mix of suspicion and resignation in the White House, with one presidential strategist saying, "there's no loyalty in politics," especially when it comes to across-the-aisle alliances. 
 Senators have long exercised their ability to derail presidential nominations. But the current crop of Senate Republicans has embraced a strategy of blocking nominees that differs in at least one respect: they are opposing not a particular nominee, but rather any nominee to a post affecting prominent economic issues like housing, finance, foreign trade and offshore drilling, Binyamin Appelbaum of The Times reports. The list of vacancies in senior economic and regulatory positions has lengthened to a dozen since November.Around the Web Mr. Huntsman is facing new political risks because of his connection to the Huntsman Corporation, a chemical company founded by his father that sold polyurethane to Iran, Politico reports. The chemical could be used to power missiles for the country. 
Happenings Around Washington The secretary of education, Arne Duncan, is to award medals to high school seniors from across the nation for making the grades to qualify as United States Presidential Scholars.

HEADLINE: Congressional Week Ahead: Budget Talks Heat Up

BYLINE: CARL HULSE


HIGHLIGHT: Congressional budget talks with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. enter a critical phase this week with four meetings planned as the Fourth of July recess looms.

 BODY:
Congressional budget talks with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. enter a critical phase this week with four meetings planned as the Fourth of July recess looms.
Lawmakers participating in the talks and Mr. Biden said last week that they were preparing for some of the tough decisions on major tradeoffs, with no guarantee that Republicans and Democrats could come to terms on changes in entitlement programs and calls for new revenue.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, weighed in Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation," saying that if Congress and the White House cannot reach a major deal, there might be no deal for the time being. 
"Everybody knows you have to tackle entitlement reform," Mr. McConnell said. "If we can't do that, then we'll probably end up with a very short term proposal over, you know, a few months and we'll be back having the same discussion again in the fall."
While the debt talks proceed, Congress will be moving ahead with some other business.
The Senate on Tuesday is set to vote to confirm C.I.A. director Leon Panetta, a former congressman and White House official, as the new secretary of defense. With an economic measure now on the floor expected to stall, the Senate is planning to turn to a bill that would eliminate Senate confirmation requirements for about 200 mid-level executive branch nominees as a way to speed the appointment process.
In the House, lawmakers are scheduled to consider a patent law overhaul as well as the spending bill for the Pentagon.

HEADLINE: Best Political Quotes of the Weekend

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The Caucus has compiled some of the best political quotes of the weekend.

 BODY:
Was your weekend too busy for paying attention to politics? No worries. The Caucus has compiled some of the best political quotes for you.
1. Rick Perry, the Republican governor of Texas, delivered a rousing and passionate address that would have qualified as a stump speech if he had decided to run for president this year. But Mr. Perry and his top aides say he has not made that decision -- yet. "Our opponents on the left are never going to like us, so let's stop trying to curry favor with them," he said at a gathering of Republicans in New Orleans. "Let's speak with pride about our values. Let's stop this American downward spiral." If Mr. Perry runs for president, he would aim to capture the votes of social conservatives, as his speech suggested. "We need to stop apologizing for celebrating life," he said.
2. Is Jon Huntsman, the former Republican governor of Utah, conservative enough to win his party's presidential nomination? David Axelrod, a senior political adviser to President Obama, recalled on Sunday that Mr. Huntsman had praised Mr. Obama's efforts in 2009. "He was encouraging on health care. He was encouraging on the whole range of issues," Mr. Axelrod said on CNN's "State of the Union" program. "He was a little quizzical about what was going on in his own party. And you got the strong sense that he was going to wait until 2016 for the storm to blow over." A spokesman for Mr. Huntsman called that recollection of the conversation "absurd." 
3. Mr. Obama used his weekly radio address to offer thoughts about the challenges of being a father. He urged fathers to spend more time with their children, saying that even as president he's made an effort to do the same. "Recently, I took on a second job: assistant coach for Sasha's basketball team," he said. "I was so proud watching her run up and down the court, seeing her learn and improve and gain confidence. And I was hopeful that in the years to come, she'd look back on experiences like these as the ones that helped define her as a person - and as a parent herself." 
4. In the "strange bedfellows" category, Mr. Obama's position on the War Powers Resolution is supported by some staunch Republicans and opposed by the leaders of his party. Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said Congress does not need to provide permission for the military operation in Libya. "The War Powers Act is unconstitutional, not worth the paper it's written on," Mr. Graham said. "The president has done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in Libya. But I will be no part of an effort to de-fund Libya or try to cut off our efforts to bring Gadhafi down." Meanwhile, on the same program, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, took the opposite position: "It's true, the War Powers Act is an infringement on the president's power as commander-in-chief. So is the Constitution, which makes it clear the American people make decisions about going to war through members of Congress."
5. Speaking on ABC's "This Week" program, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, criticized the Republican presidential contenders for suggesting a pullout of troops from Afghanistan and other military interventions. "This is isolationism," he said. "There's always been an isolation strain -- isolation strain in the Republican Party, the Pat Buchanan wing of our party. But now it seems to have moved more center stage, so to speak." Asked what former president Ronald Reagan would have thought about the comments, Mr. McCain said that "He would be saying that's not the Republican Party of the 20th century and now the 21st century. That is not the Republican Party that has been willing to stand up for freedom for people for all over the world."
6. Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, used her speech to the Republican Leadership Conference in New Orleans to detail Mr. Obama's failings. "He is failing the Hispanic community. He's failing the African-American community. He's failing all of us," she said. She said Mr. Obama's administration is leading the country to "a double-dip recession."
7. Jon Stewart, the host of Comedy Central's "The Daily Show," made a confrontational appearance on Fox News Sunday, arguing with host Chris Wallace about bias in the news industry. Mr. Wallace asked why Mr. Stewart does not accuse other news organizations of a liberal bias. "Because I think their bias is towards sensationalism and laziness. I wouldn't say it's towards a liberal agenda. It's light fluff," Mr. Stewart said. "Here is the difference between you and I -- I'm a comedian first. My comedy is informed by an ideological background. There's no question about that." He went on: "The thing that in some respect conservative activists will never understand is that Hollywood, yes, they're liberal. But that's not their primary motivating force. I'm not an activist. I'm a comedian."

HEADLINE: Levees Save a Farmhouse, But Farming Is Still a Risk

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
YAZOO CITY, Miss. -- Sitting on a boat, in a driveway on dry ground in the middle of a flood, a man can get to thinking about his place in the world.
That is where Todd Hart found himself on muggy nights this spring, a sentinel on a brand-new island. His was an island in negative, a patch of low-lying ground protected from a surrounding sea of floodwaters by 2,200 feet of packed-dirt levees.
It was part of an archipelago of private levees that he, his father and a handful of others created in a matter of days, an elaborate effort to save the Harts' place in the Delta.
In some ways, that place had been eroding long before the flood arrived. Todd's father, Irma Newell Hart, had grown disillusioned with farming, how the demanding but largely elemental practices he had inherited had given way to a modern, highly technical business. A few years ago, the elder Mr. Hart walked away from it for good, abandoning a livelihood that had been in the family for generations and that had been the reason his father came to this spot 65 years earlier. 
But the Harts were not prepared to abandon the spot itself.
''He used to tell me,'' Todd said of his father, ''that his goal in life was not to lose it all.''
The Harts are just starting to tear their levees down.
The great flood of 2011 is still slowly receding from the Mississippi Delta, sitting stubbornly in some areas, leaving behind in others thousands of damaged homes and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ruined crops. For farmers, who were expecting a banner year, it is closer to a nightmare.
''The two things that make or break us are the whims of a financial market and weather,'' said John Michael Pillow, 41, who farms the land that borders the Harts, and who lost three-quarters of his corn crop this year, his first as sole owner of the family farm. ''You can't get any riskier.''
Much of farming is a matter of risk management. Mr. Pillow and many other farmers would go under completely in a year like this were it not for the sophisticated tools that have been devised to reduce risk.
But some of these tools -- insurance policies, government programs, high-tech farm equipment, genetically modified crops from the biotech giant Monsanto -- are part of what led the elder Mr. Hart, 62, to quit farming a dozen years ago.
''My dad taught me you put the seed in the ground then put your faith in the Lord,'' he said. ''Where am I putting my faith now? I'm putting my faith in Uncle Sam, in the insurance companies, in Monsanto.''
Todd Hart, 32 and about to be married, is now considering whether to take up that calling himself. The 200 acres of soybeans he now farms, and which are still mostly underwater, are not nearly enough to be profitable in the modern business of farming. His accountant put it starkly. ''Get big,'' he said, ''or get out.''
Among the worst-flooded areas in Mississippi was a large area of farmland just west of Yazoo City. Here the levee system was simply unfinished, and backwater from the Yazoo River spilled out unobstructed, forming a vast brown lake in a matter of days.
The Harts' island sat in the middle of this lake. Inside the six-foot-high levees stood the family farmhouse where father and son were raised, the office from which the elder Mr. Hart ran the farm, the plot where his childhood pony is buried, the workshop that Todd wants to turn into a recording studio, the garden tended by his stepmother, the grass lawn that Todd kept mowed during the flood.
The decision to put it all behind levees was made on the fly.
On April 24, on an Easter Sunday afternoon trip to Lowe's hardware store, the elder Mr. Hart got a call. It was a friend of his who happened to be a hunting buddy with a man from the Army Corps of Engineers, and he had news: a flood was coming.
Over the next week Mr. Hart worked his sources, and with each call it seemed the predictions worsened. At first, his worry was the house in the nearby hamlet of Satartia, a house that his grandfather built in 1918 and where his son was planning to move with his new wife after their wedding on July 30.
But by the end of the week it was all at risk: the house in Satartia, the family farmhouse and the cottage a few dozen yards away where Todd Hart lives now. It was impossible to know the better, and cheaper, option: to let the floods come and clean up afterward or do something radical like building levees. The elder Mr. Hart opted for the latter.
Building your own levees is expensive, but so is letting the waters come in and cleaning up afterward. Mr. Hart figured that only one of these options meant relying on insurance policies, adjusters and paperwork. For a man who describes himself as having ''an authority problem,'' this was not a hard decision.
''It wasn't no smarts in it,'' Mr. Hart said.
Mr. Hart picked up farming at the age of 22, clearing some land on his father's 2,500 acres to plant cotton alongside the existing cow pastures. He was good at it and even expanded, briefly, leasing an additional 2,500 acres.
But starting in the mid-1990s, things went sour. World cotton prices began a long steady decline. A 1995 bollworm outbreak brought ruin.
Mr. Hart was stung by the run of bad luck, but he was also turned off by the newer ways farmers were coping with the old vagaries.
The federal government's generous cotton subsidies not only buoyed many farms in a bad market but also, in Mr. Hart's opinion, seemed to blatantly defy the law of supply and demand. Family farms became legal partnerships to take advantage of the subsidy regulations, and expanded by buying up or leasing the farms of those who, like Mr. Hart, left.
These legal tactics, along with the insurance policies, the new varieties of crops and the satellite-guided tractors, were designed to smooth the sharp edges of a profoundly variable occupation.
But for Mr. Hart they only seemed to make things worse. The margins for mere economic survival were tightening as the necessary spectrum of expertise was growing. Little of this expertise appeared to have much to do with the farming Mr. Hart had learned as a young man.
''When I started putting my numbers together,'' he said, ''I was checking with my insurance man and my lawyer and my accountant and the farm services man before I ever figured out what it was going to cost me to plant a seed. You're doing something that's not farming. It's a business.''
In 1999, he quit. He sold most of the equipment and let his employees go. He leased his land to a couple of farmers, who still farm it today. Both have law degrees.
But he held on to his farmhouse.
That is where Todd Hart, in between trips to Starkville, Miss., for wedding photos, kept his vigil this spring. In the mornings, he paced off the levees, looking for seepage or armadillo holes. At night, as the waters lapped against the levees and the dogs chased raccoons around the lawn, he watched TV or played guitar in the quiet house, emptied of all furniture but a bed.
Sitting in the boat in the driveway, he talked of plans to start a music festival on the farm or turn the old barn into a concert site. With marriage looming, a gamble in the music business may not cut it.
''I told myself I would never farm,'' he said. But he faltered in college, switching majors and then schools before losing interest altogether. And at some point one had to do something.
It is not as straightforward a decision as it was when his father got into it. Mr. Pillow, the neighbor, said he felt ready to take over the family farm only after two decades of managing it for the other family members in the partnership. All of the advancements have made farming more complex, but the level of risk is still daunting.
''If it were my son,'' he said, ''I'd really discourage him.''
It is a major decision that Todd Hart does not have much time to think about these days. He is spending his days tearing out the drywall in the house in Satartia, which took on water and will not be ready by the wedding; moving back into his cottage; and anxiously watching the water on his soybeans -- hoping, in the counterintuitive math of insurance payouts, that it does not drain too quickly.
The plan to build levees, like the Harts did, was not without risk: Some of Irma Hart's acquaintances have discovered they had hit septic lines while digging up earth, and that sewage water, not floodwater, had filled up the house.
Mr. Hart, for his part, is just starting to find out how much his levees cost, having received a bill for $25,000 a few days ago. In his case, it was probably a financially shrewd move, he said, given the limits of his insurance policy.
On Monday, he was even leaning toward leaving some of the levees standing, just in case.
''At least,'' he said, ''that's the plan as of today.''

HEADLINE: Smart Power Setback

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
So far, few politicians have embraced my plan for a Marshall Plan Tax. The idea is that every time a think-tanker, op-ed writer or retired senator calls for a new Marshall Plan or a moonshot-type initiative to solve a social problem, they would have to pay a tax of $50. Within a few months, we'd have enough money to pay for an actual new Marshall Plan.
The problem with my proposal is this: Do Marshall Plans work? If this country really did galvanize its best minds and billions of dollars to alleviate poverty somewhere or to solve some complicated problem, could we actually do it? 
Well, the U.S. has been engaged in a new Marshall Plan for most of the past decade. Between 2002 and 2010, the U.S. spent roughly $19 billion to promote development in Afghanistan. Many other nations have also sent thousands of aid workers and billions of dollars.
In some spheres the results have been impressive. Nearly two-thirds of Afghans now have access to basic health services, up from 9 percent a decade ago. Under the Taliban, 900,000 boys and no girls attended schools. Now more than seven million Afghans attend school, and 35 percent of them are girls, according to the United States Agency for International Development.
But when it comes to laying the foundation for economic growth and stability, the results have been discouraging.
Stuart Gordon of Chatham House, a British think tank, studied aid efforts in Helmand Province and concluded that in places where state capacity is weak and security is uncertain, foreign aid ''may have as many negative, unintended effects as positive ones.'' After a thorough two-year review of U.S. aid efforts in Afghanistan, the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee emphasized, ''The unintended consequences of pumping large amounts of money into a war zone cannot be underestimated.''
Much of the aid effort was premised on the assumption that development would foster stability. Young men with jobs wouldn't plant roadside bombs. Communities with growing economies would reject the Taliban. This assumption was based on the modern prejudice that bad behavior has material roots. Give people money and jobs and you will improve their character and behavior.
In Afghanistan, as elsewhere, this assumption seems not to be true. A conference of experts brought together last year in Wilton Park in Britain concluded that there is a ''surprisingly weak evidence base for the effectiveness of aid in promoting stabilization and security objectives'' in Afghanistan.
Violence doesn't stem from poverty. It stems from grudges, tribal dynamics and religious fanaticism -- none of which can be ameliorated by building new roads. The poorest parts of the country are not the most violent.
Meanwhile, the influx of aid has, in many cases, created dependency, fed corruption, contributed to insecurity and undermined the host government's capacity to oversee sustainable programs.
In the district of Nawa, for example, Usaid spent $400 per person last year. The per-capita income before aid was $300. According to the World Bank, 97 percent of Afghanistan's G.D.P. derives from spending related to the military and donor community presence.
This incredible infusion distorts labor markets. An Afghan can make $75 a month as a teacher but more than $1,000 a month as a translator or driver for aid workers. The most talented people get sucked out of the real economy and into the aid economy.
It overwhelms provincial governments. It fuels corruption. As aid workers grow frustrated by nonfunctioning Afghan bureaucracies, they build their own parallel ones that, in turn, take responsibility from and infantilize the Afghan agencies that are going to have to administer the country in the long run.
Meanwhile, turnover among U.S. civilians in Afghanistan is about 85 percent a year, according to the Senate report. Many in Congress fixate on ''burn rates'' -- how fast a program can disperse money -- not effectiveness.
Many gains that have been made may be unsustainable. A flood of money washed into Afghanistan, and the reports warn about what will happen when the flood dries up in a few years.
The sad thing is, we are not foreign aid rookies. People have spent years trying to learn from past foreign aid disappointments and still, with all these resources, the results are discouraging.
This experience should have a chastening influence on the advocates of smart power. When she became secretary of state, Hillary Clinton sketched out a very attractive foreign policy vision that would use ''the full range of tools at our disposal: diplomatic, economic, military, political, legal and cultural.'' But it could be that cultural and economic development works on a different timetable than traditional foreign policy.
Perhaps we don't know enough, can't plan enough, can't implement effectively enough to coordinate nation building with national security objectives.
The peace and security timetable is measured in years or decades. Development progress, if it comes at all, is measured in generations.

HEADLINE: Banking's Moment Of Truth

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Capital matters. Let me put that another way. The current fight over additional capital requirements for the banking industry, eye-glazing though it is, also happens to be the most important reform moment since the financial crisis broke out three years ago. More important than the wrangling over Dodd-Frank. More important than the ongoing effort to regulate derivatives. More important even than the jousting over the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
If investment banks like Merrill Lynch had had adequate capital requirements, they would not have been able to pile on so much disastrous debt. If A.I.G. had been required to put up enough capital against its credit default swaps, it's quite likely that the government would not have had to take over the company. If the big banks had not been able to so easily game their capital requirements, they might not have needed taxpayer bailouts. A real capital cushion would have allowed the banks to absorb the losses instead of the taxpayers. That's the role capital serves. 
Adequate capital hides a plethora of sins. And because, by definition, it forces banks to use less debt, it can also prevent sins from being committed in the first place. ''There is no credible way to get rid of bailouts except with capital,'' says Anat Admati, a finance professor at Stanford Business School and a leading voice for higher capital requirements. ''The only cure is capital,'' says Daniel Alpert, a founding managing partner of Westwood Capital. A few days ago, The Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial applauding the recent suggestion by Daniel Tarullo, a Federal Reserve governor, that the biggest banks hold as much as 14 percent of assets in capital. I couldn't agree more.
Which is why a hearing held last week by the House Financial Services Committee was such a sorry sight. Under the guise of examining whether the new financial regulations -- including proposed capital requirements -- were making American banks less competitive, the Republican majority peppered U.S. regulators, including Tarullo, with skeptical questions about the need for increased capital requirements. It was pathetic.
I should point out that the proposed international standards -- Basel III, as they're called, which are still being negotiated by regulators around the globe -- would require banks to hew to capital requirements of only 7 percent, not 14 percent. They are also talking about adding capital surcharges of up to 3 percent, on a sliding scale, to the 30 largest, most systemically important institutions worldwide, meaning that JPMorgan Chase, for instance, would have capital requirements of 10 percent.
There are many experts, including Admati and, one suspects, Tarullo himself, who think this is still too low. The Basel committee has already agreed, somewhat absurdly, to delay the implementation of the requirements until 2019. (Good thing the world's banks aren't going to have any big problems between now and then!) And because the Basel standards, whatever their final form, must still be enacted and enforced by individual country regulators, there is no guarantee that every country will agree to them.
But the U.S. should, no matter what other countries do. Banks always want capital requirements to be as low as possible, because the less capital they have, the more risk they can take and thus the more money they can make (and the bigger the executives' bonuses). But so what? Trading some bank profits for a safer financial system is a deal most Americans would take in a heartbeat.
Indeed, every argument put forth by the big banks and their Congressional spokesmen against higher capital requirements have been demolished by Admati as well as Simon Johnson, the banking expert, whose devastating rebuttal can be found in The New York Times's Economix blog. But the idea that they will make U.S. banks less competitive with European banks deserves particular scorn.
European banks, to be sure, have fought fiercely against higher capital requirements. It's not really because they hope to get a leg up on the rest of the world, though. It is because these banks are in far worse shape than the banks in other parts of the world; they can't afford higher capital requirements. If Europe began insisting that its banks begin holding enough capital to cushion against all the risk on their books -- starting with Greek debt -- the truth would be out: Their insolvency would suddenly be apparent. If Europe wants to keep kicking the can, by turning its back on the surest measure to increase the safety of its financial system, why on earth would we want to go along?
Tarullo will soon travel to Basel, Switzerland, (yes, that's why they call them the Basel accords) to push for the highest capital requirements he can get the rest of the world to agree to. He will also try to convince the international standard-setters that a significant surcharge on the most systemically important banks is vitally important. Really, there's only one appropriate response:
Good luck, sir.

HEADLINE: China's Boom Is Beginning to Show Cracks, Analysts Say

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- New economic analyses of China provide further indication that the nation's supercharged economy is beginning to slow, and warn that soaring inflation, rising labor costs and mounting local government debt threaten to weaken growth even more.
Several economists in China have recently lowered their growth forecasts for this year and next year to about 8.5 percent, down from earlier forecasts of 9 to 10 percent, while warning about the possibility of a sharp rise in nonperforming loans at the nation's big state-owned banks. 
On Monday, for instance, Credit Suisse said data recently released by the Chinese central bank showed that credit in China had expanded at ''alarming levels,'' far more than previous government estimates suggested. Credit Suisse downgraded its profit forecasts for Chinese companies and state-owned banks, as it warned of slowing growth for the overall economy.
The reports come at a time of heightened concern about slower growth in other parts of the world, including the United States, Europe and Japan.
Since the financial crisis, China has been the world's leading growth engine. But for much of the past year, China has been trying to rein in overly aggressive bank lending as way to tame soaring inflation and property prices.
Those tightening measures have not only weakened growth in China, analysts say, but have also begun to expose a host of other problems in the nation's financial system.
While few analysts expect China's growth to slow to below 8 percent in the next year, they still paint a troubling picture. The Chinese stock market has been in a slump for much of the last two years, the property market looks weaker and inflation is running at a 34-month high.
Analysts said exports have begun to show signs of weakness in recent weeks. Credit Suisse said Monday that China's export growth could be flat in the coming months, partly because of weaker demand in the United States and Europe.
Credit Suisse's new figures also indicate that off-balance-sheet lending, much of which took place outside the banking system, pumped a large amount of additional credit into the financial system last year. As a result, Credit Suisse downgraded its ratings of Chinese companies and the big state-controlled banks, and warned of a possible rise in bad loans.
Vincent Chan, the head of China research at Credit Suisse, said that the nation's economy might avoid a ''hard landing'' but that growth over the next year was likely to be less robust.
''The market consensus is for a soft landing and two or three quarters of slowing down, then a growth rebound,'' Mr. Chan said in a telephone interview Monday. But, he said, ''we're saying that after that, the growth may not re-accelerate and the indebtedness may be more serious.''
Early this month, Wang Tao, the chief economist in China at UBS, warned that over the next few years, loans to local government investment companies could result in as much as $460 billion in nonperforming loans.
Although Beijing used state-run banks to bolster growth after the financial crisis hit in late 2008, the central government is ordering them to help rein in growth.
Chinese banks have already raised interest rates and set aside larger reserves. The government is expected to announce additional measures in the coming months.
While those moves could help slow inflation, they will also probably weaken growth by driving up borrowing costs in China. That could hamper private companies and property developers, which have been among China's biggest sources of growth.
Last week, Standard & Poor's, the credit ratings agency, lowered its outlook on Chinese property developers, predicting that in some parts of the country property sales could drop sharply as a result of tighter credit and government curbs.
Another growth driver -- local government investment in infrastructure projects -- has also come under scrutiny from regulators because of worries that overly aggressive spending on new roads, bridges, tunnels, subways and showpiece projects could lead to a wave of nonperforming loans to municipalities.
Businesses, meanwhile, are trying to cope with rising labor costs, energy shortages and higher borrowing costs.
Those conditions could change if the government decided to loosen monetary policies and ramp up growth, the way Beijing did in early 2009. But Mr. Chan at Credit Suisse said the size of China's debt could restrain regulators and lead to a longer period of slower growth.
Asked whether nonperforming loans -- or N.P.L.'s -- are set to rise, Mr. Chan said: ''A rise in N.P.L.'s is a must. The question is, how much will they rise?''

ANOTHER ASSET TO SELL ING, the Dutch financial group that announced on Friday it would sell its American online banking unit for $9 billion, said on Monday that it was in talks to divest its car lease business. 
Its statement came in response to media reports that ING was seeking up to 4 billion euros ($5.7 billion) for the unit, a price that some analysts described as excessive. CHRIS V. NICHOLSON
MANAGEMENT-LED BUYOUT Harbin Electric signed an agreement to be sold to its chief executive, Tianfu Yang, for $24 a share, the latest chapter in the continuing story of Chinese companies listed in the United States.
The $750 million deal for Harbin Electric, a maker of electric motors, comes just a week after the company's stock price was pummeled by a report by Citron Research, which called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to halt trading in its shares.
Citron is one of a handful of research shops that have taken aim at so-called reverse mergers involving Chinese companies. AZAM AHMED
HOPE FOR INVESTORS The Securities and Exchange Commission froze the assets of R. Allen Stanford's financial empire almost two years ago, but authorities are still figuring out whether investors can be compensated for some of their losses.
The S.E.C. is pushing for investors who bought more than $7.2 billion in ostensibly bogus certificates of deposit from Mr. Stanford's Antiguan bank to be treated as brokerage customers by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. If that happens, clients could get at least some of their money back, according to White Collar Watch. PETER J. HENNING

HEADLINE: Chilean Court Blocks Plan For Patagonia Dam Project

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
A Chilean appeals court on Monday suspended a plan to build five dams and hydroelectric plants in the country's Patagonia region.
The court ruling came in response to actions filed by environmental groups and legislators arguing that the government commission that approved the $3.2 billion dam project last month had not taken into account a technical review. 
The ruling temporarily halts the government's approval process for the project, which set off large protests around the country in recent weeks.
Opponents applauded the ruling, hoping it was a step toward scuttling it altogether.
Amanda W. Maxwell, Latin America advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, based in New York, said the ruling was significant because the court was ''the first authority in Chile to stand up to the behemoth project and to the intense political pressure to get it built.'' She said the ruling indicated that the court ''values the rule of law over private business interests, and sees no need to rush to build the dams.''
A lawyer for the project, Mario Galindo, told the Chilean newspaper La Tercera that the decision would do nothing to stop it. The ruling was ''purely formal,'' he said, ''and there are no decisions about the legality or illegality'' of the dam complex.
The HidroAysen project, proposed by an Italian-Spanish company, Endesa, and a Chilean company, Colbun, would build five facilities that would generate 2,750 megawatts of electricity. The energy would travel to Santiago over a 1,200-mile transmission line that has yet to be approved.
Critics contend that the project is environmentally destructive and unnecessary, and that Chile should focus on developing forms of renewable energy like wind and solar. The complex would be built in a region of Patagonia known for breathtaking glaciers and lakes that draws thousands of tourists a year.
But Chile, more than any of its neighbors in Latin America, is struggling to secure energy supplies to keep up with its economic growth. The country will need to double its capacity to generate electricity over the next 10 to 15 years, according to government projections.
Chile has little oil or natural gas of its own. Importing gas from Argentina has been unreliable, and the earthquake that damaged nuclear reactors in Japan this year has rendered building one in Chile unlikely, given its propensity for earthquakes.

HEADLINE: Plight of the Expat Spouse

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
Overseas assignments are more brisk after the recession, but accompanying spouses and partners still struggle to find work abroad, too.
An annual survey of global relocation trends found that 61 percent of companies surveyed expect to transfer more employees in 2011 than in recent years, higher than the historical average of 57 percent. But only 15 percent of spouses employed before going abroad were able to find overseas assignments, about 10 percent less than in 2006.
Scott Sullivan, an executive vice president of Brookfield Global Relocation Services, publishers of the annual survey, said that ''trailing'' spouses in the current uncertain market are especially reluctant to give up jobs -- and a second income -- at home because of risks to future earning potential and career development. 
The lack of employment opportunities abroad for partners ''wasn't as much of a challenge to companies 20 to 30 years ago,'' Mr. Sullivan said, but with the rise in dual-career couples, ''it's become a huge issue across the board.'' He added, ''Companies can't find the best people to go on assignments, so the talent pool for highly skilled international employees is deteriorating.''
Yvonne McNulty, an assistant professor of international business at James Cook University's Singapore campus who studies mobility issues, said, ''The dual-career issue remains the No. 1 reason for refusing assignments.''
Some 20 years ago, financial compensation packages for expatriate families were more robust, with higher salaries and other perks like drivers, club memberships and first-class airfare for home leave so a spouse could afford not to work. Today, while packages are lower over all, ''companies are being more proactive'' in helping spouses find work, Ms. McNulty said.
''It has gone from nice to have to a must-have strategic support service,'' said Susan R. Ginsberg, vice president, global services for Ricklin-Echikson Associates, a human recourses consulting firm with professional coaches in 50 countries that specializes in career and transition assistance for spouses and partners overseas. During negotiations, the offer of support can be ''key to ensure that it doesn't become a deal breaker.''
Navdeep Boparai, originally from India, recently relocated to Houston with her husband from England. She worked as an auditor for Deloitte, and hopes to find similar work in this country. Her husband's employer, an oil and gas company, is outsourcing counseling through Ricklin-Echikson. Even before the move, a consultant helped her write an American-style resume, learn about the local job market and salary issues and prepare for interviews.
The adjustment has not been easy, Ms. Boparai said. ''The working culture is totally different. Americans are always checking their e-mail. Here, work is life, it defines them.'' She said that she wanted to know what to expect. ''Otherwise,'' she said, ''it could be a bit of a disaster.''
Cultural issues as well as foreign languages, licensing and certification, and obtaining work permits are often obstacles to spouses getting jobs in new countries.
Kathleen van der Wilk-Carlton, executive director of the Permits Foundation, a nonprofit group based at The Hague, the Netherlands, that advocates for the improvement of work regulations for the partners of expatriate employees, said that when the foundation was set up in 2001, ''only a handful of countries allowed spouses to work automatically or easily.'' But, she added, ''There's been a significant improvement.''
The foundation published a survey in 2009 of 3,300 expatriate spouses in dual-career families, relocated by more than 200 employers in 117 countries.
More than 80 percent of those not working wanted to work, and those who worked were found to be more likely to report a positive impact on adjustment, family relationships, and general heath and well being. They were also more willing to complete or extend current assignments or to go on new assignments than nonworking spouses.
Only 18 percent of respondents said they had received adequate career support from their spouses' employers.
Concern for career issues was highest among spouses or partners who were male, unmarried, younger and university graduates, all growing demographics, Mrs. Wilk-Carlton said. ''As global business increases, that is only likely to get worse.''
Once couples relocate, adjustment is critical. Expatriate spousal dissatisfaction is the biggest reason that assignments fail, many experts said.
''And the chances of failure are huge,'' said Margery Marshall, president of Vandover, a global transition support company that works with spouses on career strategy.
A failed relocation or early return can cost about $1 million. That figure is multiplied with group moves, which are on the rise, Ms. Marshall said.
Her firm advises relocated spouses on how to connect to professional associations and build networks, find volunteer work, locate local mentors and when to consider classes.
Annette Lang successfully dealt with work challenges by becoming an entrepreneur.
It was not work permit or certification issues that prevented her from finding a job when she moved to Singapore, a country with favorable laws for expatriate spouses.
''I loved what I was doing,'' said Mrs. Lang, who had been head of product development for an Australian company supplying major department stores with holiday gift items using food. ''I was sent around the world shopping, spending other people's money. But to set up this type of gift item business in Singapore would be virtually impossible,'' she said, because of the logistics and high cost of importing specialty foods.
At a dinner party at her home one evening, she got the idea for a business. A guest, impressed that the housekeeper prepared such delicious Western-style food, asked if Mrs. Lang could teach her domestic worker.
Most household staff, Mrs. Lang said, ''have little exposure to our Western ways of preparing food. I have this fantastic helper really keen to learn, so I had trained her to cook healthy Western food, and how to adhere to Western sanitation standards.''
After the dinner party, Mrs. Lang said, ''I set out to create a business to train helpers, starting with training lessons in my home.''
Today, she owns and runs Expat Kitchen, a Western food-focused cooking school, and in four years she has taught more than 1,000 students.
''My dream is to take it to every Asian country,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Witnesses to Sunrise Over the Strip

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
The economic news in the morning newspaper was grim this past weekend: another uptick in the unemployment rate for Las Vegas, to 12.4 percent from 12 percent. Room occupancy rates on the Strip are stagnant. There were tables to be had at some of the fancier restaurants around, and empty spots at craps tables at the Cosmopolitan, the hot new casino, during what should have been a prime hour. 
But if the numbers suggest the party is over, or at least on hiatus -- ''LV joblessness ticks up in May,'' read the Saturday headline in The Review-Journal -- don't tell it to people who were walking along Las Vegas Boulevard about 6 a.m. that day. It was 40 minutes after sunrise, and the Strip was humming. And it's safe to say the strollers were not your dawn-loving early risers.
''Dude!'' shouted one young man, stumbling with a group of three similarly exuberant friends in front of Paris Las Vegas as he raised his hand for a high-in-the-air greeting to a passing jogger. A few paces up, four young women -- admirably well-put together considering the time of day -- walked arm-in-arm, in tight and short dresses that caught the attention of passing gentlemen. Members of the crowd were leaving the always open casinos and late-night clubs, heading to their hotels.
The scene, in fact, was not the Strip at its best. The sidewalks were littered with glossy hand-outs distributed by squads of men and women who work the street, snapping the cards and thrusting them into the hands of startled tourists. They advertise nightclubs, shows and all kinds of sexual services. The cleaning crews were just beginning to sweep up in anticipation of the next wave, tourists heading for breakfast or an early round of gambling.
Parts of the sidewalk were littered with broken glass, from bottles that had been dropped in the revelry of the night. That did not seem to bother a considerable number of women who were, somewhat disconcertingly, walking along in their bare feet holding their high heels, which had presumably been through a lot this night.

HEADLINE: Moving Beyond Its Feisty Roots, Hudson River Park Group Focuses on Fund-Raising

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The nature lovers and community activists who founded Friends of Hudson River Park in 1999 never shied from a fight; years earlier, they even helped kill Westway, the superhighway planned to run down the West Side of Manhattan.
But the group may have met its match in Friends of the High Line.
In the last decade or so, Friends of the High Line has collected millions of dollars from wealthy people and corporations to help pay for the transformation of an elevated rail line into a mile-long park just blocks from Hudson River Park. The resulting High Line has won over parkgoers, architectural critics and benefactors. 
Using that approach as a model of sorts, Friends of Hudson River Park has essentially decided to abandon its activist roots and redirect its energy toward raising money for the park, possibly in exchange for having sections named after donors. Most of the group's leading figures are yielding their positions with Friends of Hudson River Park to people who will contribute at least $25,000 a year to the park.
On Tuesday, the Hudson River Park Trust will hold a public hearing to discuss the proposed arrangement with the Friends group. The trust is a city-state agency responsible for building and maintaining the park, which covers five miles of the riverfront from the Battery to 59th Street.
The new mission of the Friends is ''to do the bidding of the trust,'' said Madelyn Wils, a former city official who became the president and chief executive of the Hudson River Park Trust on Monday.
Ms. Wils said the Friends had supported the park by waging legal battles to remove a commercial heliport and a garage for municipal garbage trucks. As a result of a lawsuit over the trash depot, the city agreed in 2005 to pay the trust $21.5 million over seven years.
But the Friends were much less effective when it came to collecting contributions for the upkeep of the park, according to Ms. Wils. ''The Friends, in the past, in collecting money, have really led the public to believe that they are fundraising for the park, but the park has gotten very few funds'' from the group, she said.
Unlike Friends of the High Line, Friends of Hudson River Park will have no role in operating the park and little say in how the rest of the unfinished park is developed.
Ms. Wils said she ''felt strongly that Friends had to be more active in fund-raising for the park, because that's what friends are for.'' But she acknowledged that when she served on the group's board, she was ''not a particularly active fund-raiser.''
Until this month, Ms. Wils was an executive with the city's Economic Development Corporation, where she oversaw the creation of Brooklyn Bridge Park, among many projects. At the trust, she will be responsible for managing construction of the last 20 percent of Hudson River Park, at an estimated cost of more than $150 million.
Money to complete the park is expected to come from the city and the state. Money raised by the Friends could go toward some capital projects, but most is intended to help cover maintenance. It was hoped that the park would sustain itself through revenue from commercial operations within its borders, including the Chelsea Piers sports complex and a parking garage on Pier 40 in the West Village.
''What they have in mind is hiring a high-powered development staff to try to see if they can tap into private-sector funding,'' said Albert K. Butzel, a lawyer who fought against Westway in the 1970s and '80s and served as president of the Friends until 2007. But he added: ''They're not the High Line. They haven't had any of the success the High Line has had in getting people to give money.''
Mr. Butzel was referring to wealthy donors like Barry Diller, Diane von Furstenberg and Philip and Lisa Maria Falcone, all of whom have sections of the High Line named after them. So far, the benefactor most associated with Friends of Hudson River Park has been the real estate developer Douglas Durst, who is co-chairman of the group's board.
To get the revamped Friends in gear quickly, the trust is proposing to provide $500,000 and office space on Pier 40, where the trust has its offices. The proposal sets a deadline of next May 31 for the Friends to raise at least $1 million.
That would be more than the group has raised in such a short period since Mr. Durst's original contribution of $1 million several years ago. Mr. Durst said in an interview that he expected to have a new co-chairman soon. Some longtime members of the board ''have agreed to step down for the benefit of the park,'' he said, making way for others who could donate or solicit more money.
Deborah J. Glick, a state assemblywoman from Manhattan, said the ''coordinated and concentrated advocacy that came from the Friends will not be there,'' so other community organizations will have to have to fill the void and monitor what happens in the park.

HEADLINE: Health Law In a Swirl Of Forecasts

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The debate over the effects of the federal health care law on employer-provided insurance has been intensifying in recent weeks, with controversial polls and consultants contradicting one another about whether employees will benefit or lose coverage by 2014.
After nearly two weeks of widespread queries and criticisms, McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm, posted on Monday the questionnaire and methodology of an online survey it had released that was denounced by the White House and others for contending that nearly a third of employers would definitely or probably drop coverage for employees when provisions of the health care law took effect in 2014. 
The White House responded on Monday night. ''As we learn more, it's become clear that this one flawed study from McKinsey is truly an outlier,'' Nancy-Ann DeParle, an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff, said in a blog post.
The White House initially pointed to forecasts by the Congressional Budget Office and other experts whose estimates were much smaller in terms of whether employees would lose some or all coverage. For example, an Urban Institute study to be released on Tuesday suggests that employees in small businesses may receive more coverage, not less.
McKinsey also came under fire for not providing access to the survey's authors, and for not publishing the questions, the types of employers taking part or the survey methodology.
In posting ''details regarding the survey'' on its Web site Monday, McKinsey acknowledged that its survey was ''not comparable'' to the studies by the budget office, Urban Institute or others using economic modeling.
Rather, it surveyed business owners using an online panel. McKinsey said it paid for the survey by Ipsos, a French marketing firm, ''to capture the attitudes of employers,'' large and small.
In addition, McKinsey seemed to be trying to address the criticisms by the White House and others, asserting that its report was not intended to be predictive.
McKinsey's explanations did not satisfy Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and several from the House who have inquired.
''This report is filled with cherry-picked facts and slanted questions,'' he said in a statement. ''It did not provide employers with enough information for them to make honest choices and fair evaluations. Rather than correct the major deficiencies in their report, McKinsey has chosen to again stand by their faulty analysis and misguided conclusions.''
Several other reports have focused on small businesses, the group having the hardest time dealing with rising medical costs.
The latest, issued on Tuesday, is by the Urban Institute, a Washington research center. Its study, based on analysis of Census Bureau and Department of Health and Human Services surveys, estimates that employer coverage will increase modestly for workers and their dependents in firms with 50 or fewer employees.
By contrast, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was an economic and health policy adviser to Senator John McCain's presidential campaign, predicts that more than 35 million people will lose employer insurance. ''We figured they would all end up in the exchanges,'' the state-sponsored insurance agencies to be set up under the new law, he said in a telephone interview.
Over all, including all employers, analyses by a number of widely cited researchers predicted little or no change in employer-sponsored insurance in 2014. They include the Congressional Budget Office, RAND, Lewin Associates and Mercer.
John Arensmeyer, a small business advocate who supports the law, the Affordable Care Act, calls it ''a big step in the right direction.'' But he said a poll by his group, Small Business Majority, found that more than half of respondents did not know what was in the law.
''Once they learn about tax credits and the exchanges option, they are more inclined to participate,'' Mr. Arensmeyer said.
Linda J. Blumberg, an Urban Institute researcher, said, ''Contrary to a lot of statements that have been made in the press and elsewhere, the impact of the law on small employers is going to be positive in great degree.''
Mr. Holtz-Eakin headed a group of 105 economists who filed a brief supporting the lawsuit by Republican officials from 26 states seeking to have the Affordable Care Act overturned.
But Dr. Blumberg said Virginia and other states with Republican governors were working to set up the exchanges. Republicans prefer state exchanges to the probability of a federal version if they do not act.
Four states, West Virginia, Maryland, California and Colorado, recently passed laws to establish exchanges, and similar bills have been adopted by one house in a number of other states, she said. ''There is a division between what the attorneys general are doing and what governors' offices are doing,'' she said.
Gerry Harkins, who owns a small construction company in Atlanta and is a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business, said he would try to ''figure out a way to game the system.''
''This whole plan is really slanted toward large employers,'' he said. Firms with 10 and fewer workers also should benefit. ''The burden falls in the middle.'' His company, Southern Pan Services, had 1,200 employees before the economic crisis. It now has ''under 100,'' he said.
He is considering splitting his company into two units to get under 50 employees each and reduce the $3,000 penalty, for each worker, he will face for his current health plan, which is entirely paid for by employees. Joseph R. Antos, a health policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute, criticizes the health law. He says it has ''too much central direction and not enough appreciation for our fiscal situation.''
But Mr. Antos said large employers, who cover the majority of American workers, would probably wait several years after 2014 to see how the new system worked before deciding what to do. Those with union contracts will take much longer, he said.
He said the many variables in the law made predictions difficult. ''Whatever you assume, is what you get out of it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Legislature Still at Odds Over Cuomo's Top Issues

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- The annual legislative session sputtered into overtime on Monday night with no visible progress on critical elements of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's ambitious first-year agenda, while legislative leaders battled behind the scenes on a host of contentious issues.
The highest-profile battle, over whether to legalize same-sex marriage, continued without resolution as protesters sang and shouted in the Capitol, and a small group of lawmakers continued to negotiate language to protect religious groups that do not support same-sex marriage from the threat of legal sanctions. 
But the Legislature was also at odds over New York's rent regulations, after Republicans in the State Senate balked at the broader tenant protections and expanded oversight of landlords that are being sought by Mr. Cuomo and Assembly Democrats.
The stalemate over rent has stalled movement toward a final vote on Mr. Cuomo's deal with legislative leaders to impose a cap on local property taxes.
The delays on rent, property taxes and same-sex marriage -- each high-priority issues for Mr. Cuomo -- mean that lawmakers will remain in Albany in special session for at least a few more days.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said Monday that virtually every aspect of the rent laws, which limit rent increases on more than a million apartments in New York City and its suburbs, remained on the table as lawmakers sought a deal acceptable to both Mr. Cuomo and Senate Republicans, who are closely allied with the real estate industry.
''It's all of the issues,'' Mr. Silver said, a few hours after meeting with Mr. Cuomo and Dean G. Skelos, the Senate majority leader, in the governor's office.
Assembly Democrats are seeking to raise the income and rent thresholds at which landlords can begin charging tenants market rate, while at the same time indexing those thresholds to inflation. Those changes are intended to help stem the steady loss of rent-regulated units, tens of thousands of which have reverted to market rate as inflation and annual increases pushed rents past the existing thresholds.
Democrats have sought to bundle the tenant-friendly changes they have proposed with the renewal of tax breaks sought by real estate developers and landlords.
But after the meeting on Monday, Mr. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, signaled that he considered the Assembly proposals onerous and unacceptable.
''We're not looking to protect the wealthy,'' he said. ''We're looking to ensure that rent stabilization helps affordability.''
Mr. Skelos said that one specific proposal of Assembly Democrats -- to raise the income threshold at which tenants can lose the protection of rent regulations, to $300,000 from $175,000 -- was ''unconscionable.''
Though Mr. Cuomo has said publicly that he wants to expand rent regulations and not merely extend the existing laws, his specific bargaining position is unknown. Tenant advocates, who fear that Mr. Cuomo will settle for a deal that raises the current thresholds but does not index them to inflation, pressed him on Monday for a stronger package of tenant protections.
''What has been floated, it would be such a piddling improvement it's laughable,'' said Michael McKee, treasurer of the Tenants Political Action Committee. ''We're not going to accept a piddling reform and say that it's a victory.''
Meanwhile, protesters on both sides of the same-sex marriage issue strode through the corridors of the Capitol, forming a crowd as raucous as any that has gathered there in months. Members of the clergy and gay-rights activists held placards, while state troopers, some armed with bright yellow Tasers, watched over them.
Dr. Jan Taylor, 50, a family physician from the Albany suburbs, stood outside Mr. Skelos's office clutching rosary beads. ''I'm here for my children,'' she said. ''If gay marriage passes and marriage is redefined, I think that will unleash a social experiment on our children, which they have not consented to. And that's unfair to them.''
Linda Barat, 53, a homemaker from New Rochelle, also said she was there for her children -- a daughter, 18, who is straight, and son, 20, who is gay.
''They're equal,'' she said. ''There's no difference between them. And I want them both to have the opportunity of marriage, and everything it entails.''
A few yards away, the former Giants wide receiver David Tyree lingered with the leaders of several groups that oppose same-sex marriage, which delivered petitions to Mr. Skelos that they said had the signatures of 63,000 New Yorkers who agreed with them.
Mr. Tyree, who earned fame for an acrobatic, late-game catch in Super Bowl XLII in 2008, told reporters that he thought his mythical reception may have been part of a larger plan.
''Perhaps God orchestrated that play to give me a platform for what I'm doing here today,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bonus Cuts, Pay Raises, Then Layoffs

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
It's hardly surprising that Wall Street is bracing for layoffs. The European debt crisis is rocking the markets. New regulations are crimping the banks' profit centers. And smaller bonuses are sending other compensation costs soaring.
Scratching your head about that last one?
In a nod to the fury and outrage from the financial crisis, Wall Street firms tempered their annual bonuses to employees last year, seemingly as a way to rein in pay. And the bonuses were largely paid in stock, aligning compensation more closely with the company's performance. 
But Wall Street did not necessarily cut the overall pay packages. The dirty little secret is that to make up for the lower bonuses, many firms simply raised the base salaries. The move has been described by some government officials as a ''sleight of hand.''
The new pay structure is now having an unintended consequence: It is perverting Wall Street's calculus during periods of weakness.
In the past, banks could cut variable costs like bonuses when profits slipped, rather than handing out pink slips en masse.
Now, fixed costs like salaries make up a higher portion of their expenses. So layoffs are starting to look more attractive.
''An obvious short-term consequence of increasing base salaries on Wall Street is to weaken the pay-performance link - which, in turn, makes it more likely that banks will fire low-performing employees rather than simply reducing their bonuses,'' said Robert J. Jackson Jr., who served after the financial crisis as a deputy to the Treasury Department's pay czar, Kenneth R. Feinberg .
It remains to be seen how deeply Wall Street will have to cut. Kian Abouhossein, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Cazenove in London, says the layoffs could be painful, given the enormous fixed costs the firms face.
Mr. Abouhossein analyzed the major banks in Switzerland, which has stricter disclosure requirements than the United States but may be a good proxy for the rest of Wall Street. His research, which has been getting a lot of attention among Wall Street's higher-ups, found that 81 percent of Credit Suisse's compensation expenses are now fixed, compared with 66 percent in 2009. At UBS, they rose to 63 percent in 2010 from 55 percent.
''Increasing fixed costs increases pressure on the cost base and offers a limited cushion in the form of variable cost to absorb the impact of revenue downturns,'' he wrote in a note to investors. The next downturn, he explained, ''is likely to lead to material staff cuts.''
Last week, my colleague Susanne Craig reported that Goldman Sachs was ''certain'' to reduce head count this year. She reported that in January, Barclays Capital cut 600 people, or more than 2 percent of its global staff, and she wrote that Morgan Stanley plans to cut at least 300 low-producing brokers in its wealth management division this year.
All of that may sound like small potatoes. But Wall Street is facing a new reality that it has yet to come to grips with. ''Return on equity,'' perhaps the best metric for considering the health of the Wall Street, fell to 8.2 percent in 2010, according to Nomura. That is down from 17.5 percent in 2005, before the crisis.
By comparison, total compensation has hardly fallen at all. At Goldman Sachs, for example, compensation and benefit expenses fell 5 percent in the first quarter. Net revenue, however, fell 7 percent during the same period; in the firm's largest division, which includes fixed income trading, net revenue fell 28 percent. And its annualized return on equity fell to 12.2 percent from 20.1 percent in the period a year earlier.
Alan Johnson, a pay consultant, who is still bullish on the employment market among banks, said salaries had risen 40 percent to 60 percent. Nevertheless, he said, ''What's really happened is you've traded your salary going up by $100,000 for your bonus going down $100,000.''
It is tough to find the right mix between bonus and salary. If banks got rid of bonuses altogether, they would lose the link between pay and performance.
Mr. Jackson, the former deputy pay czar, said he and Mr. Feinberg worried about this issue when they set pay limits under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Banks have used these compensation limits as a model - albeit less than many people wanted.
''At Treasury, we anticipated that banks would seek to raise salaries in response to new rules on pay,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''That's why Ken Feinberg's rulings imposed a $500,000 cap on base salaries for most employees at the firms that received the most TARP help.''
Others wanted higher salary caps and lower bonuses. But Mr. Jackson and Mr. Feinberg figured that bankers needed compensation to be tied at least in part to the overall health of the company.
Mr. Abouhossein suggests far direr consequences: ''We see higher base salaries helping underperformers in a downturn at the expense of top performers, which could result in the best people leaving the industry in a downturn.''
That could be a bit of a stretch - and a bit self-serving for the industry. Some academics and Washington officials whom I spoke with said that any suggestion that lowering bonuses would cause layoffs was a ploy by Wall Street banks to roll back their compensation changes.
Lucian A. Bebchuk, the director of the Program on Corporate Governance at Harvard Law School, said he was not convinced that raising salaries was the problem at all. ''Look, it makes things less flexible, but not in a bad way,'' he said. To Mr. Bebchuk, the larger problem is that overall compensation has not come down. ''I'm surprised it hasn't come down more.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Support Is Mutual for Senator And Makers of Supplements

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
SALT LAKE CITY -- A drive along mountain-lined Interstate 15 here shows why Senator Orrin G. Hatch is considered a hero in this region nicknamed the Silicon Valley of the nutritional supplement industry.
In the town of Lehi is the sprawling headquarters of Xango, where company officials praised Mr. Hatch, a Utah Republican, late last year for helping their exotic fruit juice business ''operate without excessive intrusion'' from Washington.
Up in Sandy, Utah, is 4 Life Research, whose top executives donated to Mr. Hatch's last re-election campaign after federal regulators charged the company with making exaggerated claims about pills that it says helps the immune system. And nearby in West Salem, assembly-line workers at Neways fill thousands of bottles a day for a product line that includes Youthinol, a steroid-based hormone that professional sports leagues pushed to ban until Mr. Hatch blocked them.
''Senator Hatch -- he's our natural ally,'' said Marc S. Ullman, a lawyer for several supplement companies. 
Mr. Hatch, who credits a daily regimen of nutritional supplements for his vigor at 77, has spent his career in Washington helping the $25-billion-a-year industry thrive.
He was the chief author of a federal law enacted 17 years ago that allows companies to make general health claims about their products, but exempts them from federal reviews of their safety or effectiveness before they go to market. During the Obama administration, Mr. Hatch has repeatedly intervened with his colleagues in Congress and federal regulators in Washington to fight proposed rules that industry officials consider objectionable.
While Congress is often stalled or bitterly divided in addressing some of the nation's most pressing problems, like the economy and immigration, legislative champions like Mr. Hatch are often remarkably successful in delivering for niche industries or parochial programs. It is not unusual, of course, for lawmakers to fight for local interests, but Mr. Hatch's alliances are particularly strong and mutually beneficial.
Mr. Hatch has been rewarded with hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions, political loyalty and corporate sponsorship of his favorite causes back home.
His family and friends have benefited, too, from links to the supplement industry. His son Scott Hatch, is a longtime industry lobbyist in Washington, as are at least five of the senator's former aides. Mr. Hatch's grandson and son-in-law increase revenue at their chiropractic clinic near here by selling herbal and nutritional treatments, including $35 ''thyroid dysfunction'' injections and a weight-loss product, ''Slim and Sassy Metabolic Blend.'' And Mr. Hatch's former law partner owns Pharmics, a small nutritional supplement company in Salt Lake City.
But many public health experts argue that in his advocacy, Mr. Hatch has hindered regulators from preventing dangerous products from being put on the market, including supplements that are illegally spiked with steroids or other unapproved drugs. They also say he is the person in Washington most responsible for the proliferation of products that make exaggerated claims about health benefits.
Just in the last two years, 2,292 serious illnesses, including 33 that were fatal, were reported by consumers of supposedly harmless nutritional supplements, federal records show. (These ''severe adverse reaction'' reports do not necessarily mean the supplements caused the illnesses, just that the consumers became ill after taking them.) And some of Mr. Hatch's most important supporters in Utah have faced repeated accusations of falsely claiming their products can treat almost everything, including cancer and heart disease.
''Orrin Hatch certainly has a right to fight for his constituents,'' said Steven Novella, a clinical neurologist at the Yale School of Medicine who was a co-founder of a Web site that tracks claims by the supplement industry. ''But the consequences are we have an effectively unregulated market for these products, a Wild West, and people are being abused by slick marketing, and as a result taking things that are worthless or in some cases not even safe.''
Mr. Hatch rejects such accusations, noting that he has repeatedly demanded that federal regulators step up enforcement of existing laws, and even worked to expand their powers.
''No relationships have or will ever have any impact on my policy positions,'' Mr. Hatch said in a written statement. ''Supplements are healthy and safe, and they are a major industry in my home state of Utah.''
The depth of his industry support could be put to a test over the coming year, as Mr. Hatch prepares for what could be a tough re-election fight if Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican, mounts a primary challenge. Mr. Chaffetz, a former executive at a Utah company that sells anti-aging and skin care products, is also an industry ally.
Several executives, though, say they cannot imagine turning their back on Mr. Hatch.
''Some folks get elected, go to Washington, forget where they came from,'' John F. Gay, chief executive of an industry trade association, said last year in introducing Mr. Hatch at an industry convention in Las Vegas. ''Others get elected, go to Washington, and use the knowledge they have gained, the relationships they've built, the power they have developed over the years of incumbency to help the folks who got them there. That is the type of person that Senator Hatch is.''
Hatch to the Rescue
Just to the left of the entrance at Xango's corporate headquarters here in central Utah is the ''Million Dollar Club,'' where independent sales agents learn the pitch for the company's $40-a-bottle juice, made from a Southeast Asian fruit called the mangosteen.
One night in March, Dr. Vaughn T. Johnson, a Xango distributor, delivered part pep talk, part medical seminar, in describing extraordinary powers attributed to mangosteen. Studies showed, Dr. Johnson said, it was ''anti-tumor,'' ''anti-obesity,'' ''anti-aging,'' ''anti-fatigue,'' ''antiviral,'' ''antibiotic'' and ''antidepressant.''
''How do I know this isn't just snake oil?'' Dr. Johnson, an osteopathic physician, asked. ''It's a really simple answer. A company that is selling snake oil is not going to stay in business for almost 11 years and grow as fast as this company is growing.''
When Utah became a leading center of supplements a half century ago, an industry pioneer named John R. Christopher boasted that his more than 50 herbal formulas offered ''almost miraculous healings.''
But by the early 1990s, the Food and Drug Administration had become uneasy about the growing number of exotic product and health claims, particularly after more than 20 deaths were attributed to a ''natural'' sleep remedy. After the agency conducted raids across the country to confiscate supplements deemed unsafe or sold for unapproved uses. Mr. Hatch came to the rescue.
Under legislation he pushed through Congress, nutritional supplement companies could introduce products without F.D.A. approval, and make general health claims without proving their effectiveness or safety. The legislation covered a wide range of products -- not just vitamins and minerals, but also herbs, essential oils and other substances -- and was written to give companies a lot of leeway in their marketing claims.
''It is a broad definition -- and that was done intentionally,'' said Loren D. Israelsen, a lawyer who created an association of Utah supplement businesses that helped draft and lobby for the 1994 measure.
But Xango's record illustrates how companies eager to exploit the law can go too far.
In 2006, federal regulators warned Xango that brochures improperly promoted mangosteen juice as a disease cure, not just a healthy option. Xango is among more than a dozen Utah companies cited by federal regulators over the last decade for apparent violations of the law.
Xango, whose executives are the single biggest Utah-based contributors to Mr. Hatch's political campaigns and have drawn Mr. Hatch to its headquarters to down shot glasses of their juice, blamed a marketing company that had printed the brochures. The company also insisted that it was closely monitoring distributors to make sure they did not make inappropriate claims.
But in his talk at Xango in March, Dr. Johnson -- who lectures across the country at other company events -- used some of the same language the F.D.A. had cited in its 2006 warning letter, and he referred the sales agents to a nearby company that still sold brochures making the improper claims.
Dr. Johnson also talked about his own medical research, saying he had documented how just a few ounces a day of Xango juice could reduce certain types of inflammation, including arthritis.
''As a doc, I've had a lot of patients come to me and tell me the success they are enjoying with Xango juice,'' he said. ''The key is to stay consistent, keep taking it.''
Dr. Johnson, in a written statement, said his remarks broke no rules, as he was citing results of medical studies. But a Xango spokesman said the company had initiated an inquiry and would discipline Dr. Johnson if necessary.
One fact he did not mention during his presentation was that his medical license had twice been suspended by the State of Utah, most recently in 2008, state records show, for charges including improperly prescribing excessive amounts of narcotics or turning over signed, blank prescription forms to a weight-loss clinic. He can practice medicine but remains on probation.
A Surprise Threat
Mr. Hatch has been ever vigilant about any threats to the industry. When Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg was nominated in 2009 as commissioner of the food and drug agency, her record as an aggressive health commissioner for New York City set off alarms.
Industry officials worried that Dr. Hamburg might move to introduce a new wave of regulations on nutritional supplements. Mr. Hatch, who serves on the Senate committee that oversees the F.D.A., pressed Dr. Hamburg during her confirmation hearing to agree that the no new laws were needed.
''Do you agree with me and all former F.D.A. commissioners that I have chatted with,'' Mr. Hatch asked, that the agency had ''sufficient authority to regulate the dietary supplement industry and to protect consumers?''
Dr. Hamburg offered a diplomatic answer: ''This is really a complex issue. I want to take time to study and examine and work with you and others.''
Mr. Hatch's instincts were correct that the industry would come under assault, but the attacks would come from other directions. And just as he has in the past, he relied on help from lobbyists, including his son and former aides.
Scott Hatch and Jack Martin, a former Hatch aide, and four other onetime aides who have worked at lobbying firms have earned at least $3.9 million in fees in the last five years representing the industry, according to the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. (Mr. Hatch's office says his son does not lobby his father, leaving any contact between their offices up to Mr. Martin.)
''I do whatever they ask me to do many times because they've never asked me to do anything that is improper,'' Mr. Hatch told an industry association last year, speaking of Mr. Martin. ''And, besides, I believe in this industry.''
The most serious threat last year came from an unexpected source: Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Citing cases in which professional athletes had failed drug tests after using nutritional supplements that were secretly spiked with steroids, Mr. McCain proposed a law last February that would give the F.D.A. more power to review new ingredients in nutritional supplements before they were brought to market and require manufacturers to report any illnesses linked to supplements, not just serious ones, as Mr. Hatch had advocated.
The industry rallied, urging consumers to send e-mail messages and letters to members of Congress, including Mr. McCain, objecting to the measure.
''Opponents to this bill and their well-paid Washington lobbyists have spread false statements and rumors about the legislation, which is really a disservice to consumers, and instead proudly boast that they remain largely untouchable by the F.D.A.,'' Mr. McCain said on the Senate floor.
But after a meeting with Mr. Hatch, he soon abandoned his own legislation.
''We did it!'' the Alliance for Natural Health, a trade group, wrote to its members. ''It is time to celebrate your accomplishment.''
Mr. Hatch did help Mr. McCain press for some elements of his proposal -- pleasing the professional sports groups that had sought the legislation -- by getting them included in a separate Senate bill. A McCain aide said the senator considered those concessions a victory. Industry executives, who participated in the effort, believed that Mr. McCain largely backed off because he was concerned about the damage a highly motivated industry could do during his tough re-election fight in Arizona.
Mr. Hatch also worked to blunt other suggestions about the possible need for stricter regulation.
Congressional auditors issued a report last year concluding that nutritional supplement companies were too often making unjustified health claims and selling contaminated herbal products. The auditors said trace amounts of lead appeared in 37 of the 40 test cases.
At a Senate hearing, Gregory D. Kutz, the managing director for special investigations at the Government Accountability Office, held up a bottle of garlic capsules. Marketing materials, Mr. Kutz said, claimed that the pills could prevent and cure cancer, the common cold, obesity and diabetes.
''If these claims were true, imagine how this product could reduce health care costs in this country?'' Mr. Kutz said.
A clearly annoyed Mr. Hatch pressed the G.A.O. official to acknowledge that such claims were already illegal. He also asked that auditors concede that the contaminants in the supplements were too low to pose a health threat.
''Nobody's more interested in making sure that this industry works properly in the best interest of our people than I am,'' Mr. Hatch told Mr. Kutz. ''The trouble is the F.D.A. doesn't have the money to really do what it should do.''
Mr. Hatch also succeeded in making sure that new restrictions on supplements the industry objected to were not included in a landmark food safety bill.
Grateful industry executives thanked Mr. Hatch at a fund-raiser during the industry convention last June.
''It is important that you support your champions -- support people who support you,'' Mr. Hatch told the gathering. ''Even if you are a Democrat, you ought to be supporting me. Because I will help get other Democrats to straighten out their act to do what is right. And that will be a blessing to you.''
The Champions: Articles in this series will look at members of Congress and their advocacy for favorite industries or causes.

HEADLINE: Uranium Mine Moratorium Extended at Grand Canyon

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
The federal government on Monday extended for six months a moratorium on new uranium mining claims in a million-acre buffer zone around the Grand Canyon as it awaits the conclusions of a study of potential environmental harm to the region.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said that expanded uranium mining around the canyon could threaten water supplies, air quality, wildlife, desert vegetation and priceless scenery. Once lost, Mr. Salazar said, those assets can never be reclaimed. 
But he said he was not yet ready to declare the area off limits to new mining claims for the next 20 years, as many local and state officials and environmental advocates have demanded. He said in a briefing at the Grand Canyon that a 20-year moratorium was his preferred solution but that more scientific study was needed.
The decision represents at least a partial victory for environmentalists, who have grown increasingly uneasy in recent months as the Obama administration has, in their view, seemed to retreat on several environmental and regulatory fronts. They were particularly unhappy with Mr. Salazar's decision last month, under pressure from Republicans in Congress and energy interests, to reverse his own policy that would have set aside millions of federally owned acres as wilderness protected forever from energy exploration.
Mr. Salazar said that the relatively small number of existing mining claims around the canyon would be honored but that he was leaning strongly against allowing any new activity. He said he would make a final decision after an environmental impact statement was completed by the government this year.
''This alternative, if ultimately selected,'' he said, ''would ensure that all public lands adjacent to Grand Canyon National Park are protected from new hard-rock mining claims, all of which are in the watershed of the Grand Canyon.''
In 2009, Mr. Salazar placed a two-year moratorium on new uranium mining claims on a million acres of public lands surrounding the Grand Canyon, overturning a Bush administration policy that encouraged thousands of new claims when the price of uranium soared in 2006 and 2007. Many of the stakeholders are foreign interests, including Rosatom, Russia's state atomic energy corporation, and South Korea's state-owned utility.
That moratorium was to expire in July but will now be extended until the end of December.
The impact of Monday's decision on global uranium supplies and prices was expected to be modest. The United States is not a major supplier of uranium ore, and demand has been declining since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster in Japan, as countries including Germany, Italy and Switzerland move to cancel planned nuclear plants and reduce their dependence on nuclear power.
According to the United States Geological Survey, northern Arizona contains enough uranium to meet the American nuclear industry's needs for only about six years, and the Grand Canyon region holds just a fraction of that.
Representative Raul M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, has long been an opponent of uranium mining on public and tribal lands around the Grand Canyon. He said in an interview on Monday that Republicans might try to undo the decision to protect the land but that they would be, in his words, crawling uphill.
''It's typical of their heavy-handed approach, and they're going to lose on this one,'' Mr. Grijalva said. ''The canyon is a huge economic engine for tourism, a huge conservation issue and a huge issue of water supply for California and Las Vegas and the cities of Arizona.''
Representative Cynthia M. Lummis, Republican of Wyoming, denounced the decision, however, saying that the Obama administration's environmental policies were costing jobs and forcing the nation to look overseas for supplies of oil and critical minerals.
''It's a legacy of unemployment and high energy costs,'' Ms. Lummis said in a statement. ''We will not move this country forward until the war on Western jobs comes to an end.''

HEADLINE: Obama to Announce Plans For Afghan Surge Pullout

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and HELENE COOPER; Thom Shanker and Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama plans to announce his decision on the scale and pace of troop withdrawals from Afghanistan in a speech on Wednesday evening, an administration official said Monday.
As he closes in on a decision, another official said, Mr. Obama is considering options that range from a Pentagon-backed proposal to pull out only 5,000 troops this year to an aggressive plan to withdraw within 12 months all 30,000 troops the United States deployed to Afghanistan as part of the surge in December 2009.
Under another option, a third official said, Mr. Obama would announce a final date for the withdrawal of all the surge forces sometime in 2012, but leave the timetable for incremental reductions up to commanders in the field -- much as he did in drawing down troops after the surge in Iraq. 
The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said the president had not yet ''finalized'' his decision. But the planning for a rollout of the announcement was well under way, with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton scheduled to testify Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The White House said Mr. Obama would visit the Fort Drum Army base in upstate New York on Thursday. Fort Drum is home to the 10th Mountain Division, which has been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years.
Administration officials said Mr. Obama would most likely pull out the entire 30,000 troops by the end of 2012. What is still not known is how soon and how fast, though as the administration's deliberations wind down, the outlines of the main proposals are becoming clearer.
Some senior White House officials advocate a plan under which 15,000 troops would return by the end of this year and the other 15,000 by the end of 2012, said an official who was briefed on the deliberations. Backers of this timetable include retired Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, the president's senior adviser on Afghanistan.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has long pushed for the United States to curtail its military engagement in Afghanistan, favors a plan under which all 30,000 troops would be pulled out within 12 months, said this official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has said that the initial withdrawal should be modest, and that substantial combat forces should remain into next year's fighting season so as not to risk successes earned through the surge.
In keeping with that concept, according to Pentagon and military officials, would be an initial reduction this year of about 5,000 troops -- the size of a brigade -- followed by 5,000 over the winter, when fighting recedes. The final 20,000 troops could remain into the next autumn, through the 2012 fighting season.
The top military commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David H. Petraeus, met with Mr. Obama last Thursday and discussed a number of options with him, Mr. Carney said. But the precise options General Petraeus presented to Mr. Obama remain known to only a small group of senior officials.
Among the most intriguing proposals, an official said, is one advanced by officials at the State Department, under which Mr. Obama would announce no specific numbers of troops to be withdrawn. Instead, he would pledge to withdraw the surge force by a certain date, and leave the details to his commanders.
Gen. Ray Odierno, the former top commander in Iraq, oversaw the force reduction there under those terms. General Odierno, whom Mr. Obama recently nominated to be the chief of staff of the Army, has voiced reservations in recent days about making significant troop reductions in Afghanistan this year, an official said.
Another official said it was ''highly likely'' that the president would announce a plan with no initial numbers, though this person cautioned that Mr. Obama was keeping his cards very close to his chest.
If Mr. Obama decides to withdraw troops but leave as much of the combat force as possible in place, then among the first several thousand troops sent home could be support and service personnel. Among them would be logisticians and engineers, whose job is done after building barracks, runways and dining halls for the surge forces.
Even after all 30,000 troops are withdrawn, roughly 68,000 troops will remain in Afghanistan, twice the number as when Mr. Obama assumed office.
Senior administration officials said last week that they had made striking gains against Al Qaeda's terrorist network in Pakistan, which would provide a rationale for an accelerated reduction of troops. But Mr. Gates, who is leaving his job at the end of the month, has made a robust public case for a cautious path.
''Whatever decision he makes,'' Mr. Gates said Sunday on CNN, ''we will have a significant number of troops remaining in Afghanistan.'' In an acknowledgment that Mr. Obama is under pressure to begin a significant withdrawal, as he promised he would when he announced the surge in 2009, Mr. Gates said, ''The drawdown must be politically credible here at home.''
With the economy still fragile and the unemployment rate above 9 percent, Mr. Obama is being pressured by members of his own party to turn American resources away from the Afghanistan war -- where the United States spent $120 billion last year -- and toward economic programs at home.

HEADLINE: Shares Move Higher, Ending a Losing Streak as Investors Look Beyond Greece

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks rose broadly on Monday as the market ended its longest weekly losing streak in nearly a decade. Investors apparently put aside their concerns about the Greek financial crisis to focus on value. 
''In the short term, stocks have been oversold, and you're going to get some sort of bounce, whether justified or not, just for technical reasons,'' said Paul J. Simon, chief investment officer for the Tactical Allocation Group.
The Dow Jones industrial average added 76.02 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 12,080.38. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.86 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,278.36. The Nasdaq composite index gained 13.18, or 0.5 percent, to 2,629.66.
Health companies rose more than 1 percent on Monday, the largest gain among the 10 industry groups that make up the S.& P. 500 index. Financial companies lost 2.2 percent, the only group to lose ground.
The index eked out a tiny gain last week, breaking a six-week losing streak driven by concerns that American economic growth would falter in the second half of the year and that Greece's debt crisis would spread. The index is now 6 percent below the 2011 high it reached on April 29.
On Monday, the PNC Financial Services Group fell 2 percent after saying it would buy the United States retail operations of Royal Bank of Canada for $3.45 billion.
Whole Foods Market gained 2.2 percent after a BMO Capital Markets analyst upgraded the stock after a recent sell-off. And Wal-Mart Stores rose 0.4 percent after the Supreme Court blocked a sex discrimination lawsuit.
Signs that the European financial crisis may be contained helped ease investor concerns. European Union officials in Luxembourg said Monday that the group would raise its guarantees for bailout loans to raise market confidence.
European leaders failed over the weekend to agree on releasing more financial aid to Greece, saying the country must first agree to more budget cuts. Greece's recent efforts to reduce spending have led to street protests and political turmoil in Athens. The Greek government faces a confidence vote on Tuesday.
Prime Minister George Papandreou's newly reshuffled government is expected to prevail in the vote, and officials say they expect Greece to receive its next installment of emergency loans in July. A default by Greece could lead to losses for the banks that hold Greek bonds and more turmoil in financial markets.
Some analysts say investors are ready to move beyond the Greek crisis and focus on corporate earnings and the American economy.
''There's a little fatigue about hearing about the same problems, and there's no shock factor anymore,'' said Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services. Traders are starting to look ahead to the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which begins Tuesday, and the next round of corporate earnings reports, which will begin in July, he said.
Analysts predict that operating earnings per share for companies in the S.& P. 500 index will have risen 14 percent in the second quarter. They also expect the Fed to keep interest rates at nearly zero, a record low.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 4/32, to 101 14/32. The yield rose to 2.96 percent, from 2.94 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Mayors Call for a Quicker End to Wars So Money Can Be Used for Needs at Home

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The resolution that the United States Conference of Mayors passed on Monday calling on President Obama and Congress to ''speed up the ending'' of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was not nearly as strong as the one it passed 40 years ago, calling on President Richard M. Nixon to withdraw all American troops from Vietnam within six months. 
And the resolution passed only after it was amended to give the mayors and the Obama administration some wiggle room. The amended version reads that ''the drawdown of troops should be done in a measured way that does not destabilize the region,'' hardly a radical sentiment in Washington.
The original resolution called for bringing the money home to ''meet vital human needs,'' but the final version added that it should also be used ''to reduce the federal debt.''
But it was nonetheless a remarkable signal of both the nation's spreading war weariness and the lingering pain that the economic downturn has wrought on the nation's cities. Mayors from across the country voted Monday to approve a resolution that calls on the federal government to hasten the end of the wars and to ''bring these war dollars home to meet vital human needs, promote job creation, rebuild our infrastructure, aid municipal and state governments, and develop a new economy based upon renewable, sustainable energy and reduce the federal debt.'' As the resolution was debated at the conference's 79th annual meeting, in Baltimore, some mayors expressed reservations about lecturing the president and Congress on foreign policy, while others worried that it could send a disheartening message to American troops. So the resolution was amended to call for an accelerated yet ''measured'' withdrawal, and to add a passage noting that the mayors ''support our brave men and women and their families.''
The resolution was supported by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles, who became president of the conference at the meeting.

HEADLINE: Big Banks Lose Ruling On Research

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
A federal appeals court ruled on Monday that investment banks could not stop a financial Web site from immediately publishing the research recommendations of their stock analysts, delivering a blow to Wall Street and a win for the investing public.
Perhaps more significant, the decision was a victory for Internet companies whose business models depend upon summarizing and commenting on others' original content. Yet media businesses also cheered the ruling because it left in place legal protections against rogue competitors who copy and resell original news reporting at little or no cost. 
''It's a great decision for the free flow of information in the new media age,'' said Kathleen M. Sullivan, a lawyer who filed a brief in the case on behalf of two clients, Google and Twitter.
In a lawsuit closely followed by the world's largest financial, media and technology businesses, a panel of three judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan ruled that Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America could not dictate who reported news about their stock research - nor when they reported it.
The decision leaves in place all traditional federal copyright protections. For example, a site can report on the content of Wall Street research, meaning that it could run a headline like ''Morgan Stanley's semiconductor analyst upgrades Intel.'' But the site would violate copyright law if it reprinted the analyst's report on Intel verbatim.
''A firm's ability to make news - by issuing a recommendation that is likely to affect the market price of a security - does not give rise to a right for it to control who breaks that news and how,'' Judge Robert D. Sack wrote in the court's 88-page opinion.
The ruling reversed a controversial lower court decision made last year that required a financial Web site, theflyonthewall.com, to wait until 10 a.m. to publish news about Wall Street research that had been issued before the stock market's 9:30 a.m. opening bell. The site was also ordered to delay its headlines during the day by two hours.
The ruling effectively gave the banks' clients a chance to digest market-moving research before everyone else.
The banks had argued that the Web site's publishing headlines about a bank's upgrade or downgrade of a company's stock - often before the information was fully disseminated to the banks' clients - was tantamount to stealing intellectual property. They contended that delivering stock recommendations exclusively was key to their business because clients were more likely to trade with them if they learned of a stock recommendation from them rather than elsewhere.
Benjamin E. Marks, a lawyer for the banks, said in a statement that they were ''disappointed in the court's decision, and we are reviewing the decision to determine our next steps.'' He added: ''Each of the plaintiffs remains committed to protecting their equity research against unauthorized appropriation.''
The banks' lawsuit against theflyonthewall.com was based on a legal doctrine called ''hot news misappropriation,'' which is meant to protect organizations from stealing original content generated by competitors and reselling it. The original ''hot news'' doctrine evolved from a famous Supreme Court case in 1918, when The Associated Press successfully prevented the International News Service from appropriating its wire reports on the war in Europe.
With the rise of the Internet and digital media, the largely dormant ''hot news'' doctrine has become more relevant, as competitors can now copy content and repackage it as their own product with just a few keystrokes.
While the Second Circuit upheld the viability of a ''hot news'' claim - where one organization copies and resells news originally gathered by another - it said that the banks' case did not fall within this law. In this instance, the court said, the Web site was not ''free-riding'' on Wall Street firms' stock recommendations.
''The firms are making the news; Fly, despite the firms' understandable desire to protect their business model, is breaking it,'' Judge Sack wrote.
Corynne McSherry, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet freedom advocacy group, said that while the ruling preserves the protections of the ''hot news'' doctrine, it seems to limit its use.
''While it may have survived this case, it now appears to have been narrowed to within an inch of its life,'' Ms. McSherry said.
Media outlets applauded the ruling. The Associated Press, which submitted a brief to the court along with 13 other news organizations, including The New York Times, said in a statement that it viewed the decision ''as a victory for the news media and the public.''
''The ruling upholds the traditional protections of the news media against competitors who would copy the gathered news and resell it in direct competition with the original news gatherer,'' Andrew L. Deutsch, a lawyer who filed the brief on behalf of the companies. ''It preserves the economic incentive to engage in news gathering.''
Lawyers for Google and Twitter had argued that it was antiquated for a court to ban a Web site from immediately disseminating news. A Web site's swift republishing of facts - whether a bank's investment recommendation or a scoop from The New York Times - has become a firmly entrenched part of the news reporting ecosystem, they said.
''This ruling acknowledges the reality of new media,'' said Ms. Sullivan, the lawyer for the Internet companies. ''Hot news goes cold in a nanosecond.''
Theflyonthewall.com, a small outfit in Summit, N.J., has exploited this new reality. The site, which charges $65 a month and has thousands of subscribers, has called itself the ''fastest news feed on the web'' and ''a one-stop solution for accessing analyst's comments.'' In a statement, the company called the ruling ''a complete victory in its long-running battle with the investment firms.''
Even though the ruling directly affects cases only in the Second Circuit - New York, Connecticut and Vermont - the decision by the influential court is expected to reverberate in cases across the country.
Judge Sack is considered one of the country's leading experts on copyright law, which could enhance the ruling's influence.

HEADLINE: No Food Safety in These Numbers

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Cutting the FDA and WIC budgets puts us all at risk.

 BODY:
I'm eager to cover some curious and less depressing topics here - did you know Asian multi-millionaires are cornering the market on first-growth Bordeaux? - and equally eager to stop throwing mind-numbing numbers around. But as long as those pesky Republicans keep attacking the food supply for low-income people and food safety for all of us, and as long as most Democrats put up toothless defenses instead of actually trying to make things better, I gotta pay attention. If we needed further evidence that the party of "family values" only values wealthy families, we have it now; when these guys say "women and children first," they mean "first to throw overboard." 
The House's reactionary majority wants to dismantle two aspects of the Federal system that serve the majority of us not perfectly but decently: the Women, Infants and Children Program (WIC), one of the most effective of all social welfare programs, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), among whose jobs is the increasingly difficult one of protecting us from the kind of outbreak of E. coli that just killed at least 39 people in Germany, gravely - perhaps mortally - sickened another 800 and gave another couple thousand a few of those days none of us ever wants. 
As I wrote two weeks ago, we've had our share of foodborne illnesses in the past, but have not kept up with the increasing threat of E. coli. One in six Americans gets sick from the food we eat every year - that's about 48 million people, or enough to fill your average baseball stadium a thousand times with people having extremely unpleasant symptoms - and there are 3,000 food-related deaths annually. This is a food system that Georgia Congressman Jack Kingston calls "99.99 percent safe." I guess he wasn't one of the 16 percent last year who fell ill, but maybe he should talk to a million or two of them; they should be easy enough to find. As we near the 10th anniversary of 9/11, we're going to be reminded more and more of how much 3,000 deaths from hostile attackers can hurt. Yet put aside the questionable decisions we made in anger and sorrow that have cost us $1.2 trillion - and another 6,000 or so American lives - in wars whose benefits are far from clear. Think, instead, that the annual costs of food-borne illness are estimated to be around $152 billion a year, and consider that the entire proposed FDA budget is around $4 billion (three percent of that $150 billion), and that a measly $280 million or so of that (about one-fifth of one percent of that $150 billion) was destined for the Food Safety Modernization Act, which would expand activity geared toward protecting us from E. coli and other foodborne threats. 
In fact, the House majority proposes funding the FDA at nearly $87 million less than it's currently getting, and $205 million less than President Obama's modest request. Which means that the already-passed Food Safety Modernization Act probably will not even be implemented. Or, if funds are transferred from within FDA to allow its partial implementation, other FDA programs that are no less important - like the approval of medical devices and prescription drugs - will become less effective. 
Cutting FDA funds is a direct attack on the health and welfare of every person in this country; cutting WIC by 10 percent - that's the House's idea of fairness - may at first seem to affect fewer people, but a closer look shows good reason for us all to be concerned. It's estimated that half of all American infants and about a quarter of all kids under four have participated in WIC. Not only caring people but impartial people consider the WIC program money well spent: every dollar spent saves three in health care costs during the first two months of a child's life. Not a bad return on investment. 
Take that away, and who pays those added health care costs? You. Me. Us. (In general, Federal money absorbs about 60 percent of all health care costs; that number is greater, of course, if the people incurring those costs are low-income.) Yet the House version of the Agriculture Appropriations Bill would end food assistance for as many as 350,000 low-income women and children, and would put those women and children at risk for less-safe pregnancies, premature births, more infant deaths, worse nutrition and more. This from people who mostly claim to be "pro-life" yet for whom the great pleasure of claiming to "save" less than a billion dollars now outweighs the risk of spending many times that in the form of healthcare costs and mortality in the near future. Not to mention the suffering, which they don't. 
The numbers boggle the mind, but here it is, simply: With both FDA and WIC, we are talking millions in spending to save billions in health care costs. Shall we count the ways in which our representatives might save enough money to pay full freight for both of these programs, besides the future savings, besides coughing up 0.632 percent on what we've spent in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya? 
Let's see: reducing direct subsidies for commodity crops, which costs us at least $5 billion? Negative. Cutting subsidies for ethanol, another $6 billion? Nope. Reduction or elimination of the Bush tax cuts, which have cost us somewhere around $39 billion in just the seven months since their extension by our good-guy president (with, by the way, no significant decrease in unemployment, the ostensible reason for the extension)? Fuggedaboutit. An enforcement of the corporate tax rates, which would yield tens of billions? Hah! (In fact, Citizens for Tax Justice found that 12 corporations paid negative 1.5 percent tax on $171 billion in profits. In other words, we paid them a couple of billion so they could earn a couple of hundred billion. Nice work if you can get it.) 
The money for programs that improve our nutrition and food safety is there; it's just a matter of looking in the right places, and straightening out our priorities. As soon as that happens, we can worry about getting our hands on some of those Bordeaux.

HIGHLIGHT: A counterfeit Confederate coin reveals hidden truths.

 BODY:
PUB-DATE: June 22, 1861
It was a wicked and ingenious little cartoon. At a moment when the rebel government was busily inventing its national emblems, flags, postage stamps and currency, Harper's Weekly - the most widely read magazine in the North - presented its own modest proposal:a mockup of a new coin for the Confederate States of America. The illustration, deceptively simple at first glance, is one of those pictures that becomes more complex and meaningful the more that you look. It even offers some prophecies that were to come true during the next four years of civil war.
The anonymous artist yields not an inch to the pretensions of the new Southern republic - or, as his coin's obverse inscription calls it, the "Centrifugal States of North America." Beneath this is a classical temple, already showing cracks in its facade, and with an owl (harbinger of death and disaster) perched atop its pediment, wearing a dunce cap. The bird holds a torn and tattered American flag in its claws, while streaming from its beak is a ribbon with the Latin motto "Ex Uno Plurima" - "Out of one, many." Flanking the temple on either side are weapons that Northerners considered typical of Southern ruffians: a revolver and a bowie knife.
But most significant of all are the twin foundations on which the temple of the Confederacy stands: a bale of cotton and a kneeling black slave. In these details, the artist was taking the rebels at their own word. The cotton bale evoked an already famous 1858 speech by Sen. James Henry Hammond of South Carolina, in which the legislator challenged the North: "No, you dare not make war on cotton. No power on earth dares to make war upon it. Cotton is king." The crouching slave may well have referred to a more recent address by rebel Vice President Alexander H. Stephens, who in March 1861 had declared of the new Confederacy: "Its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth."
On the reverse of the coin, a stereotypical Southern planter - stringy hair, wispy goatee, broad-brimmed hat - thumbs his nose and points his six-shooter at a stout Yankee banker who is trying to present him with a bill. (The motto above them drives the point home: "Owe Ever, Pay Never.") In the background, slaves toil beneath the gaze of a lash-wielding overseer. Even the coin's denomination - half a dollar - is freighted with irony.
There is a larger irony at work here, too. History would prove the cartoonist strangely prescient. His coin design neatly encapsulates how those things that seemed, in 1861, to be the fundamental strengths of the Southern economy would soon prove its fatal weaknesses - flaws that already were hastening the Confederacy's demise.
Cotton and slaves were indeed the cornerstones of the antebellum South. Cotton exports in 1860 were about $192 million, or 90 percent of the South's total overseas trade. Southern secessionists counted on this to provide them with all-important diplomatic leverage: surely the European powers, especially England, would not allow a prolonged war that might risk interrupting the flow of this staple crop. The prospect of such an interruption would also prevent Northern industrialists from fully backing the war effort. Even if the war did prove a serious and protracted one, continued cotton exports - at inflated wartime prices - would finance the South's military machine.
But the dangerous consequences of having an economy based on a single crop soon became apparent. The Union blockade proved more effective than the South had predicted; exports soon dropped to less than a quarter of their prewar level. And those blockade-running ships that succeeded in eluding the U.S. Navy also usually eluded the Confederate revenue agents; the rebel government managed to collect export duties on only about 5 percent of all its cotton. Meanwhile, cut off from Northern supplies of wheat, corn, pork and beef, the South soon began experiencing food shortages, and before long, the government in Richmond actually began passing laws to limit cotton production, hoping thus to stimulate the growth of more edible crops.
Northern financiers, it is true, were hurt by the war, and some remained ambivalent supporters at best of the Union cause. But as the cartoon coin suggests, they also feared the consequences of having a myriad of heavily indebted Southern planters and merchants suddenly renege on their obligations. Moreover, they accurately perceived that the dogma of secession - which was, fundamentally, a form of anarchy enforced by violence - would hardly be good for business. And Northern manufacturers were eager to resume their lucrative export trade with the South. For the most part, the Yankees were ready to lay their money on the Union.
Moral issues aside, slavery proved even more disastrous as a basis for the South's wartime economy. In 1860, the South's 4 million enslaved human beings were worth between $3 billion and $4 billion: the largest single asset in the entire United States, representing more than the value of all the nation's railroads and factories combined. Slaves, even more than land, were Southern planters' safest and most lucrative investment. Prices had been skyrocketing - doubling in the 1850s alone. Natural human reproduction ensured a further return. Slaves could easily be rented, mortgaged, or liquidated. A planter's slaves were often, in modern terms, not just his work force, but also his stock portfolio.
In theory, secession was supposed to secure the long-term safety of this "property." In reality, the price of slaves plummeted as soon as the nation split apart, falling by as much as one-half during the first months of 1861. Despite the Confederate leaders' promises, canny Southerners seem rightly to have foreseen early on that a civil war would threaten the future of slavery. Thus, almost as soon as hostilities began, a vast portion of the Confederacy's net assets evaporated.
Slaves also began "evaporating" in a more literal sense. With the arrival of Union troops and the non-enforcement of fugitive slave laws, black Southerners began fleeing their plantations, crippling the cotton economy and worsening food shortages still further - as well as sapping the resources of Confederate troops, who were often called upon to recapture fugitives. Even those slaves who remained often became bolder at resistance and sabotage, especially as more masters and overseers left for the Confederate armies. Eventually, the rebel government even began exempting large planters from military service, lest the plantation system collapse completely.
The cartoon in Harper's suggests yet a further irony: the Confederate government would never actually succeed in issuing its own coinage. In early 1861, rebel agents commissioned a Philadelphia engraver named Robert Lovett to create for a one-cent piece. He had barely managed to create the dies and strike a dozen or so prototypes before war began. Lovett prudently broke his contract and stashed away the evidence. His Confederate pennies only came to light more than a decade later, when he got drunk and accidentally spent one in a local tavern. A lucky numismatist got wind of the discovery and purchased both the dies and the remaining pennies, which are now among the holy grails of coin collecting.
A few prototypes of a Confederate half dollar were also struck that year at the New Orleans mint after its seizure by rebel forces. But production there and at the other two federal mints in the slave states - Charlotte, N.C., and Dahlonega, Ga. - soon ceased. Although the Confederacy did have gold mines in the Carolinas and Georgia, they seem to have been mostly dormant during the war, perhaps due to lack of manpower. 
The Confederate government hoarded the relatively small reserves of precious metals that it managed to acquire. Gold and silver in circulation soon disappeared, much of it traded to the North or overseas for badly needed supplies. Instead, the Southern economy relied on paper money issued haphazardly by the central government, individual states, and private banks - as well as by scads of counterfeiters. (Some experts suggest that more fake Confederate banknotes were printed than real ones.) In an era when people still equated value with precious metals, the worth of this currency quickly plummeted, destroying more Southern fortunes and crippling the economy still further. Northern newspapers gleefully reported every fresh plunge of the Confederate dollar, boosting Union morale with these obvious portents of rebel distress.
The Harper's Weekly cartoon was prophetic in one final sense. Much of the Confederate paper money printed throughout the war did end up depicting cotton and slaves. Banknotes showed happy black workers toiling in the fields under the eyes of watchful overseers. The rebels themselves knew well what their economy and society were based upon. But many - or at least the designers of real Confederate currency - seem to have remained blissfully oblivious that they had engraved the very instruments of their own destruction.

HEADLINE: Revenue Still Down, Gannett Lays Off 700 Employees

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: Notices went out to 3 percent of the employees at the Community Publishing division, including papers like The Courier-Journal of Louisville and The Indianapolis Star.

 BODY:
Gannett confirmed on Tuesday what many newspaper publishers and employees across the country have feared since the recession officially ended two years ago: that the lagging economic recovery will force more downsizing.
Gannett said it would eliminate 700 jobs in its Community Publishing division, laying off 3 percent of its employees across newspapers like The Courier-Journal of Louisville, The Cincinnati Enquirer and The Indianapolis Star. The company's flagship paper, USA Today, just went through a round of cuts last summer and will not be affected by the layoffs. Employees who lost their jobs were notified on Tuesday.
Robert J. Dickey, president of the Community Publishing division, said that as the company looked at its disappointing midyear advertising figures, it was left with little choice.
"As we reach the midpoint of the year, the economic recovery is not happening as quickly or favorably as we had hoped and continues to impact our U.S. community media organizations," Mr. Dickey wrote in a memo to Gannett employees. "With many of our local advertisers reducing their overall budgets, we need to take further steps to align our costs with the current revenue trends." 
Many of the advertising categories that collapsed during the recession continued to lag at Gannett papers. Real estate, help wanted and even auto ads, which had rebounded somewhat, remain depressed.
In addition to eliminating jobs, Gannett is also planning a new round of furloughs to save money, a step it has taken several times in recent years. The latest round, which comes close on the heels of furloughs for many Gannett employees this year, will only affect people above a certain salary, mainly executives.
"These have been extremely difficult and painful decisions to make," Mr. Dickey wrote.

HEADLINE: In Albany, 'Big Three' Agree on Most Issues, Except Gay Marriage Vote

BYLINE: NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: Legislative leaders on Tuesday announced a tentative deal with Governor Cuomo to renew New York's rent laws, cap property taxes for homeowners, and raise tuition at state universities.

 BODY:
ALBANY - Legislative leaders said on Tuesday that they had reached a tentative deal with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on renewing New York's rent laws, capping property taxes for homeowners, and raising tuition at state universities, among other outstanding issues.
But the Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, said his caucus had not yet decided whether to bring to a vote the most contentious issue facing the Legislature: A bill introduced by Mr. Cuomo and approved by the Democratic-controlled Assembly to legalize same-sex marriage in New York. Thirty-one state senators have endorsed the marriage measure, one vote short of the number needed to pass in the 62-member senate.
Neither Mr. Skelos nor the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, offered any specifics as they emerged early Tuesday afternoon from a private meeting with Mr. Cuomo. Each leader said more details would come after they had briefed lawmakers later in the day. The annual legislative session had been scheduled to end Monday, but lawmakers have extended the session in an effort to address a number of thorny legislative matters.
"Most of those issues I think we're going to resolve very shortly," Mr. Skelos said. "We're working on the details, but I am very confident that between the governor - and he has shown tremendous leadership once again - and the speaker, showing flexibility, that we will have a session completion by tomorrow."
A spokesman for the governor, Josh Vlasto, confirmed that there was a "tentative framework agreement" with the two leaders but also provided no details. 
Mr. Silver said the deal on rent regulations would help the many New Yorkers who live in rent-stabilized apartments.
"It means that they will be able to sleep well," Mr. Silver said. "Hopefully we'll be able to expand the current protections."
But as details of the tentative deal began to dribble out, tenant advocates said they were bracing themselves for disappointment. Advocates involved in the negotiations said that they expected the thresholds at which an apartment could be deregulated to increase to $250,000 in annual household income from $175,000 and to $2,500 in monthly rent from $2,000. 
More critically, tenant groups said, was that the deal was not likely to index the income and rent figures to inflation. Tenant advocates said that they also were worried that the deal would leave intact much of the system of bonuses and increases tied to capital improvement that tenants groups have decried as loopholes through which landlords have illegally raised rents on thousands of apartments. 
Disagreements over property taxes and rent had emerged as obstacles to resolving the issue of same-sex marriage. Now, with the other issues near resolution, marriage is the one last major unresolved issue facing lawmakers, and a vote on that subject could come Wednesday or Thursday if Republican lawmakers agree to bring it to the Senate floor. Twenty-nine Democrats and two Republicans have publicly endorsed the measure, which would need support from one more Republican to win passage.
"We have not finalized the language in terms of religious protections," Mr. Skelos said of the bill on same-sex marriage. "That still is being reviewed. This conference meeting was to resolve all the other issues."
Tuesday's tentative deal effectively pairs one major priority of the Assembly Democrats, most of whom hail from New York City, with the top agenda item for Senate Republicans, most of whom hail from suburban and rural districts. 
The Democrats have sought to strengthen regulations that limit rent increases on more than one million apartments in New York City and its suburbs, while the Republicans have sought to limit the rate at which towns and school districts may increase property taxes, which in some New York communities are among the highest in the nation.
Both priorities were supported by Mr. Cuomo, a first-term Democrat.

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Pays $153 Million to Settle Mortgage Case

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The S.E.C. accused the bank of failing to tell investors that a hedge fund that helped create a collateralized debt obligation also bet that the investment would fail.

 BODY:
Mark Lennihan/Associated Press The Securities and Exchange Commission said JPMorgan Chase failed to disclose that a hedge fund helped create an investment marketed by the bank while also betting that the deal would fail. 
JPMorgan Chase has agreed to pay $153 million to settle allegations that it misled investors when it marketed a risky mortgage investment shortly before the housing market collapsed. The case is one of the largest, and most significant, legal actions against a Wall Street bank in the aftermath of the financial crisis. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday accused JPMorgan of securities fraud, saying the bank failed to disclose that a hedge fund helped create the mortgage investment while also betting that the deal would fail. 
When it did collapse, investors lost more than $100 million on the deal. The investors included a religious nonprofit group in Minneapolis, several Asian financial institutions and General Motors Asset Management, which manages the General Motors pension plans. 
The case closely mirrors the S.E.C.'s biggest enforcement matter in recent memory -- the 2010 action against Goldman Sachs, which was accused of selling a mortgage investment that was intended to collapse. In that case, the hedge fund giant John Paulson had helped create -- and bet against -- a mortgage investment sold by Goldman. The bank agreed to settle the case for $500 million. 
The S.E.C.'s case against JPMorgan focused on a collateralized debt obligation by the name of Squared CDO 2007-1. The hedge fund Magnetar Capital played a "significant role" in assembling the portfolio and was "poised to benefit" from its demise, according to the S.E.C.
In an internal e-mail, a JPMorgan employee said, "We all know [Magnetar] wants to print as many deals as possible before everything completely falls apart," according to the S.E.C.
In recent months, the S.E.C. has been examining the relationship between other Wall Street firms and Magnetar, which has not been accused of any wrongdoing. JPMorgan is the first to settle. 
 "JPMorgan marketed highly-complex CDO investments to investors with promises that the mortgage assets underlying the CDO would be selected by an independent manager looking out for investor interests," Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C.'s enforcement director, said in a statement. "What J.P. Morgan failed to tell investors was that a prominent hedge fund that would financially profit from the failure of CDO portfolio assets heavily influenced the CDO portfolio selection."
In a statement, JPMorgan said it "sustained losses of nearly $900 million in connection with" the investment. 
"We believe this settlement resolves all outstanding S.E.C. inquiries into JPMorgan's C.D.O. business," said Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman. The bank neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement.
The S.E.C.'s case against JPMorgan centers on the marketing materials for the Squared C.D.O. deal. The materials stated that the investment advisory arm of the GSC Capital Corporation assembled the portfolio. The documents failed to mention that Magnetar selected many of the assets and bet against the deal. 
The Squared deal's ultimate demise can be traced to the souring housing market. 
In early March 2007, JPMorgan executives were notified that the bank had already lost $40 billion on the portfolio. So in March and April of 2007, JPMorgan "launched a frantic global sales effort" to unload the deal, the S.E.C. said in a statement. The bank sought out a range of unlikely customers, including Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit life insurance group that acquired a $10 million stake in Squared. 
On March 22, 2007, the JPMorgan employee who was distributing the deal said in an e-mail that "we are so pregnant with this deal Let's schedule the cesarian (sic), please!" 
By early 2008, the securities were nearly worthless. Investors lost most of their money, totaling some $125 million. 
Magnetar, however, fared far better. When the Squared CDO deal closed in May 2007, Magnetar, based in Illinois, held a $600 million bet against the portfolio. 
In a statement, Magnetar said it is "not a party to the settlement nor a defendant in this case, and was not involved in the marketing of the securities."
Under the settlement with the S.E.C., JPMorgan agreed to reimburse the investors and change the way it reviews mortgage deals.
The S.E.C. also filed a complaint on Tuesday against a GSC employee who helped create the Squared CDO and draft the marketing materials.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
Today's Times In a win for big business, the Supreme Court threw out an enormous employment discrimination class-action suit against Wal-Mart. The suit had sought billions of dollars on behalf of 1.5 million women workers, claiming that the company's policies and practices led to countless discriminatory decisions over pay and promotions. The justices said the suit did not conform to the rules governing class-action suits, Adam Liptak reports. Business and labor groups were at odds over the ruling, but both sides agreed that the case was momentous. Mayors from across the country voted Monday to approve a resolution calling on the federal government to hasten the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, sending a remarkable sign of both the nation's spreading war weariness and the lingering pain that the economic downturn has had on the nation's cities. But the resolution from the United States Conference of Mayors was not nearly as strong as the one it passed 40 years ago during the Vietnam War, Michael Cooper reports. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, is well known throughout Washington for his strong and mutually beneficial alliance with the nutritional supplement industry. The Times's Eric Lipton examines Mr. Hatch's
remarkable success at writing legislation to protect the interests of the industry, which has repaid him with generous campaign contributions and corporate support of his favorite causes back home. Many public health experts say Mr. Hatch's advocacy has hindered regulators in preventing dangerous products from being put on the market.Around the Web Republicans are combating Democratic claims that their party is antiwoman with a coordinated effort to reshape the image of women in the party. The new breed, which Politico describes as "rock ribbed, younger, conservative working mothers," will deliver a series of speeches on the House floor called "I am a Republican Woman." In other news about Republicans in Congress, the Huffington Post reports that members of their freshman class have opened 22 political action committees since their election in 2010.Happenings around Washington Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates will host Japan's foreign minister, Takeaki Matsumoto, and its defense minister, Toshimi Kitazawa, for a meeting at the State Department. Later, Ms. Clinton will deliver remarks at the funeral service for former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will examine the nomination of Anne W. Patterson to be Ambassador to Egypt.

HEADLINE: Investors See Value in SABMiller's Bid for Foster's

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: After Foster's rejected the offer on Tuesday, shares of the Australian brewer surged, signaling that investors expect SABMiller to raise its price.

Foster's may have rejected SABMiller's $10 billion bid, but this isn't likely be the last call for the deal. 
After Foster's rejected the offer on Tuesday, shares of the Australian brewer surged, signaling that investors expect SABMiller to raise its price. Shares of Foster's are trading at 5.12 Australian dollars, roughly 4.4 percent higher than the deal on the table. 
SAB doesn't seem turned off by the snub, either. In a video interview, SAB's chief executive, Graham Mackay, indicated the company was pressing forward, saying the deal offers a "good value" to Foster's shareholders. 
"It's important to note that it's very early days in this process," he said. "SABMiller is seeking engagement with the Foster's board via constructive discussions to see if together we can develop this process." 
From SAB's perspective, the Australian market is attractive. Amid the commodities boom, the economy has grown at a robust 3.4 percent annually over the last five years, which contrasts starkly the anemic rate in the United States. 
Foster's is the largest beer maker in Australia, with a portfolio that includes 7 of the top 10 brands, including the No. 1 beer, Victoria Bitter. Relative to the global industry, margins are high, too.
But there's also a chance for SAB to eke out extra efficiencies at the company. As the Australian market broadly declines, Foster's is losing share, in part to the proliferation of craft beers. 
"There is a sense that Foster's business opportunity has not been maximized," said Benj Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry newsletter.
SABMiller has a strong record of deal-making. South African Breweries bought Miller from Philip Morris in 2002 for $5.6 billion to create SABMiller. Under the new leadership, the company turned around the moribund American brewer over the next few years, gaining share from the dominant leader, Anheuser-Busch. Its portfolio now includes a broad range of brands across the globe, matching fast-growing regions like China and Latin America with mature, cash flow-rich areas like Europe. 
The company's transition over the last decade mirrors the industry broadly. With rising commodity prices and pressures on margins, the largest players - Anheuser-Busch InBev, SABMiller, Heineken and Carlsberg - have been rapidly consolidating. The top four players now represent 50 percent of the beer market worldwide, up from 20 percent in the late 1990s.
