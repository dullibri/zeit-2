Previews and Openings
'Clybourne Park' (in previews; opens on April 19) After winning the Pulitzer Prize and becoming a hit in London, this Bruce Norris play moves to Broadway in this production, first seen at Playwrights Horizons in early 2010. Riffing on a situation depicted in Lorraine Hansberry's ''Raisin in the Sun,'' this satire on social prejudices jumps from 1959 to 2009, examining how we think and, more important, talk about race, then and now. Directed by Pam MacKinnon. Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David Rooney) 
'The Columnist' (in previews; opens on April 25) John Lithgow stars in David Auburn's new play as the renowned American journalist Joseph Alsop, who becomes embroiled in political and personal dramas as the mood in Washington shifts at the dawn of the 1960s. Returning to Manhattan Theater Club, Mr. Auburn is reunited with his director on ''Proof,'' Daniel Sullivan, in a production that also features Margaret Colin and Boyd Gaines. Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Don't Dress for Dinner' (in previews; opens on April 26) Roundabout aims to capitalize on the success of the Tony-winning 2008 revival of ''Boeing-Boeing'' with Marc Camoletti's sequel to his '60s sex farce. Back on the same stage where he played Valmont in ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' the British actor Ben Daniels steps into the shoes of Robert (the role played by Mark Rylance in ''Boeing-Boeing'') in the comedy about a romantic rendezvous gone awry. John Tillinger's production also stars Patricia Kalember, Adam James and Jennifer Tilly. American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Rooney)
'An Early History of Fire' (in previews; opens on April 30) Following the New Group's 2005 revival of ''Hurlyburly,'' David Rabe returns to the company with this premiere about America's loss of innocence, directed by Jo Bonney. Set in a small Midwestern town in the early '60s, the play focuses on a young man pulled between the grip of his immigrant father and the mind-expanding ideas of a woman returning from college in the East. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Fat Camp' (opens on Thursday) A multiple prize-winner at the 2009 New York Musical Theater Festival, this coming-of-age comedy about first love and self-image centers on a rock 'n' roll rebel marooned for the summer at a weight-loss retreat for chunky teenagers. The cast includes Carly Jibson, who was a memorable Tracy Turnblad during the Broadway run of ''Hairspray.'' American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, fatcampmusical.com. (Rooney)
'Ghost: The Musical' (in previews; opens on April 23) Yes, there's a new score by Dave Stewart (formerly half of Eurythmics) and Glen Ballard (a key collaborator of Alanis Morissette and Michael Jackson). But fret not, you won't be denied hearing the Righteous Brothers hit ''Unchained Melody,'' which had women flocking to pottery classes when the smash 1990 movie was released. Bruce Joel Rubin has adapted his Oscar-winning screenplay for the stage, with Matthew Warchus directing the afterlife love story. Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Rooney)
'In Masks Outrageous and Austere' (previews begin on Friday; opens on April 16) In the premiere of this baroquely titled final full-length play by Tennessee Williams, Shirley Knight stars as the richest woman in the world. With her gay husband and his young lover, she is thrust into a dimension of mystery and paranoia where they are held captive by omnipotent corporate forces. David Schweizer directs. Culture Project at 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, cultureproject.org. (Rooney)
'Leap of Faith' (in previews; opens on April 26) A couple of seasons ago it was race; now it's religion. Joining ''The Book of Mormon,'' ''Sister Act,'' ''Godspell'' and ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' in shining divine light on Broadway, this musical stars Raul Esparza as Jonas Nightingale, the con-man faith healer played by Steve Martin in the 1992 movie of the same name. Christopher Ashley directs the show, which has a book by Janus Cercone and Warren Leight, music by Alan Menken and lyrics by Glenn Slater. St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)

Second Stage, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Rooney)
'The Lyons' (in previews; opens on April 23) A hit downtown when it had its premiere at the Vineyard Theater, this Nicky Silver comedy transfers to Broadway. Described by Ben Brantley in The New York Times as a ''savagely sentimental portrait of familial loneliness,'' the play stars Linda Lavin as a tart-tongued Jewish mother whose brood regroups around a hospital bed, waiting for her husband to die. Mark Brokaw's production welcomes back the entire original cast, which includes Dick Latessa, Michael Esper and Kate Jennings Grant. Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Magic/Bird' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) After teaming up for the football-themed ''Lombardi,'' the playwright Eric Simonson and the director Thomas Kail continue to mine sports for drama in this N.B.A.-backed account of the rivalry between Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, which captivated basketball fans and yielded one of the most famous friendships in professional sports. Kevin Daniels and Tug Coker play the hoop stars. Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Massacre (Sing to Your Children)' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Brian Mertes directs this reconceived version of Jose Rivera's 2007 play, set in a small New Hampshire town where seven friends conspire to murder their mysterious neighbor. Presented by Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, the work has also spawned a pilot, again written by Mr. Rivera, for a one-hour HBO series called ''Mayhem.'' Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'A Midsummer Night's Dream' (in previews; opens on April 29) Invariably a magnet for top acting talent, Classic Stage has assembled an intriguing cast for Tony Speciale's production. With Bebe Neuwirth, Christina Ricci, Anthony Heald, Taylor Mac and David Greenspan on hand, this promises not to be another routine flit through Shakespeare's enchanted woods. Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Rooney)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' (in previews; opens on April 24) Following in the footsteps of ''Crazy for You,'' this new musical with a book by Joe DiPietro (''Memphis'') stitches nuggets from the Gershwin songbook into a Roaring '20s story of playboys, politicians, bootleggers and chorus girls. Fresh from her lauded work on ''Anything Goes,'' Kathleen Marshall directs and choreographs a stellar cast headed by Matthew Broderick, Kelli O'Hara, Estelle Parsons and Judy Kaye. Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Ninth and Joanie' (in previews; opens on April 18) A member of LAByrinth Theater Company since 2003, Brett C. Leonard (''Unconditional'') returns with this portrait of a South Philadelphia Italian-American family in crisis. Mark Wing-Davey directs a cast that includes Kevin Corrigan, Dominic Fumusa (''Nurse Jackie'') and Bob Glaudini. Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Rooney)
'One Man, Two Guvnors' (previews start on Friday; opens on April 18) Nicholas Hytner's hit production transfers from London, with James Corden (''The History Boys'') as a young man whose ravenous appetite and empty wallet force him to go to work for both a gangster and a criminal in hiding, while desperately trying to prevent them from meeting. Richard Bean's comedy updates Goldoni's ''Servant of Two Masters'' to 1960s Brighton, with skiffle music by Grant Olding. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Peter and the Starcatcher' (in previews; opens on April 15) After a hit downtown run at New York Theater Workshop, this ''Peter Pan'' origin story, adapted by Rick Elice (''Jersey Boys'') from the best seller by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson, moves to Broadway. Christian Borle (''Smash''), Adam Chanler-Berat and Celia Keenan-Bolger star in the imaginative mix of old-fashioned story theater, song and playful hipster humor, directed by Roger Rees and Alex Timbers. Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Rooney)
'A Slow Air' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Arriving in New York from the Tron Theater in Glasgow and last summer's Edinburgh Festival Fringe, this drama written and directed by the Scottish playwright David Harrower (''Blackbird'') weighs the impact of the 2007 Glasgow Airport attacks through the eyes of a family from the village where the terrorist activity was planned. The production kicks off 59E59's Scotland Week celebrations. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Rooney)
'A Streetcar Named Desire' (in previews; opens on April 22) From the same producing team behind the all-black 2008 revival of ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' comes this multiracial rethink on another Tennessee Williams classic. Waging the war between delusional fantasy and brutal reality this time are Nicole Ari Parker as Blanche and Blair Underwood as Stanley, with Daphne Rubin-Vega as Stella and Wood Harris as Mitch. Emily Mann directs a production that features original music by Terence Blanchard. Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'You Better Sit Down: Tales From My Parents' Divorce' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Thursday) Four members of the investigative theater troupe the Civilians sat down with their parents to get the real story behind their marital breakdowns and came up with this candid reflection, made entirely from verbatim interviews. Anne Kauffman directs. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org. (Rooney)
Broadway
- 'Anything Goes' Kathleen Marshall's zesty revival of Cole Porter's hit-packed musical embodies the essence of escapist entertainment in the 1930s, when hard times called for bold smiles, tough wisecracks and flashy fantasies. Sutton Foster is sensational as the nightclub evangelist Reno Sweeney (2:30). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Death of a Salesman' Mike Nichols has created an immaculate monument to Arthur Miller's masterpiece, starring a deeply thoughtful, if uneasily cast, Philip Seymour Hoffman. The production is exceptionally lucid, but the experience is rather dutiful, like visiting a great historic landmark. The dedicated cast includes Linda Emond, Andrew Garfield and the excellent Bill Camp and Finn Wittrock (2:40). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'End of the Rainbow' As befits a portrait of a woman who mixed her pills, Peter Quilter's pathography about the late-career Judy Garland is an upper and a downer. As biodrama, it is formulaic and lurid. But as Garland, Tracie Bennett is sensational, in every sense of the word, in an intense, visceral performance that transcends impersonation (2:10). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, endoftherainbowbroadway.com. (Brantley)
'The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess' As the fatally conflicted Bess, the extraordinary Audra McDonald is a gale force of emotion in Diane Paulus's slimmed-down musical adaptation of the landmark 1935 opera. Otherwise, despite a likable performance from Norm Lewis as Porgy, this production feels cloudy and mild, only rarely acquiring the majesty of the opera that inspired it (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Godspell' Oh, dear Lord: the beloved 1971 musical that turned biblical parables into teachable moments has been stuffed fruitcake-full of jokey contemporary allusions. Performed by a peppy young cast, the show is like being stuck in a rec room with kids who have been too reckless with the Red Bull (2:30). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Gore Vidal's The Best Man' James Earl Jones and Angela Lansbury all but steal the show from their more junior players in the director Michael Wilson's starry but sluggish revival of a 1960 play about the corruption of the country's political discourse. John Larroquette and Eric McCormack are the contrasting types vying for the presidential nomination, Candice Bergen and Kerry Butler their matching wives (2:30). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Jesus Christ Superstar' Another op'nin', another crucifixion. Des McAnuff's flashy modern-dress revival of the Tim Rice-Andrew Lloyd Webber pop-rock musical features a tasty villain in Josh Young's Judas Iscariot, but Mr. McAnuff's sleek staging cannot mask the musical's absurdities (2:00). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy Strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins led by the charismatic Jeremy Jordan. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
- 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Other Desert Cities' Jon Robin Baitz's family drama is so good that you may not even realize how good it is while you're watching it. Joe Mantello directs a sublime cast that expertly elicits the pain and the comfort of blood ties (2:00). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Seminar' Jeff Goldblum stars in Theresa Rebeck's shiny, facile comedy about an ego-shredding writing teacher. Full of efficiently mapped reversals, the play feels as if it were written according to the literary equivalent of a GPS device. Sam Gold is the smooth director (1:40). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Brantley)
- 'Venus in Fur' The incandescent Nina Arianda recreates her dazzling turn as an actress auditioning for the role of a 19th-century dominatrix in David Ives's seriously funny sex comedy about power games at an audition. Hugh Dancy holds his own as the writer-director who may be discovering more than he wants to know about the destabilizing nature of desire (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'The Berenstain Bears Live! In Family Matters, the Musical' The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children's book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it's rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 5 West 63rd Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. (Laurel Graeber)
'Beyond the Horizon' Eugene O'Neill's bleak 1920 drama, a tale of two brothers beaten up by bad choices and bad karma, has been given a dutiful revival by the Irish Repertory Theater. Directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, this is a one-foot-in-front-of-the-other march into a grim destiny that even Thomas Hardy might have deemed excessive (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Brantley)
'The Big Meal' Dan LeFranc's comedy-drama telescopes more than three generations of family life -- and family strife -- into a brisk 85 minutes. An excellent cast under the skilled direction of the busy Sam Gold doesn't quite disguise the play's emphasis on style over substance (1:25). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com, playwrightshorizons.org. (Isherwood)
'The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith' Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith's songs with talk about her life, loves and career. That format seems a bit tired, but Ms. Braden gives it her all (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
- 'Edward Albee's The Lady From Dubuque' Edward Albee throws a mean party in this scintillating revival of a much-maligned play, in which death comes to call wearing pearls. David Esbjornson directs a crackerjack cast that includes Michael Hayden, Laila Robins and, in the title role, a serenely commanding Jane Alexander (2:00). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Brantley)
- '4000 Miles' Amy Herzog's beautifully rendered portrait of the growing affection between an old-style lefty grandmother and her new-style lefty grandson features superlative work from the actors in these roles: Mary Louise Wilson and Gabriel Ebert. Plays that are as funny and truthful and touching as Mr. Herzog's gentle comedy-drama come along but once or twice a season, and that's if we're lucky (1:40). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
- 'Gatz' Elevator Repair Service's word-for-word presentation of ''The Great Gatsby'' chronicles one reader's seduction by a single, ravishing novel. The astonishing Scott Shepherd is the reader, a bored employee in a shabby office, and a first-rate ensemble embodies both his fellow workers and the characters he brings to life. John Collins directed this work of rare imagination and intelligence (6:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
- 'Lost in Yonkers' There are no flashy directorial or design touches in Jenn Thompson's warmly satisfying revival for TACT/The Actors Company Theater of the Pulitzer- and Tony-winning 1991 Neil Simon play, one of his most affecting works. Instead, the director and her very solid cast find just the right delicate balance of tenderness, melancholy and humor in this story of a 1940s New York family, whose damage is traced back to the emotional scars of its steely German-Jewish immigrant matriarch (2:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
- 'A Moon for the Misbegotten' This sure-footed revival does justice to Eugene O'Neill's final completed play, a heartsick valentine to his wastrel brother. Kim Martin-Cotten and the splendidly understated Andrew May wring nearly every sodden, soulful moment out of O'Neill's towering romance (3:30). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Eric Grode)
- 'Now. Here. This.' The lovable gang from ''[title of show]'' is back with a similarly sweet and happily self-conscious new musical tracing their paths from youthful misfit-dom to the stage. Slighter and less original than their first collaboration, it's nevertheless performed with an audience-embracing brio by the talented cast under Michael Berresse's direction (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Regrets' Matt Charman's drama, set at a Nevada motel where men park themselves for six weeks to escape their marriages, is set in 1954 and almost feels as if it was written then, so definitively antique is its dramaturgy. Brian Hutchison shines in an uneven cast under the direction of Carolyn Cantor (2:00). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Isherwood)
'Rent' Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.'' The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson's watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home. It is as if they're reluctant to make this show their own (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Silence! The Musical' A silly, coarse musical spin on ''The Silence of the Lambs'' as pitched to obsessive fans (1:30). 9th Space Theater at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Jason Zinoman)
'Sistas: The Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs. From ''Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do'' to ''Single Ladies,'' you could do a lot worse (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Sleep No More' Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths' career as a movable orgy. The result suggests what might have happened if Stanley Kubrick (of ''The Shining'') had designed the Haunted Mansion at Disney World (2:00). The McKittrick Hotel, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, sleepnomorenyc.com. (Brantley)
'The Soap Myth' Jeff Cohen's story of a Holocaust survivor determined to preserve his memories of a particular Nazi atrocity feels a bit more like a discussion than a drama. But presented by the National Jewish Theater, it's a cogent, astute one, with a genuinely moving conclusion (1:30). Black Box Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 352-3101, nationaljewishtheater.com. (Gates)
'The Taming of the Shrew' Andy Grotelueschen is a burly, goofy Petruchio and Maggie Siff his glowering but ultimately tender Kate in Arin Arbus's lively production of Shakespeare's comedy, set on the American frontier in the 19th century (2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org. (Isherwood)
'Traces' An energizing evening of acrobatics from the Montreal troupe Seven Fingers. Think of it as cirque du cabaret, in which a group of distinctive talents gets to show off the physical equivalents of individual song stylings (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
- 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'Voca People' This show features space aliens, but it's really all about a cappella music. The visitors have crash-landed on Earth in a ship powered by music, and lots of singing must be done to refuel their ship. The eight singers sound pretty good, but most of the show consists of fragments of songs, which becomes annoying; only when the cast is allowed to cut loose and deliver an entire song -- the Doors' ''People Are Strange'' is a highlight -- do things reach their full potential (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
Off Off Broadway
'Mama, I Want to Sing' A largely new cast (seeded from the Gospel for Teens program in Harlem) gives full-throated life to this long-running gospel musical. Quibbles about the thin plot and questionable acting go out the window with each and every tune -- and there are plenty of them. Saturday only (2:00). The Dempsey Theater, 127 West 127th Street, Harlem, (212) 868-4444, mamafoundation.org. (Grode)
'That Ain't No Lady' The doyenne of New York's now-defunct annual outdoor drag festival, Wigstock, Lady Bunny purveys bawdy stand-up and pornographic pop song parodies in her first new cabaret act in 10 years. Looking like Dusty Springfield on steroids and introduced ''direct from the Port Authority men's room,'' the Lady and her show are definitely not for the prudish. But anyone feeling nostalgic for the seedy old days before Times Square became a tourist-friendly theme park will get a kick out of this evening of big hair and bad manners. Tuesday only (1:30). La Escuelita Cabaret Theater, 301 West 39th Street, (212) 631-0588, brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)

Last Chance
'Carrie' (closes on Sunday) This exceedingly sober revival of a fabled flop musical from the 1980s, based on Stephen King's classic horrors-of-high-school novel, is as minimal and subdued as a little black choir robe, which means that it isn't much fun. Molly Ranson is a tad too sane as the vengeful Carrie, but Marin Mazzie is very good as her demented mother (2:15). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Brantley)
- 'Elephant Room' (closes on Sunday) A passel of downtown stalwarts have assembled this trashy, tricky, triumphant blend of sleight-of-hand and lovable-loser schtick. Picture the ''My Name Is Earl'' cast putting together a Vegas magic act (1:15). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (866) 811-4111, stannswarehouse.org. (Grode)
'Look Back in Anger' (closes on Sunday) Sam Gold's stylized staging of John Osborne's 1956 drama about a working-class lad with the weight of a stifling social system on his shoulders wins points for ingenuity -- the stage is about three feet deep -- but in the crucial central role, Matthew Rhys (television's ''Brothers and Sisters'') never locates the genuine pain beneath the surface rage (2:10). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 352-3101, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
- 'No Place to Go' (closes on Sunday) An immensely appealing cabaret of anxiety, from Ethan Lipton, who muses on job loss and financial uncertainty through song. Assisted by his fine three-piece band, Mr. Lipton wills himself into a mongrel show-biz alter-ego -- part lounge crooner, part folk balladeer -- to connect with his own worldly (and universal) woes (1:30). Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'Painting Churches' (closes on Saturday) Kathleen Chalfant and John Cunningham are ideal interpreters of the fading Boston blue bloods at the center of Tina Howe's 1983 family portrait, their patrician airs masking fear and fragility. But as the artist daughter who arrives from New York to paint their portrait and help the elderly couple pack up their lives for a move necessitated by failing health and diminished means, Kate Turnbull is outclassed. The same goes for the director Carl Forsman in a pedestrian revival that smudges the subtleties of Ms. Howe's delicate play (2:10).

'A (radically condensed and expanded) SUPPOSEDLY FUN THING I'LL NEVER DO AGAIN (after David Foster Wallace)' (closes on Saturday) The endless title is apt: Daniel Fish's theatrical homage to the po-mo literary icon honors the writer's brilliant but hardly economical style. Probably strictly for Wallace worshipers (2:30). Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org. (Isherwood)
'Rated P for Parenthood' (closes on Sunday) Half of the time, Sandy Rustin, Dan Lipton and David Rossmer's musical about the joys and trials of having children is touching and wistfully funny. The rest of the time, it offers nothing more than we're-all-alike platitudes, shakily conveyed (1:25). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
'Rutherford & Son' (closes on Saturday) The Mint Theater revives Githa Sowerby's grimly unsentimental 1912 drama about John Rutherford, the owner of a glassworks in northern England, and the misery he has wrought on his children's lives. Directed by Richard Corley, this production remains a static and slightly musty affair (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Saltz)
'Swell' (closes on Saturday) Juliacks's floridly ornate graphic novel about a bereaved family (particularly a daughter, Emmeline), is an immersive experience for brave readers. This profoundly visual stage adaptation offers a similarly lush stream of consciousness, one so encompassing that it almost proves overwhelming. But Emma Galvin, as the main character, anchors it and leaves you grateful for having made her character's acquaintance (1:15).

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: 'NOW. HERE. THIS.': The lovable gang from ''[title of show]'' is back with a similarly sweet and happily self-conscious new musical tracing the actors' paths from youthful misfit-dom to the stage.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Hit 4-Year Low

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans applying for new jobless benefits fell to the lowest level in nearly four years last week, according to a government report Thursday. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 357,000, the lowest level since April 2008, the Labor Department said.
The claims data could bolster the case that the labor market was reducing the need for the Federal Reserve to do more to stimulate growth.
New claims have fallen sharply in recent months, raising expectations that the end of a long cycle of heavy layoffs will lead to more hiring.
''You put this number with the other job numbers we have seen and they show the labor market continues to grow,'' said Stan Shipley, an economist at ISI Group in New York.
The St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank president, James Bullard, who is not a voting member of the Fed's policy setting committee this year, said on Thursday that the central bank should now pause and assess developments in the economy.
The four-week moving average for new claims, a more reliable measure of labor market trends, declined by 4,250, to 361,750.
''The claims data are consistent with modest job growth in March,'' said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York.
The Labor Department report showed continued claims, which counts people still receiving benefits under state programs after an initial week of aid, fell to its lowest since August 2008.

HEADLINE: Germany Reaches Accord on Tax Evaders

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Switzerland agreed Thursday to a revised tax deal with Germany under which it would pay billions of dollars on funds hidden in its banks by German tax dodgers, the latest step in an international charm offensive that is meant to salvage at least some of the country's famous banking secrecy. 
The accord , which was made tougher after a September deal was criticized by the German opposition and officials in Brussels, provides for the assessment of a one-time charge of 21 percent to 41 percent of the value of secret German accounts, higher than the original agreement of 19 percent to 34 percent. Swiss banks that are home to such accounts would make payments to the German government.
Anyone inheriting such an account will have to either pay a 50 percent tax or disclose its existence to the German authorities. And henceforth, taxes on investment income will be withheld at the standard German rate.
Crucially, from the point of view of maintaining Swiss banking secrecy, account holders' names will not be revealed to Berlin, and the Swiss authorities will be responsible for ensuring that taxes are paid on behalf of the account holder, who can remain anonymous if desired.
The German Finance Ministry estimated that a one-time payment of back taxes could bring it a windfall of up to 10 billion, or $13 billion, with annual payments of 750 million a year thereafter.
Still, ratification of the deal by the German Parliament is not assured. Members of the Social Democrats and the Greens, opposition parties that together have sufficient votes in the upper house to block it, have argued that the measures are too lenient on tax cheats.
A German Finance Ministry spokesman, who could not be identified according to ministry policy, said, ''We think there is a good chance that this will get through Parliament.''
Switzerland signed a similar deal with Britain on March 20. Both the British and German agreements met with criticism from European Commission officials, who argued that it was not the job of individual member states to negotiate tax relations with nonmembers. Switzerland does not belong to the European Union.
Seeking to overcome the country's reputation as the biggest offshore tax haven in the world, Switzerland has in recent years moved against money laundering and reached more than 40 deals providing for the exchange of tax data with other governments.
''Foreign investors in Switzerland should be taxed at the rates of their country of residence,'' Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, the Swiss president, said Thursday in a statement, adding: ''I am confident that this system will bring benefits as soon as it enters into force. I am also confident that other states will recognize this and will arrange agreements with Switzerland.''
The United States, which is carrying out criminal investigations of Swiss banks for helping Americans evade taxes, remains the biggest source of uncertainty for the Swiss financial sector, and officials in Bern are eager to reach a deal to end those inquiries.
Ms. Widmer-Schlumpf last month told the International Herald Tribune that the Swiss were ready to reach a deal ''tomorrow'' if Washington were ready.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Company Gingrich Founded to Offer Health Care Advice Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL; Mike McIntire contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A consulting company founded by Newt Gingrich filed for bankruptcy on Thursday, an apparent casualty of Mr. Gingrich's stepping down from the business to run for the Republican presidential nomination. 
The company, the Center for Health Transformation, charged up to $200,000 annually to big drug makers, insurance companies and hospitals for Mr. Gingrich's advice, including what he had to say about working the corridors of Washington power, although Mr. Gingrich has insisted he was not a lobbyist.
The company, at its height, had offices in Washington, Atlanta and St. Louis, about three dozen employees and clients that included Novo Nordisk, the American Hospital Association and Microsoft.
Mr. Gingrich had previously reported a sizable financial stake: In a financial disclosure last year, he listed his largest asset as a promissory note worth $5 million to $25 million from the Gingrich Group, which said it does business as the Center for Health Transformation.
Clients of the company spoke weekly or monthly by phone with Mr. Gingrich, depending on how much they paid, and they attended quarterly conferences to exchange ideas.
Mr. Gingrich severed his operational ties with the center once he entered the presidential race last May. Without him, clients drifted away, according to a person familiar with the company. At a client gathering in Washington recently, fewer than 20 attended, the person said.
''At the end of the day, the draw that made it economically attractive was Newt's brain,'' said Stefan Passantino, Mr. Gingrich's lawyer, who formerly represented the center.
The bankruptcy filing, in federal court in Atlanta, listed liabilities of $1 million to $10 million owed to 50 to 99 creditors. Some positions Mr. Gingrich advocated after founding the center in 2003 proved out of step with the sharp turn by the Republican base against government spending. Mr. Gingrich, for instance, backed President George W. Bush's expansion of Medicare to add a prescription drug benefit.
In an April 2006 newsletter, he called the overhaul of health care in Massachusetts by Gov. Mitt Romney ''exciting'' and praised its requirement to buy health insurance, the model for the Obama administration's universal mandate.
''The individual mandate requires those who earn enough to afford insurance to purchase coverage, and subsidies will be made available to those individuals who cannot afford insurance on their own,'' Mr. Gingrich wrote at the time in a newsletter.
As a candidate, he reversed course on a mandate and claimed to have ''fought it for two and a half years at the Center for Health Transformation.''

HEADLINE: Album Might Have a Presidential Tie

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
Ian Brabner, an Americana dealer in Delaware, is bringing an 1870s photo album that he says has a presidential connection to the New York Antiquarian Book Fair, opening Thursday at the Park Avenue Armory. Last year at a Maryland estate auction, Mr. Brabner said, he unwittingly bought images of maternal ancestors of Stanley Ann Dunham, President Obama's mother, in Kansas and Ohio.
The brown leather book, with gold-colored clasps, contains 35 pictures. Handwritten inscriptions mention the Wolfley, Preston, Jager and Abbott families. Mr. Brabner said a few people were clearly labeled, including Anna Wolfley, the president's great-great-great aunt, and Elmer Preston, a distant Obama cousin. 
''Future scholarship or facial recognition technology may identify further kinship ties to Mr. Obama from many of the album's photographs,'' Mr. Brabner wrote in a label for the book fair.
The auction house had described the artifact as a run-of-the-mill 19th-century lot. Mr. Brabner said his Web and library searches revealed the genealogical connections.
The album is now priced at $45,000. (Mr. Brabner has not disclosed his purchase price.)
Christopher Challender Child, a specialist in Obama family research at the New England Historic Genealogical Society in Boston, said Mr. Brabner's research agreed with findings over the years and the album discovery was newsworthy. He added that Anna Wolfley's resemblance to President Obama was ''really uncanny.''
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the album.
A FREED SLAVE'S DESIGNS
No one knows what Willie Howard, a freed slave in Mississippi, meant to convey with his appliques on wooden furniture. His only known works, two 1870s desks, are wrapped in silhouettes of weapons, snakes, bottles, woodworking and blacksmithing tools, and farm and kitchen implements.
Scholars have speculated that he was chronicling his traumatic prewar experiences while exulting in his newfound creative freedom. ''It's literally being able to do whatever he wants to do, and still incorporating that memory of plantation life,'' said Alyce Perry Englund, an associate curator at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford.
In January the two desks appeared at New York antiques fairs. The Wadsworth bought one from the Ricco/Maresca Gallery at the Metro Show, and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts bought the other from the antiques dealer Jeffrey Tillou at the Winter Antiques Show. The museums did not disclose the amounts paid, but Maine Antique Digest reported the asking prices as $300,000 (Ricco/Maresca) and $400,000 (Tillou).
The dealers did not plan for the simultaneous offerings of the desks, which a Mississippi dealer had found decades ago. ''Talk about incredibly bizarre coincidence,'' said Frank Maresca. Mr. Tillou said, ''We both maybe helped sell the other one.''
Recent research suggests that Howard was born in Africa, though how old he was when captured or when he arrived in America are not known. What is clearly recorded is that he worked alongside about 200 other slaves at Kirkwood, a plantation near Jackson. Catherine McWillie, his last owner, wrote after the Civil War that she hoped Howard and his family would choose to spend ''a long and useful life'' at Kirkwood. By the early 1900s the McWillies had razed their 1840s Greek Revival house; their cemetery survives in the woods there.
The Wadsworth desk is rather masculine, with a dark crusty finish and broad overhanging drawers, while the Minneapolis desk has a honey tone and a top band of almost delicate dentils. The interiors of both were cobbled together from old crates, with occasional markings for Northern cotton mills and Southern tobacco packagers. ''You were making do with what you had, in a really difficult economic climate,'' said Corine Wegener, an associate curator at the Minneapolis Institute.
Howard's works will go on view in the next few weeks. Curators in various departments at the two museums have been vying to show the versatile desks, which are compatible with quilts, slave shackles, African statues, outsider art, Louise Nevelson sculpture and Fornasetti mid-20th-century collaged screens.
DEAR GENERAL...
The Minneapolis philanthropist Allyn Kellogg Ford made his early-20th-century fortune on clothes whiteners and spent part of it buying military correspondence. He collected letters of Revolutionary War leaders, especially 1781 missives written to Brig. Gen. George Weedon explaining how American troops were strategizing at Yorktown, Va.
''We shall soon know whether the whole is a farce,'' George Washington's aide-de-camp Jonathan Trumbull skeptically wrote to Weedon, when Cornwallis offered to surrender.
A preview for a sale of the letters opens Saturday at Swann Auction Galleries in Manhattan, with estimates mostly of a few thousand dollars a page. Weedon's descendants had kept the material together. Ford acquired it in 1927 and his family later donated it to the Minnesota Historical Society, which has consigned it to Swann.
In a statement released through Swann, the society wrote that the sale will help it better fulfill its mission ''of chronicling Minnesota's history through a wide range of artifacts and materials,'' and the profits will be used to acquire ''new historical items that preserve and tell the story of Minnesota's past.''
Historical societies are cash strapped nationwide. But breaking up a cohesive scholarly gift like the Weedon papers remains unusual. ''You don't see these kinds of large collections getting sold very frequently,'' said E. Lee Shepard, the vice president for collections at the Virginia Historical Society. He added that he would ''never second-guess another institution'' for choosing what to disperse, and that the Weedon papers fortunately have been documented and published.
The Swann sale also includes Ford's letters documenting turning points in later American wars. An 1847 letter from Zachary Taylor ($10,000 to $15,000) reports on casualties for both sides in the Mexican-American War, ''enough so on ours to cover the whole country with mourning.''
In an 1865 letter ($4,000 to $6,000) Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman wrote from South Carolina about troops gearing up to ''get the railroad broken.'' Freed slaves were eager to help fight, and Sherman shrewdly suggested that anyone opposing ''the policy of arming Negroes'' should be asked to file grievances with the secretary of war's office.

HEADLINE: Obama Signs Bill to Promote Start-Up Investments

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, eager to promote his administration's efforts to revive the job market on the eve of another politically significant employment report, signed a bill on Thursday that will roll back restrictions on the way start-up companies can raise money from individual investors.
Mr. Obama, surrounded by a bipartisan tableau of lawmakers and entrepreneurs, said the bill known as the JOBS Act, for Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups, was a ''potential game changer'' for fledgling businesses in need of financing. Among other things, it would allow them to raise small sums from investors via the Internet. 
''For the first time, ordinary Americans will be able to go online and invest in entrepreneurs that they believe in,'' Mr. Obama said in a ceremony in the Rose Garden, as Republican supporters of the law, including Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, looked on.
New businesses generate almost every new job in the United States, Mr. Obama said, hence the bill's acronym. On Friday, the White House will highlight another facet of its jobs campaign with a daylong forum on women and the economy.
The bill-signing set the stage for Friday's release of the monthly employment report by the Labor Department, which has become an important political barometer for the presidential election. There have been signs of strengthening in the last several employment reports.
''Our economy has begun to turn a corner,'' the president said, ''but we've still got a long way to go. We've still got a lot of Americans out there who are looking for a job or looking for a job that pays better than the one that they've got.''
Responding to critics who say the law will open the door to investor fraud, the president insisted that these Web sites would be closely monitored by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He also appealed for adequate funding for the S.E.C., shooting a glance at Mr. Cantor and his fellow Republicans.
But the White House was mainly celebrating a rare bipartisan achievement on legislation that had been by pushed by Republicans and embraced by Mr. Obama in his State of the Union address. Most of the administration's $447 billion jobs bill has little chance of being passed by a hostile Congress in an election year.
Mr. Cantor joined in the unusual display of harmony, saying to reporters at the White House after the ceremony: ''I hope it represents the kind of bipartisan work that we can accomplish here in Washington over the next few months. We have a very difficult economic situation still.''
While Mr. Cantor said he welcomed the improvement in the job market, he added, ''We are nowhere near out of the woods.'' With the summer travel season approaching, he said, high gas prices were putting a burden on families.
The speaker of the House, John A. Boehner of Ohio, also welcomed the bill, which he described in a statement as a ''key part of the Republican jobs plan.'' Mr. Boehner said it would be ''good news for entrepreneurs and aspiring small businesspeople struggling to overcome government barriers to job creation.''
Also onstage with Mr. Obama was Steve Case, an investor and co-founder of America Online, who is a member of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. Mr. Case praised the law but urged the White House to push for other measures, including legislation to allow highly skilled immigrants to stay in the United States.
The audience included venture capitalists and entrepreneurs who had lobbied for the easing of regulations. Several said the law would open the door to so-called crowd-funding, in which a start-up can solicit small investments from individuals through Web sites registered with the S.E.C.
Critics of the law, including the former New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, say it will weaken a 2003 legal settlement, negotiated by Mr. Spitzer, that protects investors by forbidding Wall Street research analysts to promote stocks to help bankers at the same firm win deals.
But the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said the law would keep in place ''the core post-dotcom bust conflict-of-interest protections from the Spitzer decree.'' Investment banks, he said, must still keep their research and banking departments separate; research analysts cannot do sales presentations for stock offerings.
While soliciting investment funds online has triggered fears of fraudulent schemes, the law's backers said the greater availability of information through social media sites like Facebook would allow would-be investors to conduct their own background checks, making it difficult for such schemes to succeed.
''While it seems reasonable to worry about these issues, there is just so much more information these days,'' said Timothy Rowe, the chief executive of the Cambridge Innovation Center, which provides office space for start-up firms next to the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

HEADLINE: A Good Education With the G.I. Bill

 BODY:
Service members and veterans looking to learn more about their educational benefits under the G.I. Bill may be in trouble if they plunge unprepared into the wilds of the Internet. Many reputable private and public universities, trade schools and training programs are committed to helping veterans further their education and careers. But there are also predators itching to pad their enrollments with veterans and get their hands on government billions -- nearly 600,000 people are expected to enter classes under the G.I. Bill this year, with the Veterans Affairs Department footing more than $9 billion of the cost. 
Thus the welcome move by Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and chairwoman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, who has introduced a bill to tilt the knowledge balance in the veterans' favor.
The G.I. Bill Consumer Awareness Act seeks to ensure that veterans enter school and training programs armed with useful information: data about things like the true cost of student loans, how credits they earn may be transferred, dropout and job-placement rates, how well a program will prepare them for a job or for earning a professional license or certification, and what wages they might expect.
The bill would require programs to have at least one full-time-equivalent employee able to advise service members and veterans about their benefits. It would also ensure that the Veterans Affairs and Defense Departments work together to curb G.I. Bill abuses stemming from aggressive, misleading recruiting and marketing, on base and online.
Senator Murray's bill complements steps the V.A. is already taking to prepare veterans to pursue education and new careers. With the economy still slumping, many in the home-bound surge of veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan are finding hope and opportunity in the classroom. It is important to make sure that this country's huge investment in the futures of those who served is not squandered or exploited.

HEADLINE: Not Enough Inflation

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
A few days ago, Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, spoke out in defense of his successor. Attacks on Ben Bernanke by Republicans, he told The Financial Times, are ''wholly inappropriate and destructive.'' He's right about that -- which makes this one of the very few things the ex-maestro has gotten right in the past few years.
But why are the attacks on Mr. Bernanke so destructive? After all, nobody in America is or should be immune from criticism, least of all those -- like the chairman of the Fed -- who, by the nature of their positions, have immense power to make our lives better or worse. And while there is an unmistakable thuggishness to the campaign against the Fed, most famously Rick Perry's warning that the Fed chairman would be treated ''pretty ugly'' if he visited Texas, surely the bad manners of the critics aren't the most important issue. 
No, the real reason the attacks on Mr. Bernanke from the right are so destructive is that they're an effort to bully the Fed into doing exactly the wrong thing. The attackers want the Fed to slam on the brakes when it should be stepping on the gas; they want the Fed to choke off recovery when it should be doing much more to accelerate recovery. Fundamentally, the right wants the Fed to obsess over inflation, when the truth is that we'd be better off if the Fed paid less attention to inflation and more attention to unemployment. Indeed, a bit more inflation would be a good thing, not a bad thing.
O.K., I know that many readers are already outraged. But bear with me, and let me take this in stages.
First, about inflation obsession: For at least three years, right-wing economists, pundits and politicians have been warning that runaway inflation is just around the corner, and they keep being wrong. Do you remember the tirades about ''debasing the dollar'' around this time last year? Do you remember the scorn heaped on Mr. Bernanke last spring when he argued that the bulge in inflation taking place at the time was just a temporary blip caused by gasoline prices and would soon recede? Well, he was right. At this point, inflation is once again running a bit below the Fed's self-declared target of 2 percent.
Now, the Fed has, by law, a dual mandate: It's supposed to be concerned with full employment as well as price stability. And while we more or less have price stability by the Fed's definition, we're nowhere near full employment. So this says that the Fed is doing too little, not too much. Indeed, some Fed officials -- notably Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed -- have tried to make exactly that case.
To be sure, more aggressive Fed policies to fight unemployment might lead to inflation above that 2 percent target. But remember that dual mandate: If the Fed refuses to take even the slightest risk on the inflation front, despite a disastrous performance on the employment front, it's violating its own charter. And, beyond that, would a rise in inflation to 3 percent or even 4 percent be a terrible thing? On the contrary, it would almost surely help the economy.
How so? For one thing, large parts of the private sector continue to be crippled by the overhang of debt accumulated during the bubble years; this debt burden is arguably the main thing holding private spending back and perpetuating the slump. Modest inflation would, however, reduce that overhang -- by eroding the real value of that debt -- and help promote the private-sector recovery we need. Meanwhile, other parts of the private sector (like much of corporate America) are sitting on large hoards of cash; the prospect of moderate inflation would make letting the cash just sit there less attractive, acting as a spur to investment -- again, helping to promote overall recovery.
In short, far from fearing that more action against unemployment might lead to an uptick in inflation, the Fed should actually welcome that prospect. Which brings me back to those Republican attacks and their chilling effect on policy.
True, Mr. Bernanke likes to insist that he and his colleagues aren't affected by politics. But that claim is hard to square with the Fed's actions, or rather lack of action. As many observers have noted, the Fed's own forecasts indicate that while things have been looking up a bit lately, it still expects low inflation and high unemployment for years to come. Given that prospect, more of the ''quantitative easing'' that is now the main tool of Fed policy should be a no-brainer. Yet the recently released minutes from a March 13 meeting show a Fed inclined to do nothing unless things take a turn for the worse.
So what's going on? I think that Fed officials, whether they admit it to themselves or not, are feeling intimidated -- and that American workers are paying the price for their timidity.

HEADLINE: Child Servants in India: Rare Case or Routine?

BYLINE: PAMPOSH RAINA


HIGHLIGHT: The case of the teenage maid who was allegedly locked in a New Delhi apartment has sparked a heated discussion about child labor. 

 BODY:
The recent article by Jim Yardley in The New York Times about a 13-year-old maid who was allegedly locked up by her employers in their New Delhi apartment when they went on vacation generated a huge response from readers.
Some have raised concerns about the problem of child labor, which they say has deeply entrenched into the Indian system, exemplifying how socio-economic relations are negotiated within the Indian society. Others warn that a broad generalization about the ill treatment of domestic labor in Indian homes, based on this case alone, is incorrect.
"This is hardly new news," Buzzramjet wrote from California. "This has been going on in India, and here, where people from India bring their slave labor with them usually smuggled in, for a very long time," suggesting that Indians "smuggle" domestic workers into America. 
Another reader seeks a call to action, "We all see young children being ill treated or employed but how many of us take action-we are too busy with our lives to get embroiled with the police or the right people who can help the children," Anita Mathew wrote from Goa.
"When you see a child being made a slave you have the right to go and question and report," Ms. Mathew wrote.
An irate reader from Detroit, who did not mention an online name or real name with the comment, wrote : "This infuriates me! I have only one question: what can we do to help these children?"
The assumption that the "problem is getting worse as India is getting richer" is not the case, FZ, a reader from the United Kingdom wrote. This reader notes that "servants are more difficult to hire nowadays and the pay has increased over the years" and is hopeful that with the creation of more employment opportunities "the problem will get better."
Only the affluent can afford to hire live-in domestic workers, majority of the Indian middle class "cannot afford live-in servants and the servants are not uniformly ill treated," ST wrote from Delaware. However, "live-in servants are much more vulnerable to exploitation" since they do not have families or any other form of support around them, the reader notes.
As wages for "servants are going through the roof," many "young children are being put to work in greater numbers," ST wrote.
The online discussion also had a reader questioning the need for hiring domestic help by Indian households.
"While visiting India several years ago, I asked a rich relative what had she done to deserve a servant," Vinod Puri wrote from Michigan. "The question was so awkward that the educated, sophisticated lady, the wife of a high government official was struck silent."
"Most Indians, rich and middle class or barely making it, think they deserve servants," Mr. Puri wrote. "Just because they can afford to pay a pittance! It is the attitude of entitlement of a different kind."
Challenging the claims made by some readers through their comments, Kartik from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, wrote : "While I fully agree that India has a (very) long way to go to achieve its societal goals, I find your generalization galling. There are many of us who either have no household help or treat them ethically." 
The doctor couple who had employed the girl as a maidservant has denied charges of abusing her. They also question the veracity of the statements she made about her age, and say she told them she was 18, not 13. The couple was arrested by the police on Wednesday.
Asha Malhotra, a reader, wrote from New York: "The courts should show no leniency towards this doctor couple." They should be "fined heavily and put in jail, so an example is set to other people not to participate in child labor."
"They should pay for the education and upkeep of this young girl," Ms. Malhotra wrote.
If you have any suggestions about how this girl could be helped or what should be done to spread awareness about child labor, please leave your comments in the comments section below.

HEADLINE: Answers About Bobby and Rosie, Part 3

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Hawk Cam 2012: The executive director of NYC Audubon, Glenn Phillips, responds to readers' questions. 

 BODY:
For the red-tailed hawks incubating two eggs in a nest overlooking Washington Square Park, hatch day could come at any moment. As we await the blessed event, the executive director of New York City Audubon, Glenn Phillips, responds to readers' questions about Bobby and Rosie's sleeping and eating habits and the effects of pesticides on raptors.
Following is his set of responses. Thank you to everyone who participated, and stay tuned. 
I've noticed that Rosie (much like my blue and gold macaw), sleeps with her head turned around and tucked behind her into her wings. Why do birds sleep/roost this way?
- Posted by LRK, New York, NY
A very good observation! It's not just macaws and red-tails that sleep that way; most birds do, although some birds will tuck their beak into their breast. It is generally thought that birds tuck their beaks under the feathers to reduce heat loss from their bills. Keep in mind that for most of the year, red-tailed hawks don't sleep on the nest, and the male almost never does. Mostly, hawks sleep on tree branches. Hawks tend to have favorite roosts, as these sleeping perches are called.
More on sleeping habits: hawks, like other perching birds, have tendons in their feet that clamp around the perch when relaxed, and must be actively pulled to release, so they won't fall off the branch while sleeping. Pale Male and his mates in Central Park have been closely observed for more than 20 years, and much of what we know about roosting habits comes from observations of these birds. Hawks tend to roost alone, but many other species roost together in large gatherings, providing both safety in numbers and additional warmth. 
There is some evidence that birds like swifts may actually sleep while flying. While swifts do gather in large communal roosts to sleep during fall migration, they are unable to perch, and sleep while clinging to the walls of chimneys or other vertical cavities. It is thought that they are also able to sleep while flying by letting half of their brain sleep while the other half maintains vigilance, similar to the way dolphins and other marine mammals sleep while swimming.
I notice that the hawks may wait to finish off a meal that can remain in the nest for many hours. How are they protected from getting sick after eating food that has begun to spoil?
- Posted by JLG, New York, NY
During the winter, hawks will frequently cache food and continue to feed on it for several days. As the days get warmer, they will stop this behavior as temperatures rise and their food stores presumably don't keep as well.
How can they tell the food is no longer safe to eat? Probably they can smell it. Some birds do have keen olfactory sensibilities. 
Given the link between pesticides and long-term raptor decline, how can the Audubon Society justify taking money from Monsanto whose glyphosate-based RoundUp (the most commonly used by the public and farms) is the most likely culprit for toxicity-related raptor mortality?
- Posted by Holly
The National Audubon Society (not New York City Audubon) and Monsanto entered into a partnership known as the Waterbirds on Working Lands Project several years ago. The project is a large-scale effort to identify and promote sustainable agricultural practices that will maintain the economic viability of farms, while measurably improving the conservation value of these privately owned lands. 
Conservation organizations realized many years ago that they can make a real difference if they work with industries rather than simply calling for an end to the use of every product or system that might be harmful to wildlife, especially because it is highly unrealistic to think that the product will simply be taken off the market in every case. That approach has worked in some cases, but it is extremely unlikely that all pesticide use will end. 
As for pesticides and raptor mortality, the pesticides of concern are the rodenticides, because raptors eat the poisoned rodents. The second generation anticoagulants such as brodifacoum are particularly lethal, but all the anticoagulants cause sublethal effects and have been found to accumulate in the bodies of raptors. Glyphosate, which is an herbicide, is not as toxic for birds and has not been implicated as a major cause of raptor decline.

HEADLINE: Portraits of Harlem's Clergy

BYLINE: DAVID GONZALEZ


HIGHLIGHT: When the photographer Ozier Muhammad was looking to do a personal project on religion, Harlem was a natural choice. Faith is no small part of the community, where religious leaders have wielded great influence over the years. Mr. Muhammad photographed 13 of them. 

 BODY:
Ozier Muhammad has lived in Harlem for the last 22 years, exploring the area and hunting for stories during long walks in the neighborhood.
"It is an intriguing place that is a laboratory for artistic expression," said Mr. Muhammad, a staff photographer for The Times. "A cultural cauldron for Latino and African-American expression and, of course, with all the historical benchmarks like the Harlem Renaissance."
So the area was a natural choice for him when he was looking to do a personal project on religion. Faith is no small part of this legendary community, where religious leaders have wielded great influence over the years. From grand churches to upstart storefronts, serving longtime residents or newcomers, these churches have seen generations of transition. Many have also hewed closely to an activist tradition, whether it was civil rights in the 1950s or concerns over the police's stop and frisk policies today.
The more he thought about it, the more he got excited. The resulting portraits, he said, are the start of what he hopes will be a long-term project that will follow how these institutions and their leaders adapt in the coming years. In addition to the photographs, he conducted audio interviews as well.
"What I really wanted to know was who are the people providing spiritual services to the Harlem community," he said. "It's looking at the lives of people evolving, and who has the responsibility of taking care of those needs."
As a journalist and Harlem resident, he has also come to know many of its faith leaders, like the Rev. Calvin O. Butts of Abyssinian Baptist Church and the Rev. Earl Kooperkamp at St. Mary's Episcopal Church.
In the case of Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, a mosque on 116th Street and Lenox Avenue, there was a deep personal connection. It first started as Temple #7 by the Nation of Islam - which was founded by Mr. Muhammad's grandfather, Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm X preached there. And in the 1970s, the temple adopted Sunni Islam, guided in the transition by his uncle, Imam Warith Deen Mohammed.
"Masjid Malcolm Shabazz was the place where the most visible community of Muslims would gather in New York City," Mr. Muhammad said. "Even today, it is perhaps the most important place where Muslims still worship in Harlem."
Though he said he has "wavered on religion and wondered if it truly served the needs of the people," he was surprised by what he found.
"I was inspired by many of the people I photographed," he said. "The way they defined their mission and understand their congregation and its needs, and by extension linking up with the greater community."
Rev. Jo-An Owings
"I've been the pastor of Mount Zion for six years. I was called to preach and what that means is that I believe that the Holy Spirit moved in me before I realized what I would do. Also, my mother was a preacher, my cousin was a preacher and my grandfather was a preacher and he founded this church. So maybe preaching was in my blood."
Rev. Calvin O. Butts, III
"There's got to be some elevation of valleys and some bringing down of mountains so that all us stand fairly on equal plane. And we've got to break free from the kind of propaganda that somehow is spreading rapidly, that if you're poor it's your own fault. And taking the focus off the exploitation and deception that poor people face, not only by the hands of the large corporate entities, but also by the media controlled largely by these corporate entities."
Rev. Dr. Michael A. Walrond
"I think that no matter who you are, no matter how old you are - we all cry, we all hurt. We all know what it is to mourn, to lose. To feel joy. And sometimes preachers forget to speak to those issues that people deal with daily. So that whether you're 80 or 18, there's a commonality in our humanity that binds us. And it is our realities that really at the end of the day make us human, those emotions. So when you speak to those - and are genuine and authentic - everyone will be drawn, I think, whether old or young."
Imam Izak-El Mu'eed Pasha
"What brought me to Harlem to the historical Malcolm Shabazz Mosque was a request by the members here after the passing of the late imam, Ali Rashid - God give the power for his great work. I was a helper in many aspects of business but not an imam. I refused it the first time - I didn't feel that I was qualified. But they insisted, and I accepted it based on their asking me and the love that I have for the pioneers here. That's 19 years ago now, so praise be to God."
Rev. Jose Roberto Gandara-Perea
"We are a bilingual congregation. We are English speakers and Spanish speakers from different countries of Latin America. We have Dominicans, African-Americans and West Indians. I think we are a melting place where we can come and share our differences, respecting our differences, sharing our common goals and I think that is a contribution we have. We are a place where we can be brothers and sisters from different backgrounds."
Rev. Jose Humphreys
"The role of pastor has changed. Back in my day, pastors would be soul-tenders. They would provide spiritual nourishment through Bible study and teaching and visiting the sick. Nowadays, pastors are expected to be C.E.O.'s, counselors, prognosticators. Just about every single hat that they can wear. It reminds me of the Wild West, when you had the person who was the sheriff and who was also the hotel clerk and who also ran the business down the street."
Rev. Pedro Prado Ocegueda
"The basic call to the church is to preach the goodness of Jesus Christ - salvation through Jesus Christ. Because we work with human beings, we need to be aware of their needs -- economic, social, emotional. So we try to focus on every aspect of their lives. I am like a social worker in my congregation, and I also work with issues in the community like violence and drug addiction."
Rev. Dr. Patricia A. Singletary
"I was called to the ministries in my early 30s, but at that time, women were not preachers in the Baptist church. Today there were quite a few women that are called to ministry, are very active and very visible in ministry. Yes, we had a rough time. As a matter of fact, there were some seminaries who would not accept women as students because women were not called to be in ministry, or so they believed. But if you will check the seminary rolls today, you will find that almost 75 percent of the enrollees were women."
Rev. D. Albert Turk
"For most of my ministry as a pastor, I've been assigned to churches where the membership has gone down or the building needs repair. It can get frustrating. By the grace of God and those congregation members, I have to been able to turn those places around. I have come to an epiphany that I have some kind of ability to handle this, and so now I don't fret these situations anymore. I now understand I've been equipped by God to handle those kind of congregations. I receive it now gladly and go forward with it."
Rev. Earl Kooperkamp
"The prophet Isaiah, two and a half millennia ago, said maintain justice and do what is right. We're seeing mass incarceration, some of it starting literally right here on the street in front of the church with the stop and frisk policies of the New York Police Department. They are stopping 1,900 to 2,000 young men every day, the vast majority young African-American and Latino men. Quite frankly, if Jesus of Nazareth were walking around the streets of New York City in 2012 - young man of color - he'd have a 90 percent chance that he would be stopped and frisked."
Rev. Grace E. Bowen
"The gospel of Jesus Christ is very proactive - clothing the naked, feeding the poor, feeding the hungry, visiting the incarcerated. Society puts a very political spin on that. I can remember being challenged all along the way as to whether or not my call was perceived to be political or theological. I don't see them as separate."
Paul Radensky
"I was a student at the Jewish Theological Seminary and my wife started coming here, so I started coming with her. And then the rabbi who was here - Rabbi Kret, who was here for nearly 50 years - got our phone number and started calling me every Friday night requesting that I come. He was a Holocaust survivor and had been the head of a yeshiva in Poland and you couldn't say no to him without feeling really guilty. I fell in love with the sense of authenticity here."
Father Gregory C. Chisholm
"I studied engineering as an undergraduate and graduate student at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Mass. You know there are tensions that have existed primarily since the enlightenment in the 18th century between religion and science. I have found at least in my own experience that the two worked very much in tandem. If I were trying to form a world that was without any difficulty or challenges, I could neither turn to religion, nor science. Both of them have their limitations, but both of them are very helpful in getting us to do things in the world that are valuable and important."

HEADLINE: Don't Expect Many New Factory Jobs

BYLINE: EDUARDO PORTER


HIGHLIGHT: Even if every manufactured product we bought was made in America, a professor argues, manufacturing employment here would lag. 

 BODY:
Prof. Robert Lawrence from Harvard makes an interesting point in response to my Wednesday column about our misplaced hopes in manufacturing as a source of new jobs: even if every single thing we bought was "made in America" - if we stopped multinationals from outsourcing production to China and closed our doors to imports - even then, manufacturing employment would lag.
The reason is simple: we are spending less and less on goods and more and more on services. In 1969, American consumers were allocating half of all their spending on consumption to goods. By 2010, that share had fallen to one-third. Spending on equipment is also falling. "Even if we had no trade deficit, given this inelastic demand, employment in goods would continue to fall," Mr. Lawrence said.

HEADLINE: Table Talk | Frre Jacques

BYLINE: ABBY AGUIRRE


HIGHLIGHT: In a rare appearance, Jacques P&#233;pin's cuisine will headline a benefit dinner for University Settlement, a 125-year-old non-profit that serves immigrants on the Lower East Side. 

 BODY:
Jacques Ppin: more French than American, or more American than French? Let's review the particulars. He learned to cook as a teenager in his parents' restaurant in Lyon and, by the age of 20, was commanding the kitchen of Charles de Gaulle. (French!) At 23, he moved to the United States and took a job flipping burgers at a Howard Johnson's on Queens Boulevard, then spent a decade at the Howard Johnson Company, mastering the art of mass food production. (American!) Several television shows and 27 cookbooks later, he holds a daytime Emmy and both a Chevalier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and Chevalier de L'Ordre du Mrite Agricole, two of France's highest honors. (American?)
Debating the question was something of an on-camera parlor game for the Bourg-en-Bresse-born omelet magician and his good friend Julia Child, with whom he hosted the popular goofball series "Julia and Jacques" in the late 1990s. That he does not care for marshmallows in his mashed sweet potatoes must be because he is French, Child teases in one episode. In France, people use leftover chicken fat to saut potatoes, Ppin explains in another; "sensible people here do the same thing, it's not only the French," Child protests. And then there was the matter of washing chickens.
"I have washed this chicken with hot water," Child says, manhandling a wet bird.
"I don't wash my chicken," Ppin tells the camera.
"He doesn't wash his," she says. "I think in France they're not as worried about things as we are, are they?"
"Well, I live in Connecticut," he says.
As it happens Ppin, now 76, still lives in Connecticut, still oversees a great deal at the French Culinary Institute and still churns out cookbooks, most recently "Essential Ppin," published last year. What he does not often do is lend his celebrated cuisine to charity events. Which makes an auction dinner he is headlining later this month for University Settlement, a 125-year-old nonprofit that serves immigrants on the Lower East Side, a very rare occasion indeed. Ppin explained the move Thursday evening, at a Champagne reception for board members and supporters of the agency, at a private residence overlooking Central Park.
"I have an immigrant story," he said. "Most people come here for economic reasons, or religious reasons, or racial reasons, or gender reasons, or one of those things. I had a good job in Paris, but America was, and still is, the golden fleece." He raised his Champagne flute. "And I've done very well!"
In a grand downtown loft and former manufacturing space, 82Mercer, on April 24, some 150 guests will be treated to Ppin's gratitude in five courses: amuse bouche of mushroom soup; spring fava beans, morel mushroom vol-au-vent, and crab salad; beef carpaccio with basil pesto; spring lamb stuffed with sage mousse and paired with a leek gratin and potato pure; and a selection of chocolate desserts prepared by that other Jacques of note, Jacques Torres. A wine program headed up by Scott Carney will include a sommelier seated at each table.
The menu bears some resemblance to the meals he prepared for Charles de Gaulle, Ppin noted. "I'd do a consomm, a roasted leg of lamb properly done, a gratin of potato, a salad, some cheese and then maybe a caramel custard or one of those things," he said. "But in that case Madame de Gaulle would tell me, 'Don't cook the meat too rare, it's not good for the blood of the president.'"
So why, after cooking for three French heads of state, did he turn down an offer to cook in J.F.K.'s White House, choosing instead to sling hot dogs at HoJo's? "It was more exciting to me," he said. "I was in a new territory. Working with the chemists I learned words like 'bacteria,' 'chloroform' and 'specific gravity' or whatever. Also I learned mass production, marketing, American eating habits and American food. I could not have run any of the restaurants I opened later if I hadn't had the training of Howard Johnson."
Ppin does find some latter-day culinary developments here perplexing, like California's banning of foie gras ("Totally ridiculous"), the fetishizing of organic ingredients ("What's the big deal?") and the larger foraging rage ("This is new?"). Growing up in France, he says, all food was organic; hunting for wild herbs and mushrooms, too, was de rigueur. "I mean I've been to restaurants where they come to take your order and produce for you the carrot and say, 'That carrot is named Matilda, and it was born on the seventh of,'" he broke off, rolling his eyes. "Give me a break! Just give me the carrot."

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $19,200,000

BYLINE: MARC SANTORA


HIGHLIGHT: An apartment with a 2,200-square-foot terrace was bought with two adjoining units. 

 BODY:
A penthouse apartment at 34 Greene Street in SoHo that has a 2,200-square-foot terrace and was bought with two adjoining apartments for $19.2 million was the biggest sale of the week, according to city records.
"It has ridiculous outdoor space," said Frances Katzen of Prudential Douglas Elliman, who brokered the deal with her colleague Melanie Lazenby. Potential buyers were told that they had the option to put a reflecting pool or hot tub on the terrace so they could soak while gazing up at the Empire State Building.
The property was bought anonymously through a limited liability company. Ms. Katzen declined to comment on the buyer's identity.
The building, originally a printing house, was bought in 2007 by the American arm of the Sorgente Group, an Italian company. The cast-iron facade, dating back to 1873, was restored by the architect Thomas McKay and the interior was gutted and converted into luxury condominiums. The first apartments were on the market in 2010. The penthouse, which has four bedrooms and five bathrooms and nearly 5,000 square feet of interior space, was priced at $13.75 million, but the buyer wanted more space and bought two smaller adjoining apartments. 
The Sorgente Group, which also owns a stake in the Flatiron Building, has found success in New York City by acquiring historically significant properties and restoring and updating them.
After 34 Greene Street first opened, Veronica Mainetti, who heads the firm's American office, told The New York Observer that the firm was always looking for projects like 34 Greene as well as "trophy buildings."
"They always have to be historic," she said. "That's our strategy. We believe these kinds of buildings that have architectural value and historical value do better, especially in periods such as this. So we're always looking."
Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Seattle: Leave Our Amazon Alone!

BYLINE: DAVID STREITFELD


HIGHLIGHT: As leading tech firms grow ever more prominent and pervasive, questions are increasingly being asked about their labor practices, attitudes toward customers' data, unyielding competitive streaks and other aspects of their corporate DNA. Is creating jobs and wealth for stockholders enough? When Amazon was in the cross hairs, Seattle said, "Leave 'em alone!" 

 BODY:
It was Amazon week at The Seattle Times, as the retailer's hometown paper examined at length various aspects of the company, including its approach to warehouse labor, tough negotiating tactics with publishersand bare-bones approach to corporate giving. The questions underlying these stories are increasingly being asked not only about Amazon, but also Apple and other leading tech companies: As their reach and ambition grow, do these firms have any special responsibilities to their workers? How about to the local community? How about the larger community? 
The Seattle Times pointed out that Amazon's stock market valuation is second only to Microsoft in the Pacific Northwest, yet Amazon has been largely a no-show in local corporate giving --- unlike Microsoft, Starbucks and Boeing. You might think that, after a withering recession, most people would have issues with this. Instead, if the 500 comments on the charity article are anything to go by, many readers had more problem with The Seattle Times than with Amazon.
Their basic message: Leave Amazon alone.
The retailer, these readers said, had already done more than enough just by being successful. As one commentator put it: 
"So let me get this straight -- adding huge numbers of high paying software development, management, customer service, warehouse, hr, jobs, contributing to the local tax base by just having a nexus here, contributing to the real estate market (and tax base) here by renting, purchasing and building buildings and offering kick-rear-end service isn't enough for the writer of this article. They think that Amazon, as a company, must also give what this person thinks is an acceptable amount of money to be considered good Washingtonians?" 
Another reader tried to make the argument for giving:
 "Amazon is able to attract talent into Seattle and keep them here in large part because it's not a cultural and economic backwater. Corporate donations in past years have built and sustained theaters, educational institutions, hospitals, orchestras, and helped stem social issues like poverty that are part of every human community. Without those historic corporate donations, common in all large cities, Seattle would have been stagnant and Amazon would be elsewhere today. The question is whether Amazon believes in such tradition or simply deserves to be its beneficiary."
As reasonable as that might sound, the writer got little traction.
Jan Drago, a Seattle politician quoted in the article as bluntly saying Amazon should do more, had no explanation of the commentators' pro-Amazon attitude. "Maybe they're stockholders and they're happy with their returns," she said. Ms. Drago, a stockholder herself, used to give Mr. Bezos the benefit of the doubt and assumed he would come around, the way Bill Gates eventually evolved at Microsoft. If Mr. Bezos is indeed a libertarian, as the story concluded, that prospect is less likely.

HEADLINE: Skyscapes

BYLINE: CONSTANCE HALE


HIGHLIGHT: Readers answered the call to write a distinct description of the sky. 

 BODY:
In my last essay, about choosing precise nouns and adjectives, I challenged readers to write a distinct description of the sky. Many thanks to those of you who answered the call. We were given hundreds of skyscapes, in Paris; New York City; Vancouver, Canada; Perth, Australia; and Quepos, Costa Rica - as well as sentences describing the sky above tornado country and across the American Southwest.
I wish I could respond to each of these posts. Instead I'll share some impressions that struck me as I read them, along with some ideas about what makes descriptions work.
One of the first challenges in describing the sky is to find words that allow a reader to see the thing at hand, while resisting clichs. I was fascinated by the ways these writers described the blue overhead. We were given a "9/11 blue," "taut blue glass," "chips of lapis and pale jade," blue stripes crossing the sky "like a boy's sweater" and an "icy blue sky, cloudless and full of winter." Sometimes, the sky wasn't blue at all, but rather a "J.M.W. Turner cloudscape," "fiery Rothko hues" and "an impressionist's marks on a unfinished canvas." 
We were also treated to "fish-scale" clouds, "clouds like a crocodile's belly" and clouds etching the sky "like cracks in a crystal dish." We saw the moon "suspended like a communion wafer" and a sun "like a molten penny, half slid in." 
Too many images, though, in a single passage risks an excessive lushness often referred to as "purple prose." I agree with Asterix, who wrote: "Rich, vivid words must be used carefully if they are to carry any real weight. The best writing maintains an elegant balance between the commonplace and the unexpected in its vocabulary." 
In addition to such "elegant balance," I like economy. I don't think of myself as a minimalist, but I do appreciate descriptions that consist of one or two spare sentences, including these:
"Telephone pole wires jailed the harvest moon." (from B.L.A. in Seattle)
"The burnished afternoon light is tangled in tree fronds and corrugated metal awnings." (Emmeline Sun in Eugene, Ore.)
"The spring milk sky spilled across the early afternoon." (Charlotte Udziela in Beaverton, Ore.)
Even posts that rolled through many phrases and sentences could be grounded by specific imagery, like the stream, a companion's hand, the canopy or "the penny-copper taste of fear rising" in Tom Lassiter's post. For his part, Terrence Doyle made Death Valley come alive through nighttime critters ("coyotes, chuckwallas, roadrunners") and "thickets of oleander and salt cedar."
Happily, writers - and readers - have different tastes and sensibilities. Even as I found myself enthralled with geography, Joan, from Sarasota, Fla., noted that she responded to humanity: "I was surprised to learn how much more I preferred the ones where the sky set the scene for a person doing, thinking, whatever over the ones where the sky was the scene." 
One of the wondrous and mysterious things about literary merit is that there is no right and wrong way to achieve it. The sum of these comments makes that abundantly clear.

HEADLINE: A Voice of Williamsburg's Past, Warning Against Change

BYLINE: DAVID GONZALEZ


HIGHLIGHT: A pugnacious advocate for what Williamsburg once was can no longer afford to stay in the Williamsburg of today. 

 BODY:
Growing up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in the 1980s, Dennis Farr dreamed of a life that was mythical. His fascination with the murals slathered on the walls of the abandoned buildings on the neighborhood's post-industrial waterfront satisfied his longing for adventure, looking like tags written by phantom giants. 
But he also envisioned a life that was biblical. He got that soon enough when he started writing and warning against the influx of artists and other trendsetters who were slowly colonizing the area in the early 1990s. Where others saw a brick and mortar change for the better, Mr. Farr was alarmed that these newcomers would push out members of the area's long-established Puerto Rican community. 
"Was the Puerto Rican community going to be Isaac to the gentrifiers' Abraham?" he asked one afternoon, walking along Kent Avenue, much of which has been remade into a wall of towers. 
His writings and debates on the issue - much of which are captured in long and frequent comments on blogs and social media sites - have been consistent. They have won him admirers and detractors. He is unafraid to speak his mind, and with his long hair and sometimes severe manner, he can come across like a throwback to another era. Make that millennium.
"Dennis reminds me of a biblical prophet screaming in the desert, 'The Change is coming and prepare for the worst!' And he has been right," said Luis Garden Acosta, the founder of El Puente, a youth and community center that has recently embarked on an effort to navigate the changes with an ambitious project nurturing the arts, health and the environment. "The cultural integrity and the dignity of our community is being removed solely for the profit motive."
Raised by a single mother along with a brother and a sister, Mr. Farr, 40, grew up on the south side of Williamsburg, moving around a lot. He admits to having been a bit wild - restless, not violent. Religion calmed him down, but did not take away his yearning to write and draw about the world around him. With his home life hectic, he stepped out on his own in his mid-teens, squatting inside the decrepit industrial buildings along Kent Avenue.
He lived there, and crashed with friends, for a long stretch. Though transient, he managed to finish high school, become a proofreader and get a degree from Vassar College. After living in Ridgewood, he and his girlfriend returned to Williamsburg a few years ago, settling in a few blocks away from where he used to squat - which is now a state park ringed by new housing.
"The narrative about gentrification was always problematic," he said. "It always talked about how bad things were, often to demonize and reduce those who had been living here before. Yes, violence was part of it, but we also had institutions like Los Sures doing housing, El Puente with the youth or Transfiguration Church."
Though others saw the newcomers as liberals with good intentions, Mr. Farr wasn't convinced. He saw them more as libertarians whose economic interests were being served by the new developments in housing and businesses. For a while, he published a 'zine called Thirty Days, where his writings focused on what he saw as the threat facing current residents.
"The people promoting gentrification always tried to put a positive spin on it," he said. "But rich people come in and bring rich people things. Displacement was never part of the dialogue."
His own style continues to be pugnacious, which should not be a surprise, since he likes to spar. While others might restrain their comments, he has no bridges to cross, much less burn.
"When you have a vision your community is being upended, you can't worry about the repercussions," he said. "You have to say something."
There are few signs of the old neighborhood inside the park that now sits on the stretch of waterfront where he crashed as a young man: a patch of cobblestones, a random fire hydrant, railroad tracks embedded in cement and a few large foundation stones. He climbed atop them and surveyed the remade landscape.
"This used to be a blasted-out, apocalyptic setting," he said. "But it wasn't devoid of hope."
That hope is ever more personal now. He and his girlfriend recently learned they have to move so the landlord can make major renovations. As much as he'd like to stay, Mr. Farr has begun packing and looking for a new place - in Bushwick and Bed Stuy. There's a chance they might be able to find a spot in Williamsburg, but he admits it's slim given their finances.
But he vows to return.
"I could contest it, but my landlord's been pretty fantastic with us," he said. "This is just a temporary exile. I've been exiled before, and even then I sustained my connection with this place."

HIGHLIGHT: The Republican National Committee has collected large cash reserves that could be critical to Mitt Romney if he becomes the nominee. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
The Republican National Committee has bounced back from the brink of bankruptcy, amassing substantial cash reserves that could offer Mitt Romney critical leverage against President Obama. (Outside groups have handled the early attacks on Mr. Obama.) The party is already preparing for fund-raising operations with Mr. Romney if he becomes the nominee, Nicholas Confessore reports.

        
Pushed by an unusual demand from a federal appeals court, the Obama administration formally acknowledged that "the power of the courts to review the constitutionality of legislation is beyond dispute," continuing to backpedal from remarks that the president made about the Supreme Court on Monday, John H.

HEADLINE: Romney's Health Care Plan

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The candidate wants the states to take over. Here's why that's a bad idea. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney was roundly mocked on Thursday for seeming to forget he went to Harvard. At a campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Mr. Romney suggested that President Obama was out of touch, perhaps because he had "spent too much time at Harvard." Mr. Obama attended Harvard for three years, obtaining a law degree; Mr. Romney was there for four years, obtaining a combined JD/MBA.
At the same rally, Mr. Romney pledged, as usual, to "repeal Obamacare," and explained that he'd "return health care to the states." I doubt that idea's the product of his years in Cambridge, Mass., but wherever it came from, it's lousy: The laboratories of democracy are ill-equipped to deliver universal health care.

In a 2007 article for the Washington Monthly, the journalist Ezra Klein pointed out that "states have tried programs of many different ideological and economic persuasions" and "all of them failed" because "states are structurally incapable of sustaining them." In 1993, Washington passed a health reform bill that mandated universal coverage, forced insurers to provide comprehensive packages, and demanded that all insurers become certified through the state. Many insurance companies resisted the change; some refused to do business in Washington, others raised premiums. A couple of years later, a new Republican majority started chipping away at the plan, and made participation by insurance companies voluntary. Today, the percentage of uninsured people in Washington is greater than it was in 1992.
When Hawaii attempted reform in 1994 by merging Medicaid with a state program, it achieved nearly universal coverage. But more people applied than initially expected, and after an economic downturn, the state government couldn't afford the subsidies. It couldn't run a deficit, since that would violate the state constitution, so it cut benefits.
In that same Washington Monthly article, Mr. Klein told similar stories about failed health care experiments in Tennessee and Oregon. Massachusetts, with its individual mandate, seems like it might be an outlier, but it's unlikely that less wealthy states-with more citizens requiring government assistance-can adopt the same program with as much success.
Along with the 50-state solution, would-be reformers on the right-wing often propose letting insurers sell across state lines, which, they say, will drive down costs through competition. That won't work, either, because insurance companies can relocate to the laxest states with the least consumer-focused regulations-just as credit card companies have-and offer plans that might be cheap for healthy people, but incredibly expensive for everyone else. (This system would also remove power from most states since, as I said, the laxest ones will set policy. See this Daily Beast article for a more thorough discussion.)
Mr. Romney and others on the right abhor the idea that the federal government will force a "one size fits all" solution on the country, instead of allowing experimentation. But just how long should this period of experimentation, actually more like a period of throwing everything at the wall, last? Especially when we know from the experience of Western Europe and Canada that universal coverage is possible, and sustainable, if the central government takes control.

HEADLINE: After a Weak Jobs Report, Romney Goes on the Attack

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: "This is a weak and very troubling jobs report that shows the employment market remains stagnant," Mitt Romney said in an e-mail statement released by his campaign. 

 BODY:
On a subject that is intended to be the center of his campaign, Mitt Romney attacked President Obama on Friday for what he called the "weak and very troubling jobs report."
The United States economy added a relatively weak 120,000 jobs in March, compared with 240,000 in February, and the unemployment rate dipped to 8.2 percent from 8.3 percent, the Labor Department said on Friday. 
"This is a weak and very troubling jobs report that shows the employment market remains stagnant," Mr. Romney said in an e-mail statement released by his campaign. "Millions of Americans are paying a high price for President Obama's economic policies, and more and more people are growing so discouraged that they are dropping out of the labor force altogether."
Mr. Romney, the former chief executive of Bain Capital, has repeatedly argued that he is best equipped to fix the nation's struggling economy, an argument that has been undercut recently by three months of solid employment growth. Many economists had expected March to be the fourth consecutive month of strong growth.
When each new positive jobs report came out, Mr. Romney had been forced to offer a more nuanced position than he might have liked - that the economy seemed to be improving, but that under Mr. Obama, it was improving slower than it should.
On Thursday in Tunkhannock, Pa., Mr. Romney offered a version of the same argument.
"The reason I'm so animated about defeating Barack Obama is because he's failed the American people," Mr. Romney said, speaking outside at an energy company. "He came into the office, and the economy was in trouble, people were losing jobs, homes were losing their value, energy prices were beginning go up, and we would have expected him to focus his energy on getting this economy going."
Mr. Romney continued: "Instead, he delegated the economy to Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. And they put together a grab bag of some of their favorite projects in Washington and called it a stimulus. It was a stimulus that protected government but didn't put people back to work."
His e-mail statement concluded: "It is increasingly clear the Obama economy is not working and that after three years in office the president's excuses have run out."

HEADLINE: Reads and Reactions

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: In this edition: debates over forecasting models, the Republican primary's climax and the fallout over a Supreme Court hearing on the Affordable Care Act. Also, an all-jobs-report edition of Reads 

 BODY:
Reactions
FiveThirtyEight looked at the track record of political scientists in predicting presidential elections. The verdict: forecasting models, particularly ones based solely on "fundamentals," have had very little predictive value on average. 
In the wake of that post, a lively debate broke out on the efficacy and value of such predictions. FiveThirtyEight contributor John Sides came to the defense of presidential forecasting models. So too did YouGov's Lynn Vavreck. Jay Ulfelder also delved into the fray. As did Jonathan Bernstein at A Plain Blog About Politics.
Two general counterarguments emerged in the response to FiveThirtyEight's criticism of election forecasts:
1. Yes, predictions of the margin of victory have been well off the mark on average. The point, however, is more determining which party will win the election rather than by how much, and in that regard the models have been better.
2. There is a wide variety in the quality of such models, and averaging them all together obscures the better models.
FiveThirtyEight also elicited some disagreement when we pointed to Mr. Romney's victory in the Michigan primary on Feb. 28 as the moment that set him on a relatively secure path to the nomination. Jonathan Bernstein, this time writing for The Washington Post argued that it was actually South Carolina that determined how the Republican primary would unfold.
Whether South Carolina or Michigan was the climactic moment of the Republican race, it was not until after Illinois that analysts began calling the game. Ed Kilgore called it at The New Republic. Andrew Sullivan, at The Daily Beast, called it, too. At Outside the Belway, Doug Mataconis was a little more circumspect, writing, "The fat lady hasn't started her aria yet, but she's backstage warming up and this race is (finally) almost over."
FiveThirtyEight also read the writing on the wall after Illinois.
The next major news story was the Supreme Court hearing arguments on President Obama's health reform law. A counterintuitive theory began percolating among the chattering class that a ruling against the law would actually help Mr. Obama. FiveThirtyEight tested that hypotheses and found it wanting.
James Taranto, writing at The Wall Street Journal, agreed with most of the post, except the contention that Mr. Obama does not face a problem with his base. "The base is happy with Obama now. But how will they feel three months from now if the court has struck down the president's signature 'achievement'?" Mr. Taranto wrote, reasoning that progressive voters will get angry at Mr. Obama if the Supreme Court strikes down the Affordable Care Act.
Reads
The Bureau of Labor Statistics released an underwhelming jobs report for March, reporting that nonfarm payrolls expanded by a net of 120,000 new jobs, and the unemployment rate ticked down to 8.2 percent.
Stephen Green, writing at VodkaPundit, argued the report is even worse than the top line results suggest.
Brad Plumer, at The Washington Post's WonkBlog, is not quite as gloomy.
And MSNBC's Chuck Todd took a "deep dive" into the jobs numbers, distinguishing between expansion in the private sector and contraction in the public sector.

HEADLINE: Former Franklin Bank Executives Accused of Fraud

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Anthony J. Nocella, Franklin's former chief executive, and J. Russell McCann, the bank's former chief financial officer, with misstating the health of their firm during the financial crisis. 

 BODY:
Two former executives of the Franklin Bank Corporation, a now-defunct lender started by the mortgage bond pioneer Lewis Ranieri, have been accused of hiding losses during the final days of the company.
In a complaint filed on Thursday in United States District Court in Texas, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Anthony J. Nocella, Franklin's former chief executive, and J. Russell McCann, the bank's former chief financial officer, of misstating the health of their company during the financial crisis, when a series of mortgage loans on the bank's books went sour and it struggled to stay afloat.
According to the S.E.C.'s complaint, the two executives "engaged in a disclosure and accounting fraud that misled investors about Franklin's financial condition and concealed the extent of its exposure to loan delinquencies." Franklin, which was based in Houston, declared bankruptcy in 2008.
Loan modification programs were at the center of the S.E.C.'s complaint.
"Nocella and McCann used the loan modification scheme like a magic wand to change nonperforming loans into performing assets," Robert Khuzami, the agency's enforcement director, said in a statement accompanying the charges. Mr. Khuzami added that the executives had "misled investors into believing that Franklin was outperforming other banks during the height of the financial crisis."
Barrett H. Reasoner, a lawyer for Mr. McCann, said his client believed that the claims against him "don't have any merit." Mr. Reasoner said the evidence in the case was "contrary to what the S.E.C. has pled."
In an e-mailed statement, James G. Munisteri, a lawyer for Mr. Nocella, said the S.E.C. had "made a seriously wrong decision in alleging this claim, and we believe confidently that Mr. Nocella will be vindicated."
The S.E.C. says Mr. McCann and Mr. Nocella used the modification programs - with names like "Fresh Start" and "Great New" - to falsely classify delinquent loans as healthy in 2007.
At one point, Mr. Ranieri, who then was chairman of Franklin, spoke with Mr. Nocella and another executive to discuss a "$6 million shortfall in loan modifications," according to the S.E.C. The agency said Mr. Ranieri, who was not charged with wrongdoing, was "furious" that the modifications had been overstated.
After the call, Mr. Nocella, "in an effort to conceal the $6 million shortfall and placate Ranieri," directed an executive to "implement a retroactive, unilateral-loan-modification program to reduce the third-quarter nonperforming loan amounts without requiring a payment from the borrower," the agency said.
Such programs, the agency said, allowed the bank to hide more than $24 million in nonperforming loans and led to income reports that were inflated more than 300 percent. The company was later forced to restate its financial information. Franklin failed in 2008.
In addition to accusing Mr. Nocella and Mr. McCann of violations of securities law, the S.E.C. is looking to recover $75,000 in bonus payments the two men received during the time of the reported misconduct.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Standing Slips After Mixed Jobs Numbers

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the euro and the yen on Friday after lower-than-expected jobs figures bolstered views that the Federal Reserve could yet ease policy further to help the economy, though thin holiday trading exaggerated currency moves.
The dollar reversed early gains against the euro after data showed nonfarm payrolls in the United States rose by 120,000 in March, far lower than the 203,000 expected in a Reuters survey. 
The data was especially disappointing since recent numbers suggested a stronger recovery in the jobs market.
''The question for the dollar is whether this is viewed as an outlier in an otherwise improving trend in labor markets, or if it's viewed as enough to revive talk of another round of Fed policy easing,'' Omer Esiner, chief market analyst with Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington, said. ''At the very least it will keep the door open to additional policy easing, more so than before the number was released. In that respect, it's definitely a negative for the dollar.''
The euro rose 0.26 percent to $1.3097, bouncing from a three-week low of $1.3033 it hit the previous session, according to Reuters data.
Nevertheless, dismal data from the euro zone, fears about Spain's debt levels and expectations that European monetary policy will stay loose have the euro down about 2 percent against the dollar this week.
The dollar was off 0.95 percent to 81.51 yen, for a loss of about 1.7 percent for the week.
Activity was light and trading desks thinly staffed, with the stock market in the United States closed and the bond market closed early in observance of the Good Friday holiday. Much of Asia was off as well.
Government debt prices surged, pushing yields to more than three-week lows after the surprisingly weak job growth report.
''Right now, this is going to keep the Fed in easy-policy mode,'' said Sean Incremona, an economist at 4Cast in New York. ''They're going to want to see a step toward 300,000 before they start to think about seeing a stronger outlook for the economy.''
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 1 6/32, to 99 19/32, and the yield fell to 2.05 percent from 2.18 percent late Thursday.
''Monday's price action will be a lot more telling as participants in the U.S. and abroad digest today's jobs data,'' said Daniel Hwang, senior currency strategist at Forex.com in New York. ''Raised expectations of Fed stimulus should cause some consolidation of the dollar next week, especially after this week's gains, and I think the euro is likely to test that support level.''
The euro was also weighed by worries about Spain's high debt level as a poor debt auction earlier in the week fueled concerns about the country's ability to address its fiscal problems.
''I'm negative on the euro,'' said Sumino Kamei, senior currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo. ''It's likely to keep extending losses below $1.30 as there's no event that could stop its decline amid worries over Spain.
Against the yen, the euro was at 106.77, down 0.69 percent after hitting a one-month low at 106.52.

HEADLINE: In a Mixed Jobs Report, Ammunition for All Sides on the Economy: Dreary Forecasts From Recovery Skeptics

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When a lackluster jobs report came in on Friday morning, some economists, investors and forecasters were hardly surprised.
Call them permabears. A solid six months of good and getting-better data -- fewer Americans claiming unemployment benefits, rising industrial production and improving economic sentiment among them -- have failed to convince them of the strength of the recovery.
Some offer outright dire predictions. There is the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a New York-based forecasting firm, which foresees a new recession. There is A. Gary Shilling & Company, a consulting firm in Springfield, N.J., which argues that the economy will weaken through the rest of the year. 
There is also the asset manager John P. Hussman. Last month, he wrote in a research note that ''while investors and the economic consensus has largely abandoned any concern about a fresh economic downturn, we remain uncomfortable,'' given the deterioration of certain leading measures, like consumption growth.
Others -- call them the baby bears, perhaps -- simply offer what they say are more realistic assessments of both the weakness of the economy and the tepid pace of the recovery, despite a few months in which a spate of reports surprised to the upside.
''The recovery is anemic, subpar, below trend, below potential,'' said Nouriel Roubini, the New York economist whose consistently dour predictions (including calling the collapse of the housing bubble) have won him the nickname ''Dr. Doom,'' and who might fall into that latter camp.
''If we avoid a major external or internal shock,'' like a military confrontation with Iran or a major default in the euro zone, ''we may avoid another recession and that might be good news. But that's where the good news ends,'' said Professor Roubini, who teaches at New York University and heads Roubini Global Economics, an economic consultancy.
Most firms have been raising their estimates for economic growth on the back of months of good news. For instance, Macroeconomic Advisers, the respected forecasting firm, has bumped its estimate of current economic growth to an annualized 2.2 percent, up from 1.8 percent. And the Federal Reserve currently estimates that the economy will grow a respectable if not spectacular 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent this year.
''I'm relatively optimistic,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, who released a note this week showing unemployment dropping faster than he previously forecast. As for the more dire claims about an economy on the brink, ''I don't really take those seriously,'' he said.
But the bears point out that 2 percent-plus growth is sluggish growth by historical standards. During the expansion of the 2000s, for instance, annual growth rates routinely spiked above 3.5 percent, even hitting 6 percent in one quarter.
And no less of a market authority than Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warns that the recent strength might not be sustained. ''The recent news has been good,'' he said in an interview with ABC News last month. ''But I think we need to be cautious and make sure this is sustainable. And we haven't quite yet got to the point where we can be completely confident that we're on a track to full recovery.''
So what are the bears worried about? And what explains the last few months, in which the unemployment rate fell to 8.2 percent in March from 8.9 percent in October?
The bears point to weakness underlying current numbers. Disposable personal income, a measure of how much money Americans have left over once they have paid their taxes, has barely been increasing of late, raising questions about how much spending the debt-soaked American consumer can contribute to the recovery. The shock of growth at the end of 2011, which gave a shot in the arm to economic confidence this spring, came mostly from wholesalers restocking their inventories as well.
''Final sales are barely growing,'' Professor Roubini said. ''So I don't see a sustainable recovery coming from that.''
On top of that, the bears note that some trends could be making the job gains and economic growth of the last few months seem more robust than they really are. One factor is the warm winter, which might have pulled forward economic activity from the spring. In a research note entitled ''Sticking With Sluggish,'' the relatively pessimistic analysts at Goldman Sachs argued that the ''exceptionally mild'' winter stole commerce and hiring from March and April.
Moreover, the surge of hiring in the winter, which was unexplained by growth in economic output, could have been from employers who had laid off too many workers during the recession and were swinging the other way by adding too many workers, meaning hiring might slow down again.
Those trends were perhaps borne out in the lower-than-expected jobs number released on Friday, which showed that private employers added 121,000 workers in March, just 2,420 jobs per state and about half the amount added in the previous three months.
Then, there are the headwinds coming from Europe, where debt yields are rising yet again for countries including Spain. The economy is cooling in China, now a major United States export market. Worse, gas prices have continued to track upward over increased demand from emerging economies as well as from concerns about a confrontation with Iran as the White House and the European Union prepare to apply strict new sanctions.
It all adds up to a bleak picture, at least in the bears' minority opinion.

HEADLINE: Finding the Holy in Harlem

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Ozier Muhammad has lived in Harlem for the last 22 years, exploring the area and hunting for stories during long walks in the neighborhood.
''It is an intriguing place that is a laboratory for artistic expression,'' said Mr. Muhammad, a staff photographer for The Times. ''A cultural cauldron for Latino and African-American expression and, of course, with all the historical benchmarks like the Harlem Renaissance.''
So the area was a natural choice for him when he was looking to do a personal project on religion. Faith is no small part of this legendary community, where religious leaders have wielded great influence over the years. From grand churches to upstart storefronts, serving longtime residents or newcomers, these churches have seen generations of transition. Many have also hewed closely to an activist tradition, whether it was civil rights in the 1950s or concerns over the police's stop and frisk policies today.
The more he thought about it, the more he got excited. The resulting portraits, he said, are the start of what he hopes will be a long-term project that will follow how these institutions and their leaders adapt in the coming years. In addition to the photographs, he conducted audio interviews as well. 
''What I really wanted to know was who are the people providing spiritual services to the Harlem community,'' he said. ''It's looking at the lives of people evolving, and who has the responsibility of taking care of those needs.''
As a journalist and Harlem resident, he has also come to know many of its faith leaders, like the Rev. Calvin O. Butts of Abyssinian Baptist Church and the Rev. Earl Kooperkamp at St. Mary's Episcopal Church.
In the case of Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, a mosque on 116th Street and Lenox Avenue, there was a deep personal connection. It first started as Temple #7 by the Nation of Islam - which was founded by Mr. Muhammad's grandfather, Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm X preached there. And in the 1970s, the temple adopted Sunni Islam, guided in the transition by his uncle, Imam Warith Deen Mohammed.
''Masjid Malcolm Shabazz was the place where the most visible community of Muslims would gather in New York City,'' Mr. Muhammad said. ''Even today, it is perhaps the most important place where Muslims still worship in Harlem.''
Though he said he has ''wavered on religion and wondered if it truly served the needs of the people,'' he was surprised by what he found.
''I was inspired by many of the people I photographed,'' he said. ''The way they defined their mission and understand their congregation and its needs, and by extension linking up with the greater community.''
Below are excerpts from Mr. Muhammad's conversations with each of his subjects, including audio clips. The conversations have been edited and condensed.
Rev. Jo-An Owings
''I've been the pastor of Mount Zion for six years. I was called to preach and what that means is that I believe that the Holy Spirit moved in me before I realized what I would do. Also, my mother was a preacher, my cousin was a preacher and my grandfather was a preacher and he founded this church. So maybe preaching was in my blood.''
Rev. Calvin O. Butts, III
''There's got to be some elevation of valleys and some bringing down of mountains so that all us stand fairly on equal plane. And we've got to break free from the kind of propaganda that somehow is spreading rapidly, that if you're poor it's your own fault. And taking the focus off the exploitation and deception that poor people face, not only by the hands of the large corporate entities, but also by the media controlled largely by these corporate entities.''
Rev. Dr. Michael A. Walrond
''I think that no matter who you are, no matter how old you are - we all cry, we all hurt. We all know what it is to mourn, to lose. To feel joy. And sometimes preachers forget to speak to those issues that people deal with daily. So that whether you're 80 or 18, there's a commonality in our humanity that binds us. And it is our realities that really at the end of the day make us human, those emotions. So when you speak to those - and are genuine and authentic - everyone will be drawn, I think, whether old or young.''
Imam Izak-El Mu'eed Pasha
''What brought me to Harlem to the historical Malcolm Shabazz Mosque was a request by the members here after the passing of the late imam, Ali Rashid - God give the power for his great work. I was a helper in many aspects of business but not an imam. I refused it the first time - I didn't feel that I was qualified. But they insisted, and I accepted it based on their asking me and the love that I have for the pioneers here. That's 19 years ago now, so praise be to God.''
Rev. Jose Roberto Gandara-Perea
''We are a bilingual congregation. We are English speakers and Spanish speakers from different countries of Latin America. We have Dominicans, African-Americans and West Indians. I think we are a melting place where we can come and share our differences, respecting our differences, sharing our common goals and I think that is a contribution we have. We are a place where we can be brothers and sisters from different backgrounds.''
Rev. Jose Humphreys
''The role of pastor has changed. Back in my day, pastors would be soul-tenders. They would provide spiritual nourishment through Bible study and teaching and visiting the sick. Nowadays, pastors are expected to be C.E.O.'s, counselors, prognosticators. Just about every single hat that they can wear. It reminds me of the Wild West, when you had the person who was the sheriff and who was also the hotel clerk and who also ran the business down the street.''
Rev. Pedro Prado Ocegueda
''The basic call to the church is to preach the goodness of Jesus Christ - salvation through Jesus Christ. Because we work with human beings, we need to be aware of their needs -- economic, social, emotional. So we try to focus on every aspect of their lives. I am like a social worker in my congregation, and I also work with issues in the community like violence and drug addiction.''
Rev. Dr. Patricia A. Singletary
''I was called to the ministries in my early 30s, but at that time, women were not preachers in the Baptist church. Today there were quite a few women that are called to ministry, are very active and very visible in ministry. Yes, we had a rough time. As a matter of fact, there were some seminaries who would not accept women as students because women were not called to be in ministry, or so they believed. But if you will check the seminary rolls today, you will find that almost 75 percent of the enrollees were women.''
Rev. D. Albert Turk
''For most of my ministry as a pastor, I've been assigned to churches where the membership has gone down or the building needs repair. It can get frustrating. By the grace of God and those congregation members, I have to been able to turn those places around. I have come to an epiphany that I have some kind of ability to handle this, and so now I don't fret these situations anymore. I now understand I've been equipped by God to handle those kind of congregations. I receive it now gladly and go forward with it.''
Rev. Earl Kooperkamp
''The prophet Isaiah, two and a half millennia ago, said maintain justice and do what is right. We're seeing mass incarceration, some of it starting literally right here on the street in front of the church with the stop and frisk policies of the New York Police Department. They are stopping 1,900 to 2,000 young men every day, the vast majority young African-American and Latino men. Quite frankly, if Jesus of Nazareth were walking around the streets of New York City in 2012 - young man of color - he'd have a 90 percent chance that he would be stopped and frisked.''
Rev. Grace E. Bowen
''The gospel of Jesus Christ is very proactive - clothing the naked, feeding the poor, feeding the hungry, visiting the incarcerated. Society puts a very political spin on that. I can remember being challenged all along the way as to whether or not my call was perceived to be political or theological. I don't see them as separate.''
Paul Radensky
''I was a student at the Jewish Theological Seminary and my wife started coming here, so I started coming with her. And then the rabbi who was here - Rabbi Kret, who was here for nearly 50 years - got our phone number and started calling me every Friday night requesting that I come. He was a Holocaust survivor and had been the head of a yeshiva in Poland and you couldn't say no to him without feeling really guilty. I fell in love with the sense of authenticity here.''
Father Gregory C. Chisholm
''I studied engineering as an undergraduate and graduate student at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Mass. You know there are tensions that have existed primarily since the enlightenment in the 18th century between religion and science. I have found at least in my own experience that the two worked very much in tandem. If I were trying to form a world that was without any difficulty or challenges, I could neither turn to religion, nor science. Both of them have their limitations, but both of them are very helpful in getting us to do things in the world that are valuable and important.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Accuses Former Franklin Bank Executives of Covering Up Losses in Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
Two former executives of the Franklin Bank Corporation, a now-defunct lender started by the mortgage bond pioneer Lewis Ranieri, have been accused of hiding losses during the final days of the company. 
In a complaint filed on Thursday in United States District Court in Texas, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Anthony J. Nocella, Franklin's former chief executive, and J. Russell McCann, the bank's former chief financial officer, of misstating the health of their company during the financial crisis, when a series of mortgage loans on the bank's books went sour and it struggled to stay afloat.
According to the S.E.C.'s complaint, the two executives ''engaged in a disclosure and accounting fraud that misled investors about Franklin's financial condition and concealed the extent of its exposure to loan delinquencies.'' Franklin, which was based in Houston, declared bankruptcy in 2008.
Loan modification programs were at the center of the S.E.C.'s complaint.
''Nocella and McCann used the loan modification scheme like a magic wand to change nonperforming loans into performing assets,'' Robert Khuzami, the agency's enforcement director, said in a statement accompanying the charges. Mr. Khuzami added that the executives had ''misled investors into believing that Franklin was outperforming other banks during the height of the financial crisis.''
Barrett H. Reasoner, a lawyer for Mr. McCann, said his client believed that the claims against him ''don't have any merit.'' Mr. Reasoner said the evidence in the case was ''contrary to what the S.E.C. has pled.''
In an e-mailed statement, James G. Munisteri, a lawyer for Mr. Nocella, said the S.E.C. had ''made a seriously wrong decision in alleging this claim, and we believe confidently that Mr. Nocella will be vindicated.''
The S.E.C. says Mr. McCann and Mr. Nocella used the modification programs - with names like ''Fresh Start'' and ''Great New'' - to falsely classify delinquent loans as healthy in 2007.
At one point, Mr. Ranieri, who then was chairman of Franklin, spoke with Mr. Nocella and another executive to discuss a ''$6 million shortfall in loan modifications,'' according to the S.E.C. The agency said Mr. Ranieri, who was not charged with wrongdoing, was ''furious'' that the modifications had been overstated.
After the call, Mr. Nocella, ''in an effort to conceal the $6 million shortfall and placate Ranieri,'' directed an executive to ''implement a retroactive, unilateral-loan-modification program to reduce the third-quarter nonperforming loan amounts without requiring a payment from the borrower,'' the agency said.
Such programs, the agency said, allowed the bank to hide more than $24 million in nonperforming loans and led to income reports that were inflated more than 300 percent. The company was later forced to restate its financial information. Franklin failed in 2008.
In addition to accusing Mr. Nocella and Mr. McCann of violations of securities law, the S.E.C. is looking to recover $75,000 in bonus payments the two men received during the time of the reported misconduct.

HEADLINE: After A Winter Of Strong Gains, Job Growth Ebbs

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH; Ashley Parker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
Although signs pointed to a strengthening economy earlier this year, the jobs report on Friday came with a message: don't get ahead of yourself.
The country's employers added a disappointing 120,000 jobs in March, about half the net gains posted in each of the preceding three months. The unemployment rate, which comes from a separate survey of households rather than employers, slipped to 8.2 percent, from 8.3 percent, as a smaller portion of the population looked for work.
Politicians seized on the data, with Mitt Romney, the front-runner in the Republican presidential nominating contest, characterizing the report as ''weak and very troubling.'' President Obama emphasized that employers had added more than 600,000 jobs in the last three months, but acknowledged the ''ups and downs'' in the jobs picture.
The slowdown suggests that employers remain cautious about hiring as they digest the impact of rising gas prices, especially on consumers, and as they face uncertainty about health care and pension costs. 
Despite some indications, like falling unemployment claims, that the job market was finding its footing, anxieties have built in recent weeks about whether a stronger pace of recovery could be sustained.
The economic outlook abroad is worrisome. Global stock markets grew skittish this week as the ballooning debt and a weak bond offering in Spain raised the specter of a deepening slump in Europe. The United States stock market has also had several days of declines after a strong first-quarter performance. Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has tried to temper expectations and noted in a speech last month that the ''better jobs numbers seem somewhat out of sync with the overall pace of economic expansion.''
With the United States stock market closed for Good Friday, futures on the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped by more than 1 percent in limited trading.
The March pullback in hiring eerily repeats a pattern set in the last two years, when an apparent pickup in the winter was followed by a slowdown in the spring. The monthly snapshot of the job market from the Labor Department can reflect transitory factors, however, and is often revised. The job gains in February, for example, were revised up to 240,000 from the 227,000 initially reported. Seasonal factors may also be playing a role, after the unusually warm winter.
Economists suggested that the trend among employers to wring more work from fewer people continued to be a hallmark of this recovery.
''What we are seeing now is an agonizingly slow recovery in the job market,'' said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. ''I believe what this reflects is this laser focus intensity that business leaders have nowadays to try to be able to increase production with less reliance on labor as a means to do so.''
Private sector companies added 121,000 jobs in March as governments shed 1,000 jobs, driven by layoffs in the postal system and at the local level.
Among industries, manufacturing continued its run as the stalwart of job growth, adding 37,000 jobs in March.
But economists cautioned that factories were unlikely to bring back a majority of the two million people who lost their jobs during the recession.
Rather, manufacturers are recalibrating. ''In the worst of a downturn like this, they probably kicked too many people out the door,'' said Cliff Waldman, senior economist at MAPI/the Manufacturers Alliance. ''And now even with modest growth they have to bring people back.''
Joel Long, chief executive of GSM Services, an air-conditioning installer and roofing contractor that also makes some of its parts in Gastonia, N.C., said he had five openings for sales staff, production workers and a project manager. His family-owned company, which employs about 130 people, is doing well enough to hire in part because ''the competition has gone away,'' he said.
Despite recent improvements in store sales, retailers shed nearly 34,000 jobs last month, a sign to some economists that the rapid incursion of e-commerce had hurt employment in the sector.
''You simply need fewer workers when you're selling from a distribution center,'' said Patrick O'Keefe, director of economic research at J. H. Cohn and a deputy assistant secretary for employment and training in the Reagan administration.
While the slowdown in job growth seemed to reinforce Mr. Bernanke's concern about the disjuncture between overall economic growth and job growth around the turn of the year, economists suggested long-term trends could also be behind the protracted sluggishness.
''There are definitely some structural headwinds,'' said Michelle Girard, senior United States economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland. Many companies contend that they would hire more if only they could find more skilled workers. Other workers are unable to move for a new job because they are stuck in homes that are worth less than what they owe on their mortgages.
''I think that's why it is going to take a while to get back to where we were,'' Ms. Girard said. ''It could take years to get back to the labor market that we saw in the years before the downturn.''
The usual precursors to hiring improvement were weak in March. Average weekly hours slipped to 34.5 from 34.6, and average weekly earnings were also down, to $806.96 from $807.56 a month earlier. Hiring by temporary firms declined by 7,500 jobs.
Jeffrey A. Joerres, chief executive of Manpower Group, said that companies were hitting the ''slow motion button'' in hiring. He characterized employers' attitudes as ''Hmm, if I can digest a little bit right now and see what's out there, I'll do that.''
But Janette Marx, a senior vice president at Adecco North America, another job placement firm, said that clients were beginning to convert temporary workers to permanent hires and that companies that had postponed projects were beginning to revive them for later in the year. ''They are getting ready to ramp up their work force to staff projects that they had put on the back burner for a while,'' Ms. Marx said.
Although the number of people out of work for six months or longer fell to 5.3 million, from 5.4 million in the February report, the number of people who said they were without a job for five weeks or less rose to 2.57 million.
The modest job growth in March seemed to favor men over women. Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and former chief economist at the Labor Department, noted that women took only 38,000 of the 120,000 jobs added in March. What's more, she said, ''men got more than half the gains in health care and education, a traditionally female-dominated industry.''
Deborah Harrison, a former administrative assistant in Louisville, Ky., has managed to land only a few short contract assignments in the three years since she lost her job.
The longer she is out of work, she said, the more she is tarnished with the stigma of unemployment. ''I think that raises a red flag,'' said Ms. Harrison, who said she spent several hours a day searching for jobs online. ''It's not hopeless,'' she added, ''but it's not real encouraging either.''

HEADLINE: Malawi Leader's Death Is Reported Unofficially, and U.S. Worries About Succession

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London, and Peter Jegwa Kumwenda from Lilongwe, Malawi.

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG -- The United States expressed concern about the future of the impoverished African nation of Malawi on Friday after a swirl of reports that its president, stricken by a heart attack, had died, suggesting that the delay in an official announcement reflected possible succession problems.
Medical and government officials in Lilongwe, Malawi's capital, said the president, Bingu wa Mutharika, died on Thursday after the heart attack. But the government had not announced his death. Instead, Information Minister Patricia Kaliati announced on the radio late Friday night that the president was being treated in South Africa and that she would give an update on his condition after speaking to his doctors Saturday morning. 
Joyce Banda, the vice president and the next in line for the presidency under Malawi's Constitution, said in a brief statement to a private radio station that she had sought clarification from the South African government on the president's condition, but did not say what reply she had received.
''The people of Malawi have the right to know the state of health of President Bingu wa Mutharika,'' Mrs. Banda said, according to The Associated Press, apparently trying to head off any effort to prevent her from taking office as president. ''I am appealing to the people of Malawi that we must abide the rules. The laws say if the president is incapacitated, the vice president takes over. It's my hope that Malawians shall adhere to the Constitution.''
Mrs. Banda, once an ally of Mr. Mutharika, was expelled from his political party after a falling-out. Mr. Mutharika has been widely seen as grooming his brother, Foreign Minister Peter Mutharika, for the presidency. The minister frequently stood in for the president during his absences. On Friday, the president's party announced that Peter Mutharika would take over as party president, but made no mention of the president's condition.
The State Department issued a condolence statement that strongly suggested the president was dead but was carefully worded to avoid the appearance of confirming it, saying he had ''reportedly passed away after a sudden illness.'' The statement, by Johnnie Carson, the assistant secretary for African affairs, also expressed anxiety about what would happen next.
''Malawi's Constitution lays out a clear path for succession, and we expect it to be observed,'' Mr. Carson said. ''We are concerned about the delay in the transfer of power. We trust that the vice president who is next in line will be sworn in shortly.''
The president, a 78-year-old former World Bank economist, was elected in 2004. Credited with turning around the economy of a landlocked, perpetually poor southeast African nation by helping farmers produce more food, Mr. Mutharika was re-elected by a wide margin five years later.
But his popularity has faded in the face of declining demand for Malawi's main cash crop, tobacco, and accusations that he had mishandled the economy. Rising fuel prices and shrinking foreign exchange reserves have compounded hardship for many of Malawi's 15 million people, and Mr. Mutharika, who styled himself as the ''economist in chief,'' resisted advice from the International Monetary Fund to devalue the country's currency.
As unrest grew last year, the police responded to protests with force, firing on a demonstration and killing 19 people in July. The United States suspended a $350 million grant program in response, a major blow to a nation with an annual budget of just $2 billion. Mr. Mutharika expelled the British ambassador after the leak of a cable that quoted him as saying that the president was ''becoming ever more autocratic and intolerant of criticism.''
Human rights advocates and academics sounded alarms about authoritarian tendencies, which they compared with those of Hastings Kamuzu Banda, the dictator who ruled the country for 30 years until the advent of multiparty elections in 1994.
Last month, Mr. Mutharika's office released a lengthy directive banning the use of the term ''the Big Kahuna'' to refer to Mr. Mutharika, saying that ''the laws of Malawi provide for the total respect and protection of the head of state.'' The news media had widely used that term for him.
The statement also said the government was monitoring social media Web sites for content that was ''hostile and probably careless in demeaning the state president.''
John-Gift Mwakhwawa of the Malawi Law Society said Mr. Mutharika became more autocratic after his party won many legislative seats in 2009.
''In the first five years, he really had to perform because he didn't have a majority in Parliament,'' Mr. Mwakhwawa said. ''He was always on his toes.''
Fidelis Edge Kanyongolo, a law professor and analyst at the University of Malawi, said the country had been on edge.
''There has been a lot of discontent and a lot of worry about the economy, politics and security,'' Professor Kanyongolo said.
Vice President Banda, the legal successor if the president is dead, formed her own political party after being expelled from Mr. Mutharika's. Analysts said that if his death was confirmed, Mr. Mutharika's supporters might argue that she was not really the vice president and try to put an ally of the president in her place.
The seriousness of Mr. Mutharika's illness first became apparent when police officers were deployed in force across the capital on Thursday as he was rushed to a hospital. Army officers took up position around the vice president's residence, Reuters quoted witnesses as saying.
On the streets of Lilongwe, amid rumors of the president's illness and reports of his death, there were few signs of mourning. ''If that is what was needed in order to improve our country's economic situation, then I am afraid I'll have to say the death is good news,'' said Eric Muganga, 48, a taxi driver.
Austin Lungu, 28, a bartender, said the mood was festive in his bar. ''Everyone here is cerebrating,'' he said. ''We have been suffering for a long time; this has to be very welcome news.''

HEADLINE: Credit Card Borrowing Falls; Car Lending Is on the Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans took out more loans to buy cars and attend school in February but used their credit cards less frequently for the second consecutive month, the Federal Reserve said Friday. 
Consumers increased borrowing by $8.7 billion, the sixth straight monthly increase, the Federal Reserve said in its monthly report.
The increase in borrowing was driven by an $11 billion increase in the category that includes mostly auto and student loans. Borrowing on credit cards fell by $2 billion, after a $3 billion decline in January.
Total consumer borrowing rose to a seasonally adjusted $2.52 trillion. The figure was nearly at prerecession levels and was up from a postrecession low point of $2.39 trillion reached in September 2010. Borrowing had tumbled for more than two years during and immediately after the recession.
Consumer borrowing rose by $18.6 billion in January, after similar gains in December and November. The gains for those three months were the largest in a decade.
A rise in borrowing could suggest that consumers are feeling more confident about the economy. However, few are comfortable enough to step up credit card use. Consumers carried $799 billion in credit card debt in February -- 15 percent less than they held in December 2007, the first month of the recession.
Steven Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics, said February's borrowing increase was strong. But he said it was the smallest increase since October.
''Consumers still appear to be reluctant to use their credit cards,'' Mr. Wood said in a note to clients.
Consumers are taking on more debt at a time when their wages have not kept pace with inflation. And they are paying more for gasoline. The average price per gallon nationally was $3.94 on Friday.
Households began borrowing less and saving more when the recession began and unemployment surged. While the expectation is that consumers are ready to resume borrowing, they are not expected to load up on debt the way they did during the housing boom of the last decade.
The Federal Reserve's borrowing report covers auto loans, student loans and credit cards. It excludes mortgages, home equity loans and other loans tied to real estate.

HEADLINE: Architecture's Ugly Ducklings May Not Get Time to Be Swans

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
GOSHEN, N.Y. -- As Modernist buildings reach middle age, many of the stark structures that once represented the architectural vanguard are showing signs of wear, setting off debates around the country between preservationists, who see them as historic landmarks, and the many people who just see them as eyesores.
The conflict has come in recent months to this quaint village 60 miles north of New York City -- with its historic harness-racing track, picturesque Main Street and Greek Revival, Federal and Victorian houses -- where the blocky concrete county government center designed by the celebrated Modernist architect Paul Rudolph has always been something of a misfit.
''I just don't think it fits with the character of the county seat and the village of Goshen,'' said Leigh Benton, an Orange County legislator who grew up in the area. ''I just thought it was a big ugly building.'' 
Completed in 1967, the building has long been plagued by a leaky roof and faulty ventilation system and, more recently, by mold; it was closed last year after it was damaged by storms, including Tropical Storm Irene.
Edward A. Diana, the Orange County executive, wants to demolish it, an idea that has delighted many residents but alarmed preservationists, local and national, who say the building should be saved. The county legislature is expected to decide whether to demolish or renovate it next month.
Those who want to save it call it a prime example of an architectural style called Brutalism that rejected efforts to prettify buildings in favor of displaying the raw power of simple forms and undisguised building materials, like the center's textured facade.
''Preservation is not simply about saving the most beautiful things,'' said Mark Wigley, the dean of Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. ''It's about saving those objects that are an important part of our history and whose value is always going to be a subject of debate.''
A similar debate is going on in Chicago, where preservationists have been fighting to save Prentice Women's Hospital, a concrete, cloverleaf-shaped 1974 structure designed by Bertrand Goldberg that the National Trust for Historic Preservation has placed on its endangered list. In New Haven, the 1972 Veterans Memorial Coliseum was demolished in 2007 despite a campaign to rescue it.
In Manhattan, 2 Columbus Circle, the 1964 ''lollipop'' building by Edward Durell Stone, escaped demolition but was renovated in 2008 in a way that stripped away its original facade.
Preserving charming confections from the 18th- and 19th-century can be a struggle; convincing people to keep more recent, decidedly uncute structures built from 1950 into the 1970s can be a battle of an entirely higher magnitude, especially if they've sprung leaks.
''The phenomenon of a building that's about 30 to 40 years old being severely out of style and leading to people wanting to alter it or demolish it is very real,'' said Frank Sanchis, the director of United States programs at the World Monuments Fund page, about the Orange County Government Center here. The fund put the Goshen building on its 2012 watch list.
Opinions are even stronger when it comes to Brutalism, a style closely associated with the Swiss architect Le Corbusier, and one that tends to produce weighty monoliths like the F.B.I. headquarters in Washington and Boston City Hall.
In an interview Theodore Dalrymple, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute who has written about the architecture of Le Corbusier, described Brutalist buildings as ''absolutely hideous, like scouring pads on the retina.''
''One of those buildings can destroy an entire cityscape that has been built up over hundreds of years,'' he said.
Barry Bergdoll, the chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, said: ''Brutalism was supposed to bring back all sorts of things like craft -- the concrete wasn't smooth, you could feel the hand of the worker there. But it was perceived in almost the exact opposite way. It's one of the great public relations failures of all time. Most people think of Brutalist architecture literally -- as aggressive, heavy, boding and forbidding.''
Rudolph, who died in 1997, was a prominent Modernist architect who also designed Yale's Art and Architecture Building, among others. Architectural historians say the Goshen government center, which features protruding cubes and a corrugated concrete facade resembling corduroy, represents Rudolph at his best.
''I would easily identify this as one of his top 10,'' said Sean Khorsandi, a director of the Paul Rudolph Foundation.
But Mr. Benton, the county legislator, called it ''a world monument to inefficiency.'' Each camp has its own estimate for how much it will cost to renovate the center -- the preservation side says about $35 million, the county says $65 million. For an additional $20 million, county officials say, they would be able to build a new center (probably traditional) and to improve several other county buildings. The government offices that were in the center have dispersed around the county.
''I'm a pretty modern type of person when it comes to architecture and paintings,'' said Mr. Diana, the county executive. ''If the building functioned in the right manner and was effective and efficient, I'd leave the building right where it is.''
Economics aside, many say the Rudolph building simply has never belonged in Goshen and never will.
''It's just so out of place,'' said Barbara Hatfield, a longtime county resident. ''Goshen is the county seat. There's a lot of history there.''
But others argue that the building is part of the area's history, too.
''It reflects a snapshot in time in the late '60s and '70s, when our history was turbulent,'' said Patricia Turner, a resident trained as an architect who wants to save the building. ''Isn't that just as relevant as something that happened in 1868?''
John Hildreth, a vice president at the National Trust, said architectural taste changes over time and then can change again.
''There was a time when people weren't concerned about saving Victorian houses, bungalows, Art Deco buildings -- all were not favored styles,'' he said. ''You have to focus on the significance of the building and not its style, because styles will come and go. We're at a point where we're evaluating the recent past and coming up against that.''
Historians also say appreciating architecture can require an education.
''It's like saying, 'I don't like Pollock because he splattered paint,' '' said Nina Rappaport, chairwoman of Docomomo-New York/Tri-State, an organization that promotes the preservation of Modernist architecture. ''Does that mean we shouldn't put it in a museum? No, it means we teach people about these things.''
But Mr. Dalrymple said the notion that the public needs to be educated to appreciate Brutalism is like saying that people ''need to be intimidated out of their taste.''
No expertise is needed to decide that a building is ugly, he said, adding, ''It's an aesthetic judgment.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 10, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about a dispute over whether to restore or demolish the Modernist county government center in Goshen, N.Y., designed by Paul Rudolph, misspelled the surname of an influential painter cited by a preservationist who said people should be taught to appreciate some works of modern art and architecture. He was Jackson Pollock, not Pollack.

HEADLINE: In a Mixed Jobs Report, Ammunition for All Sides on the Economy: As Obama Praises Data, Romney Deplores It

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It is fast becoming a monthly rite of the election season: the Labor Department issues a statistics-laden report on the job market, and President Obama and his opponents mine the numbers for political advantage.
With few major changes expected in the employment picture between now and November, the competition is largely on the margins -- though, as the reaction to Friday's report demonstrated, that makes it no less lively. 
Within hours of the report's release, the White House and the Republicans both issued statements saying the job numbers validated their respective arguments: that the president's policies were aiding the recovery from a historic downturn, or that Mr. Obama has been a failed steward of the economy.
Mr. Obama acknowledged that the report was a mixed bag, welcoming the fact that the economy had added 120,000 jobs and that the unemployment rate had dropped a notch. But he conceded, ''It's clear to every American that there will still be ups and downs along the way, and that we've still got a lot to do.''
Republicans pounced on the lower-than-expected payroll numbers, with the party's front-runner, Mitt Romney, declaring, ''This is a weak and very troubling jobs report that shows the employment remains stagnant.'' Speaker John A. Boehner and Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, also deplored the numbers and laid the blame for them at Mr. Obama's feet.
Given the likelihood that the jobless rate will neither surge nor swoon in the next few months, economists and political analysts said that what mattered for the president, and his challenger, was less the monthly snapshot than the broad perception of whether the economy was moving in the right direction.
''Momentum tops level, when it comes to political dynamics,'' said Jared Bernstein, a former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who now works at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That would seem to favor the president, though Mr. Bernstein added, ''I didn't think we were out of the woods before this, and I still don't. It is by no means impossible that we're at the beginning of an unfavorable period.''
In his public remarks, Mr. Obama has tended to project a mix of cautious optimism and unfinished business, regardless of whether the jobless numbers exceed or fall below expectations. But he also accentuates the positive -- noting, for example, that the unemployment rate ''ticked down'' from 8.3 percent to 8.2 percent and that the economy added 600,000 jobs in the last three months.
Mr. Obama made no mention of the disappointing trends in the report: that the number of people added to payrolls was half that of recent months, or that the drop in the unemployment rate actually reflected more people dropping out of the labor force.
Then he swiftly pivoted to his administration's efforts to help women in the work force, which the White House showcased in a daylong conference. With polls showing that the Democrats hold a strong advantage over Republicans among women, Mr. Obama clearly wanted to keep the focus on that.
Over the last few months, when the economy was adding more than 200,000 jobs, Mr. Romney had to carefully calibrate his response. This time, however, he played up numbers that show the overall labor market is shrinking.
''Millions of Americans are paying a high price for President Obama's economic policies,'' Mr. Romney said, ''and more and more people are growing so discouraged that they are dropping out of the labor market altogether.''
Mr. Boehner, who issued his statement barely 30 minutes after the release of the job numbers, said, ''Today's report shows that families and small businesses are still struggling to get by because of President Obama's failed economic policies.'' The president, he said, had worsened the problem, with a budget that raises taxes and with his blocking of the Keystone pipeline.
The president's advisers said it made little sense to get caught up in the vagaries of the job report, as long as the economy's overall trend was upward. The monthly report, they noted, is subject to volatility, is frequently revised up or down in subsequent months, and has a margin of error of 100,000 jobs.
''It's less important to focus on month-to-month than on the general trend,'' said David Plouffe, a senior political adviser to the president. ''We are definitely on a trajectory that suggests the economy is recovering.''
Administration officials said they were less worried than last fall about an external shock from the financial crisis in the European Union. But they continue to fret about the Middle East, where warnings about an Israeli military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, and Iranian threats of retaliation, have driven up oil prices.
In the end, said Geoff Garin, a Democratic strategist who supports Mr. Obama, ''The prevailing level of economic optimism or pessimism will be the most important driver of how voters approach the election, and those feelings certainly don't rise and fall on the basis of one month's jobs statistics.''
While Friday's report may give Republicans fresh ammunition -- the jobless rate has been above 8 percent for three years, to cite one unflattering statistic -- Mr. Romney and others have to be careful not to overdo it.
''One of the dangers for our political opponents is not to seem overly exultant when certain reports are not as strong as predicted,'' Mr. Plouffe said.

HEADLINE: India's Tax Plan Troubles Foreign Investors

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Neha Thirani contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India -- Just two months ago, worried about their slowing economy, Indian officials were promising to promote policies to make the country more hospitable to foreign investment.
Instead, the government has done the opposite -- proposed a budget festooned with new taxes that would make it more difficult and expensive for outsiders to invest here.
No wonder foreign investors are putting off deals and new investments in India while they wait for Parliament to consider those proposals, according to executives, lawyers and accountants.
Political handicappers expect legislators to approve the new taxes later this month because the government desperately needs to raise money to reduce its fiscal deficit. 
''There is an 'Oh, my God' factor,'' about the tax proposals, said Nandan S. Nelivigi, a partner at the law firm White & Case in New York who advises companies that do business in India. He said he knew of at least two foreign acquisition deals involving Indian firms that had been delayed while executives wait to see what happens with the tax measures.
''New deals -- there is no question that they are on hold until the tax implications are clear,'' Mr. Nelivigi said.
Last week a group of business associations representing 250,000 companies in the United States, Canada, Britain, Japan and Hong Kong sent a letter to the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh. They warned that India would ''lose significant ground as a destination for international investment'' if it adopted the tax changes.
Any slowing of foreign investment would come at a difficult time for the Indian economy, which has cooled considerably from its blistering 9.9 percent growth rate of only two years ago. Last year, it was down to 7.4 percent and is expected to do no better than 7 percent this year.
And recent data shows that India has become increasingly reliant on capital from the United States, Europe and Japan to help offset not only its budget deficit but also its ballooning trade deficit, which was estimated at $175 billion for the 12 months ending in March, largely a result of oil imports and a big trade imbalance with China.
Even before the government's proposed budget was unveiled in mid-March, foreign investment in India had been slowing as the economy weakened and businesses fumed about the glacial pace of market-opening changes in the country.
India's business reputation suffered a big blow late last year when policy makers quickly reversed a decision to relax restrictions on foreign investment in the retail industry after a political ally of Prime Minister Singh protested that the move would hurt small shopkeepers.
But that was a minor dust-up compared with the fury of the foreign business community last month as they discovered two dozen tax proposals tucked away in the country's fiscal budget -- initiatives that they say could leave them responsible for billions of dollars in taxes they had not anticipated. One change would empower the country to tax any offshore transactions involving assets in India dating to 1962. Another measure would levy a 10 percent tax on any software imported into India since 1976.
Securities investors have registered their concern in measurable ways. In the 10 trading days after introduction of the proposals, foreign investors had net sales of about 31 billion rupees ($600 million) in Indian stocks and bonds, according to government data. By comparison, they had net purchases of 57.7 billion rupees in the 10 days before the budget.
Perhaps the most far-reaching change is one that would give tax collectors the power to challenge long-standing legal maneuvers and tax treaties used by foreign investors to limit or avoid taxes. That change would enable India to tax investment funds that route their investments to India via the African island nation of Mauritius, which has a nearly three-decade-old tax treaty with India. In recent years, about 40 percent of all foreign direct investment into India has come through Mauritius.
Investors and analysts say the changes, considered together, would give too much leeway to tax collectors to determine who, and what kind of activity, can be taxed.
Moreover, critics say some of the retroactive proposals are written in a way that would override court judgments in favor of taxpayers. That includes an Indian Supreme Court ruling in January that Vodafone, the British telecommunications giant, did not owe $2.2 billion in capital gains taxes demanded by Indian tax officials.
''People are concerned regarding the ramifications these provisions can have on their corporate actions,'' said Punit Shah, a partner at the accounting firm KPMG India. ''Foreign investors are rethinking their strategy. Some people are holding back their plans for three months to see what makes it into law.''
One chief executive of a large American corporation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid offending Indian officials said he and other executives he had spoken to were not doing anything to change existing investments in India. But they were ''taking time to think about'' new projects.
That executive and others said that while they remain convinced of India's long-term growth prospects, right now they were focusing more on other fast-growing countries like China, Indonesia and Brazil. And some portfolio managers say they are paralyzed because they have no way of knowing what kinds of income and profits could be taxed in the future -- or be hit for back taxes.
Some advisers, including Mr. Shah, say certain types of foreign funds could reduce their tax burden by moving from Mauritius to Singapore, which has a slightly different tax treaty with India. But other experts are not sure that such moves would make much of a difference.
''We are still trying to decipher this,'' said Rahul Bhasin, managing partner of Baring Private Equity Partners India, which has invested $1 billion of foreign capital in India through Mauritius-based funds over the last 10 years. ''My biggest concern is good faith. I don't think these laws will be used in good faith.''
Indian policy makers have defended their proposals, saying they were meant to clarify the intent of the country's tax laws and ensure that investors did not use tax havens to avoid paying taxes on the capital gains they earned by investing in India. It has defended its use of retroactive laws by pointing out that countries like Britain have also changed some tax laws retroactively.
''If someone offered to invest $200 billion in India only if there is no tax, I will not allow it,'' the finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, told reporters recently. ''This is because India is not a tax haven, zero-tax or low-tax country.''
Still, he has tried to allay some of the concerns of investors. Last week, after the Indian stock market fell sharply, Mr. Mukherjee announced that he did not intend to tax a derivative financial instrument known as participatory notes. The notes are used by traders who want to track the performance of Indian stocks without directly investing in them.
Stocks recovered after his statement, but lawyers and accountants remain skeptical about his assurances because the proposal seems aimed at financial derivatives.
''The manner in which they are going about it, that is sending a chill down the spine of many investors,'' said Mukesh Bhutani, a prominent Indian tax lawyer.

HEADLINE: Obama and Democrats Ready to Pressure Republicans on 'Buffett Rule'

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama and Senate Democrats will kick off a coordinated pressure campaign on Republicans next week ahead of a tax day vote on legislation to enact the president's ''Buffett Rule,'' which would ensure that the rich pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes.
Mr. Obama will travel to Florida on Tuesday for a speech on the Buffett Rule, named after the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett, who has made a point of saying that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. The Obama campaign will hold Buffett Rule events in other swing states that day, and Senate Democratic leaders have encouraged Democratic senators to get involved with those campaign efforts. 
''Making sure that everyone plays by the same set of rules is key to ensuring the economic security of the middle class,'' said Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman, ''and the president will continue to make this case next week.''
The push comes ahead of a procedural vote on April 16 that will decide whether the Senate will even debate the bill, and Democrats give it little chance of reaching the necessary 60-vote threshold. The blitz comes with some risks. After Friday's jobs report for March fell short of expectations, Republicans will make the case that raising taxes -- even on the very wealthy -- would do nothing to put Americans to work.
''This is yet another proposal from Democrats that won't create a single job or lower the price at the pump by a penny, but may have the opposite effect,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate minority leader.
But Democrats see multiple reasons to go forward. The bill will put political pressure on some Republicans, especially two senators facing tough re-election fights, Dean Heller of Nevada and Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts. And it will allow Mr. Obama and his surrogates to go after Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, not only on his low tax rate -- he paid 13.9 percent in 2010 on $21.7 million in income -- but also on his refusal to release more tax returns than 2010 and a 2011 estimate.
''Governor Romney will have to explain why he believes it is fair that he and the wealthiest Americans who make most of their income from investments pay a lower tax rate than middle-class families,'' said Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman.
The Obama campaign demanded that Mr. Romney emulate his father and other previous presidential candidates, Mr. Obama included, who released years of tax returns. A Romney campaign adviser, Eric Fehrnstrom, told the cable news channel MSNBC on Friday that the releases of the 2010 returns and the 2011 estimate were ''sufficient.''
Mayor Michael A. Nutter of Philadelphia said Friday on a conference call set up by the Democratic National Committee: ''Here's a guy running for president of the United States. Level with the public, and let the American people know just what those tax returns look like.''
The Senate legislation would establish a minimum 30 percent tax rate for households earning at least $2 million a year, with a lower minimum rate for incomes between $1 million and $2 million. Such wealthy families would calculate their taxes normally, and using the minimum tax rate, then pay the higher amount.
Republicans see the push as a political loser at a time when jobs and energy prices are top concerns. The Romney camp used the effort to portray Mr. Obama as a tax-and-spend liberal.
''President Obama may wish for a perfect world in which he could spend as much as possible,'' said the Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul, ''but the last thing we need in this struggling economy is higher taxes on anyone.''
But Democrats view the coming Buffett Rule vote as fitting into a theme of ''fairness'' for the middle class at a time when most Americans see a society tilted in favor of a wealthy elite. An Associated Press/GfK poll in February found that 65 percent favor a law requiring all Americans with incomes of $1 million or more to pay at least 30 percent in taxes. Only 26 percent opposed.
White House officials will target senators in 13 states with media outreach efforts, while Obama campaign volunteers try to raise the heat.
''This is one of those issues where if the American people are watching, our chances of winning the vote are dramatically improved,'' said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island and the author of the Buffett Rule bill. ''If people can vote in the dark, the special interests that support the loophole have a much, much better chance of holding on.''
Few believe there will be enough -- or any -- Republican defections. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, told reporters this would be the first of many votes on the issue. The vote on April 16 is on stand-alone legislation that would devote the estimated $47 billion in added tax revenue over 10 years to deficit reduction. Future votes would use the Buffett Rule to offset the cost of job-creation measures like infrastructure spending, student loan relief or tax breaks to encourage hiring.
Mr. Whitehouse said that by raising public attention, Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats would increase the chances that some sort of minimum tax level for the rich would be part of an end-of-year deal, when the Bush-era tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 are set to expire.

HEADLINE: Limits on Lobbyists as Hosts? Simply Unworkable, They Say

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Tough new limits proposed on the way special interests could court executive branch officials have prompted a fierce counterattack from lobbyists who fear they will end a cherished Washington ritual: hosting federal workers at events like conferences, cocktail parties, galas and movie screenings.
Filmmakers and farmers, gun makers and real estate agents, and people in dozens of other industries say the rules under consideration by the Obama administration would choke off their ability to have a mutually beneficial dialogue with government officials. As a result, they say, public policy would be made in a vacuum, and federal rules would be more unrealistic and unworkable. 
The proposal would extend restrictions now on political appointees to more than two million government workers. Federal employees could no longer accept ''gifts of free attendance'' at the many seminars, receptions and other social gatherings held by registered lobbyists and lobbying organizations as a matter of course in Washington.
In issuing the proposal under instructions from President Obama, the Office of Government Ethics said lobbyists often used such events to curry favor with federal employees.
The ethics office, which is now weighing the response to the proposal it made last September, said lobbyists had used these gatherings not only to discuss business with federal employees, but also to ''foster a social bond that may be of greater use in the long run.''
The problem, it said, is ''not the brazen quid pro quo, but rather the cultivation of familiarity and access that a lobbyist may use in the future to obtain a more sympathetic hearing for clients.''
The American League of Lobbyists, a trade group, denounced the proposal as excessive, and leaders of other groups branded it as demeaning and dismissive of the role that industry experts can play in formulating sound public policy.
The Motion Picture Association of America, the trade group for major Hollywood studios, strenuously objected to a suggestion by the ethics office that movie screenings were social events where lobbyists built good will, thus enhancing their influence with federal employees.
The association said that movie screenings at its headquarters two blocks from the White House ''are not purely social events akin to sporting events or theatrical and musical events, but rather serve as educational opportunities,'' allowing federal employees to learn about moviemaking techniques and ''challenges facing the industry.''
Ronald L. Phipps, former president of the National Association of Realtors, said the restrictions would ''perpetuate the problem of the Beltway bubble,'' isolating regulators from the industries they regulate.
The USA Rice Federation, the lobby for rice growers, called the proposal insulting. The administration, it said, appears to view lobbyists as predators and federal employees as ''weak, unprincipled victims.''
Under current rules, federal employees can accept free invitations to certain ''widely attended gatherings,'' and they often do so. Under the proposal, they could no longer accept such ''gifts'' from registered lobbyists and lobbying organizations.
Administration officials are still reviewing the comments, and it is unclear when a final decision may be made on whether to impose the new rules. But the Obama administration defended the proposal as a way to curb the influence of special interests, just as Mr. Obama did in 2010 when he told federal officials not to appoint registered lobbyists to advisory committees, boards and commissions.
Special interests can drown out the voices of ordinary Americans by deploying ''lobbyists who have special access that is not available to all citizens,'' Mr. Obama said then.
Mr. Obama promised to run the most ethical and transparent administration in history. While berating lobbyists in public, the administration has worked with them in private. White House officials have often met with lobbyists at coffee shops near the White House, so the meetings do not show up in White House visitor logs. Despite a pledge not to take money from registered federal lobbyists, Mr. Obama has relied on people active in the lobbying industry to raise millions of dollars for his re-election bid.
The proposed rules are aimed at lobbyists who work for trade associations. The new restrictions would not apply to institutions of higher education or to certain nonprofit groups like professional associations, scientific organizations and learned societies.
While these entities may lobby, the ethics office said, they pose less risk of ''ethical harm,'' and they can promote the professional development of government scientists and other federal employees. By contrast, it said, professional education is usually not the primary concern of trade associations.
This distinction infuriated lobbyists for trade associations.
Groups like the American Frozen Food Institute, the American Hospital Association and the Edison Electric Institute said they engaged in both lobbying and educational activities, with training as a major part of their mission.
However, watchdog groups like the Project on Government Oversight, the Government Accountability Project and Common Cause welcomed the proposal, saying it would help break up the cozy relationships between federal regulators and regulated industries.
Lobbyists said such relationships were essential at a time when the government regulates almost every corner of the economy and federal officials are continually promoting public-private partnerships to create jobs.
The Consumer Electronics Association, which holds a giant trade show each year, said the new restrictions would ''drive a wedge between policy makers and job creators'' and lead to a ''drastic dumbing-down of government.''
The National Shooting Sports Foundation said the proposal would make it far more difficult to have ''a constructive and mutually beneficial dialogue'' between its members -- manufacturers of firearms -- and federal officials who regulate the industry.
Several members of Congress share the critics' concerns. In a letter to the ethics office, nine House Democrats, including Representatives Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and James P. Moran of Virginia, said the rules could disrupt ''the necessary flow of information between the public and private sectors'' and adversely affect their constituents, including businesses and federal employees.
Civil servants say the rules could impose onerous new obligations on them. The rules suggest that federal employees check a searchable online database of lobbyists, maintained by Congress, to see if an invitation comes from a registered lobbyist or lobbying organization.

HEADLINE: Godfathers, Caterpillars And Golf

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Republican to-do checklist:
1) Pooh-pooh all the talk about a war on women.
''If the Democrats said we had a war on caterpillars, and every mainstream media outlet talked about the fact that Republicans have a war on caterpillars, then we'd have problems with caterpillars,'' said the Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, during a week when a USA Today/Gallup poll found Barack Obama leading Mitt Romney among women in key swing states by 18 points.
This comment was extremely unsettling. What was it that made Priebus think about caterpillars? At least if you mess with women, women can fight back. We're already losing all the bees, and the bats are in trouble. We do not want these people picking on caterpillars at all. 
2) Seek out news about the mood of the womenfolk.
''My wife has the occasion, as you know, to campaign on her own and also with me, and she reports to me regularly that the issue women care about most is the economy,'' Mitt told a meeting of editors in Washington this week.
It sounded as if Ann Romney was, say, a native of Turkmenistan who had occasion to return to her native people and bring her husband back word of their hopes and concerns.
3) Make Rick Santorum get out of the race.
This is becoming a Republican obsession, and I am sure it will be a hot topic of conversation at Easter and Passover dinners, when American families will get together and express their amazement at the news that Rick Santorum is still running for something.
4) Keep Mitt on script.
The other day Romney reacted spontaneously to a comment by David Plouffe, an Obama adviser, that Mitt was the ''godfather'' of the individual mandate in health care reform.
''If I'm the godfather of this thing, then it gives me the right to kill it,'' Romney said.
Think about that for a minute. What do you think he was going for there? A Mafia metaphor? Romney also tossed in a mention of Rumpelstiltskin, so maybe either a Mafia metaphor or some sort of weird fairy-tale image? (''I am your evil fairy godfather, and I am putting you into a coma from which you will never awake. Especially since your health insurance expired.'')
5) Watch the Masters golf tournament.
But not with approval! ''Don't you think it's time Augusta National joined the 21st century -- or the 20th -- and allowed women members?'' tweeted John McCain. (O.K., possibly not personally. Possibly tweeted a minion on behalf of John McCain.)
''If I could run Augusta, which isn't likely to happen, of course, I'd have women,'' said Romney.
There are two ways to look at this. One is that this is another sign of an increased gender consciousness in the Republican ranks, albeit a teensy-weensy, poll-driven one. Another is that it is heartening that the whole men-only-golf-club thing now seems so pathetic, even the Republican high command wants to steer away from it.
Although, in that case, somebody had better tell John Boehner to ditch his.
6) Prepare for the next big primaries.
''On April 24 -- is that -- what day is April 24? Is that a Tuesday?'' Mitt asked the crowd at a rally this week. ''It's a Tuesday! I need you to -- it's not that coming Tuesday. It's the one after that, or is it the one after that? It's the one after that!''
As Mario Cuomo said, we campaign in poetry, govern in prose.
7) Prepare for the convention.
Which will be held in Tampa, Fla., on Aug. 27. Where, in the name of safety, the City Council is attempting to ban water guns from the area around the coliseum but is prohibited by Florida state law from banning handguns. Sure looking forward to Tampa.
8) Try to figure out what to do for the four months in between. That's enough time to run an entire season of a TV series.
Star Trek, the Mitt Generation -- A time machine takes Romney 100 years into the future, where Newt Gingrich is plotting his next political comeback.
Romney Top Chef -- Ann impresses the judges with Mitt's favorite meal of meatloaf cakes with catsup and brown sugar.
Undercover Boss Reunion Show -- Mitt goes back to visit workers who were laid off after Bain Capital bought their factories and discovers that every one of them is doing great.
The Amazing Race: Michigan -- Team Romney overcomes a Roadblock in which Tagg is challenged to measure the height of the trees.
Republican Swamp People -- The Romneys move to the Everglades in an effort to woo the swing state of Florida. Excitement ensues when Mitt tries to drive to a rally with an alligator strapped to the roof of the car.

HEADLINE: U.S. Orders Cuts In Pay at 3 Firms

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top executives at three companies bailed out by taxpayers during the 2008 financial crisis have been ordered to take pay cuts by the federal government, the Treasury Department said Friday. 
The Treasury said annual compensation for nearly 70 executives at the American International Group, Ally Financial and General Motors was reduced by 10 percent.
Pay for the chief executives of the companies was frozen at 2011 levels.
All three companies have yet to repay what they received from the $700 billion bailout, and their executives are subject to pay cuts as a result.
A.I.G. still owes about $50 billion. General Motors owes about $25 billion, and Ally Financial about $12 billion.
Even with the compensation freeze, General Motors' chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, is expected to earn $9 million in stock and salary this year. Ally Financial's chief, Michael A. Carpenter, is set to earn $9.5 million in total compensation. And A.I.G.'s chief, Robert H. Benmosche, is expected to make $10.5 million.
Mr. Akerson has criticized the pay limits, saying G.M. is losing top talent in its executive ranks because of the rules. G.M. received $49.5 billion from the government in 2008 and 2009.
''It's the reality we have to live with, as long as we're under the restrictions,'' said a G.M. spokesman, Jim Cain.
In a statement, Ally Financial said it was ''squarely focused on delivering value for shareholders and repaying the remaining U.S. Treasury investment.''
A.I.G. declined to comment on the pay changes.

HEADLINE: Reactions and Overreactions

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The old optimism, not the new pessimism, was the overreaction. 

 BODY:
Hmm. I see that some people are accusing me of overreacting to one bad month of job news. Um, no. What has actually been happening is that conventional wisdom overreacted to four months of good(ish) news, and the March numbers were a useful corrective.
Look at my current favorite measure of the labor market, the employment-population ratio of prime-age Americans -- employment rather than unemployment so as to avoid distortion by people dropping out, prime-age to avoid demographic issues as the population ages. Here it is:
What has been happening lately is that conventional wisdom, including among people with influence over policy, has taken that little uptick at the right as evidence that it's time to sound the all-clear, time to call off efforts to boost the economy and worry about inflation instead. This was a terrible misjudgment: we've barely made a dent in the employment decline that followed the financial crisis, and are still a very long way from full recovery..
And you can't even count on the trend continuing to be favorable -- which was the message of last month's numbers.
I was for more stimulus before those numbers came out; I'm still for more stimulus now. The only difference is that it might be a bit easier today than two days ago to argue against unjustified complacency.

HEADLINE: Looking for Four Good Rounds in a Row

BYLINE: KAREN CROUSE


HIGHLIGHT: Jason Dufner was tied for the lead after two rounds of the Masters. On the PGA Tour, he ranks in the top 30 in scoring average in the first and second rounds, and outside the top 75 in the third and fourth. 

 BODY:
AUGUSTA, Ga. - At 5 feet 10 inches and 180 pounds, Jason Dufner doesn't look like a sprinter. And yet he is golf's equivalent of a runner who goes out fast and hangs on for dear life. On the PGA Tour, Dufner ranks in the top 30 in scoring average in the first and second rounds, and outside the top 75 in the third and fourth.
He faded down the stretch of last year's P.G.A. Championship, bogeying three of the last four holes before losing to Keegan Bradley in a playoff. Dufner, who turned pro in 2000, has finished second on the tour three times and third twice. He is 0 for 161 but entered the weekend at tied for the Masters lead with Fred Couples at five-under-par 139. 
"I had some really nice rounds at the P.G.A.," Dufner said. "Didn't quite work out, but carried over into this year. It gave me confidence that I can compete and play at a high level out here and do really nice things."
Dufner, 35, has played well recently. He opened with consecutive 66s at the Transitions Championship on his way to a tie for 10th and carded a 66 and a 69 in the first two rounds of the Arnold Palmer Championship and finished tied for 15th.

"I have been feeling really good about my game," Dufner said. "Couple of rounds here and there, had a really bad nine holes at Bay Hill. You know, missed the playoff by three shots at Tampa, which isn't a heck of a lot out on tour. I've had some really, really good rounds, and I'm just kind of searching to put four together."
Dufner, who graduated from Auburn with an economics degree, is as dry as a spreadsheet. In temperament, he is the polar opposite of the former N.B.A. star Charles Barkley, with whom he communicates regularly by text and whom he sees at Auburn football and basketball games.
"We make a good combo there," Dufner said. "He's a little bit more out there and wears his emotions on his sleeve and tells people what he's got on his mind no matter the consequences. So we've been friends for about a year and a half now." 
Dufner's expression never changes on the course.
"There's a lot more going on out there than appears," he said. "I feel like I have the same emotions and same thought processes as a lot of guys, but I seem to not show it quite as well as some other players. It's just difficult. It's a test to yourself. You are trying to have the same mentality and confidence out there."
It takes a wellspring of confidence to go out for the Auburn golf team as a walk-on, as Dufner did. He has never backed down from a challenge, and this weekend should be no different.
"I've played in a good bit of these," Dufner said. "I don't have as much experience as some players, but I'm getting to the point where I feel good."

HEADLINE: The Puzzle of Measuring Poverty

BYLINE: JASON DEPARLE


HIGHLIGHT: The resources of the very poor have become increasingly hard to measure. According to different yardsticks, incomes have plunged, but spending has largely kept pace. 

 BODY:
Despite four years of economic distress, the welfare rolls have barely budged, as my article this weekend shows. Many researchers see evidence of growing destitution, but the resources of the very poor have become increasingly hard to measure. Different yardsticks show diverging trends.
Incomes have plunged. But spending has largely kept pace. 
That, at least, is what the poorest households tell government statisticians. The divergence in the trends complicates efforts to assess the effects of tough welfare laws on the most disadvantaged families.
Most researchers follow income trends. There are several major data sets. The Current Population Survey interviews 100,000 households in March and asks them to reconstruct their income for the previous calendar year. (It is the source of the government's official poverty statistics.) The Survey of Income and Program Participation interviews a smaller group of households every four months -- requiring less long-term recall -- and asks more questions about safety net programs. 
The two data sets show a similar pattern since 1996, when President Bill Clinton signed a tough law placing time limits and work requirements on welfare recipients. As the economy boomed and caseloads collapsed, incomes rose for single mothers as a whole. Yet a small but growing minority was left ``disconnected,'' reporting they had neither welfare nor work. 
Since the start of Great Recession, welfare rolls have stayed near historic lows, and the number of disconnected families appears to have surged.

Pamela Loprest and Austin Nichols of the Urban Institute used data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to trace the rise of disconnected families under the tough new law. In 1996, when it passed, about one in eight low-income single mothers said they had neither welfare nor work. By 2008, the share had risen to one in five, and by 2010 it was one in four - twice the level of seeming destitution when welfare was more accessible.
Those families appeared very poor - they reported incomes of under $5,000 in 2008 - and had high rates of mental and physical ailments and problems with domestic violence. 
"Given what we know about these families, we have reason to be concerned,'' Ms. Loprest said. 
But Bruce Meyer of the University of Chicago and James Sullivan of the University of Notre Dame examined consumption patterns and found much more encouraging news. They work with the Consumer Expenditure Survey, which interviews 7,000 households at quarterly intervals, asking about spending on hundreds of items from cigarettes to houses.
Examining low-income single mothers (those at the 10th percentile), they found that annual spending has risen sharply since 1996 when the tough welfare law passed: it is up 19 percent, adjusted for inflation. And the Great Recession appears to have inflicted little pain. From 2007 to 2010, spending fell just 1 percent.
``For single mothers near the bottom, living standards have held up quite well, even in the recession,'' Mr. Meyer said.
With the measures pointing in such opposite directions, researchers have been hard-pressed to offer explanations.
Perhaps one of the two measures - income or consumption - just gets things wrong for the most disadvantaged families. Researchers have long agreed that the very poor fail to tally all their income when answering survey questions, undercounting informal sources like odd jobs or help from boyfriends. After all, who can really live on $5,000 a year? That is why scholars usually play down specific poverty levels and emphasize trends - whether things or getting better or worse under a consistent methodology.
But there is evidence to show the underreporting has grown worse in recent years, especially regarding the receipt of food stamps and cash aid. This could skew the trends themselves and exaggerate the rise of poverty, as Mr. Meyer contends.
Then again, there has been some deterioration in the quality of consumption data, too. (Some experts think that the public has just grown tired of questionnaires.) How likely is it that the Great Recession really left the poorest single mothers untouched?
Perhaps the very poorest families truly have lost income but kept up consumption by alternate means -- relying on boyfriends, family, charity, loans, or street wits. That is consistent with what my article found among poor single mothers in Phoenix, who described selling food stamps, doubling up with friends, and recycling discarded cans.
Help from boyfriends can be especially important in filling the gaps, but it is also especially difficult to measure. People tend to keep vague count and deem the matter private.
``My friend, my good friend, he gives me like $40 or $50 a month,'' said Maria Thomas, a single mother who has four children, no cash welfare, and no job.
The ability to replace lost welfare might be positive - showing the strength of private charity or extended families -- but it could also be a danger sign. Several women interviewed for my article said the loss of aid made them more reliant on troubled men.
"He drinks too much but I stay, because where would I be without him?'' said Julie Hammond, a single mother in Apache Junction, speaking of her boyfriend.
The income-based approach has tradition in its favor and multiple data sets to draw upon; consumption-based researchers have just one. As the source of the official poverty count, the income measure also has the government imprimatur. 
On one point the divided researchers agree: more research is needed.

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and a summary of President Obama's weekly address, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
The Obama campaign is preparing to emphasize an issue that few Democrats have embraced in the past: national security. Mr. Obama is seeking to portray Mitt Romney as a national security neophyte, with a plan to take the former governor to task every time he talks about foreign policy, Helene Cooper reports.

        
The White House and Congressional Democrats are joining forces to pressure Republicans on the "Buffet Rule," which would ensure that the rich pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes, Jonathan Weisman reports.

        
The Labor Department releases a monthly, statistics-laden report on the job market, and President Obama and his opponents immediately mine the numbers for political advantage - a newly formed rite of the election season, Mark Landler writes. But with only slight changes expected in the unemployment picture between now and November, the competition is largely on the margins.

        
Tough new limits proposed on the way special interests could court executive branch officials have prompted a fierce counterattack from lobbyists who fear the rules would choke off their ability to have a mutually beneficial dialogue with government officials, Robert Pear writes.

        
Ashley Parker delves into thebond between Mitt Romney and his personal assistant, Garrett Jackson, who spends more time with the candidate than even Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, does.
Weekly Address

        
President Obama used his weekly address to remind Americans from all religious backgrounds "of the common thread of humanity that connects us all." Marking the weekend as "a time to celebrate redemption at God's hand," Mr. Obama said he hoped Americans will have an opportunity for "joy and reflection, focused on the things that matter most."
Around the Web
The trip to Israel by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey adds to his credentials as a possible choice to be the Republican vice presidential candidate, Politico reports.

HEADLINE: India's Tax Plan Troubles Foreign Investors

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: India would lose significant ground as a destination for international investment, if the new tax regime is implemented. 

 BODY:
"Just two months ago, worried about their slowing economy, Indian officials were promising to promote policies to make the country more hospitable to foreign investment," Vikas Bajaj writes in The New York Times. "Instead, the government has done the opposite - proposed a budget festooned with new taxes that would make it more difficult and expensive for outsiders to invest here."
Political handicappers expect legislators to approve the new taxes later this month because "the government desperately needs to raise money to reduce its fiscal deficit," Mr. Bajaj writes. 
There is an 'Oh, my God' factor," about the tax proposals, said Nandan S. Nelivigi, a partner at the law firm White & Case in New York who advises companies that do business in India. He said he knew of at least two foreign acquisition deals involving Indian firms that had been delayed while executives wait to see what happens with the tax measures.
"New deals - there is no question that they are on hold until the tax implications are clear," Mr. Nelivigi said.
Last week a group of business associations representing 250,000 companies in the United States, Canada, Britain, Japan and Hong Kong sent a letter to the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh. They warned that India would "lose significant ground as a destination for international investment" if it adopted the tax changes.
Recent data shows that "India has become increasingly reliant on capital from the United States, Europe and Japan to help offset not only its budget deficit but also its ballooning trade deficit, which was estimated at $175 billion for the 12 months ending in March," largely a result of oil imports and a big trade imbalance with China, Mr. Bajaj writes.

HEADLINE: Dodgers Look to Turn Over Team by End of Month

BYLINE: RICHARD SANDOMIR


HIGHLIGHT: The Los Angeles Dodgers, who filed for bankruptcy last June, filed documents Friday looking to get out for good by the end of the month. 

 BODY:
The Los Angeles Dodgers, who filed for bankruptcy last June, filed documents Friday looking to get out for good by the end of the month. But almost no specifics are revealed in the paperwork about the purchase of the team and Dodger Stadium for $2 billion by a group led by Magic Johnson but financed primarily by Guggenheim Partners, a private financial services firm.
The group is paying an additional $150 million for half the land surrounding Dodger Stadium, including the parking lots, in a joint venture with Frank McCourt, the team's outgoing owner. The few details of the team's sale include the Guggenheim-Johnson group's agreement to pay about $1.6 million in cash and to assume $412 million in debt. 
The group is paying a record price for a sports franchise. But the redacted documents do not describe how the ownership is being divvied among Johnson, Guggenheim's insurance and other businesses and some of its executives, including Mark Walter, the chief executive.
In their documents, the Dodgers offered some reminders of their financial crisis last year. 
"When the debtors entered bankruptcy on June 27, 2011, they did not have enough cash to meet payroll that was due in three days," the team said, "and they were embroiled in a bitter dispute with Major League Baseball." Indeed, Commissioner Bud Selig installed a monitor to run the team, over McCourt's objections, and vetoed McCourt's multi-billion-dollar plan to sell the team's future TV rights to Fox Sports. When he was denied the deal, McCourt placed the team into bankruptcy.
A confirmation hearing on the team's plan to leave bankruptcy is scheduled for April 13 in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. Assuming the plan and the sale are approved by April 30, McCourt will be able to pay a $131 million divorce settlement to his ex-wife, Jamie, on time.

HEADLINE: Cultural Liberalism Is Not Enough

BYLINE: ERIC ALTERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Liberals have spent decades trying to adjudicate the claims of their conflicting constituencies without focusing on the economic well-being of a broad section of Americans. 

 BODY:
As White House aides and Congressional leaders flood the media with dueling leaks about just how far President Obama was willing to go last summer to meet the budget-cutting demands of House Speaker John A. Boehner, many liberals have reacted with shock and horror at how much of their historic achievement the president appears to have been ready to bargain away. If a Democratic president could consider cutting America's shredded safety net further when unemployment remained stiffly high and the country was undergoing an explosion of inequality, was the "liberal moment" of American politics finally over?
Yet Maryland recently became the eighth state to join the same-sex marriage club (which includes the District of Columbia). Rush Limbaugh was force-fed a triple helping of crow for his failed attempt at "slut shaming," after opening up the gender gap again. Women, young people, college graduates and mixed-race Americans, surveys indicate, are spurning conservative arguments about contraception, same-sex marriage and sexual freedom.
In other words, economic liberalism is on life-support, while cultural liberalism thrives. The obvious question is why. The simple answer is that cultural liberalism comes cheap. Supporting same-sex marriage or a woman's right to choose does not cost the wealthy anything or restrict their ability to become wealthier. But there is more to it than that.
The United States has undoubtedly become a fairer, more open and less oppressive society thanks largely to the political and cultural struggles waged by liberals during the past half century. The progress in securing basic human and civil rights for women, African-Americans, gay men and lesbians, immigrants and their children, Americans with disabilities and so many others is a testament to liberal courage in the face of adversity and oppression. This was the work of "those who marched and those who sang, those who sat in and those who stood firm, those who organized and those who mobilized," as Barack Obama recalled on the occasion of the unveiling of the memorial statue of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the National Mall in October.
Liberal optimism regarding race and progress had been buoyed by the belief that, with the right experts running the government, an expanding economic pie could be guaranteed indefinitely, which would in turn purchase peace between feuding factions. But liberals had no ready response when the global economy chose not to cooperate, first with the rise in oil prices following the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and then with the exodus of exactly the kinds of manufacturing jobs that had provided the engine driving the expansion of the middle class in the first place.
The failure of liberals to plan for the failure of their plans - what Saul Bellow once called the "Good Intentions Paving Company" - resulted in a bitter, resentful scramble for the remaining scraps. Liberal politicians proved unable to face up to the harsh realities. "The great liberal failing of this time," Daniel Patrick Moynihan observed as early as 1968, was "constantly to over-promise and to overstate, and thereby constantly to appear to under-perform." This not only alienated key constituencies, but it also diminished the trust between the governing and the governed that previous generations of liberals had worked so hard to earn.
Caught in the crosswinds of so many simultaneous crises - I have not even mentioned Vietnam - many liberals chose to focus, rather perversely, on a "rights" agenda and the internecine fights it engendered within their increasingly fractured coalition. They lost sight of the essential element that had made the coalition possible in the first place: the sense that liberalism stood with the common man and woman in their struggle against economic forces too large and powerful to be faced by individuals on their own.
Liberals must find a way to combine their cultural successes with new approaches to achieving economic equality. But they must do so unambiguously and unequivocally. That brings us back to President Obama.
The president often sounds as if he believes in a vigorous economic populism. Just this past Tuesday he told the American Society of News Editors: "In this country broad-based prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few. It has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle class. That's how a generation who went to college on the G.I. Bill, including my grandfather, helped build the most prosperous economy the world has ever known." But so far the president has been unwilling to put his budgetary moneys where his mouth is.
In fact, Obama has proved far more adept at adapting his positions toward the increasingly radical views enunciated by the leaders of the Republican Party than he has in articulating - and sticking to - an alternative vision of the role of government in ensuring a fair economic shake for all its citizens.
He asked the right question on Tuesday when he said: "Can we succeed as a country where a shrinking number of people do exceedingly well, while a growing number struggle to get by? Or are we better off when everyone gets a fair shot?" But as liberals have repeatedly learned to their dismay, the devil is not in the poetry of the president's election-time rhetoric but in the prose of his apparent eagerness to seek out a compromise on almost any Republican proposal offered him. Liberals have spent decades trying to adjudicate the claims of their conflicting constituencies without focusing sharply enough on the economic well-being of a broad section of Americans. A fight for fairness and equity could unite the working poor and middle class in a winning coalition for the future, but the problem today for liberals is less the message itself than the credibility of the messenger.
While signaling his support for much if not all of liberalism's cultural agenda, President Obama has occasionally tossed economic liberals a rhetorical bone - but he has also worried too much about deficit reduction. In this regard, Obama embodies the unsolved liberal conundrum. Were the president to embrace a genuinely populist economic agenda and mean it this time - just as Franklin D. Roosevelt did in his second term - he might go a long way toward solving the problem that has dogged liberalism now for nearly half a century.

HEADLINE: Welfare Limits Left Poor Adrift as Recession Hit

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- Perhaps no law in the past generation has drawn more praise than the drive to ''end welfare as we know it,'' which joined the late-'90s economic boom to send caseloads plunging, employment rates rising and officials of both parties hailing the virtues of tough love.
But the distress of the last four years has added a cautionary postscript: much as overlooked critics of the restrictions once warned, a program that built its reputation when times were good offered little help when jobs disappeared. Despite the worst economy in decades, the cash welfare rolls have barely budged.
Faced with flat federal financing and rising need, Arizona is one of 16 states that have cut their welfare caseloads further since the start of the recession -- in its case, by half. Even as it turned away the needy, Arizona spent most of its federal welfare dollars on other programs, using permissive rules to plug state budget gaps. 
The poor people who were dropped from cash assistance here, mostly single mothers, talk with surprising openness about the desperate, and sometimes illegal, ways they make ends meet. They have sold food stamps, sold blood, skipped meals, shoplifted, doubled up with friends, scavenged trash bins for bottles and cans and returned to relationships with violent partners -- all with children in tow.
Esmeralda Murillo, a 21-year-old mother of two, lost her welfare check, landed in a shelter and then returned to a boyfriend whose violent temper had driven her away. ''You don't know who to turn to,'' she said.
Maria Thomas, 29, with four daughters, helps friends sell piles of brand-name clothes, taking pains not to ask if they are stolen. ''I don't know where they come from,'' she said. ''I'm just helping get rid of them.''
To keep her lights on, Rosa Pena, 24, sold the groceries she bought with food stamps and then kept her children fed with school lunches and help from neighbors. Her post-welfare credo is widely shared: ''I'll do what I have to do.''
Critics of the stringent system say stories like these vindicate warnings they made in 1996 when President Bill Clinton fulfilled his pledge to ''end welfare as we know it'': the revamped law encourages states to withhold aid, especially when the economy turns bad.
The old program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, dates from the New Deal; it gave states unlimited matching funds and offered poor families extensive rights, with few requirements and no time limits. The new program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, created time limits and work rules, capped federal spending and allowed states to turn poor families away.
''My take on it was the states would push people off and not let them back on, and that's just what they did,'' said Peter B. Edelman, a law professor at Georgetown University who resigned from the Clinton administration to protest the law. ''It's been even worse than I thought it would be.''
But supporters of the current system often say lower caseloads are evidence of decreased dependency. Many leading Republicans are pushing for similar changes to much larger programs, like Medicaid and food stamps.
Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the top House Republican on budget issues, calls the current welfare program ''an unprecedented success.'' Mitt Romney, who leads the race for the Republican presidential nomination, has said he would place similar restrictions on ''all these federal programs.'' One of his rivals, Rick Santorum, calls the welfare law a source of spiritual rejuvenation.
''It didn't just cut the rolls, but it saved lives,'' Mr. Santorum said, giving the poor ''something dependency doesn't give: hope.''
President Obama spoke favorably of the program in his 2008 campaign -- promoting his role as a state legislator in cutting the Illinois welfare rolls. But he has said little about it as president.
Even in the 1996 program's early days, when jobs were plentiful, a subset of families appeared disconnected -- left with neither welfare nor work. Their numbers were growing before the recession and seem to have surged since then.
No Money, No Job
While data on the very poor is limited and subject to challenge, recent studies have found that as many as one in every four low-income single mothers are jobless and without cash aid -- roughly four million women and children. Many of the mothers have problems like addiction or depression, which can make assisting them politically unpopular, and they have received little attention in a downturn that has produced an outpouring of concern for the middle class.
Poor families can turn to other programs, like food stamps or Medicaid, or rely on family and charity. But the absence of a steady source of cash, however modest, can bring new instability to troubled lives.
One prominent supporter of the tough welfare law is worried that it may have increased destitution among the most disadvantaged families. ''This is the biggest problem with welfare reform, and we ought to be paying attention to it,'' said Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution, who helped draft the 1996 law as an aide to House Republicans and argues that it has worked well for most recipients.
''The issue here is, can you create a strong work program, as we did, without creating a big problem at the bottom?'' Mr. Haskins said. ''And we have what appears to be a big problem at the bottom.''
He added, ''This is what really bothers me: the people who supported welfare reform, they're ignoring the problem.''
The welfare program was born amid apocalyptic warnings and was instantly proclaimed a success, at times with a measure of ''I told you so'' glee from its supporters. Liberal critics had warned that its mix of time limits and work rules would create mass destitution -- ''children sleeping on the grates,'' in the words of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat who died in 2003.
But the economy boomed, employment soared, poverty fell and caseloads plunged. Thirty-two states reduced their caseloads by two-thirds or more, as officials issued press releases and jostled for bragging rights. The tough law played a large role, but so did expansions of child care and tax credits that raised take-home pay.
In a twist on poverty politics, poor single mothers, previously chided as ''welfare queens,'' were celebrated as working-class heroes, with their stories of leaving the welfare rolls cast as uplifting tales of pluck. Flush with federal money, states experimented with programs that offered counseling, clothes and used cars.
But if the rise in employment was larger than predicted, it was also less transformative than it may have seemed. Researchers found that most families that escaped poverty remained ''near poor.''
And despite widespread hopes that working mothers might serve as role models, studies found few social or educational benefits for their children. (They measured things like children's aspirations, self-esteem, grades, drug use and arrests.) Nonmarital births continued to rise.
But the image of success formed early and stayed frozen in time.
''The debate is over,'' President Clinton said a year after signing the law, which he often cites in casting himself as a centrist. ''Welfare reform works.''
The recession that began in 2007 posed a new test to that claim. Even with $5 billion in new federal funds, caseloads rose just 15 percent from the lowest level in two generations. Compared with the 1990s peak, the national welfare rolls are still down by 68 percent. Just one in five poor children now receives cash aid, the lowest level in nearly 50 years.
As the downturn wreaked havoc on budgets, some states took new steps to keep the needy away. They shortened time limits, tightened eligibility rules and reduced benefits (to an average of about $350 a month for a family of three).
Since 2007, 11 states have cut the rolls by 10 percent or more. They include centers of unemployment like Georgia, Indiana and Rhode Island, as well as Michigan, where the welfare director justified cuts by telling legislators, ''We have a fair number of people gaming the system.'' Arizona cut benefits by 20 percent and shortened time limits twice -- to two years, from five.
Many people already found the underlying system more hassle than help, a gantlet of job-search classes where absences can be punished by a complete loss of aid. Some states explicitly pursue a policy of deterrence to make sure people use the program only as a last resort.
Since the states get fixed federal grants, any caseload growth comes at their own expense. By contrast, the federal government pays the entire food stamp bill no matter how many people enroll; states encourage applications, and the rolls have reached record highs.
Among the Arizonans who lost their checks was Tamika Shelby, who first sought cash aid at 29 after fast-food jobs and a stint as a waitress in a Phoenix strip club. The state gave her $176 a month and sent her to work part time at a food bank. Though she was effectively working for $2 an hour, she scarcely missed a day in more than a year.
''I loved it,'' she said.
Her supervisor, Michael Cox, said Ms. Shelby ''was just wonderful'' and ''would even come up here on her days off.''
Then the reduced time limit left Ms. Shelby with neither welfare nor work. She still gets about $250 a month in food stamps for herself and her 3-year-old son, Dejon. She counts herself fortunate, she said, because a male friend lets her stay in a spare room, with no expectations of sex. Still, after feeding her roommate and her child, she said, ''there are plenty of days I don't eat.''
''I know there are some people who abuse the system,'' Ms. Shelby said. ''But I was willing to do anything they asked me to. If I could, I'd still be working for those two dollars an hour.''
Diverting Federal Funds
Clarence H. Carter, Arizona's director of economic security, says finances forced officials to cut the rolls. But the state gets the same base funding from the federal government, $200 million, that it received in the mid-1990s when caseloads were five times as high. (The law also requires it to spend $86 million in state funds.)
Arizona spends most of the federal money on other human services programs, especially foster care and adoption services, while using just one-third for cash benefits and work programs -- the core purposes of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. If it did not use the federal welfare money, the state would have to finance more of those programs itself.
''Yes, we divert -- divert's a bad word,'' said State Representative John Kavanagh, a Republican and chairman of the Arizona House Appropriations Committee. ''It helps the state.''
While federal law allows such flexibility, critics say states neglect poor families to patch their own finances. Nationally, only 30 percent of the welfare money is spent on cash benefits.
''It's not that the other stuff isn't important, but it's not what T.A.N.F.'' -- the Temporary Assistance program -- ''was intended for,'' said LaDonna Pavetti of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research and advocacy group. ''The states use the money to fill budget holes.''
Even in an economy as bad as Arizona's, some recipients find work. Estefana Armas, a 30-year-old mother of three, spent nine years on the rolls, fighting depression so severe that it left her hospitalized. Once exempt from time limits because of her mental health, Ms. Armas joined support groups, earned a high school equivalency degree and enrolled in community college.
Just as her time expired last summer, Ms. Armas found work as a teacher's aide at a church preschool.
''It kind of pushed me to get a job,'' she said.
Supporters of Temporary Assistance cite stories like that to argue that it promotes a work ethic. Despite high unemployment, low-skilled single mothers work as much now, on average, as they did under the old welfare law -- and by some measures, a bit more. As a group, their poverty rates are still lower. And those without cash aid, they say, can turn to other programs.
''We have reduced our caseload, and we don't have people dying in the street,'' Mr. Kavanagh said. ''There were an awful lot of people who didn't need it.''
But the number of very poor families appears to be growing. Pamela Loprest and Austin Nichols, researchers at the Urban Institute, found that one in four low-income single mothers nationwide -- about 1.5 million -- are jobless and without cash aid. That is twice the rate the researchers found under the old welfare law. More than 40 percent remain that way for more than a year, and many have mental or physical disabilities, sick children or problems with domestic violence.
Using a different definition of distress, Luke Shaefer of the University of Michigan and Kathryn Edin of Harvard examined the share of households with children in a given month living on less than $2 per person per day. It has nearly doubled since 1996, to almost 4 percent. Even when counting food stamps as cash, they found one of every 50 children live in such a household.
The Census Bureau uses a third measure, ''deep poverty,'' which it defines as living on less than half of the amount needed to escape poverty (for a family of three, that means living on less than $9,000 a year). About 10 percent of households headed by women report incomes that low, a bit less than the peak under the old law but still the highest level in 18 years.
Some researchers say the studies exaggerate poverty by inadequately accounting for undisclosed income, like help from boyfriends or under-the-table jobs. They note that asking poor people about their consumption, rather than their income, suggests that even the poorest single mothers have improved their standard of living since 1996.
Mr. Haskins, the Temporary Assistance program's architect, agrees that poverty at the bottom ''is not as bad as it seems,'' but adds, ''It's still pretty darn bad.''
Trying to Make Do
Asked how they survived without cash aid, virtually all of the women interviewed here said they had sold food stamps, getting 50 cents for every dollar of groceries they let others buy with their benefit cards. Many turned to food banks and churches. Nationally, roughly a quarter have subsidized housing, with rents as low as $50 a month.
Several women said the loss of aid had left them more dependent on troubled boyfriends. One woman said she sold her child's Social Security number so a relative could collect a tax credit worth $3,000.
''I tried to sell blood, but they told me I was anemic,'' she said.
Several women acknowledged that they had resorted to shoplifting, including one who took orders for brand-name clothes and sold them for half-price. Asked how she got cash, one woman said flatly, ''We rob wetbacks'' -- illegal immigrants, who tend to carry cash and avoid the police. At least nine times, she said, she has flirted with men and led them toward her home, where accomplices robbed them.
''I felt bad afterwards,'' she said. But she added, ''There were times when we didn't have nothing to eat.''
One family ruled out crime and rummaged through trash cans instead. The mother, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, could not get aid for herself but received $164 a month for her four American-born children until their time limit expired. Distraught at losing her only steady source of cash, she asked the children if they would be ashamed to help her collect discarded cans.
''I told her I would be embarrassed to steal from someone -- not to pick up cans,'' her teenage daughter said.
Weekly park patrols ensued, and recycling money replaced about half of the welfare check.
Despite having a father in prison and a mother who could be deported, the children exude earnest cheer. A daughter in the fifth grade won a contest at school for reading the most books. A son in the eighth grade is a student leader praised by his principal for tutoring younger students, using supplies he pays for himself.
''That's just the kind of character he has,'' the principal said.
After losing cash aid, the mother found a cleaning job but lost it when her boss discovered that she was in the United States illegally. The family still gets subsidized housing and $650 a month in food stamps.
The boy worries about homelessness, but his younger sisters, 9 and 10, see an upside in scavenging.
''It's kind of fun because you get to look through the trash,'' one of the girls said.
''And you get to play in the park a little while before you go home,'' her sister agreed.

HEADLINE: At the End of the Earth, Seeking Clues to the Universe

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
LLANO DE CHAJNANTOR, Chile -- Trucks stall on the road to this plateau 16,597 feet up in the Atacama Desert, where scientists are installing one of the world's largest ground-based astronomical projects. Heads ache. Noses bleed. Dizziness overcomes the researchers toiling in the shadow of the Licancabur volcano.
''Then there's what we call 'jelly legs,' '' said Diego Garcia-Appadoo, a Spanish astronomer studying galaxy formation. ''You feel shattered, as if you ran a marathon.''
Still, the same conditions that make the Atacama, Earth's driest desert, so inhospitable make it beguiling for astronomy. In northern Chile, it is far from big cities, with little light pollution. Its arid climate prevents radio signals from being absorbed by water droplets. The altitude, as high as the Himalaya base camps for climbers preparing to scale Mount Everest, places astronomers closer to the heavens. 
Opened last October, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, known as ALMA, will have spread 66 radio antennas near the spine of the Andes by the time it is completed next year. Drawing more than $1 billion in funding mainly from the United States, European countries and Japan, ALMA will help the oxygen-deprived scientists flocking to this region to study the origins of the universe.
The project also strengthens Chile's position in the vanguard of astronomy. Observatories are already scattered throughout the Atacama, including the Cerro Paranal Observatory, where scientists discovered in 2010 the largest star observed to date, and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, which was founded in 1961 and endured Chile's tumult of revolution and counterrevolution in the 1970s.
But ALMA opens a new stage for astronomy in Chile, which is favored by international research organizations for the stability of its economy and legal system. Like other radio telescopes, ALMA does not detect optical light but radio waves, allowing researchers to study parts of the universe that are dark, like the clouds of cold gas from which stars are formed.
With ALMA, astronomers hope to see where the first galaxies were formed, and perhaps even detect solar systems with the conditions to support life, like water-bearing planets. But the scientists here express caution about their chances of finding life elsewhere in the universe, explaining that such definitive proof is likely to remain elusive.
''We won't be able to see life, but perhaps signatures of life,'' said Thijs de Graauw, a Dutch astronomer who is ALMA's director.
Still, scientists believe ALMA will make transformational leaps possible in the understanding of the universe, enabling a hunt for so-called cold gas tracers, the ashes of exploded stars from a time about a few hundred million years after the Big Bang that astronomers call ''cosmic dawn.''
ALMA's construction, said Jesus Mosterin, a prominent Spanish philosopher who writes about the frontier between science and philosophy, and who visited the observatory last year, is taking place at ''the only time in history that windows into the universe are being thrown wide open.''
Chile is not the only country luring big investments in astronomical projects. South Africa and Australia are competing to host an even bigger radio telescope, the Square Kilometer Array, which would be fully operational by 2024. China has begun building its own large radio telescope in a craterlike setting in the southern province of Guizhou.
At the same time, the financial crisis in rich industrialized countries has raised concerns that funding for some ambitious astronomy projects could face constraints. In the United States, a Congressional panel last year proposed killing NASA's James Webb Space Telescope before a compromise spending plan saved the project.
''It would be very sad for humankind if we were so spiritually decadent to forgo the pleasures of consciousness and of knowledge,'' said Mr. Mosterin, reflecting on the funding choices political leaders need to make. ''These things make human beings a very interesting animal indeed.''
ALMA's Operations Support Facility, an outpost built for the scientists here in the Atacama, offers a glimpse into the lengths to which people go for astronomical discoveries. From Chajnantor, where dust devils dance across the plain, and unusually extreme weather in recent months has included rains and sand storms, a dirt road runs to the facility past towering cactuses and herds of wild donkeys and vicunas.
The facility, at an altitude of about 9,500 feet, houses about 500 researchers and other staff in shipping containers turned living quarters. In a system similar to that on offshore oil platforms, scientists have daily shifts lasting up to 12 hours for 8 days straight. Many toil through the night.
''Quiet Zone,'' reads one sign in an area of containers for ALMA's so-called day sleepers.
Supervisors enforce other rules, ensuring a work environment almost as austere as the surrounding Mars-esque landscape. Alcohol is prohibited, and those found drinking after trips into San Pedro de Atacama, a town about 30 minutes away by car, must dry out at a security checkpoint before entering the futuristic complex.
In the control room, where astronomers spend hours peering into screens displaying the array of antennas, some gallows humor prevails. ''We are well in the control room, the 17,'' reads one message scribbled on a piece of roofing and posted on the wall after fire alarms went off by accident at the facility in 2011, sealing those inside the control room until they broke a door to escape.
The note riffs on the 2010 mine accident and subsequent rescue of 33 miners in the Chilean desert, during which the trapped men sent a note to the surface saying, ''We are well in the shelter, the 33.''
Developments elsewhere in Chile occasionally raise eyebrows here, like antigovernment protests that have rocked remote regions of the country this year and spread in March to the nearby mining city of Calama. ''The protests are not directly a concern,'' said Mr. de Graauw, ALMA's director. ''They are part of a democratic process, not a revolution.''
Still, it seems at times that the astronomers stationed here are as far removed from the world around them as the miners working beneath other parts of the Atacama. English predominates as the observatory's language, tying together scientists from dozens of countries.
A sense of awe still accompanies the installation of each new antenna. Two giant German-manufactured transporters, each with 28 tires and engines equivalent to two Formula 1 racing vehicles, are used to transport the antennas. Called Otto and Lore, they look like massive mechanized centipedes making their way across the arid landscape.
''There's a quietness that comes to you at Chajnantor,'' said Lutz Stenvers, a German engineer who came here in 2008 to lead a team from General Dynamics building the antennas. ''I can see why this place was chosen.''

HEADLINE: Focused on the Cup

BYLINE: By BEN SHPIGEL

 BODY:
Less than two hours before they were to play the Philadelphia Flyers at Madison Square Garden, the Rangers could not find Henrik Lundqvist. They called his cellphone, but it had been turned off. They called his wife, Therese, who said he had left their Midtown apartment.
On game days, Lundqvist follows an elaborate set of rituals, refined over his years playing in the N.H.L. and in his native Sweden. He knows precisely when he must wake from his nap, when he must eat and when he must arrive at the rink. He listens to the same music, heavy on punk rock, as he tapes his sticks and stretches his limbs. He checks, then double-checks his equipment: his skates, his pads, his gloves. He sits in his stall. He does not talk.
For Lundqvist, to feel unprepared is to feel uncomfortable -- and for a goalie, nothing is worse than feeling uncomfortable.
He entered the locker room as the pregame meeting was about to end. He walked in feeling calm and relaxed. Then he realized that he had miscalculated by an hour. He had only 45 minutes until warm-ups. He did not feel comfortable anymore. 
Coach John Tortorella asked Lundqvist if he was ready. Lundqvist said he was. You better be, Tortorella told him.
Late in the first period, Lundqvist stuffed Scott Hartnell on a breakaway. He faced 29 shots in all. He stopped all of them as the Rangers won, 2-0.
On that day, Nov. 26, early in what has been his finest season, Lundqvist was ready. His family, friends and teammates say that he has, in fact, been preparing for this season since he was a boy, when, on the way to games, his father would ask him to visualize positive outcomes.
''He wants to be the best, so he's the best,'' the Rangers' backup goalie Martin Biron said. ''If all you have is one day, one game, one shot, he can do it.''
After Saturday night's 4-1 loss to the Washington Captials in the regular-season finale, Lundqvist, a leading candidate to win the Vezina Trophy, awarded annually to the league's top goaltender, has posted a .930 save percentage, a 1.97 goals-against, a career-high 39 victories and 8 shutouts for the Rangers, who have earned the top seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time since winning the Stanley Cup in 1994.
The Rangers crave more, as does Lundqvist, owner of Olympic gold but foiled thus far in his quest for Stanley Cup silver.
''He feels that he's been here long enough,'' center Brandon Dubinsky said. ''I don't want to put words in his mouth, but we haven't accomplished anything here, and he wants to accomplish something here. That's important to him. That drives him every day.''
That emptiness drove Lundqvist last summer, when he lost 13 pounds, skated more (with new, more efficient skates), trained harder. The outcome has been a span of brilliance appreciated in hockey circles but overshadowed locally by Eli Manning and the Super Bowl-winning Giants, Jeremy Lin and now Tim Tebow.
Surrounded by his best supporting cast in seven seasons with the Rangers, Lundqvist has found balance, enjoying personal fulfillment with his professional success. He married last August. He turned 30 in March. His first child is due this summer.
It all can get a man thinking, and Lundqvist is a man who thinks. When emphasizing a point, he uses not his voice but his entire face. His head tilts forward. His eyes widen to pools of blue.
''The first three years, it was a lot about proving to everybody else that I should be here, that I should play in this league,'' Lundqvist said in an interview last month at the team's practice facility in Greenburgh, N.Y. ''But now it's about proving to myself. I want to be good. I want to play better.''
The former Rangers goalie Mike Richter said Lundqvist's attitude reminded him of a sentiment expressed by Wayne Gretzky, who considered himself a far better player at 28 than he was at 23 because he was tougher and more mentally resilient.
''Your body diminishes over time, but goaltenders often get better as they get older,'' said Richter, who led the Rangers to their 1994 title. ''You know yourself better. You know how to respond. That's the deal when the franchise is relying on you.''
If anything, the Rangers are guilty of depending on Lundqvist too much. In years past, he played so often -- four straight seasons of at least 70 appearances, then 68 last season -- that he was not as fresh during the playoffs. Though the Rangers have reached the playoffs every season except 2009-10 since Lundqvist arrived in 2005, they have not won a postseason series in four years.
''The clock is ticking,'' said Lundqvist, who has played 62 games this season. ''You don't know how many more chances you're going to get.''
Envisioning the Future
Are (pronounced OAR-eh), a small town in northwestern Sweden, is a world-class ski resort in a hockey-crazed country. Mountains were readily accessible. Ice rinks were not. So the children of Peter Lundqvist and Eva Johansson -- Gabriella, Henrik and his identical twin, Joel -- improvised, shoveling the snow off the lake near their home to skate on it.
For competitive hockey, Henrik and Joel had to travel to Jarpen, about 30 minutes east. It was during one of those car rides that a 9-year-old Henrik started plotting his future. As Gabriella tells the story, their grandmother was driving the boys to practice when Henrik, suddenly serious, said: ''No one's going to find me if I'm staying here. I'm not going to get discovered here. I need to get out of this little place.''
Typical Henrik -- always dreaming, striving, wanting more. He even competed in utero, jockeying for space with Joel. Henrik arrived first, on March 2, 1982, and Joel arrived 40 minutes later. It was, the family came to joke, the longest they ever spent apart.
Now he is called Hank, or the King, or King Henrik, or HEN-Reek, as go the rhythmic chants at the Garden. But growing up, he was so inseparable from his brother that he was Joelandhenrik. When Joel was 2, he had a severe coughing fit that necessitated a two-day hospital stay. Henrik was inconsolable, refusing to eat, Gabriella said.
''We were almost like the same person,'' Joel said.
Both dabbled in tennis. Both starred in soccer, Joel as a forward and Henrik as a goalkeeper, same as in hockey. And both hated to lose. Family board games ended in tears or fights, if they ended at all. Once, Joel said, when the twins were 5, they lost in either soccer or street hockey (Joel couldn't remember), and they reacted by running into the woods and hiding. Lundqvist's competitive streak is so intense, his former teammate Brendan Shanahan said, ''most psychiatrists would say he's not healthy.'' Imagine how Lundqvist felt his first two times playing goal in an organized hockey game. His team, Jarpens IF, lost, 12-2 and 18-0.
At the first practice with Jarpens IF, players were asked who wanted to play goal. Joel grabbed Henrik's hand and raised it. At first, Lundqvist was drawn to the position by the armor: gloves, a mask and a set of heavy brown pads that he thought were pretty cool. It soon became an obsession. In sewing class, he knitted a pillow shaped like a goalie. He built a goal with pieces of old wood. He watched videos of his favorite Swedish goalie, Peter Lindmark, and two paragons of N.H.L. excellence, Patrick Roy and Dominik Hasek, incorporating elements of Roy's butterfly and Hasek's unorthodox style.
Only later -- after the family settled in Bastad in southern Sweden, and after the boys moved, at 16, to Gothenburg so they could play for junior-level squads of the Swedish Elite League team Vastra Frolunda -- did Gabriella, older by three and a half years, come to realize why goaltending so appealed to Henrik.
''He was very good at just worrying about himself, and I don't mean that in a selfish way,'' Gabriella said. ''All his focus is in the right place, not worrying about things you can't control.''
For someone so attached to his brother, Lundqvist embraced the solitude of the position. He loved practicing breakaways. He enjoyed the pressure. He welcomed being the last bastion of defense, just him and the net. Changing lines was for defensemen and forwards, like Joel, who went on to play for three years in the N.H.L.
Goalies were always on the ice -- the good ones, at least.
A Sleeper Pick
The question is an obvious one, after 252 N.H.L. career victories, 3 All-Star selections and an Olympic gold medal: how was Lundqvist taken so late in the 2000 N.H.L. draft, in the seventh round with the 205th overall pick, the 22nd goalie chosen?
''As you get deeper into the draft, you're basically looking for anyone with a heartbeat who can stand up and skate,'' said Phoenix Coyotes General Manager Don Maloney, who was the Rangers' assistant general manager in 2000. ''You're never thinking, 'Let's wait until the seventh round to draft our franchise goaltender.' You're just throwing darts.''
Maloney posed what might be a better question: what would have happened that June day in Calgary, Alberta, had he looked right instead of left?
Every draft has its presumptive can't-miss kids, the Sidney Crosbys and Alexander Ovechkins and Steven Stamkoses. Once the elite prospects are gone, teams lean on the wisdom and intuition of scouts who have traversed countries and continents searching for top talent. One shrewd late-round pick -- a Pavel Datsyuk, a Luc Robitaille, a Henrik Zetterberg -- can change a franchise.
''It's not like the N.F.L. draft, where you're dealing with college kids that are 22 years old, who are developed mentally and physically,'' said Jim Nill, the assistant general manager of the Detroit Red Wings, who drafted Datsyuk and Zetterberg in late rounds in successive years. ''There are so many changes that take place over the years, so you're sitting there trying to project. You're wondering, for example, 'Which Henrik Lundqvist is the Henrik Lundqvist we're going to see at age 25?' ''
The Henrik Lundqvist scouts observed at 18 had loads of natural ability, sharp reflexes and a strong work ethic augmented by his competitive spirit, but he lacked consistency. Martin Madden, then the Rangers' chief scout, watched Lundqvist in two tournaments in early 2000 and came away unimpressed.
''I don't want to say he was ordinary,'' Madden said, ''but he was just O.K.''
Christer Rockstrom, then the team's head European scout, held a different perspective. Living in Sweden, Rockstrom saw Lundqvist play more regularly and rated him No. 1 on the Rangers' list of eligible European goalies. Rockstrom pushed for the Rangers to draft Lundqvist in the middle rounds, but Madden overruled him, thinking it too early.
But in the sixth round or so, Maloney turned to his right, to Rockstrom. This was long after the Islanders had used the first overall pick to take goalie Rick DiPietro, who has 135 fewer wins and has played 178 fewer games than Lundqvist in his injury-plagued N.H.L. career. This was after Joel Lundqvist had gone to Dallas in the third round, and after the Rangers had selected a goalie, Brandon Snee from Union College, in the fifth. Maloney grabbed the list. Henrik Lundqvist was not highlighted, signifying that he was available.
''Is that your top goalie in Europe?'' Maloney asked Rockstrom.
''Yeah,'' Rockstrom said, ''but Martin didn't like him.''
Maloney leaned toward Madden, sitting at his left, and said: ''We're looking for a goalie. Why wouldn't we take a flier on him?''
''Yeah, fine,'' Madden said.
And with that, Lundqvist was a Ranger. About six months later, at the World Junior Championships in Russia, Lundqvist changed Madden's mind. Leading Sweden to a fourth-place finish, Lundqvist had improved from head (poise) to toe (quickness), resembling in Madden's estimation ''a completely different goalie.''
The evolution continued in the summer of 2001, when for the first time, Lundqvist, then 19, worked with a personal goalie coach, Michael Lehner. Lehner was not a normal goalie coach. He had never played hockey. His background was in a full-contact style of karate called Kyokushin. But when his son, Robin, who now plays in the Ottawa Senators' system, became interested in goaltending, Lehner devoted his life to teaching him.
Drawing on stances that he used in Kyokushin, Lehner applied his martial-arts training to building the perfect goalie, fundamentally sound and mentally unshakable. In Lundqvist, Lehner found a worthy test subject.
Lehner ripped up his backyard, installing concrete and a machine that shot puck after puck at Lundqvist. On-ice workouts featured Lehner's yelling at him to compete for every puck, to cut down angles, to challenge shooters on breakaways.
Lehner's tactics were physically grueling, but the sessions tested Lundqvist's mind even more. Lehner frequently told him that he was not good enough, and that yielding one goal was one too many.
''Sometimes, I was a little bit mean to him,'' Lehner said. ''I wanted him to get upset with me and really show me that he was better than I said he was.''
Lundqvist appreciated Lehner's urgency, how every instruction seemed appended by ''or else.'' He said he ''really connected'' with Lehner, who from 2001 to 2005 drove around Sweden to watch Lundqvist's games. He would sit in the stands taking notes; afterward, they would deconstruct Lundqvist's performance.
Lehner said a turning point in Lundqvist's development occurred during the fall of 2002, when Frolunda signed Fredrik Norrena, who started for the Finnish national team. On a bench in Frolunda's practice arena, Lundqvist sulked. He did not want to be a backup. Lehner told Lundqvist he did not have to.
In practice, Lundqvist made sure to face one more puck than Norrena. Then, five. Then, 10. Then it was Lundqvist overtaking Norrena, guiding Frolunda to its first Elite League championship in 38 years and winning his first of three consecutive Honken Trophies, given to the Swedish goaltender of the year.
His third trophy came in 2004-5, when dozens of locked-out N.H.L. players flocked to European leagues. Lundqvist outclassed established goalies like Miikka Kiprusoff and Jose Theodore to lead the league in save percentage (.936) and goals against average (1.79). In the playoffs, he was even better, recording six shutouts in 14 games, allowing only 15 goals, as Frolunda captured another title.
''I'm thinking, 'Can I make it in the N.H.L.?' '' Lundqvist said. ''And then all those guys from the N.H.L. come over and play against me. I had my best year, and I'm like, 'I can do this.' ''
Style Evolution
The Rangers agreed, impressed with his handling of celebrity status in Sweden and his success for club and country. But even as Lundqvist projected confidence in training camp in 2005, outshining Al Montoya to win a backup job, doubt raged inside.
At times, reflecting on the good life he left behind in Sweden, he asked himself, ''What have I done?'' For a Swedish rookie goalie adjusting to more skillful opponents, increased traffic in front of the net and a smaller ice surface, the transition was at once invigorating and intimidating.
Even as Lundqvist thrived, capitalizing on an injury to the starter Kevin Weekes to win three of his first four starts, every game was an experiment of sorts.
Accustomed to roaming outside the crease, Lundqvist, at the request of his new goalie coach, Benoit Allaire, began playing a more conservative style, deeper in the net. The switch maximized Lundqvist's quickness, one of his main assets, and enabled him to glide from post to post with an economy of movement. Allaire, regarded as one of the top goalie coaches in the N.H.L., teaches the virtues of patience, imploring his students to maintain their positioning -- in the middle of the net, at an angle that defends optimum space -- instead of moving forward to chase the puck.
''It was a very radical change in a very short amount of time,'' Weekes said. ''I'm honestly not sure how he was able to implement it so quickly.''
Do something enough times, Lundqvist said, and it feels natural. To hone his new approach, he would spend 30 minutes on the ice with Allaire before practice. Steve Valiquette, his backup for parts of four seasons, said Lundqvist would prepare for practices as if they were games.
''You could see the intensity in his eyes before we'd go on the ice,'' Valiquette said.
Over time, Lundqvist's intensity has never wavered, but his style has evolved. If an onrushing forward seems likely to fire a slap shot from the wing, Lundqvist will drift to the top of the crease. If in that same situation he senses a pass coming, he may move back a few inches so he can slide easily across the crease to prepare for a potential shot.
Valiquette said he had never seen or played with a goalie better than Lundqvist, in large part because Lundqvist always seems square to the shooter.
The former N.H.L. goaltender Darren Pang, an analyst for TSN and the St. Louis Blues, said: ''It's amazing watching Henrik, because when he does get beat, he gets beat by pretty darn good shots. Very seldom do pucks go through him, or does he end up overcommitting. It makes it very hard to get a breakdown on how to beat him.''
Compared with many other N.H.L. goalies, Lundqvist, at 6 feet 1 inch, is of average height. But because he favors a more upright position, he appears far larger to the shooter.
''You see him in street clothes, and you're like, 'This is the same guy?' '' said Zetterberg, who was on the ice for Sweden for Lundqvist's defining moment of the 2006 Olympics, an acrobatic stick save on Olli Jokinen that preserved a 3-2 victory against Finland in the gold medal game. ''He stands up so tall that it's tough to see any net behind him.''
Pucks do slip past Lundqvist. Even in practice, being scored on infuriates him. Just ask wing Mats Zuccarello, whose celebration one recent morning in Greenburgh was interrupted by a puck struck by Lundqvist smacking the glass behind him, missing his head by a few feet.
Former teammates tell stories of Lundqvist's breaking golf clubs and trashing locker rooms after bad performances, but he said his swings in emotion were not so extreme anymore.
However comfortable he had been living in a city that nourishes his varied interests -- fashion, music, philanthropy -- Lundqvist said he was more at peace with himself than ever before. Hiring a business manager, Adam Campbell, reduced distractions and simplified his life off the ice, allowing Lundqvist to concentrate on being a Lamborghini-driving soon-to-be dad who also happens to be a virtuoso at stopping frozen disks of vulcanized rubber, sometimes with his head.
Unwinding after and between games has become easier for Lundqvist, who often plays one of his many guitars -- usually acoustic, so as not to disturb the neighbors -- to help him decompress. When time allows, he jams with his band, the Noise Upstairs, which includes John McEnroe and Jay Weinberg, son of Max Weinberg, the longtime drummer for the E Street Band. Shopping was a popular pastime when his friend Sean Avery played for the Rangers. Avery, who is a co-owner with Lundqvist of the Tribeca restaurant Tiny's, said he picked out most of the shoes in Therese's closet.
''I was wasting so much energy because I was so focused, if not 24-7, then almost,'' said Lundqvist, who is in the fourth year of a six-year, $41.2 million contract extension. ''Especially if you want to have a good run in the playoffs, you need to relax. You need to save your energy for what matters.''
Still, certain goals, certain games, stay with him like tattoos. He thinks about when, at 13, he gave up the winning goal in sudden-death overtime in the finals of a prestigious tournament. He thinks about a defeat in Philadelphia on the final day of the 2009-10 regular season, with the Rangers and the Flyers needing a victory to reach the playoffs. Lundqvist made 46 saves across regulation and overtime, but the Rangers were eliminated when the Flyers won in the shootout, 2-1.
''That was one of the tougher losses of my career,'' he said. ''You work the whole year and then you lose the whole season.''

About a half-hour before they were to play the Flyers at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia last Tuesday, the Rangers knew exactly where Henrik Lundqvist was: in goal, preparing for his 10th consecutive start.
His performance over the previous nine games -- a 6-3 record, .910 save percentage, 2.20 goals against -- hardly signified failure. But with the playoffs edging closer and the Rangers needing a point to secure the Eastern Conference title, Lundqvist yearned to regain top form.
''The thing with Hankie,'' his backup Biron said, ''when he puts his mind to do it, he can do anything.''
So he did.
First, a wicked glove save from up close on Wayne Simmonds, who skated away shaking his head. Next, a contortionist's delight: while falling backward, Lundqvist flicked his blocker to poke a fluttering puck over the crossbar.
The Flyers' first goal caromed in off Marc Staal's skate. The second was tapped in after Lundqvist landed on his right forearm while stopping a slap shot.
His arm throbbing so badly that he advised Biron to get ready, Lundqvist, barely able to grip his stick, made 13 more saves in the third period. The final two came one right after the other, as he kicked away a Hartnell wrister toward Simmonds, who batted the puck in midair -- and into Lundqvist's glove as the Rangers held on for a 5-3 victory.
''Pure reaction,'' Lundqvist said, with a slight shrug. ''Nothing more.''
Maybe. Maybe not.
This, after all, has been the Season of Hank, an affirmation and celebration of his place among New York's sports royalty. In the quiet of the visitors' locker room in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, after most of his teammates had scattered, Lundqvist reflected on the last seven months.
A season that began in Sweden, where he choked back tears during a ceremony before an exhibition game against Frolunda and Joel, the team's captain. A season that reinforced how the Rangers reflected Lundqvist's personality -- determined, unflappable, ambitious. A season that showcased Lundqvist on the national stage at the Winter Classic, the All-Star Game and on HBO as the most indispensable player on the best team in the conference. A season that begins anew this week, in the Stanley Cup playoffs.
''This,'' Lundqvist said, ''has been an amazing year.''
He knew it would be. In late August, soon after his wedding and shortly before training camp, he and Gabriella spoke over the phone. He told her what he was going to do this season.
''I'm going to be the best,'' Lundqvist said.
Taken aback by his boldness, Gabriella asked him what he meant.
''I'm going to be the best,'' Lundqvist said. ''And that's that.''

HEADLINE: On Lenten Fridays in New Orleans, the Catfish Are Making the Sacrifices

BYLINE: By DAVE THIER

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- New Orleans is the land of Antoine's and Galatoire's, of trout amandine and oysters Rockefeller, of remoulades and beurre blanc -- a bastion of Old World fine dining in the United States.
But on Fridays during Lent, the hottest ticket in town is not served on silver platters by white-gloved waiters. It is served up in plastic foam clamshells in church parking lots, parish halls and multipurpose rooms surrounded by a scoop of potato salad, green beans, bread pudding and a few slices of white bread in a plastic bag. 
The tradition of avoiding meat on Fridays during Lent may have been intended as a sacrifice, but when it comes to fried catfish in New Orleans, it is anything but.
Roman Catholic churches all over the country hold fish fries to raise money during Lent, but in New Orleans the fish fry has become a citywide event. Different kitchens use the occasion as a chance to stretch their culinary skills and throw the sort of neighborhood party this city is known for.
''There's a fish fry in every direction for a three-to-five-block radius,'' said Audrey Amos, president of the St. Augustine Catholic Church Ladies' Altar Society. ''It's not really a sacrifice.''
St. Augustine's 171-year-old church draws flocks of tourists every Sunday, but it also has one of the better-known fish fries. On Fridays, the parish hall fills up several times over as a team of older women works to fill hundreds of plates with catfish and sides. The cooks make sure to come out and greet people as they eat, and to see how they like their food.
When the hall gets crowded, the cooks sometimes start to sing in the kitchen and may come out for a dance in front as well. Brass bands and local musicians have been known to stop by. Plates are $8 each, but people have a way of leaving a bit more.
''There's a lot of community pride wrapped up in the fish fries,'' said Ian McNulty, a local food critic. ''It's a pretty ordinary plate of food, but sometimes the simplest things are what people take the most pride in. And because it comes from this dream team of cooks, people come all the way across town to get them.''
Ms. Amos remembers fish fries going back to when she was a little girl, but in recent years the practice has exploded to dozens of churches and other organizations across greater New Orleans. Some even have drive-through windows.
The fish fry has become part of the rhythm of the city, coming off the bacchanalian excess that is Mardi Gras and heading into the long hot summer. Local connoisseurs will spend their Fridays driving around and sampling the different events the way they would with new restaurants.
''We've been doing ours for 15 years,'' said Tracey Reed, a youth minister with St. Maria Goretti Church in New Orleans East. ''When we first started doing it, it was basically the churches. Now the schools do it, and other groups within the community do it, so we're competing. It's funny.''
Catholics in New Orleans have had to make tough decisions in the years since Hurricane Katrina. The shifting populations have left some parishes struggling, and other churches have been shuttered altogether.
For parishes still feeling the repercussions of emptied neighborhoods, the fish fries are a way not only to foster a sense of pride and community, but also to provide extra income.
''We're a poor parish,'' Ms. Amos said. ''We've outlived that mess after Katrina. But this helps supplement some of the bills that come in.''
Ms. Amos usually hopes to raise about $10,000 through a season of fish fries, but she does not expect to hit that target this year. The economic downturn has been hard on her community. In times like these, the fish fry can be an end in itself.
''It takes a lot more than a fish fry to keep a church going,'' Ms. Amos said. ''But we make the food with a lot of love, and we serve it with a lot of love.''
''Sometimes working people will come back around 4:30 or 5, because we stop at 6, asking, 'Am I too late?,' '' she said.
'' 'Don't worry,' '' she tells them. '' 'We knew you were coming.' ''

LENGTH: 1478 words

HEADLINE: Strolling Through a Sailors' Haven

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
COS COB, a snug enclave in Greenwich about 32 miles from Manhattan, seems a place in perpetual motion.
There are all the cars, zipping in and out of the parking lots of the lively commercial strip along East Putnam Avenue. And there are the ones that go by at a faster clip, and more thunderously, on Interstate 95, whose elevated light blue roadbed casts shadows on some streets.
Then there are rowers -- teenagers from private schools, as well as adults looking to stretch their limbs -- who skim past in crew boats along the Mianus River. Others sail past in yachts from the necklace of marinas along River and Strickland Roads.
Also, a handful of commuters use bikes to get to Cos Cob's wood-frame Metro-North Railroad station, before chugging off to Grand Central Terminal. About 20 percent of residents say they use public transportation to travel to work, census records indicate, versus 4 percent statewide. 
Yet engines, pedals and oars are not the main reason that many end up in Cos Cob. Residents say the like the neighborhood's walkability.
Playgrounds, mom-and-pop restaurants and a beloved library are often no more than a five-minute stroll away, and it is not uncommon to see people making their way there on the shoulders of roads, undeterred by the occasional lack of sidewalks.
Even after decades of living there, the novelty hasn't worn off for Faith Toraby, who walks to the post office nearly every day at 4:30 p.m. to catch up on gossip, and sometimes even buy stamps. Having everything close in many ways recalls New York City, where Ms. Toraby worked as a lawyer for 12 years.
Ms. Toraby's home, a daffodil-yellow Federal-style structure with six bedrooms, gazes down on it all from a perch on a hill. It cost her $660,000 in 1991, she said, estimating that it might sell for $3 million today, in part because she added a wing with a garage to the back.
From her windows, she can see I-95 in the distance. But if not for the efforts of preservationists in the 1950s, it might be much closer. They were the ones who urged highway planners to reroute it slightly south, historical accounts show.
Today the Interstate is more friend than foe, especially at night, Ms. Toraby said. ''There's something nice having a little twinkling of lights going by,'' she said jokingly.
If there's any outdoor noise to speak of north of East Putnam Avenue, it probably emanates from children skateboarding in the street, said Laura Yens, a new resident. She considers those sounds pleasing.
Last fall, she and husband, John McDonald, both lawyers, relocated from Bethesda, Md., after more than a year of hunting on Long Island and in Connecticut. Greenwich was an early favorite, but in the older houses they saw in Old Greenwich and Central Greenwich, the kitchens and baths weren't always up to snuff. But the three-bedroom Foursquare they found in Cos Cob, with an octagonal window by the door, had up-to-date amenities, she said. It cost $800,000.
Though a newcomer, Ms. Yens has already broken in her shoes. She frequently makes use of a little red wagon to tow her son, Ryan, who is nearly 2, to the library, which on Wednesdays hosts sing-alongs with offerings like ''The Wheels on the Bus.''
But no wheels are needed when she craves veggie wraps from Arcuri's, a nearby pizzeria. ''You feel silly getting in the car,'' Ms. Yens said. ''And it's actually faster to go out the door and get them.''
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
Cos Cob's four and a half square miles correspond roughly with the boundaries of the 06807 ZIP code, which follows the Mianus from its mouth to the Stamford border.
There are about 9,000 residents, about a quarter of whom claim Italian ancestry; historically, Italians lived in the microneighborhood of Mianus, which hugs the dammed portion of the river.
Between Valley Road and Bible Street, near Scarpelli's market, is a mix of modest Capes and two-families, many of them amply clad in stucco. The backyard privacy so typical of Greenwich, enforced by privet hedges, is notably absent. Houses are cheek by jowl on sixth-of-an-acre lots.
Farther north the landscape opens up, and two-acre zoning is the rule. Contemporary styles and newer colonials relax on wooded cul-de-sacs off Cat Rock Road, where it is not unusual to find a pool or tennis court, or both.
The area around Valleywood Road was known as Little Millbrook when it was built in the 1920s, to differentiate it from the Millbrook community off Indian Field Road. Both have brick-and-stone Tudor homes, though Valleywood's tend to be much smaller and usually sit atop one-car garages.
There are also narrow driveways nearby on Butler Street, which means people park on the sides of roads; homeowners who do so pay $10 for a yearly pass.
On Mead Avenue, rambling Second Empire-style houses jostle vinyl-sided colonials, creating a hodgepodge look; an open-air porch supported by posts with purple-colored brackets sheltered a set of Adirondack chairs in repose.
There are some condominiums. The largest complex is the 74-unit Palmer Point, built in 1979, on the waterfront site where the Palmer Engine Company outfitted fishing trawlers with 300-horsepower engines.
About a quarter of Cos Cob residents are renters; rental buildings are usually the ones with fire escapes.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
In late March, there were 45 single-family homes for sale in Cos Cob, at an average of $1.22 million, according to the Greenwich Multiple Listing Service. They ranged from an expanded five-bedroom Cape, at $645,000, to a five-bedroom 2002 colonial on two acres, on rural Cognewaugh Road, at $3.2 million.
Though the market has healed since its low point of the recession, it's still far below its peak.
In 2011, 51 single-family houses sold; in 2007 the number was 71, according to data prepared by Anderson Associates, a real estate firm. That represents a 28 percent decrease. The average sale price in 2011 was $1.12 million, down from $1.57 million in 2007, so prices are down nearly 30 percent, the data show.
The rental market, which often moves inversely to the sales market, has improved over the same time frame.
In 2011, 48 single-families were leased in Cos Cob, as compared with 36 in 2007 -- a 33 percent jump. And the average monthly rent for those houses in 2011 was $5,200, as compared with $3,400 in 2007, a 53 percent increase.
Cos Cob, though, has made gains in the last decade as a first choice for buyers within Greenwich, whereas it used to play second fiddle to more rural North Street or Backcountry.
''The whole attitude has changed,'' said Carolyn Anderson, the managing broker at Anderson Associates. ''People want neighborhoods, they want to be near things, and Cos Cob is right in the middle.''
Famously low taxes don't hurt either. A five-bedroom that Ms. Anderson is listing has a $14,000 annual tax bill, which is less than for the same size property in Stamford, she added, and far below levels in Westchester.
WHAT TO DO
Among open spaces that serve as gathering points are Loughlin Playground and Bible Street Playground.
The most unusual might be Montgomery Pinetum. A 200-acre expanse, the park boasts 100 varieties of evergreen, including a recently planted Chinese golden larch. In addition to trails that loop past rock outcroppings, it has a garden center that teaches bark identification; a one-day class is $25.
Many residents were upset in 2008 when Porricelli's, a longtime grocery store, was replaced by a CVS store. Other chains, though, seem to have improved the landscape, like the Starbucks that recently took over a gas station that had sat empty for years.
THE SCHOOLS
Cos Cob School, a stately red-brick structure, was rebuilt in 1990 after a fire. This year, 400 students are enrolled in kindergarten to fifth grade. On Connecticut Mastery Tests last year, 95 percent of third-graders met standards in math, 88 percent in reading and 98 percent in writing.
Central Middle School, which has 630 students, teaches sixth to eighth grade. And Greenwich High School, which is among the top-rated schools in the state, teaches 2,700 students, who can choose among seven languages, including sign language, and 24 Advanced Placement classes. Sports include crew. SAT averages last year were 585 in math, 566 in reading and 579 in writing, versus 505, 502 and 506 statewide.
THE COMMUTE
The Cos Cob station, one of four in Greenwich, has seven trains daily between 6 and 8 a.m. The shortest trip to Grand Central takes 46 minutes. There are 556 parking spaces there; permits cost $279 a year. There is a two-year waiting list.
THE HISTORY
The origin of ''Cos Cob'' is a mystery, but the name has existed on maps, as ''Coscobneck,'' since 1668, according to the historical society, which is housed in the Bush-Holley museum complex. For 40 years, starting in the 1890s, that property played host to an arts colony dedicated to Impressionism; it was spared when plans for I-95 were changed.

THE IDEA FACTORY
Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation
By Jon Gertner
Illustrated. 422 pp. The Penguin Press. $29.95.
In 1909, top executives at AT&T decided to commit themselves to a challenge: building a transcontinental phone line that could connect a call between New York and San Francisco. The problem was one that required not just engineering skill but advances in pure science. They needed, among other things, to create a repeater or amplifier for the electric signals so that they would not attenuate after a few miles. Thus was the seed planted for a new collaborative industrial organization -- teaming up theoreticians, experimentalists, material scientists, metallurgists, engineers and even telephone pole climbers -- that eventually became Bell Labs. Jointly owned by AT&T and its affiliated equipment maker, Western Electric, Bell Labs went on to invent the transistor and make major contributions to the field of lasers and cellular telephony. 
Jon Gertner, an editor at Fast Company magazine, has produced a well-/researched history of Bell Labs, filled with colorful characters and inspiring lessons. But more important, ''The Idea Factory'' explores one of the most critical issues of our time: What causes innovation? Why does it happen, and how might we nurture it? The lesson of Bell Labs is that most feats of sustained innovation cannot and do not occur in an iconic garage or the workshop of an ingenious inventor. They occur when people of diverse talents and mind-sets and expertise are brought together, preferably in close physical proximity where they can have frequent meetings and serendipitous encounters.
Bell Labs was created on Jan. 1, 1925, and was originally based on West Street in Lower Manhattan. During the 1930s it was the site for many lectures, scientific visits (Einstein dropped by) and informal study groups. Among those groups was one that discussed the latest advances in solid-state physics, an emerging field that analyzed the conductivity and other properties of different materials in relation to their atomic structures. It included William Shockley, who was an intense theoretician, and Walter Brattain, who was a verbose experimentalist.
Shockley was inspired by a talk given by the Bell Labs research director, Mervin Kelly, who wanted to find a way to invent electronic switches and amplifiers that could replace the relay switches and vacuum tubes that underlay the telephone exchanges. So Shockley began to think about using a type of material known as the semiconductor, which partly conducted and partly resisted electric current; it also sometimes acted as a rectifier that would allow current to move in only one direction. His idea was that semiconducting materials might be used to make small devices that would serve as electronic amplifiers. He urged Brattain to try to fabricate one using copper oxide.
It didn't work, and for a while the endeavor was put aside as Bell Labs concentrated on helping the military during World War II. But in the middle of the war, Bell Labs began moving to a new campus in Murray Hill, N.J., and Kelly began to create interdisciplinary teams that threw theorists and engineers together into the same work spaces. ''By intention, everyone would be in one another's way,'' Gertner writes. Among the teams was one doing solid-state research. It included Shockley and Brattain. Kelly recruited John Bardeen, a very quiet theorist, to join the group, but there was no vacant office, so Bardeen decided to share space with Brattain, the experimentalist. This was a smart idea. Gertner describes how innovations came not just from new theories but from linking them to advances made by the lab's experimental chemists and metallurgists who were creating a revolution in materials. ''Indeed, without new materials,'' Gertner writes, ''Shockley would have spent his career trapped in a prison of elegant theory.''
Having failed with copper oxide, the team tried two other semiconducting materials, silicon and germanium. By December 1947, they had rigged up thin slices of those materials with a wire tipped by a gold-foil point and were able to show that the contraption could act as an amplifier. It also proved able to serve as an electronic switch and do everything a vacuum tube could do at a fraction of the size and electricity use. After polling 31 members of the Bell Labs staff, they decided to name the new device a ''transistor.'' Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain would share the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery.
Like Bell Labs, the transistor stood at the intersection of theoretical science and applied engineering. It could be described as both a discovery and an invention. It was also an example of the ''linear argument'' in the history of science that was expounded by Vannevar Bush, James Conant and other academics who were involved in World War II's scientific endeavors and wanted to encourage continued government funding of pure research: The theoretical discoveries of pure science would lead to applied science breakthroughs and new technological inventions. Gertner explains how this process could result in sustained innovation:
''If an idea begat a discovery, and if a discovery begat an invention, then an innovation defined the lengthy and wholesale transformation of an idea into a technological product (or process) meant for widespread practical use. Almost by definition, a single person, or even a single group, could not alone create an innovation. The task was too variegated and involved.''
Because Bell Labs was part of the AT&T monopoly, its executives felt a moral, political and legal imperative to share the discovery with other researchers and license it to other companies. ''AT&T maintained its monopoly at the government's pleasure, and with the understanding that its scientific work was in the public interest,'' Gertner writes. The transistor would end up doing a lot more than make telephone circuits function better. It would start a digital revolution in computing and information technology.
Bell Labs had just the right person to help its people imagine the transistor's larger implications. Claude Elwood Shannon was a very eccentric theoretician who amused himself by juggling while riding a unicycle up and down the long Bell Labs corridors. He had the insight that the best way to understand complex circuits that contained many on-off switches was through Boolean algebra, which assigned each operation a value of either 0 or 1. Shannon went on to develop an information theory in which all communications and sequences of information could be measured in the number of binary digits (either a 0 or a 1), known as bits, they required. This was one of the great intellectual achievements of the 20th century, and it correlated neatly with the advent of transistors that could permit circuits to have huge numbers of on-off switches.
The application of these theories and discoveries helped to spawn the computer revolution, but Bell Labs did not lead the way. In part this was because, with the threat of antitrust lawsuits looming, the company decided not to go into the computer or consumer electronics business. In fact, it did not even take its invention of the transistor to the next step, which was figuring out how to etch a circuit of multiple transistors onto a single chip, an idea that became known as the integrated circuit, or microchip. That breakthrough came in 1958 at two small companies that had licensed semiconductor patents from Bell Labs -- Texas Instruments, led by Jack Kilby, and Fairchild Semiconductor, led by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, who had worked for the increasingly erratic Shockley after he quit Bell Labs but soon rebelled against him.
Bell Labs had other great successes that it failed to capitalize on fully. It did pioneering work in the invention of the laser, a super-focused beam of visible light based on the stimulated emission of a stream of photons. Laser beams could carry information, like voice and data, and Bell Labs began a cumbersome and expensive endeavor to create hollow pipes that would serve as waveguides to send the beam to the proper destination. Another concept, developed elsewhere, was to direct the beams by creating incredibly pure strands of glass fiber. The Bell Labs brain trust concluded this would be unfeasible, and besides, they already had a lot invested in the waveguide pipe infrastructure. Thus Bell Labs lost out to Corning Glass and others on the chance to be a leader in the development of fiber optics.
Gertner draws smart insights from the successes at Bell Labs, but he does not do quite as well drawing lessons from its lapses and failures. Perhaps these were inevitable; in innovation as in hitting home runs in baseball, you have to be willing to strike out a lot to be successful. Whatever the case, it was not the failures that doomed Bell Labs. That was mainly the decision of the Justice Department, in 1974, to file a sweeping antitrust suit against AT&T that led, 10 years later, to the breakup of the company. Bell Labs gradually withered.
Steve Jobs once said that the most difficult and important thing to create was not an innovative product but a great organization that could continually create innovative products. That required joining creative people with product designers and great engineers so that imagination and technology could be connected. For much of the 20th century, Bell Labs played that role. It showed the value of having theoreticians, researchers, developers and engineers all huddled together. ''People had to be near one another,'' Gertner writes. ''Phone calls alone wouldn't do.'' Mervin Kelly even created branches of Bell Labs at the phone company's factories so that the theoreticians and scientists could be closely involved with the manufacturing workers.
The ability to combine theory, creativity and engineering was a great achievement of postwar America. For 50 years, economic growth and job creation were propelled by transistors, lasers and other discoveries that came from the willingness to nurture theoretical research in conjunction with applied science and manufacturing skills. But these days, manufacturing is being outsourced, and funding for pure science is being curtailed. With Bell Labs and other such idea factories disappearing, and with government research money endangered, what will propel innovation and job creation for the next 50 years?

HEADLINE: The Other Arab Spring

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
The public editor is off today.

 BODY:
ISN'T it interesting that the Arab awakening began in Tunisia with a fruit vendor who was harassed by police for not having a permit to sell food -- just at the moment when world food prices hit record highs? And that it began in Syria with farmers in the southern village of Dara'a, who were demanding the right to buy and sell land near the border, without having to get permission from corrupt security officials? And that it was spurred on in Yemen -- the first country in the world expected to run out of water -- by a list of grievances against an incompetent government, among the biggest of which was that top officials were digging water wells in their own backyards at a time when the government was supposed to be preventing such water wildcatting? As Abdelsalam Razzaz, the minister of water in Yemen's new government, told Reuters last week: ''The officials themselves have traditionally been the most aggressive well diggers. Nearly every minister had a well dug in his house.'' 
All these tensions over land, water and food are telling us something: The Arab awakening was driven not only by political and economic stresses, but, less visibly, by environmental, population and climate stresses as well. If we focus only on the former and not the latter, we will never be able to help stabilize these societies.
Take Syria. ''Syria's current social unrest is, in the most direct sense, a reaction to a brutal and out-of-touch regime,'' write Francesco Femia and Caitlin Werrell, in a report for their Center for Climate and Security in Washington. ''However, that's not the whole story. The past few years have seen a number of significant social, economic, environmental and climatic changes in Syria that have eroded the social contract between citizen and government. ... If the international community and future policy makers in Syria are to address and resolve the drivers of unrest in the country, these changes will have to be better explored.''
From 2006-11, they note, up to 60 percent of Syria's land experienced one of the worst droughts and most severe set of crop failures in its history. ''According to a special case study from last year's Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction, of the most vulnerable Syrians dependent on agriculture, particularly in the northeast governorate of Hassakeh (but also in the south), 'nearly 75 percent ... suffered total crop failure.' Herders in the northeast lost around 85 percent of their livestock, affecting 1.3 million people.'' The United Nations reported that more than 800,000 Syrians had their livelihoods wiped out by these droughts, and many were forced to move to the cities to find work -- adding to the burdens of already incompetent government.
''If climate projections stay on their current path, the drought situation in North Africa and the Middle East is going to get progressively worse, and you will end up witnessing cycle after cycle of instability that may be the impetus for future authoritarian responses,'' argues Femia. ''There are a few ways that the U.S. can be on the right side of history in the Arab world. One is to enthusiastically and robustly support democratic movements.'' The other is to invest in climate-adaptive infrastructure and improvements in water management -- to make these countries more resilient in an age of disruptive climate change.
An analysis by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, published last October in the Journal of Climate, and cited on Joe Romm's blog, climateprogress.org, found that droughts in wintertime in the Middle East -- when the region traditionally gets most of its rainfall to replenish aquifers -- are increasing, and human-caused climate change is partly responsible.
''The magnitude and frequency of the drying that has occurred is too great to be explained by natural variability alone,'' noted Martin Hoerling, of NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory, the lead author of the paper. ''This is not encouraging news for a region that already experiences water stress, because it implies natural variability alone is unlikely to return the region's climate to normal.''
Especially when you consider the other stresses. Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, the executive director of the Institute for Policy Research and Development in London, writing in The Beirut Daily Star in February, pointed out that 12 of the world's 15 most water-scarce countries -- Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Israel and Palestine -- are in the Middle East, and after three decades of explosive population growth these countries are ''set to dramatically worsen their predicament. Although birth rates are falling, one-third of the overall population is below 15 years old, and large numbers of young women are reaching reproductive age, or soon will be.'' A British Defense Ministry study, he added, ''has projected that by 2030 the population of the Middle East will increase by 132 percent -- generating an unprecedented 'youth bulge.' ''
And a lot more mouths to feed with less water than ever. As Lester Brown, the president of the Earth Policy Institute and author of ''World on the Edge,'' notes, 20 years ago, using oil-drilling technology, the Saudis tapped into an aquifer far below the desert to produce irrigated wheat, making themselves self-sufficient. But now almost all that water is gone, and Saudi wheat production is, too. So the Saudis are investing in farm land in Ethiopia and Sudan, but that means they will draw more Nile water for irrigation away from Egypt, whose agriculture-rich Nile Delta is already vulnerable to any sea level rise and saltwater intrusion.
If you ask ''what are the real threats to our security today,'' said Brown, ''at the top of the list would be climate change, population growth, water shortages, rising food prices and the number of failing states in the world. As that list grows, how many failed states before we have a failing global civilization, and everything begins to unravel?''
Hopefully, we won't go there. But, then, we should all remember that quote attributed to Leon Trotsky: ''You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.'' Well, you may not be interested in climate change, but climate change is interested in you.
Folks, this is not a hoax. We and the Arabs need to figure out -- and fast -- more ways to partner to mitigate the environmental threats where we can and to build greater resiliency against those where we can't. Twenty years from now, this could be all that we're talking about.

HEADLINE: In Target-Date Funds, A Hodgepodge of Styles

BYLINE: By CARLA FRIED

 BODY:
CHOOSING among the often-confusing lineup of mutual funds offered in 401(k)retirement accounts can be an unwelcome chore. Increasingly, employees have been embracing a simpler choice: all-in-one mutual funds known as target-date retirement funds, or T.D.F.'s.
Assets in these funds have more than quadrupled since 2007. For employees, the funds appear very straightforward, requiring only the choice of an expected retirement date. Once a fund with an appropriate target date is chosen, investment professionals take charge. They decide on a mix of assets that gradually becomes more conservative as the employee nears retirement.
''Workers are delegating back to their employer the asset-allocation decision,'' says Stephen P. Utkus, principal of the Vanguard Center for Retirement Research. Put another way, workers are delegating to their employer, who is then delegating to the plan provider it has hired, to run a target-date fund within a 401(k). The T.D.F is typically comprised of a mix of mutual funds run by the plan provider. 
There is a very wide range of T.D.F.'s, and that may be a problem because they have a whiff of the old Wild West about them: just about anything goes. For example, Morningstar found that among three dozen funds with a target retirement date of 2025, the percentage of fund assets invested in stocks ranged from 38 to 86 percent, with an average of 70 percent. The retirement investment industry and Washington regulators have basically left it to investors to figure out what their T.D.F.'s contain, and to decide if their plan dovetails with their risk and return expectations.
These funds are also not immune to some well-worn fund and 401(k) maladies, including possibly high fees and a presumptuous belief that active management can consistently beat passive indexing.
But what T.D.F.'s do quite well is distance investors from their worst enemy: themselves. By hewing to a long-term investment allocation strategy and rebalancing whenever the markets throw the portfolio off that strategy, they insulate investors from many emotional and psychological barriers that can make it hard to stick with a given approach.
''It's akin to a stereo system,'' said Meir Statman, professor of finance at Santa Clara University in California and author of ''What Investors Really Want.'' ''Rather than having to purchase all the individual components and figure out how to make it work together, a T.D.F. is like buying a single, integrated system. Maybe you give up some flexibility, but that's still a good trade-off for many investors.''
That idea offers some comfort to many investors. A recent ING survey of 401(k) investors found that those who used a T.D.F. were more confident about their retirement prospects than investors who didn't own such a fund.
Assets in target-date funds grew to $374 billion at the end of 2011 from $71 billion four years ago. The Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan group that specializes in economic security issues, says that nearly half of workers hired in 2009 and 2010 who were enrolled in a 401(k) owned a T.D.F.; in 2006, just 28 percent of new hires did. Vanguard, a big manager of target-date funds, says it anticipates that 75 percent of employees enrolled in its plans will own such a fund by 2016.
The growing popularity has been aided by a big nudge from Washington. In 2006, the Labor Department allowed employers to automatically enroll employees in 401(k)'s, and when employees did not actively choose among the funds offered in a plan, employers could also automatically put them into a T.D.F. that matched their expected retirement age.
But automated simplicity isn't a magic bullet. ''The potential problem is that the T.D.F. you are given isn't really that good,'' Professor Statman says.
For example, a recent survey by Callan Associates, an investment consulting firm, found that 63 percent of such funds used actively managed funds and that an additional 17 percent used a mix of active and index-based funds. Historically, active management has been less effective than passive index-based investing.
''The fact is, after investment fees are subtracted, active management is a loser's game,'' says Tom Idzorek, global chief investment officer at Morningstar Investment Management .
On an asset-weighed basis, the average annual expense ratio charged on target-date funds is 0.61 percent, according to Morningstar. Vanguard, which has an average charge of 0.18 percent for its T.D.F.'s, is the only major manager that emphasizes index-based funds for them. Target-date funds that are actively managed tend to have annual expense charges above 0.70 percent -- though many exchange-traded funds charge less than 0.30 percent.
Both TIAA-CREF and Fidelity have started low-cost, index-fund-based T.D.F.'s in the last few years, but assets in them are dwarfed by each provider's more expensive actively managed funds.
A vast majority of 401(k)'s offer only funds run by the plan provider. For the providers, keeping all assets in-house makes plenty of business sense. But for plan sponsors, who have a fiduciary responsibility to run the plan for the benefit of employees, being able to pick and choose among different managers would offer the chance to package a T.D.F. made up of best-in-class funds. ING reports that only 6 of the 21 largest target-date funds now use nonproprietary funds.
THEN there is the debate over glide paths -- the strategy that each fund uses to gradually shift assets for a given target date to a more conservative bent as retirement nears. There is no industry standard, and these paths vary widely.
Lori Lucas, the leader of Callan's defined-contribution practice, says arguing over the right one path misses the point. ''You can make a case for a variety of different glide paths,'' she said. ''The issue is whether the glide path a sponsor has chosen makes sense for its employees, and whether employees are getting enough information on how their glide path works.''
A study conducted by Ibbotson, a Morningstar subsidiary, says that many T.D.F. glide paths have been evolving. For example, Ibbotson said that in 2002, the particular Fidelity Freedom fund intended for a 60-year-old worker had a 34 percent equity allocation. In 2006, a 60-year-old in the age-appropriate Fidelity Freedom fund had a 53 percent equity allocation. More recently, Ibbotson said, the glide-path allocations of Fidelity T.D.F.'s have bounced around much more than those of T. Rowe Price or Vanguard. The three fund companies manage three out of every four dollars invested in T.D.F.'s.
Christopher Sharpe, a co-manager of Fidelity's T.D.F.'s, says the company made a strategic decision in 2006 to wait longer to roll down the equity stake for investors of particular ages. ''That change manifested itself over the next five years for investors,'' Mr. Sharpe said. He also said Fidelity had been adding alternative assets in recent years, including commodities, real estate investment trusts and floating-rate debt, that could change how Ibbotson calculated glide-path stability. He stressed that those changes were ''aiming for the same return with a smoother ride.''
Vanguard also made a shift in 2006 to maintain higher equity stakes for investors at given ages, but it has not added alternative asset classes. In 2010, T. Rowe Price began incorporating its Real Assets Fund, which holds real estate investment trusts and commodities, into its T.D.F.'s.
''Now that there's so much more money in T.D.F.'s, firms are taking a harder look at what their process is,'' says Mr. Idzorek, a co-author of the Ibbotson study. ''I would suspect some level of instability as firms figure this out.''
In the meantime, more managers are practicing selective tweaking. According to a Callan survey, 24 percent of T.D.F. managers in 2009 said they incorporated a tactical overlay -- shorter-term shifts in response to market conditions -- to their long-term strategic allocation goals. By 2011, that figure had grown to 37 percent.
Ms. Lucas of Callan says T.D.F. managers who struggled with frequent rebalancing during the depths of the financial crisis were looking for more leeway during extreme market volatility. But that is typically a tweak, not a wholesale shift. For example, T. Rowe Price says it reserves the right to let its glide-path allocations stray up to 5 percentage points from its stated allocation target. ''T.D.F.'s exercise judgment,'' Ms. Lucas says. ''It's up to the participants to figure out if they are comfortable with that strategy.''

HEADLINE: Democratize Wall Street, For Social Good

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale and author of ''Finance and the Good Society,'' to be published on Wednesday by Princeton University Press. A related, newly revised online course in financial markets is at oyc.yale.edu/economics/shiller. It is free and is part of the Open Yale project.

 BODY:
MANY finance students and members of the Occupy Wall Street movement have a great deal in common: a deep interest in democratizing Wall Street.
At Yale, where I have been teaching for 25 years, I've been hearing a great deal lately from my students about financial innovations linked to social media. One such innovation, called crowdfunding, is embedded in the jobs bill signed into law by President Obama on Thursday. The idea involves Web sites that help many investors contribute small amounts of capital to projects that they read about online, and that might otherwise be starved for money.
Though the concept is being tried, in different ways, on sites like Kickstarter.com and Kiva.org, it is still very much an experiment, and its real-world benefits for small investors are still uncertain. 
The new law, called the Jump-start Our Business Start-ups, or JOBS, Act, tries to regulate crowdfunding constructively. This innovation might be as well received as Wikipedia, which is constantly being updated and improved by a vast army of users. There may well be disappointments at first, but the concept can be tinkered with, like other democratizing financial innovations that have eventually delivered much good to society. I discuss many such examples in my new book, ''Finance and the Good Society.''
Consider Wall Street in 1811. It wasn't obvious then, but worldwide economic growth received a major boost that year from a New York law that allowed anyone who satisfied some minimal requirements to set up a corporation, with limited liability. The law turned out to be one of the most socially productive pieces of modern financial history.
By clarifying that shareholders would never be personally liable for a corporation's debts, the New York law would allow investors to hold a diversified portfolio consisting of many stocks. That wasn't feasible without first establishing limited liability, because of the risk that a lawsuit involving any company in the portfolio could bring a major personal loss. The New York law, proven successful, was copied globally. This created a pool of investors for which investment bankers could place shares.
The framers of the New York law didn't see themselves as inventors of a brand-new market. They were merely responding creatively to an economic crisis. Congress had imposed an embargo on trade with Britain starting in 1807, citing grievances related to Britain's war with France. By 1811, the trade embargo was causing economic pain in the United States, because America had been an exporter of cotton and other fibers to British textile mills. There was a pressing need for more American textile mills, but few people in the United States wanted to start them, thinking it would be hard to compete with Britain after the embargo eventually ended.
The new provisions of the New York bill were regarded as expedients to deal with this crisis. The bill made it possible for anyone to start a joint stock company at any time and for any purpose, without special action by the government. But the effects were profound. It was the kind of socially productive financial innovation that the proponents of crowdfunding want today: a new means of financing exciting enterprises, products and services.
The crowdfunding concept also recalls another bit of historical financial innovation that promoted a more democratic economy: support for small businesses. In their 1961 book, ''The New Capitalists,'' Louis O. Kelso and Mortimer J. Adler proposed what they called a Capital Diffusion Insurance Corporation, which would guarantee small-business loans. The Small Business Administration had already been created, in 1953, to replace the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and was then a maker of loans rather than just a guarantor of them.
Gradually, the S.B.A. was transformed from a lender to a partial guarantor of small-business loans, much in the Kelso-Adler spirit. The idea is that individuals should have an incentive to participate in the risk-taking, relieving general taxpayers of the full burden.
Crowdfunding is an altogether new twist on this idea. Financial innovation, of course, takes unanticipated forms, but wherever it turns next, we can expect some breathtaking transformations during the careers of today's students. And despite the damage to its reputation from the subprime mortgage crisis and its aftermath, financial innovation could help solve many vexing problems -- including many for those in the 99 percent.
Finance is substantially about controlling risk. If risk management is suitably democratized, and if its sophisticated tools are better dispersed throughout society, it could help reduce social inequality. Future financial innovation, for example, could deal with the problem of rigid entitlements -- like Social Security or health benefits -- that are making our national debt problems so difficult.
The essence of finance is that contracts should benefit all parties. We may be able to revise our entitlement programs, creating them in a more refined way, using data and analysis to account for the life situations of individuals while still retaining the simple concept of fairness.
Likewise, financial innovation can make our responses to catastrophes more intelligent. It can channel our gambling impulses into something more constructive. It can make speculative bubbles less of a problem, and help make prices in financial markets better reflect fundamental information.
As in the examples of crowdfunding, limited liability and small-business loans, financial professionals can better direct creative energies on longstanding problems that are lamentably neglected today. And they may be able to focus specifically on problems specific to the very poor.
In his 1936 book, ''The Good Society,'' Walter Lippmann saw the deepest human benefits flowing from private business: ''How else, when we pause to ponder the matter, can the human race advance except by the emancipation of more and more individuals in ever-widening circles of activity?''
Contrary to popular opinion these days, the history of finance marks those ''ever-widening circles of activity'' with products ranging from venture capital to home mortgages to various forms of insurance, savings and pensions. The faults in institutions that contributed to the recent financial crisis can be corrected, but only by those who are willing to get inside the mechanism and get to know it.
The challenge ahead -- both for my students bound for the world of finance and for those who would occupy it -- is to truly democratize Wall Street.

HEADLINE: What's the easiest Way to Cheat on Your Taxes?

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON, JACOB GOLDSTEIN, CAITLIN KENNEY, and DAN KEDMEY. 
The authors work at NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
If economists ran the tax system, there would be virtually no exemptions or loopholes. But economists don't run the tax system! Instead, businesses, rich people, Congressmen and attorneys spend a shockingly large amount of time lobbying for tax breaks or exploiting the ones that exist. When the modern income tax was created in 1913, the code was 27 pages long. Last year, it was 5,296 pages. What in the world does it say? After surveying 20 accountants, tax lawyers and policy wonks, we've boiled down their arcane knowledge to this short list of things you might want to know.
So what's the easiest way to cheat on your taxes? 
Run your own company. More specifically, as Greg Kyte, a Utah C.P.A., puts it, be the sole proprietor of a Schedule C business. Then you can buy stuff for yourself and probably write it off as a business expense. ''You can look through your receipts for the year and say, 'Here's some stuff I bought at Home Depot,' '' says Kyte (who, for the record, says he never does this). ''The I.R.S. would have no idea if I bought that for my house or for my business.'' There were more than 20 million Schedule C returns filed in 2009, with receipts of more than $1.2 trillion.
Upstanding Schedule C filers have options, too. They can legally write off payment for office work done by family members, even if they're in middle school. ''I've seen people with infant children claiming that their kids are doing work,'' says Howard Rosen, a St. Louis-based C.P.A. ''I'm talking about a 3-year-old doing filing,'' Rosen says. ''He didn't even know the alphabet.''
How often do people cheat?
For 2006, the most recent year for which data are available, the I.R.S. collected 86 percent of what it was owed in taxes. Most of this $385 billion shortfall came from underreporting income, which is often more creative than it sounds. Gambling winnings, for example, are taxable, but losses are deductible -- and some people greatly exaggerate their losses. ''It's not unheard-of for gamblers to go to the track and pick up tickets for losing bets that would be thrown on the floor,'' says Mark Blood, a C.P.A. in Rochester. ''I had an examination once where a number of tickets the client had given me to support losses had footprints on them.'' The agent disallowed the deductions.
What's the most ridiculous loophole?
There are too many to count. Like de/duct/ing part of the cost for col/lege foot/ball tick/ets. Or open/ing a ''mo/tor/sports en/ter/tain/ment com/plex.'' (Sad/ly for Nascar track own/ers, this break just ex/pired.) Loop/holes will cost the gov/ern/ment rough/ly $1 tril/lion in lost rev/e/nue this year, which is more than it spends on de/fense or Med/i/care.
The most surprising loopholes are the ones that are so big that they don't even seem like loopholes. The mortgage-interest deduction, which lets people deduct the interest they pay on their mortgages, requires the government to essentially write an annual check to everyone with a mortgage. The incentive was supposed to encourage more people to buy houses, but there's not much evidence for this, says Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center in Washington. It does, however, encourage people to take out even bigger mortgages. It will cost the government an estimated $84 billion this year. And it's considered untouchable.
Who is the government's dream taxpayer?
It's a married, childless renter who earns a decent salary. The government didn't set out to target these people -- it's just that married people who rent and make a decent living don't hire lobbyists or attract activists to write op-eds. ''Sometimes they're pregnant, and I'll say, 'Any chance you can get that out by December?' '' says Shayna Chapman, a C.P.A. in Gallipolis, Ohio. Or: ''Do you think you can get divorced by Dec. 31?''
What's the most ridiculous attempted deduction?
According to the accountants surveyed, here are some common, if questionable, things that people try to deduct:
1.Gym memberships
2.Country-club dues
3.Cosmetic surgery
Less common, more questionable things:
1.A wedding (clients were invited)
2.Thongs (the buyer was an actress, who needed to avoid visible underwear lines on TV)
3.Vet bills (for pets that were listed as dependents)
What's the biggest red flag for auditors?
''There's an old saying in the I.R.S.,'' says David Lifson, a C.P.A. in New York. ''Look at T. and E. and get out by 3.'' Because people are aggressive about writing off travel and entertainment expenses -- and because regulations for deducting T. and E. expenses are Byzantine -- this is low-hanging fruit for auditors.
Another thing that makes people more likely to be audited: being rich. Those with income of at least $1 million are 11 times as likely to be audited as the average taxpayer; those with incomes of $200,000 or more are 4 times as likely. Of the 1,000 biggest U.S. companies, more than half are being audited at any given time, says Mary B. Hevener, a partner at Morgan, Lewis and Bockius in Washington. The I.R.S. is drawn to giant corporations ''for the same reason Willie Sutton robbed banks,'' Hevener notes. ''It's where the money is.''
Why is the tax code so complicated?
The answer, according to most accountants, is simple: ''exceptions to the exceptions,'' which, typically, are extremely complicated. John Yeutter, a C.P.A. who teaches accounting at Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Okla., offered the following example:
RULE: When you buy a bond, you have to pay taxes on the interest payments you receive.
EXCEPTION: You don't have to pay taxes on interest from municipal bonds (because the federal government wants to make it easy for local governments to borrow money).
EXCEPTION TO THE EXCEPTION: If a municipal bond is used to finance a professional sports arena, you have to pay taxes on the interest (the government doesn't want to support a sports team).
Now imagine this times a thousand. ''Each step along the way is great,'' Yeutter says. ''But after 100 years, we have a system that is very, very complex.''
Who is the greatest accountant of all time?
Many consider Luca Pacioli, a 15th-century Italian bookkeeper who hung out with Leonardo, as their standard-bearer. In his 1494 opus, ''Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita,'' Pacioli described the system that Venetian merchants had begun to keep track of their far-flung businesses. That system, with some tweaks, is still in use today. ''He's the father of double-entry accounting,'' Yeutter says, ''the exciting world that we have.''
Do tax cuts pay for themselves?
Politicians sometimes say that lower tax rates lead to higher economic growth, which in turn leads to higher overall tax revenue. This may have been true in the early 1960s, when the top tax rate was 91 percent, but the top tax rate today is 35 percent. For decades, lower tax rates have led to lower government revenues, says Alan Viard, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy group. ''The Reagan tax cuts, on the whole, reduced revenue,'' he explains. ''The Bush tax cuts clearly reduced revenue. There is no dispute among economists about that.''

HEADLINE: Can Coffee Kick-Start an Economy?

BYLINE: By DANIEL BERGNER

 BODY:
When he set out to wedge his coffee onto supermarket shelves in England and America, Andrew Rugasira didn't start by making phone calls from his home in Kampala, Uganda. He didn't begin by sending e-mails. The distance seemed too great for that. At one end of his business were farmers who, until he came along, thought their beans were purchased and carried off to make gunpowder. At the other were buyers at the corporate headquarters of chains like Waitrose and Sainsbury's, Whole Foods and Wal-Mart. If he was going to succeed, he felt he would have to do it physically; it was as if he believed he could stretch himself to span the divide between the two worlds. So he got on a plane to London, without trying any advance contact. 
He checked into a London hotel, and from there he called and sent e-mails to the companies. Rugasira is a tall, tireless 43-year-old with an angular face and slightly prominent ears and a smile that rearranges everything. Armed with a laptop that held a PowerPoint presentation about his coffee, he intended to pull off a kind of revolution. No longer would his country merely sell its unroasted beans to exporters who supplied the European and American coffee kings, from Nestle to Starbucks; no longer would his nation just provide the raw material for someone else's riches. In the stores, his roasts would take their place beside the high-end brands.
He was bursting with the pitch he would deliver as soon as he met his first British buyer. ''We as a new generation of African entrepreneurs believe that we can bring quality products to the global market. We believe we have what the consumer in the North Atlantic market is looking for in coffee; we believe we have the capacity to design the packaging to make it attractive; we believe. . . .'' As he recalled the speech he prepared -- while we sat in December outside his little purchasing office in Kasese, a town not far from the Democratic Republic of Congo -- he sounded like the most moving of preachers. And he felt poised, he said, on that trip to London in 2004, to convert the Western world to his product. In his hotel room, he sat dressed in beige slacks and a gray turtleneck, with a blue blazer pressed and waiting. He watched for replies to animate his in-box. None came. On the phone, the receptionists wouldn't put him through. The 4,000 miles he traveled didn't seem to soften them. ''Did you send a message?'' they asked. ''Well, then he'll get back to you.'' No one did. Day after day, his sermon went unspoken. And at last, there was nothing to do but go home.
Yet Rugasira has a resilience that may have been forged in childhood. He grew up in Kampala during the terrors of Idi Amin's reign in the '70s. When he was around 11, with Amin just driven out, soldiers climbed over the gate in front of his family's house and carried away the TV, the refrigerator, the furniture, while Rugasira and two of his sisters, who were 7 and 5, huddled on their knees and prayed in a bedroom. He could hear the soldiers threatening and his parents pleading out front. The gunmen left, but one evening, his father, who owned a factory that made chalk for Ugandan schoolchildren, didn't return home.
Imprisonment and exile in Kenya -- this was his father's life for the next two and a half years, yet when I asked Rugasira how that period of his boyhood affected him, he said flatly that it hadn't. ''Context is so important,'' he said. ''Friends were losing their parents. If you were successful, you were accused of being Amin's agent. It wasn't difficult to figure out that I was fortunate to be alive, to have my parents alive.'' He didn't want to dwell on that time. He was far happier talking about the ''value addition'' achieved by the growers on the rugged hills above Kasese, through a technique of processing beans that his staff taught them. Or talking about ''capturing the entire value chain'' through his quest to build a roasting factory in Kampala, offering perhaps the first African-roasted coffee sold in British and American stores and creating a thriving industry in sub-Saharan Africa, where factories of any kind are scarce and where the export of finished products to the West is nearly nonexistent.
Three months after his failed trip to England, he got back on a plane with the identical plan in mind: land in London; dial the numbers and send the e-mails and compel the buyers to respond by means of proximity and pure will. ''I thought, I can do this,'' he remembered. He didn't score a single meeting.
Rugasira's company is called Good African Coffee. The Kasese office, about 200 miles west of Kampala toward the center of the continent, is a squat, white-and-blue building surrounded by a dilapidated town that once served a copper mine, now defunct. The town is framed by the Rwenzori Mountains, a glacial chain that the ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy labeled the Mountains of the Moon, borrowing from the name the locals gave to the glowing, snowcapped peaks. Under a tree near the office was a waiting cluster of boda-boda boys, the young men who taxi people around on their motorbikes, their heedless speeds and buzzing engines speaking of the constant motion and ambition that somehow exist side by side with a profound inertia in Africa.
One morning in the Rwenzori foothills, I joined Rugasira as he checked in with some of the growers who sell beans to Good African. In a hovel below a harsh incline, I sat with a group of farmers who had put on their best for our visit. Two of the men wore battered wingtips; a woman was wrapped in a lime green caftan rimmed with pompoms. The building is home to the village-run savings and loan, which Rugasira set up, with blue exam booklets for passbooks. He hoped to guide the farmers to invest in educating their children, upgrading their mud-and-thatch homes and generally elevating their standard of living. But he brought things much more rudimentary than banking. The farmers told me that until Rugasira and his staff appeared, they hadn't terraced their fields; somehow this fundamental, millennia-old method of enhancing yields on steep terrain had eluded them.
Rugasira also generated a miniature industrial revolution. He brought simple pulping machines, knee-high metal contraptions, turned by hand crank, that free the bean from its thick red skin. Over time, he gave out 200 of these, which the farmers carry on their backs from hamlet to hamlet and share across the area. His staff taught the farmers to soak the skinned beans as a way of culling those that are damaged or unripe, while also removing an inner sheath. And Rugasira impressed upon them the benefit of drying the beans in the shade and off the ground, on platforms of wire mesh that the company hired carpenters to construct. These methods would enrich the taste of the coffee down the line, he explained, and in turn enrich the price he could pay them for their beans. The new equipment and methods allowed the growers to liberate themselves from the prevailing local system of selling their raw commodity cheaply to traders. Instead, Rugasira paid 70 percent more -- about 60 cents a pound, as his company got under way -- for a product that could go on to satisfy elite markets and that he planned to roast and sell in a sector, he pointed out to me repeatedly, worth billions.
When he was three years out of the University of London, where his family sent him for college, Rugasira heard a radio show that led him to start his first company. After graduating with a degree in law and economics, he worked for a research institute in Kampala, studying the impact of World Bank trade-liberalization policies, before taking over the chalk factory when his father died. But the factory was being forced out of business by Chinese imports. Then, on his car radio one Sunday, he heard a Ugandan promoter declare that he wanted to bring the South African reggae star Lucky Dube to Kampala for a concert.
Dube, Rugasira explained, was a world-class musician, and Kampala concerts were slapdash affairs at the time, in the early '90s, with minor bands and makeshift staging. ''I thought, No way can you bring Lucky Dube with the way you've been doing things,'' he recounted. ''No, I'm going to try to bring Lucky Dube, and I'm going to do it right.''
After persuading a Zimbabwean friend to put him in touch with Dube's management team, he flew to South Africa and sat down with the star's people. They were impressed by his promises and asked about his track record. He told them he did some promoting in England. In fact, he and a few university buddies staged a single concert during his third-year exam week; they figured everyone would want a break from studying and that the auditorium they rented would be thronged. About 25 people showed up. But no matter: he got his fellow impresarios from that event to fax letters about his promotional skills to Dube's handlers, and Dube signed on. Rugasira borrowed money from family and ran overdrafts at two banks to put on three packed shows with giant screens and explosions of smoke and V.I.P. tents, shows advertised with radio spots featuring a woman divorcing her husband over his failure to buy Lucky Dube tickets, shows that sparked a major change in the local concert scene and that taught Rugasira a lesson in ''capitalizing on the intangible,'' on his own resolve.
When Bill Clinton paid a presidential visit to Uganda four years later, in 1998, Rugasira's flourishing events-and-marketing company was chosen to provide the stages, lighting and sound for three Clinton speeches. ''Ah, man!'' Rugasira said. ''The sheer resources deployed! Uganda had never seen aircraft that carry limousines, that carry helicopters. It was a sobering exposure to the power disparity, the power dynamic between two states. But mostly this was a chance for me to be a host. And to learn.'' He reported to the presidential advance team and worked under the watch of the Secret Service. ''It was something else -- the methodical attention to detail. I relished the opportunity to operate at that level.''
Having reached that height, though, he began to feel he'd lost his way. His wife, Jackie -- with whom he has five children -- talked to him relentlessly about ''internal prosperity,'' as opposed to the kind of prosperity he was hustling to attain. He felt ''constantly bombarded with images of squalor, of despair, in the neighborhoods and suburbs of Kampala.'' He subjected himself to ''a robust critique,'' he said. ''I was born in a Christian home. I moved away from that in my university years. Now I found myself going back to my faith.'' In 2003, Rugasira sold his business and used the proceeds -- along with a loan taken out against his house -- to found his coffee company.
Between the thousands of Kasese area farmers with their small orchards of waxy-leaved Arabica coffee trees and his dream of a Kampala factory, he felt that coffee was the perfect way to combine the motives of personal profit and wider good. Africa supplies about one-tenth of the world's trade in raw beans, mostly of low quality. His company would be a luminous symbol of the continent's ability to rise, to compete: ''We're battling the idea of Africa being a backward, primordial society with nothing going for it, a continent of conflict, a continent just begging for handouts, a basket case.''
Quickly, with their enhanced yields and the price Rugasira was paying for their beans, the farmers saw their incomes climb, but to keep buying from them, he needed to find markets for his product. And by the middle of 2004, with his family's home on the line, he began to panic.
He flew yet again to London, though this time, after the first two failed trips, he switched tactics; a distributor he knew in South Africa put him in touch with a British distributor named David Fine. ''This was around the time of Bob Geldof shouting, 'Give money!' '' Fine told me, thinking back to the rock-star-led cry for African rescue that would reach one of its periodic peaks at the G8 summit in 2005, in Scotland.
''Every society that has prospered has done it through trade and not aid,'' Rugasira told Fine when they met in London. Rugasira touched on Asia in recent decades. ''Africa will be no different. Charity doesn't incentivize. It stifles innovation. It causes chronic dependency. Africa's contribution to global trade is 1 percent. If that were just 2 percent, the increase would bring far more annual revenue to the continent than all the aid Africa receives in a year.'' Rugasira pledged to channel half of his eventual profits into more equipment and training for the farmers and to basic educational programs like ''financial literacy'' to bolster the village banks, but perhaps most thrilling to Fine was the contrast between Rugasira's message and Geldof's or Bono's. ''Here was Andrew saying, 'Aid is not the panacea,' '' Fine recalled.
Twenty-three of the world's 25 poorest countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, where half the population lives on less than $1.25 a day, and the continent's resistance to economic development can be as puzzling to experts as how the fields above Kasese remained unterraced for so long. Standing on one side of a heated debate about how best to help is the economist Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University's Earth Institute. Sachs argues that the forces of private enterprise can't bring significant development to sub-Saharan Africa unless unprecedented international assistance establishes a better foundation of infrastructure, education and health care. On the opposite side are William Easterly, a professor of economics at New York University who served for many years at the World Bank, and Dambisa Moyo, a Zambian economist and younger World Bank veteran, whose book ''Dead Aid'' was a best seller a few years ago. They lament that philanthropy to Africa has barely any record of success, that trillions given since the end of colonialism has accomplished next to nothing. Worse, in Moyo's eyes, it has instilled a kind of continental passivity, undercutting entrepreneurial ambition.
Despite Rugasira's words, his company is not purely aid-free. Investors can be all but impossible to find for African ventures, so over the years about one-eighth of the funds used to get Good African going have come from the United States Agency for International Development. In addition, Rugasira's pitch can sound like a roundabout appeal to altruistic rather than capitalist impulses: sell this coffee in your stores because it is the right thing to do. He offers no muscular advantage in price -- like the kind derived from Asia's cheap, efficient labor in clothes or computer parts. And his coffee's distinction in flavor, however lovely, is relatively subtle: citrus accents arising from Rwenzori soil and elevations.
So what real meaning can a company like Good African hold for the continent's economic development and competitiveness? Easterly -- whose research, in collaboration with the University of Virginia economist Ariell Reshef, has examined Rugasira's company -- emphasizes that stark advantages and outsize triumphs, like China's, aren't necessary to the success of individual businesses or to pushing Africa forward. He stresses that merely reaching the market and holding your own there can be a major victory for a company like Good African, not only because the brand may grow gradually but also because when it comes to African enterprise as a whole, the continent needs to prove, for starters, that in the world of business, it can just coexist. Sachs adds that what's termed ''the Asian miracle'' began with lesser-known progress in low-level commercial farming. This is the very thing Good African is fostering around Kasese. And as for the moral elements in Rugasira's pitch, it doesn't take an economist to point out that an inspiriting message can be a strong capitalist tool.
Listening to Rugasira's faith in profit-driven metamorphosis, Fine was moved -- ''you see the belief this man has'' -- and he thought the message might stir others. He also recognized that here, in the selling of finished goods, was something potentially far more significant than the ''fair trade'' purchasing of third-world beans that the coffee giants like to announce as a feel-good ploy on their packaging. A few weeks later, one of Fine's colleagues contacted Rugasira in Uganda with the news that a buyer at Waitrose was willing to see him. Rugasira got back on a plane, walked into the chain's corporate headquarters and delivered the pitch he'd made to Fine.
''I told myself, Don't fidget. Though I don't anyway. I thought, No sudden moves,'' Rugasira recounted. ''I'm an African businessman. To counter the preconceptions, my etiquette, my preparedness, must be perfect. What general perception do people have of Africa? Corruption, H.I.V., genocide, celebrities fighting for dying children. I have to be an ambassador to turn the perception around. There's no room for error.''
The meeting lasted 15 minutes. He left some coffee behind for sampling. ''We'll get back to you,'' he was told. He flew home.
Then the chain asked for another meeting at its headquarters and, a month later, another. Now Rugasira was missing payments at his bank and receiving letters from the bank's lawyers that grew more and more threatening. It wasn't until his 12th London trip that he won Waitrose's commitment.
He had no budget for advertising, so he wrote an op-ed for The Guardian, pushing his product along with his belief in Africa's economic viability. But Waitrose alone couldn't keep the company afloat, couldn't allow Rugasira to continue purchasing all that the farmers could grow or save his house. A coffee shop he and Jackie opened in Kampala, to take advantage of the city's fledgling interest in cafes, wasn't enough help. And his vision of a Kampala roasting factory remained a fantasy. Good African came in upbeat yellow packs that bore the brand's continent-shaped logo, but the coffee was being roasted and packaged in Ireland.
He needed another retailer. After an agonizingly long courtship, a buyer at Sainsbury's, a much bigger British chain, sent an e-mail one night in 2007 saying that the corporation wasn't interested in selling Rugasira's coffee. Seeing his company as all but dead and his house as all but gone, Rugasira knelt and prayed on the floor of his Kampala office. Next, in a frenzy, he got hold of the e-mail address for Sainsbury's chief executive and typed out his dreams to a man he'd never met. Almost dizzy with fervor, he clicked send. He reread his words and discovered typos. Frantically he tried to recall the message.
In three weeks' time, a reply arrived from the C.E.O.'s assistant: ''We are planning an autumn launch'' of Good African Coffee.
Wearing a white lab coat, Donald Isingoma, a roaster at Good African's factory in Kampala, listened for the second crackle of the cooking beans. He stood beside the machinery, the hulking black cylinder of the roasting drum, the hoppers and the degasser, that Rugasira was at last able to buy -- used, in Turkey -- and set into operation two and a half years ago.
Just after the second crackle, Isingoma released the beans into a cooling bed. ''Roasting is an art,'' Ransley Sokia, the factory's manager, said proudly. When I visited the factory in December, he led me through a chipped wooden door to where two white-coated young women, Faith Asagi and Beatrice Atim, work at a simple Formica counter, performing what's known in the business as cupping. In loud, aspirating snarfs, the delicate-looking pair slurp up tablespoons of coffee to distinguish flavors and guide the roasters. ''Sometimes I taste some apricot,'' Asagi said, her eyes bright. ''I'm like, Wow, when I find that.''
At one end of the factory floor, a modest packaging machine -- bought used, in China -- expels eye-catching packs of coffee onto a short conveyor belt. Unlike the packs of most upscale brands, Rugasira's don't have folding fasteners or Ziploc seals for easy reclosing. For that, he would need an additional $400,000 -- the company's 2011 gross revenue was $1.2 million -- to buy a better machine.
Since Good African's start, Rugasira has been trying to break into American stores. (America's specialty-coffee consumption outstrips Britain's, yet he initially concentrated on England, because it felt familiar from his college years.) The U.S. market, he said, ''seemed a monstrous labyrinth.'' But in 2009, through its African outreach program, the Willow Creek Community Church in suburban Chicago, one of America's most powerful mainstream megachurches, invited Rugasira to address its annual leadership summit. Soon after his factory opened, he told Good African's story and gave his sermon in front of 7,200 in Willow Creek's indoor stadium and more than 20,000 by simulcast: ''A lot of people with their hearts in the right places advocate aid, because they somehow believe that through handouts they're going to bring about change. But how can that be?'' His voice leapt with incredulity. ''Look at the United States -- 200 years of trade-generated growth and prosperity. Look at China. Trade is the only sustainable way to take societies out of poverty.'' Sitting in an upper tier, Jerry Kehe, a church elder who had just retired as head of one of the largest distributorships that trucked goods to American supermarkets, was rapt. The next day Kehe drove Rugasira to see the company's headquarters -- ''an eight-mile conveyor system!'' Rugasira marveled to me -- where the current C.E.O., who also heard his speech, declared, ''We just feel we need to do something about this.''
Through the distribution company's influence, Rugasira recently won shelf space in two Midwestern chains. The distributorship is also selling Good African online, with promotional support from an organization of African-American churches he has long been wooing. In 2012, Rugasira expects to sell $2 million worth of coffee -- around 200,000 pounds -- here and in the U.K. and through a newly signed deal in Austria. For the first time, Good African will turn a profit.
Two million dollars represents a speck of the world's market in packaged specialty coffee. But that speck may also symbolize a bit of hope for sub-Saharan Africa. Whether Rugasira is right in the part of his thinking that condemns aid, or whether Sachs is correct in viewing tremendous assistance as crucial, the continent may be inching upward. Many of its nations, including Uganda, have seen surges of 5 percent or more in their gross-domestic products during the last eight years. The increases are dismissed by some because they may largely reflect the export of natural resources like oil rather than the creation of goods, like Rugasira's. Still, a recent McKinsey & Company analysis made the case that the figures are signs of true change. The report emphasized the growing number of Africans with at least some disposable income, purchasing power that is spurring the expansion of businesses. This expansion could lead, ultimately, to a proliferation of exports to the first world, trade that is essential to serious advancement.
One day in Kampala, I went with Rugasira to a conference of about 50 Ugandan entrepreneurs, from a mobile-phone magnate to the owner of a lone dry-cleaning shop. There I met a sprightly 29-year-old, Ashish J. Thakkar, who is about to open call centers in Kampala and across Africa. Thakkar's family is Indian and has been living in Uganda for a century, beginning as petty traders. He quit school at 15 to test his prowess at importing electronics. Several businesses later, he is setting out to lure the patronage of huge Western corporations from the call centers of India and the Philippines to his own outfits. The actual luring is a phase or two away; first he'll establish a track record by serving African cellphone companies. His strategy might seem far-fetched, except that Thakkar's previous endeavors have made him many millions. And if he succeeds, it will mean a boon to Africa in tens of thousands of jobs and an assumption that the continent's people are capable of professional competence.
In Katabukenene, a village perched on a ridge above Kasese that is among the most productive in Rugasira's network, growers showed me that since his arrival they have been able to replace their mud huts with ample brick and zinc houses. They are raising pigs, adding meat to their diet. One man has bought a blue motorcycle, a well-polished machine on a hill with no other vehicle in sight. Lately the villagers have sent two of their young women to train as nurses. A teenage son of one prolific grower -- a grower whose earnings have gone from around $250 a year in 2004 to $3,500 now -- said that he had no intention of becoming a farmer himself. He plans to be an engineer.
Rugasira gathered a meeting of 40 of Katabukenene's farmers. They are among 14,000 who these days supply Good African, many selling Rugasira one or two 220-pound sacks per season, some bringing in up to a dozen. The men and women sat on a low wall outside the shed where they process their beans. The landscape of Arabicas and plantain trees fell away behind them; the village seemed suspended in air. Rugasira announced that their coffee was now in the United States, and he described the three high-speed processing stations, driven by small electrical generators, that he would soon introduce in their village and in two other spots in the hills. They would in part substitute for the hand-cranked pulpers and cumbersome method of soaking. All would be a little more industrial, a lot more efficient. Wearing a dusty blazer, a grower touched his head and smiled in astonishment. ''I am trying to imagine it,'' he said.
And in Britain and America, meanwhile, Rugasira works to nurture his speck of a company. In lieu of advertising, he sometimes loiters in the aisles of the stores that carry his brand. He shifts the packs to an eye-level shelf or casually asks shoppers: ''Have you tried this coffee? I hear it's really good. It's from Africa.''

HEADLINE: Latin American Markets Aim for a New Decade of Gains

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
STOCK markets in much of the world may have suffered a lost decade, but there was much to gain by investing in Latin America.
A vigorous and persistent economic and political renaissance, especially in Brazil, produced annualized returns of 17.1 percent for funds that focus on the region during the 10 years through March, including a 13.3 percent return in the first quarter of this year.
Another decade like that may be too much to hope for, and fund managers who concentrate on emerging economies highlight a handful of potential challenges for Latin American markets. The markets can be volatile too; they fell sharply in 2008 and more moderately in 2011. Still, continued success is widely expected for the region and for investors who keep their money there for the long haul. 
Rick Schmidt, a manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets fund, attributed the run of phenomenal performance to ''two and a half stories.'' One is sustained, strong economic growth across the developing world. Significant growth of another sort -- in democratic political institutions and sound economic management -- was an even greater contributor to success, in his view.
''The countries that made changes to more open markets and to developing their middle class saw the greatest returns,'' Mr. Schmidt said.
His other favorable circumstance, or half of one, was a lucky coincidence. The economic and currency crisis that began in Asia in 1997 moved on to Russia a year later and then to Latin America. Markets there bottomed almost exactly 10 years ago, he noted, making the returns since then look especially robust.
Gonzalo Pangaro, head of the emerging-markets group at T. Rowe Price, also mentioned improvement in leadership in Latin America, and said it extended from government ministries to corporate boardrooms.
''Most governments, including the key ones in Brazil and Mexico, have implemented very sensible macroeconomic policies -- fiscal prudence, controlling inflation -- and public companies tend to be of very good quality,'' he said. ''The quality of management and protection of minority shareholders are right up there, and growth opportunities are as good as you can find in some of the fast-growing Asian countries.''
The healthy increase in profits at Latin American companies has kept valuations reasonable, even as markets have continued to soar. Stocks in Brazil, the region's dominant market, recently traded at about 10 times earnings, compared with a multiple of about 13 for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the United States.
Good management is crucial for maintaining robust profits, and so are good customers. Fund managers find plenty of those in Latin America, where growing demand for products and services from increasingly well-off people is helping to transform economies and businesses.
''Seventy percent of Brazil is middle class or higher, and they're active consumers,'' said William Landers, manager of the BlackRock Latin America fund.
Many of investors' favored stocks in the region are of companies that cater to consumer needs and wants, particularly Brazilian banks and real estate developers. Housing is in short supply in Brazil, portfolio managers say, and a government program in which employers make regular contributions to subsidize employees' mortgages should keep demand high for homes and financing.
Mr. Landers likes Banco Itau and the home builder PDG Realty, which he credits with having ''one of the better managements in the sector.''
Mr. Schmidt, meanwhile, holds Itau and one of its main rivals, Banco Bradesco. Mr. Pangaro casts a third vote for Brazilian banks, especially Itau, which he called ''a very well-run bank with very good profitability.''
Jonas Krumplys, manager of the Ivy Asset Strategy New Opportunities fund, holds a broad range of stocks tied to Brazilian real estate, including home builders and developers of shopping malls and warehouses. One company outside Brazil that he expects to benefit from the expansion of the Latin American middle class is Copa Airlines, which is doing brisk business flying passengers between North and South America via its base in Panama.
Apart from banks, Mr. Schmidt recommends the brewers Ambev of Brazil and Femsa of Mexico, along with Coca-Cola Femsa, an affiliate of Femsa and Coca-Cola.
One sector not on managers' favored list is telecommunications. Use of cellphones and the Internet is much lower in Latin America than in mature economies, leaving great scope for growth, but managers find too many companies competing to offer services.
As for the two Brazilian commodity producers that are the largest contributors to regional stock indexes -- the oil company Petrobras and the iron ore mining company CVRD -- investors tend to be indifferent. Although Mr. Pangaro considers Petrobras stock as inexpensive, the two stocks are widely seen as vulnerable to a slowdown in global growth.
Investment advisers agree that Latin America has made spectacular progress in the last 10 to 20 years and, with exceptions, has recovered from the instability that once plagued the region. They caution, though, that investors may still face challenges in coming months, though of the run-of-the-mill variety that afflict economies and markets everywhere.
Inflation has been about 5 percent a year in Brazil. That is nothing like the rates in the 1980s, when they reached percentages in the tens of thousands, but Mr. Landers cited mounting concern that politics, not just economics, would begin to guide decisions by Brazil's central bank, leading to lax monetary policy.
The concern may be justified, given history, but he said he expected inflation -- and central bankers -- to remain well behaved.
The Brazilians ''have worked so hard to get where they are,'' he said. ''If inflation comes back, the whole domestic growth trend starts to go the other way, the middle class loses purchasing power and the domestic growth story is called into question.''
Mr. Krumplys is less optimistic that the problem can be sidestepped.
''Brazil is probably going to have an inflation problem in the second half of this year,'' he predicted.
He identified several chronic impediments to long-term progress in Brazil, too, including high tax rates, deficient transportation and other infrastructure and a poor education system.
AS worrisome as such developments might be, however, Latin America is on such a roll that having them lurking in investors' thoughts could prove beneficial -- by providing a vital measure of perspective and humility.
''The real domestic worry would be hubris, getting too successful and blowing what they made in the past,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''That's what always destroys markets. They get overstretched; they push themselves. They think the rules don't apply to them and they go for too much growth. That never ends well.''

HEADLINE: Emerging-Market Bonds Quench a Yield Thirst

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
MUTUAL funds investing in emerging-market bonds have lately captured a frothy river of new customer cash.
With the measly yields now offered on presumably safer bonds, like United States Treasuries, savers are seeking more appealing sources of income. And in the first quarter this year, the average emerging-bond fund tracked by Morningstar returned 7 percent, versus 0.3 percent for the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.
But this combination -- a surge in popularity for emerging-market bonds on top of a strong performance run -- has some analysts wondering if investors are smartly diversifying or foolishly ramping up risk. ''I worry that people are desperate for yield and are chasing performance,'' said Tom Roseen, a senior analyst at Lipper.
Still, in some ways, the popularity of emerging-market bond funds may be overdue. Handled prudently, these markets' debt can add diversification to portfolios. And bond issuers -- countries and companies -- in developing markets are maturing. By some measures, their bonds look more attractive than those of the developed world. 
''The relative risk of emerging markets compared with developed markets has changed,'' said Campbell R. Harvey, a professor of international business at Duke University.
The average debt level of emerging-market countries like Brazil and China is far lower than that of developed ones like the United States and Japan, Professor Harvey said. In addition, emerging economies have continued to surge, even as much of the developed world keeps struggling with the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Today, emerging markets represent about one-third of world G.D.P., and that share should increase in coming decades, he said.
Professor Harvey said he could thus see average investors putting as much as a quarter of a fixed-income portfolio in an emerging-market bond fund or exchange-traded fund. Not all analysts suggest quite so big a bet, but many say people should consider increasing their investment in emerging-market debt because of the diversification benefit.
Too many people shy from investing any money abroad and thus limit their diversification, said Christopher B. Philips, a senior investment analyst at Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group. ''It's the home bias -- investors are more willing to hold domestic securities,'' he said. ''The average person holds less than 10 percent of their fixed-income portfolio in foreign bonds.''
A recent Vanguard study found that investors could benefit from allocating at least 20 to 40 percent of their fixed-income holdings to international bonds. Emerging-market bonds could be part of that allocation for risk-tolerant investors, Mr. Philips said.
Of course, emerging-market bonds -- and the mutual funds that invest in them -- still carry perils aplenty. Issuers in emerging markets pay better because they have to: the extra money compensates investors for the greater chance of loss. ''Their yields are higher because the risk is higher,'' said Scott A. Richardson, an accounting professor at the London Business School. ''Yields reflect risks: bonds that have higher yields are riskier bonds.''
Besides usual worries about rising interest rates and bankruptcies, managers investing in emerging-market bonds face risks from government policies, liquidity crises and currency fluctuations. Even if a manager chose, say, the right Brazilian corporate bond, one of those risks could sap its return. Bad policies might lead to high inflation, which erodes bond values, or a bond market might seize up at a time of financial stress.
Over the last several decades, financial crises have repeatedly battered emerging markets. The 1990s were particularly tumultuous. A disaster occurred in Mexico in 1994, when the government devalued the peso. In 1997, the ''Asian financial flu'' broke out, and in 1998 came Russia's devaluation of the ruble, and a default on its debts.
Given such history, it should be no surprise that returns of emerging-market bond funds can be volatile, more than those of funds investing in, say, United States Treasuries. In 2008, all emerging-market bond funds followed by Morningstar lost money, said David I. Falkof, a Morningstar analyst.
''An emerging-market bond fund, managed by a good manager, can add value to an investor's portfolio,'' he said. ''But you have to have the right expectations. If you can't handle short-term volatility, it doesn't make sense. If you're a long-term investor and can tolerate that, it can.''
Some fund companies offer two types of emerging-market bond funds: those that invest mainly in bonds issued in United States dollars and those that invest mainly in bonds issued in local currencies. Pimco, for example, has one of each: its Emerging Markets Bond fund and its Emerging Local Bond fund.
''Both of these strategies invest in emerging-market bonds, but the first does it in dollars, so its total return will be directly influenced by U.S. interest rates,'' said Michael A. Gomez, manager of both funds. In contrast, the local-currency fund lets investors diversify away from the dollar, which they would want to do if they believed that the currency was going to weaken, he said.
Other companies offer a single fund but give their managers great flexibility in moving back and forth between dollar- and locally denominated bonds. The Fidelity New Markets Income fund fits into this category, though the manager, John A. Carlson, favors dollar bonds because their returns tend to be less volatile than those of local bonds.
''I limit myself to no more than 20 percent nondollar bonds and 20 percent corporate bonds,'' he said. The fund returned an annualized average of 11.2 percent over the 15 years ended March 31, versus 9.9 percent for the average emerging-markets bond fund followed by Morningstar. Mr. Carlson has managed the fund since 1995.
Michael J. Conelius, manager of the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Bond fund, also has freedom to roam. In Brazil, for example, he has lately favored local sovereign bonds but dollar-denominated corporates. ''Local-currency corporates exist in Brazil, but the market isn't very deep,'' he said. In a less mature economy, he might stick with dollar issues.
Among funds tracked by Morningstar, there are no index mutual funds for emerging-market bonds, though Vanguard has said it will introduce one later this year. Index E.T.F.'s investing in emerging-market bonds are available. One, from iShares, invests in an index of dollar bonds -- its J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond fund -- and another invests in local bonds -- its Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond fund, which tracks the Barclays Capital Emerging Markets Broad Local Currency Bond Index. InvescoPowerShares provides an indexed dollar-bond E.T.F. called the Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt Portfolio, which follows Deutsche Bank's Emerging Market USD Liquid Balanced Index.
Paul J. Chew, head of investments at Brown Advisory in Baltimore, said his money-management company is increasingly steering clients into emerging-market bonds. Even so, he urged caution. ''Emerging markets have been very volatile and will most likely remain very volatile until they have a lot of local investors,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Still Crawling Out Of a Very Deep Hole

BYLINE: By TERESA TRITCH

 BODY:
The employment report for March, released Friday, was a big disappointment. After three straight months of job gains above 200,000, only 120,000 new jobs were added last month.
Of course, one month's data does not a trend make. But March's reversal is a painful reminder that nearly three years into the expansion, the recovery has been a climb toward the rim of the crater left by the Great Recession, not an ascent to new economic heights. As the graphs with this piece show, the deepest deficits are in those areas that matter most to most Americans: jobs and home equity.
That has left Americans wondering when, or if, the recovery will translate into broad prosperity, and policy makers looking either to take credit for gains so far or to assign blame for continued hard times. 
What distinguishes this jobs recovery from others is the sheer scale of the job loss that preceded it. The economy has regained 3.6 million jobs since employment hit bottom in February 2010, but it is still missing nearly 10 million jobs -- 5.2 million lost in the recession and 4.7 million needed to employ new entrants to the labor market. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that at the average rate of job creation in the last three months, it would take until the end of 2017, fully 10 years from the start of the Great Recession in December 2007, to return to the prerecession jobless rate of 5 percent.
And there is no guarantee we will ever get there. It took about four years to close the job gaps created by the recessions that began in mid-1981 and mid-1990. In the tepid expansion after the 2001 recession, the job gap had still not closed by 2007.
Without good jobs, families certainly can't power the economy with spending. Incomes always fall in recessions, but they usually rebound and then reach a new high. That didn't happen after the 2001 recession. Analysis of government data by Moody's Analytics shows that median household income, in 2011 dollars, peaked at $56,000 in 2000, and did not rebound to that level. When the Great Recession hit, income fell again. Though there has been some progress in the last two years, median income, now at $52,000, is about where it was in 1997.
At the same time, home equity -- for most families, the most important store of wealth -- has been devastated by the housing bust, with $7.4 trillion wiped out since home prices peaked in 2006. Nascent signs of life in the spring selling season are welcome, but it will take a far stronger economy, or far more aggressive antiforeclosure efforts, to substantially rebuild lost equity anytime soon. Even at that, many of the nearly 12 million homeowners who owe more on their mortgages than the homes are worth will never get above water.
Without a revival in jobs, income and home equity, other indicators of recovery -- like a rising stock market and more consumer spending -- largely reflect gains among the top echelon of earners. Such lopsided growth can make for good numbers, but doesn't presage broadly higher living standards.
So how to nurture the recovery, such as it is? If long-term unemployment remains high through 2012, Congress will need to renew federal jobless benefits beyond their expiration at the end of the year. If incomes and spending remain constrained, tax relief for low- and middle-income earners will also need to be extended. The high-end Bush-era tax cuts should be allowed to expire, with the money going toward programs that have more economic impact. Congress, which has committed to deficit reduction starting in 2013, must avoid heedless cuts, in favor of minimal and balanced tax increases and spending reductions. And the Federal Reserve must resist calls for premature tightening.
To oppose such basic measures is to deny reality. The current recovery is largely the result of support from Congress and the Federal Reserve. A self-reinforcing, virtuous cycle of growth has yet to take firm hold, and until it does, the need for help remains.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Changing Our Car Culture

 BODY:
Readers debate how best to reduce our use of cars and gas.
The Letter
To the Editor:
Americans pay too little for gasoline and diesel, and our subsequent driving of 2.9 trillion miles annually is a key factor in our trade deficit, military excursions, health and obesity crisis, air and water pollution, and greenhouse emissions. We keep hoping to defeat congestion by building highways -- a counterproductive proposition. The United States enjoys the second-lowest gasoline prices in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development after oil-exporting Mexico and, adjusted for inflation, we don't pay that much more than what our grandparents paid in the 1920s.
While oil worldwide costs the same, other nations put higher fees on gasoline and diesel consumption. Japan's high gas taxes make its 127 million people a huge test market for energy efficiency, while our lower taxes cajoled Detroit into selling gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s.
Of course, decreasing driving in a culture famed for its ''love affair with the automobile'' is difficult. No one, yet everyone, is to blame for our national default position of key in the ignition to get anywhere, everywhere and -- often -- nowhere. Our politicians are not willing to tell us the most inconvenient of inconvenient truths. 
If we'd use our cars smarter, we'd mitigate a host of problems and prevent our grandchildren from following our children in fighting wars in the Middle East.
To begin using our cars intelligently rather than habitually, we need a rational federal gasoline ''user fee'' rolled in slowly over a decade.
It's time politicians led an adult conversation with America.
RANDY SALZMAN Charlottesville, Va., April 3, 2012
The writer, a transportation demand management researcher, is writing a book, ''Yes We Can: Getting Americans to Back Away From the Steering Wheel.''
Readers React
Mr. Salzman calls for politicians to lead ''an adult conversation with America'' on intelligent versus habitual motor vehicle use. When, pray tell, over the last 40 years, have politicians been able to lead any intelligent conversation on issues related to energy, technology and society? And does this proposed conversation take us down the road to a ''user fee'' or a tax that is sure to penalize most those Americans who have the least ability to pay it?
Our unique long history with the car has made personal, flexible transportation and perceptions of freedom and autonomy as American as the Fourth of July. It is true that our reliance on the car and fossil fuels is out of balance, but the widespread diffusion of this technology is also in part responsible for the remarkable prosperity and opportunities we have enjoyed.
The key to our future is not to conflate the car with fossil fuel use. Plug-in hybrids give us the thrills and autonomy of personal transportation, while diminishing our energy consumption.
Changing our culture concerning electric cars and plug-ins will ultimately prove to be more decisive in our transition to a cleaner and healthier environment than a tax imposed by politicians who often serve special interests.
JOHN HEITMANN Dayton, Ohio, April 5, 2012
The writer is a professor of history at the University of Dayton and the author of ''The Automobile and American Life.''
The automobile has been around on a commercial basis for approximately 100 years but is unlikely to survive for another century. Congestion, energy scarcity, deteriorating infrastructure, fatalities and numerous other problems are prompting a transition.
The challenge for coming decades is not to electrify the vehicle fleet, as some suggest, but to retrofit our communities to render the automobile irrelevant. Indeed, car use is already on the decline. The streetscape is being reappropriated in many cities for nonmotorized activities, and younger drivers are forsaking vehicle trips in favor of smartphones and other means of ''virtual mobility.'' A growing proportion of 17- and 18-year-olds is not even bothering to get a driver's license.
This trend is apparent in most wealthy countries. It has, for instance, become increasingly common in Japan to speak of ''kuruma banare,'' which can be roughly translated as ''walking away from the car.'' We may have already begun to reach the end of the automobile era.
MAURIE J. COHEN Princeton, N.J., April 4, 2012
The writer is an associate professor of environmental policy and sustainability at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
Mr. Salzman's plan to impose a federal gasoline ''user fee'' would disproportionately affect those of us who live in less dense residential communities -- call it urban sprawl if you will -- common in Western states, where public transportation is not an alternative. I find it troubling that there is so much talk about punitive taxation intended to change the habits of the population without any regard to what this means for real people living in the world as it is right now, not some idealized future.
Has anyone considered what effect this ''user fee'' would have on the consumer's ability to spend on other goods and services? Or what effect it would have on the housing market in car-dependent communities like mine?
Finally, Mr. Salzman, have you ever waited for the bus when it's 110 degrees in the shade?
LINDA WENDLER Apache Junction, Ariz., April 3, 2012
Many Americans seem to forget that our driving culture did not come about as a result of free-market forces or accident, but because of government policies favoring the automobile.
In the early 1900s, the United States had the best public transportation system in the world, with intercity passenger trains that ran faster than the ones we have today and electric interurban railways all over the country.
But after World War II, state and local governments began carving out former farmland and wilderness and turning them into auto-dependent suburbs, and the federal government built the Interstate highway system. Railroads mostly had to fend for themselves, and passenger rail declined as a result. Today, the main reason that people drive and fly everywhere is because they have no other transportation mode.
Meanwhile, people in developed countries that kept their public transit systems -- particularly Japan and Western European countries -- are noticeably thinner than Americans and have lower carbon footprints, and their cities are far more convenient to navigate. Lowering our national carbon footprint, reducing our trade deficits and reducing obesity start with reducing our need to drive.
ALARIC DeARMENT Brooklyn, April 4, 2012
I don't own a car and haven't since January 2007. It's the only New Year's resolution I can remember keeping for any appreciable length of time. I don't buy gas or car insurance. I never get speeding or parking tickets, and I don't worry about noises under the hood or dings in the windshield.
When I stopped being a habitual driver, I dropped about 10 pounds. I started taking the bus to and from work, and walking all over Bangor, Me., where I live. Surprisingly, I didn't lose much freedom of mobility. I can still go where I want, when I want, most of the time. The exceptions are evening events in outlying areas after the buses stop running. But do those few events justify supporting an automobile 365 days a year?
I've raised and supported children, and car ownership has all the same financial obligations but few of the rewards. Unlike children, cars do not get smarter as they get older. They do not become skilled at taking care of themselves. They may not argue with you, but they will, at inopportune times, refuse to do what they are told.
Suddenly, I had money to dine out, to buy a new guitar, to visit New York. The American Automobile Association estimates the average annual cost of owning a car at $9,000. The occasional cab fare or car rental is a bargain by comparison.
HENRY GARFIELD Bangor, Me., April 5, 2012
Mr. Salzman may be leading us in the wrong direction. With such a vast country, our ''love affair with the automobile'' should really be considered a necessity. To be honest, we are not going to be able to reverse that any time soon.
However, a trip with a ''smarter car'' is clearly indicated. What about the superb cars that American companies design and build, but sadly are available only outside the country? Ford especially is providing vehicles that regularly get about 70 miles per gallon, with low carbon dioxide outputs. And many other manufacturers are following suit.
Perhaps the question should be reframed. Instead of questioning our addiction to cars, we should ask, Why are we addicted to wasting oil?
BARRY GILES Watsonville, Calif., April 4, 2012
The writer is the founder of BuildingWise, which promotes energy efficiency.
I couldn't have said it better than Mr. Salzman: ''Our subsequent driving of 2.9 trillion miles annually is a key factor in our trade deficit, military excursions, health and obesity crisis, air and water pollution, and greenhouse emissions.''
Well, I might add a few other things to this list, including the slow decline of once-vibrant downtown commercial centers, replaced by big-box megastores like Walmart and Home Depot that have popped up at the edges of these towns thanks to Interstate highways.
Not only has this trend of decentralized commerce led to the demise of the familiar ''mom and pop'' store, but it has also resulted in out-of-control urban sprawl that has contributed to those social and environmental ills described by Mr. Salzman.
The combustible engine is truly the scourge of modern society.
MIKE JOHNSON Ipswich, Mass., April 4, 2012
The Writer Responds
While I haven't waited for a bus in 110 degrees, Ms. Wendler, I have bicycled and drilled for oil in similar temperatures. And my son has fought in 110 degrees in Middle Eastern wars with connections to oil.
National good, I submit, should overcome personal convenience. Since several politicians, as well as the auto executive William Ford, suggested rational gasoline taxing 25 years ago, our failure to do so has had huge consequences, including the disconnected suburbs and the decline of ''mom and pop'' stores cited by Mr. DeArment and Mr. Johnson.
With American political leadership best defined as ''getting in front of whatever way the parade is going,'' Professor Heitmann is right: politicians haven't led. However, smarter taxing dedicated to mass transit actually helps the poor. Two-thirds of American families that use mass transit earn less than $50,000. Yet half of transit companies raised fares and 71 percent added fuel surcharges last year.
Rational gasoline taxing would provide dollars to improve alternative transportation while boosting hybrid and electric sales more than subsidies do.
Since the Arab oil embargos of the 1970s, Americans are driving about a third more miles daily -- and we have fought in oil-producing countries while suffering the two worst offshore oil spills in history.
According to some transportation studies, it costs American society as much as 54 cents for every mile we drive in economic, environmental, health and foreign policy costs, and one analysis notes that we should be paying upwards of $10 a gallon to cover the true costs.

TIME TO START THINKING
America in the Age of Descent
By Edward Luce
291 pp.Atlantic Monthly Press. $26.
In 1990, Japan was at the peak of its prosperity. It seemed an unstoppable force. But the boom turned out to be a bubble. Remember MITI, Japan's economic planning agency? It's now defunct, but then it was the envy of ''competitiveness'' gurus the world over. MITI, plus public-private cooperation, plus thrifty citizens and dedicated workers, plus demanding schools and diligent students, plus a sheltered domestic economy, plus ferociously competitive exporters -- all worked together to create a new variety of capitalism, one destined to eat America's lunch. Or so it seemed.
If you stepped into any bookstore in Tokyo, however, you saw stacks, veritable towers, of a discordant book. ''The Sun Also Sets,'' by Bill Emmott, sold spectacularly in Japan. The Japanese felt that something was amiss; they (and Emmott, later the editor of The Economist) were right. 
So now, two Japanese lost decades later, a generation has passed. Again Americans are worried about decline; again we fear that an Asian economic superpower -- now China, of course, not Japan -- will eat our lunch. For those old enough to have lived through the competitiveness debate of 20 years ago, Edward Luce's new book, ''Time to Start Thinking: America in the Age of Descent,'' will seem awfully familiar.
As with Japan then, so with China today. Its advantages include a nimble government, a shrewd industrial policy, enormous investment in infrastructure, motivated and diligent students and workers, piles of savings. Meanwhile, the United States hobbles itself with laissez-faire dogma and /government-bashing ideology. America is hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs. Bad enough that we no longer have a shoe industry; worse yet that we are handing our competitors the industries of the future -- computer chips (a generation ago), clean energy (today). ''If America is to restore its competitiveness,'' Luce writes, ''it will need to do many things, few of which will be possible without a much more effective federal government. In today's world, smart government is a critical ingredient of national competitiveness. Unless America can address government's role in a more pragmatic light, it may doom itself to continued descent.''
Luce is British, but he has lived and worked in the United States for years (as a columnist for The Financial Times and a speechwriter in the Clinton administration's Treasury Department). He knows the country well, and he wishes it well, too. A result is that he leavens his yearning for smarter, more nimble government with a realism not always found among Europeans. He recognizes that the accumulation of interest groups guarding the status quo, and the remarkable increase in partisan polarization (especially on the right), are structural changes, difficult, at best, to reverse. No politician wielding cries of ''Change!'' -- whether that politician is named Obama or Gingrich -- can make decades' worth of governmental and political sclerosis go away.
So where does that leave the country? Not in a great place, if Luce is right. Jobs are disappearing, median household income is declining, skills are in short supply, health costs hobble competitiveness, outsourcing and offshoring and automation marginalize working-class men, and through it all political leaders either sit by helplessly or actively oppose remedies. And that's just in Chapter 1. Later sections bring us dysfunctional schools, demoralized government, burdensome debt and deficits, failing innovation, hidebound regulation, crumbling infrastructure, a paralyzed Congress, a broken campaign-finance system and more, much more.
Luce is a good writer with a vacuum-cleaner for a notebook. His book could not be bettered as a compendium of American problems, at least as filtered through the center-left sensibilities of a pro-American European. But a narrower, more focused approach would have gone a long way. As I marched through the list of failures and obstacles, I began to think a better title for the book might be ''Time to Start /Drinking.''
Still, out of Luce's mass of stuff, two parallel but distinct diagnoses of ''descent'' emerge. One is the case for American relative decline: relative to emerging economies in general, and especially relative to China. No one can doubt that this is happening. But can it be stopped? Not by nimble MITI-style bureaucrats collaborating closely with pliable private-/sector executives; that is not how America works, as Luce himself acknowledges. A generation ago, the journalist James Fallows got it right: If America rises to the Asian challenge, it will be by being ''more like us,'' not more like them.
In any case, China's relative economic rise is a good thing, certainly compared with the alternatives. True, China's geopolitical power will grow, and that will be a nuisance. If we want to worry, however, the more appropriate worry is not that China will succeed but that it will fail. As was true of Japan a generation ago, only much more so, China's obvious strengths cover underlying flaws and weaknesses. Its government is corrupt, rigid and (of course) authoritarian. Its economy is rife with politically imposed distortions. Its schools, like Japan's, rely heavily on rote instruction, good for playing economic catch-up but not so good for taking the lead. Its infrastructure buildup, also like Japan's, feeds on an unsustainable diet of political cronyism and environmental depredation. And its message to the rest of the world is less ''Give us your huddled masses'' than ''Give us your precious minerals.'' If I had to bet on one system being in decent working order a generation from now, it would be ours, not theirs.
No, this is not an argument for complacency. Luce is right: America's economy and political system are both in worse shape than they have been in a long time, and their dysfunctions seem to feed on one another. His more compelling case, and the country's bigger worry, concerns absolute decline.
True, declinism has been wrong in the past (and I was among those who said so). America has an almost miraculous capacity for self-renewal. Right?
This time, however, that's not so clear. In recent years, productivity improvements have decoupled from incomes, so that between 2000 and 2007, as the economist Robert J. Shapiro notes, ''for the first time on record, the incomes of most Americans stagnated or fell through ostensibly good times.'' Men have seen their earnings drop and have been withdrawing from the work force. Inequality has grown markedly, with not only the incomes but the lifestyles and lifetime prospects of the top and bottom bifurcating.
No one is really confident of what to do about these things, any one of which would be a challenge. Pile them atop one another, then layer over them the recession and a growing debt that will take years to dig out of, and spice liberally with political polarization and Republican looniness. Even optimists need to wonder if this time America is entering its own lost decade, or two.
For all its overkill, ''Time to Start Thinking'' raises the right questions at the right moment, which is what books are supposed to do. It deserves an audience in America. And I wouldn't be surprised, too, if it ends up stacked on the best-seller tables in China.

STRATEGIC VISION
America and the Crisis of Global Power
By Zbigniew Brzezinski
Illustrated. 208 pp. Basic Books. $26.
THE WORLD AMERICA MADE
By Robert Kagan
149 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $21.
Last fall, television stations carried a 60-second ad for Audi's A6 car. The opening images showed a pitted, potholed American road while the voice-over gloomily intoned, ''Across the nation, over 100,000 miles of highways and bridges are in disrepair.'' Fear not, said the voice; Audi's smart gizmos would help. The spot's message was clear: Roads in the United States are now so bad, you need a foreign car to negotiate them.
The Audi ad was seized upon as evidence of American decline, now such a regular meme that the Foreign Policy magazine Web site runs a dedicated blog, ''Decline Watch.'' Books have been in plentiful supply, and now come two more, helpfully approaching the subject from left and right, as if to demonstrate declinism's bipartisan credentials. 
The authors are big hitters in the geopolitics genre. Robert Kagan coined what passes for a catchphrase in the international relations field when he declared a decade ago that ''Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus.'' At the time, Kagan, a veteran of Ronald Reagan's State Department, was one of the leading advocates of military action against Iraq. Zbigniew Brzezinski, still best known for his service as national security adviser to Jimmy Carter, has filled the three intervening decades with a throng of books on the same terrain: what America should do in the world.
As you'd expect, there are big differences between the two. Kagan barely mentions the Iraq war in ''The World America Made,'' and certainly feels no need to explain his past enthusiasm for a decision that many now regard as a calamity. By contrast, Brzezinski is scathing in ''Strategic Vision,'' judging Iraq ''a costly diversion'' from the fight against Al Qaeda. The war, he says, was justified by dubious claims about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction that ''evaporated altogether within a few months'' and that sapped America's international standing.
The former Carter official regards climate change as a grave global threat; the ex-Reagan appointee hardly mentions it. When Brzezinski lays out the obstacles to America's keeping its position as international top dog, he includes ever-widening inequality between the richest and the rest -- offering statistics that would fit well on an Occupy Wall Street placard -- and an unsustainable financial system that benefits ''greedy Wall Street speculators.'' Reform is needed, he writes, not only to ensure growth but to foster the ''social consensus and democratic stability'' at home without which the United States cannot be a force abroad. Kagan allows that the post-2008 woes look like capitalism ''discrediting itself'' but confidently asserts that ''the liberal economic order is in everyone's interest'' even as some /voices, certainly outside the United States, are having severe doubts about key tenets of neoliberal economics.
The two books are different in temperament and style, too, in ways that say much about the contrast between left and right. Brzezinski's is full of wonkish detail and some truly leaden language: '' . . . with the potential international benefits of the foregoing unfortunately vitiated by the cumulatively destructive consequences of continued and maybe even somewhat expanded. . . . '' Kagan prefers to paint with a broad brush, sprinkling a memorable metaphor here, a striking simile there. International ''rules and institutions are like scaffolding around a building: they don't hold the building up; the building holds them up'' (the building being America). Where Brzezinski can be gloomy, almost channeling the spirit of Jimmy Carter's notorious ''malaise'' speech when he warns of the excessive materialism and spiritual hollowness of contemporary American life, Kagan is breezier and sunnier. Reading the books side by side is to be reminded not only of Carter versus Reagan but also of Kerry versus Bush.
And yet the great surprise is how much they agree with each other, especially on what matters. They both insist that reports of America's decline are exaggerated. Both note that the United States still accounts for a quarter of the world's gross domestic product, a proportion that has held steady for more than 40 years. Both note America's military strength, with a budget greater than that of all its rivals combined. As Brzezinski puts it, on every measure ''America is still peerless.''
Usefully, Kagan states that much of the current decline talk is based on a ''nostalgic fallacy,'' imagining a golden past in which America was all but omnipotent. There never was such a time, he says, not even during those periods now remembered as the glory days of American might. Still bathing in the glow of total victory in World War II, the country watched events in China, Korea and Indochina that, Dean Acheson lamented, were ''beyond the control of the . . . United States.'' In 1952 Douglas MacArthur warned of ''our own relative decline.'' Indeed, Kagan shows that declinism is as old as America itself: in 1788, Patrick Henry was ruing the Republic's fall from the days ''when the American spirit was in its youth.'' Kagan's message is that America has been gripped by these fears before, only to bounce back: ''Anyone who honestly recalls the 1970s, with Watergate, Vietnam, stagflation and the energy crisis, cannot really believe the present difficulties are unrivaled.''
Both men dismiss that other plank of declinist conventional wisdom, the assumption that China's hot breath is on America's neck and that it is about to take over. That's an ''overreaction,'' Brzezinski writes, on a par with 1980s fears that the United States was about to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan. China is still decades behind on all the measures that count and has shown little sign of wanting to assume America's central role. It might just be biding its time, but Kagan makes a good case that its geopolitical position is not propitious: while the United States is flanked by oceans, China is encircled by wary, watchful neighbors. It cannot so easily head out into the world to serve as a global naval power and hegemon.
The two authors agree that it's in every/one's interest, not just America's, for the United States to remain dominant. Kagan frames his essay with a device borrowed from the Frank Capra classic ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' imagining the world if America were not there to play global superpower. He provides a compelling demonstration that whether it's protecting the sea lanes vital for free trade or nudging societies toward democracy, the world stands a better chance with America in prime position than it would with China or Russia in the lead. Brzezinski similarly asks us to imagine the Internet if it were under the de facto stewardship of Moscow or Beijing rather than Washington.
Of the two, it is Brzezinski, predictably, who is more alert to the long history of United States intrusion abroad -- including the toppling of democratic governments and the gobbling up of developing nations' resources -- that might make non-/Americans skeptical of the merits of American dominance. But both are persuasive that American mastery is better than any plausible alternative (if only because a world without any dominant power is itself implausible).
Above all, Brzezinski and Kagan unite in arguing against fatalism. American decline is not preordained, but neither is the status quo. If Americans want to remain on top, they will have to fight for that position, making some painful changes in the process (including, Brzezinski says, to a dysfunctional, paralyzed political system). But it's worth it, chiefly because the current international order -- more or less stable and free from world war for seven decades -- will not maintain itself. Given what else is out there, the world still needs America.

HEADLINE: China's Cash Buys Inroads In Caribbean

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Karla Zabludovsky contributed reporting from Mexico City, Camilo Thame from Kingston, Jamaica, and Prior Beharry from Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago .

 BODY:
NASSAU, the Bahamas -- A brand new $35 million stadium opened here in the Bahamas a few weeks ago, a gift from the Chinese government.
The tiny island nation of Dominica has received a grammar school, a renovated hospital and a sports stadium, also courtesy of the Chinese. Antigua and Barbuda got a power plant and a cricket stadium, and a new school is on its way. The prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago can thank Chinese contractors for the craftsmanship in her official residence.
China's economic might has rolled up to America's doorstep in the Caribbean, with a flurry of loans from state banks, investments by companies and outright gifts from the government in the form of new stadiums, roads, official buildings, ports and resorts in a region where the United States has long been a prime benefactor.
The Chinese have flexed their economic prowess in nearly every corner of the world. But planting a flag so close to the United States has generated intense vetting -- and some raised eyebrows -- among diplomats, economists and investors. 
''When you've got a new player in the hemisphere all of a sudden, it's obviously something talked about at the highest level of governments,'' said Kevin P. Gallagher, a Boston University professor who is an author of a recent report on Chinese financing, ''The New Banks in Town.''
Most analysts do not see a security threat, noting that the Chinese are not building bases or forging any military ties that could invoke fears of another Cuban missile crisis. But they do see an emerging superpower securing economic inroads and political support from a bloc of developing countries with anemic budgets that once counted almost exclusively on the United States, Canada and Europe.
China announced late last year that it would lend $6.3 billion to Caribbean governments, adding considerably to the hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, grants and other forms of economic assistance it has already channeled there in the past decade.
Unlike in Africa, South America and other parts of the world where China's forays are largely driven by a search for commodities, its presence in the Caribbean derives mainly from long-term economic ventures, like tourism and loans, and potential new allies that are inexpensive to win over, analysts say.
American diplomatic cables released through WikiLeaks and published in the British newspaper The Guardian quoted diplomats as being increasingly worried about the Chinese presence here ''less than 190 miles from the United States'' and speculating on its purpose. One theory, according to a 2003 cable, suggested that China was lining up allies as ''a strategic move'' for the eventual end of the Castro era in Cuba, with which it has strong relations.
But the public line today is to be untroubled.
''I am not particularly worried, but it is something the U.S. should continue to monitor,'' said Dennis C. Shea, the chairman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a bipartisan Congressional panel. But, he added, ''With China you have to be wary of possible policy goals behind the effort.''
This archipelago, less than a one-hour flight from Florida, has gotten particular attention from the Chinese. Aside from the new stadium, with its ''China Aid'' plaque affixed prominently at the entrance, Chinese workers here in the Bahamas are busy helping build the $3.5 billion Baha Mar, one of the region's largest megaresorts.
Beyond that, a Chinese state bank agreed in recent weeks to put up $41 million for a new port and bridge, and a new, large Chinese Embassy is being built downtown.
The new stadium here, Bahamian officials said, was in part a reward for breaking ties with Taiwan in 1997 and establishing and keeping relations with China.
It is one of several sporting arenas that China has sprinkled in Caribbean and Central American nations as gratitude for their recognition of ''one China'' -- in other words, for their refusal to recognize Taiwan, which Chinese officials consider part of their country.
''They offered a substantial gift and we opted for a national stadium,'' said Charles Maynard, the Bahamian sports minister, adding that his government could never have afforded to build it on its own.
In this enduring tug of war with Taiwan, others have switched, too, with a little financial encouragement. Grenada ended relations with Taiwan in 2004, and it is now in talks with China about getting a new national track and field stadium. The parting has not been entirely amicable; Taiwan and Grenada are now locked in a financial dispute over loans that Grenada received to finance the construction of its airport.
Determined not to be sidelined, Taiwan is seeking to solidify its existing relationships with countries like Belize, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Lucia -- which in 2007 broke relations with China in favor of Taiwan -- with a bevy of projects, many of them agricultural, including an agreement signed with Belize in recent weeks to develop the fish farming industry there.
Still, Taiwanese diplomats in the region conceded that they could never keep up with China's largess but continued to make strategic investments in the Caribbean.
There are some commodities in the region that China wants. In August, a Chinese company, Complant, bought the last three government sugar estates in Jamaica and leased cane fields, for a total investment of $166 million. Last year, Jamaica for the first time shipped its famed Blue Mountain Coffee to China.
The Jamaican government has also received several hundred million dollars in loans from China, including $400 million announced in 2010 over five years to rebuild roads and other infrastructure.
''In order to be prosperous you need to build roads first,'' said Adam Wu, an executive with China Business Network, a consulting group for Chinese businesses that has been making the case for China in several Caribbean countries.
Several analysts in the Caribbean say they believe that China eventually will emerge as a political force in the region, with so many countries indebted to it, at a time when the United States is perceived as preoccupied with the Middle East and paying little attention to the region.
''They are buying loyalty and taking up the vacuum left by the United States, Canada and other countries, particularly in infrastructure improvements,'' said Sir Ronald Sanders, a former diplomat from Antigua and Barbuda.
''If China continues to invest the way it is doing in the Caribbean, the U.S. is almost making itself irrelevant to the region,'' he added. ''You don't leave your flank exposed.''
In some places, Chinese contractors or workers have stayed on, beginning to build communities and businesses. So many have opened in Roseau, Dominica, that local merchants have complained about being squeezed out.
Trinidad and Tobago has had waves of Chinese immigration over the past century, but locals are now seeing more Chinese restaurants and shops, as well as other signs of a new immigrant generation.
''I am second-generation Trinidadian-Chinese, and like most of us of this era, we have integrated very well in society, having friends, girlfriends, spouses and kids with people of other ethnicities,'' said Robert Johnson-Attin, 36, a mechanical engineer now with his own successful business. ''It'll only be a matter of time before it happens with the Chinese coming in now.''
Here in the Bahamas, Tan Jian, the economic counselor at the Chinese Embassy, said he that believed ''it's only the start'' of the Chinese presence across the Caribbean, casting it as one developing country using its growing economic power to help other developing ones.
The Bahamian government, he said, ''cannot afford to build huge projects by itself.''
While the Chinese built the stadium, the Bahamas is responsible for utility hookups and the roads and landscaping outside it.
The $35 million gift ''is costing us $50 million,'' said Mr. Maynard, the sports minister. ''But at the end of the day it will pay for itself'' by putting the Bahamas in position to host major sporting events and reap the tourism revenue that comes with that.
For Baha Mar, the Chinese Export-Import Bank is financing $2.6 billion, nearly three-quarters of the cost, and China's state construction company is a partner.
The Bahamas agreed to allow up to 8,000 foreign workers, most of them Chinese, to work on the project in stages, but it also required employment for 4,000 Bahamians, dampening concerns that Chinese workers were taking jobs. American companies will also take part in building and running it.
Mr. Jian played down any economic competition with the United States, whose tourists, he asserted, stood to benefit from China's presence in the Caribbean. The Chinese workers here live in barracks behind the project fences, largely shielded from public view.
''We hardly know they are here,'' said James Duffy, watching a track practice next to the stadium one recent afternoon, adding with a chuckle: ''Except for the big things they build.''

HEADLINE: Infiniti's Cheetah: The Blue Period

BYLINE: By EZRA DYER

 BODY:
TESTED: 2012 Infiniti FX35 Limited Edition
WHAT IS IT? A five-passenger all-wheel-drive relative of the Nissan 370Z sports car.
HOW MUCH? $52,950, which is $6,850 more than an FX35 AWD. But the Limited Edition includes the Premium Package ($4,150 on other versions), with an around-view monitor, navigation system and front seats that can be heated or cooled.
WHAT MAKES IT RUN? 3.5-liter V-6 (303 horsepower, 262 pound-feet of torque), 7-speed automatic. 
IS IT THIRSTY? The FX prioritizes performance over fuel economy; the E.P.A. rating is only 16 m.p.g. in town and 21 m.p.g. on the highway.
I'M on the phone with a fellow automotive journalist when his end of the conversation is pre-empted by the raspy snarl of an engine straining toward its redline. I can't identify many engines just by their sounds -- except for oddballs like a Bentley W-12 or Subaru flat 4 -- but even over the phone, I recognize this sonic signature.
''Are you driving an Infiniti with a V-6?'' I ask. He replies, ''Yes, I'm driving an FX35.'' I feel as though I should win a prize -- or maybe Infiniti's engineers should, for tuning a mainstream V-6 to produce a hard-edged burble that's recognizable even through a tiny iPhone speaker.
The FX is a fundamentally strange beast, a crossover that shares its rear-wheel-drive platform with Nissan and Infiniti sports cars. Those rear-drive bones help to distinguish the FX from the sea of quasi-S.U.V.'s that ride on stretched front-drive-sedan platforms, an ever-growing mob that includes Infiniti's new three-row JX (a branch of the Nissan Maxima family tree.)
After nine years, the styling is familiar, but let's not forget that Infiniti once described the FX as a ''bionic cheetah.'' I think it looks like a jacked-up extraterrestrial insect, and I mean that as a compliment.
The FX's last redesign came in 2009, so Infiniti needed to create some midcycle interest. You know what that means: it's time for a special edition. The FX35 AWD Limited Edition is essentially a trim package with distinctive blue paint and exclusive graphite-finish 21-inch wheels. Only 550 Limited Editions will be built for the United States.
A special color scheme sounds like a weak excuse for a distinct model, but the Iridium Blue paint is so striking that passers-by stop for a second look. In shadow, the color mimics a sedate shade of navy blue, but in sunlight the hue changes into bright, bottomless metallic liquid. Unlike other distinctive paint jobs (like a matte finish or the unfortunate shade that Ford calls ''cinnamon''), I suspect this one will age well.
However, Iridium Blue won't repair its own scratches. When the current FX was introduced, it included Scratch Shield, a novel coating that could ''heal'' scratches under exposure to sunlight. Infiniti quietly dropped Scratch Shield after a year, because customers suffered from overly high expectations of its rehabilitative capabilities. The technology was meant to handle a light scratch in the clear coat, but when a deep gouge didn't magically repair itself like the bad Terminator, the complaints rolled in. Now we're back where we started, with paint that can't fix itself at all. See, people, this is why we can't have nice things.
The deletion of Scratch Shield shows that Infiniti cares about its customer satisfaction ratings, as does a new perk called Infiniti Personal Assistant. For the first four years, FX owners have access to a personal concierge service. If you need a restaurant reservation, travel help or ''assistance on a range of topics and tasks,'' there's a team of assistants operating a 24-hour hotline. Remember, it's their job to help, not to ask why you need a clown sent to Denny's at 4 a.m.
If you want to test the personal assistants further, you might call and ask them to help you distinguish the difference in front-end styling between the 2011 FX and the 2012 model. I'd say that the 2011 grille looked rapacious and the 2012 appears self-satisfied, but only FX owners are likely to notice the change.
Behind the grille, the engines are the same. Infiniti offers a 390-horsepower V-8 in the FX50, but the FX35's high-revving V-6 is enjoyable in its own right. Its 303 horses are put to good effect by the 7-speed gearbox; visits to the 7,500 r.p.m. redline are accompanied by that singular bark.
The FX is nominally rear-wheel drive, sending torque to the front as needed, so it drives like an overgrown sports car -- agile, balanced and willing to frolic in a way that front-drive crossovers can't match. Somehow, the Limited Edition even has a decent ride despite its colossal wheels.
Before the FX, I might have wondered why anyone would want a high-riding, low-roof utility with sports-car pretentions. Nearly a decade later, the FX has spawned a genre populated by mutants like BMW's X6 and Acura's ZDX. While the release of a limited edition hints at a fear of showroom stasis, last year the FX maintained its steady clip of about 10,000 sales, more than the X6 and ZDX combined. It's hard to catch up to a bionic cheetah.

WATCHING THE UNIVERSE
FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
The same conditions that make the Atacama in Chile, Earth's driest desert, so inhospitable also make it beguiling for astronomy. Far from big cities, the Atacama has a dearth of light pollution. Its arid climate prevents radio signals from being absorbed by water droplets. The altitude, as high as the Himalaya base camps for climbers preparing to scale Mount Everest, places astronomers closer to the heavens. Page 6
JUNTA IN MALI TO STEP DOWN
Political leaders in Mali welcomed an accord signed by the junta in which it agreed to step down in ''the hours and days ahead'' and hand power to the president of the National Assembly. Page 8 
NEW LEADER IN MALAWI
The government of Malawi confirmed that the country's president, Bingu wa Mutharika, had died, ending 24 hours of confusion and fervid speculation about his condition. The vice president moved swiftly to take control of the government, lessening the likelihood that democratic succession would be interrupted in one of central Africa's most enduring democracies.

AIRPORT ATTACKED IN YEMEN
Gunmen loyal to Yemen's ousted president blasted buildings at the country's main airport with anti-aircraft guns, forcing it to shut down, an airport official said. The attack comes a day after Yemen's new president fired key security officials appointed by the ex-president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. Page 9

Students in elementary, middle and high schools take standardized tests whose results are made public, inviting anyone to assess, however imperfectly, a school's performance. There is no comparable trove of public data for judging and comparing colleges, but pieces of such a system may be taking shape, with several kinds of national assessments gaining traction in recent years.

AIM FOR DECADE OF GAINS
Analysts see continued economic success for the region -- and for investors who keep money there for the long haul. A vigorous and persistent economic and political renaissance, especially in Brazil, produced annualized returns of 17.1 percent for funds that focus on the region during the 10 years through March, including a 13.3 percent return in the first quarter of this year.

WHEN SHAREHOLDERS SPEAK
This year, there is evidence that the people who actually own public companies are gaining some influence over corporate pay practices. These straws in the wind appear as a result of the Dodd-Frank law. Rules mandated by the law require companies to put their pay practices to a shareholder vote at least every three years.

A NEW YORK AUTO SHOW

As an occasion known for hosting the arrival of truly benchmark cars, this New York auto show will not touch the 1954 edition, where the Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing made its debut. Aside from the rebirth of the vaunted Viper sports car and six-figure baubles like the Mercedes SL65 AMG roadster, the show is notably light on fantasies destined to be enshrined on posters in teenagers' bedrooms.

THINKING ABOUT DECLINE
In ''Time to Start Thinking: America in the Age of Descent,'' Edward Luce argues that the United States' economy and political system are in bad shape, and the country's dysfunctions feed on one another. He recognizes that the accumulation of interest groups guarding the status quo and the remarkable increase in partisan polarization are structural changes, difficult, at best, to reverse.

HISTORY OF THE END OF DAYS
In ''Revelations,'' Elaine Pagels examines the history of the Book of Revelation and places the biblical book in the context of other ancient narratives of visions and prophecy.

LIVING IN A WORLD
OF ADDICTIVE VIDEO GAMES
In the nearly 30 years since Tetris's invention -- and especially over the last five, with the rise of smartphones -- the game and its offspring (Angry Birds, Bejeweled, Fruit Ninja, etc.) have colonized our pockets and our brains and shifted the entire economic model of the video-game industry. Today, we are living, for better and worse, in a world of stupid games. Page 28
OUTSIDE THE BOX
Jack White is most famous as the singer for the White Stripes, the red-and-white-clad Detroit duo that played a stripped-down, punked-up take on Delta blues. He also runs Third Man Records, a label that has produced records for the '50s rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson and a band called Transit, made up of employees of the Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority. The label also has a Rolling Record Store, basically an ice-cream truck for records. Page 34
NO HONOR IN OBSCURITY
At one time, it was very cool to know about obscure music, writes Alexandra Molotkow. But now there is no longer any honor in musical obscurity; populism is the new model of cool. If you can be popular on your own terms -- if you can be Arcade Fire or Bon Iver and still win a Grammy -- there is really no such thing as ''selling out'' anymore. Page 52

HEADLINE: Penny Wise, Or 2.4 Cents Foolish?

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
THE news from north of the border is both trivial and unsettling: they won't be making shiny new pennies in Canada anymore.
The government in Ottawa has made this decision after years of deliberation, for reasons that would seem to apply equally well in the United States. ''Pennies take up too much space on our dressers at home,'' Jim Flaherty, the Canadian finance minister, said in a speech last month. A persuasive government brochure put it this way: ''We often store them in jars, throw them away in water fountains, or refuse them as change.''
Pennies cost more to produce than they are worth. Yet because of inflation, they are worth so little that many Canadians don't bother to use them at all.
It's not very different in New York City. In January, when Starbucks raised the price of a 12-ounce cup of coffee in Manhattan to $2.01, with taxes, many coffee drinkers were appalled -- not so much by the cost as by the indignity of needing to fish for pennies. In the intervening weeks, I've given up on coins at Starbucks and begun paying for my morning joe electronically. 
Do we really need pennies?
The Canadian government doesn't think so. By the fall, it plans to stop minting them and stop distributing them through banks. It won't actually ban them, though. Some people have grown so attached to pennies -- a penny saved is a penny earned, after all -- that they may want to keep using them indefinitely, and they can, the Canadian government says.
But those who can bear to part with their pennies are being encouraged to bring them to banks for eventual melting or to donate them to charities -- which will presumably bring them in for melting. Electronic transactions will continue to include cents, while retail sales will be rounded up or down.
Inflation is sometimes cited as a threat whenever small coins are phased out. A $2.01 cup of coffee should be rounded down to $2, while $2.03 should become $2.05, for example, but retailers in the real world might raise prices more than lower them. That could cause a small, one-time inflation burst, says Francois Velde, an expert on the history of small change.
''But in a competitive market, you might well see price decreases,'' says Mr. Velde, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago who is working this year at the Bank of France. ''In a place like New York, a 99-cent price of pizza might go down to 95 cents rather than $1 to avoid crossing that higher price threshold.'' Over all and over time, there should be no net price effect, he says.
He finds the argument for phasing out the penny to be at least as strong in the United States as in Canada because the two nations' small coins, political history and socioeconomic culture have so much in common. ''That's what makes the Canadian decision a little unsettling,'' he says. ''Their pennies even look a lot like ours.''
In the United States, the mint says, each zinc and copper coin costs 2.41 cents to produce and distribute. It costs 1.6 Canadian cents to make a penny at the mint in Winnipeg, according to Canadian government figures. (A Canadian cent is worth about 0.99 cents at the current exchange rate.) ''From the standpoint of economics, that's just a total waste of money,'' Mr. Velde says.
Pennies may not be big money, even if you add them together. But we are paying a cost for the privilege of squirreling them away in drawers and on dressers. The United States government -- that is, taxpayers -- lost $60.2 million on the production and distribution of pennies in the 2011 fiscal year, the mint's budget shows, and the losses have been mounting: $27.4 million in 2010, and $19.8 million in 2009.
A number of countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Britain, have already dropped their lowest-denominated coins, without dire consequences.
WHAT is to be done in the United States? The mint defers to Congress, and Congress hasn't told it to abolish the penny. Lawmakers have directed the mint to study ways to make small coins more cheaply. Mike White, a spokesman for the mint, says a report will be completed in December -- which happens to be after the presidential election.
President Obama, a former senator from Illinois, has observed that people from that state are partial to the penny, which has depicted Abraham Lincoln since 1909. But after the Canadian announcement, The Chicago Tribune last week editorialized that, sentiment aside, it was ''time to kill the cent.''
At the very least, a change in the composition of the American penny seems likely.
In 1982, Congress authorized the Treasury to make such a change, and it did. Before then, pennies were 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc, Mr. White says. Pennies manufactured since have been copper-plated zinc, with zinc making up 97.5 percent of the coin and copper only 2.5 percent. Steel, which was used in pennies in World War II, could be substituted next.
But why stop at the penny? It's not the only American coin that costs more than it's worth. Each nickel costs 11.18 cents to produce and distribute, the mint says, at a loss to taxpayers of $56.5 million in the last fiscal year. In its 2013 budget proposal, the Obama administration has asked for authority to alter the composition of the nickel, too.
Mr. Velde has suggested what he calls a ''medieval solution to a medieval problem.'' The United States could resolve the penny and nickel quandaries simultaneously, by revaluing the penny as a five-cent piece and abolishing the nickel. Nickels would be melted down rapidly even now, as a business proposition, he says, if not for regulations imposed in 2006 prohibiting the melting or exporting of both pennies and nickels.
Anti-melting measures have a long history -- medieval England instituted one in 1299 -- but market pressures limit their effectiveness. (English silver coins were debased -- their silver content was reduced -- in 1343.)
''The whole situation is ridiculous,'' Mr. Velde says. ''My medieval solution is, well, medieval. The serious, simple solution is to do away with the penny.''
It's hard to be entirely serious about pennies, though. If there are no new ones, says Lizzie Wright, a native of Louisiana, old ones can be shined up very easily by using Tabasco sauce and a rag. Along with Mike Smith, a fellow performance artist, Ms. Wright cleaned pennies for passers-by at the Brooklyn Museum last year, at no charge.
''We think it's a useful service for a coin that isn't very useful,'' Ms. Wright says. ''And if the penny is abolished, we think that will create greater demand for clean pennies.''
A penny for your thoughts?

HEADLINE: Wary of Heights (and the Future)

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
SEEING is supposed to be believing, but a second consecutive quarter of eye-popping gains for stocks has left many investors still unconvinced that the long-term trend is up.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 12 percent in the first quarter, after gaining 11.2 percent in the one before, yet the panic that was palpable last fall seems to have given way to doubt, more than to euphoria or even hope.
The index reached a four-year high in March, some 31 percent above its October low, amid stronger economic data in the United States and a resolution, at least for now, of the credit crisis in Greece. Yet investors continue to shun mutual funds with a focus on American stocks; Morningstar reported a net outflow of $3.8 billion in the first two months of 2012, bringing the total in the 12 months through February to $114.2 billion.
''This is the Rodney Dangerfield of bull markets,'' said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. ''It doesn't get any respect. The naysayers have been badmouthing it really since the start.'' 
Skeptical investment advisers find much to say nay about; they question that a bona fide recovery is in place or that the last disruptive piece of news has come out of Europe.
Others, including Mr. Yardeni, are skeptical about the skepticism. ''There have been numerous nearly apocalyptic scenarios out there that haven't played out,'' he said. ''Despite the scares we've had, the global economy continues to grow. The adage about the market climbing a wall of worry has never been more relevant.''
In Mr. Yardeni's view, investors are ignoring a persistent lift to economic growth and corporate profits from reduced constraints on international trade.
''What the bears have been missing is the power of globalization,'' he said. ''The liberalization of national economies through relatively free-trade policies is creating a lot of wealth. There are a lot more consumers out there than before the end of the cold war.''
But investors who have pushed up stock prices may be missing that the interconnectedness of economies and markets cuts both ways. Alan Brown, chief investment officer of Schroder Investment Management, is concerned that the deal to protect European banks and allow Greece to renegotiate its debt is only a limited solution to the region's problems.
''I don't think it's over with at all,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We had some meaningful and very good news in the last few months that kicked the can down the road for a while, but none of this addresses the core problem of lack of competitiveness in the peripheral countries. If it can be addressed at all, it will be a grindingly slow process over a decade or more.''
THE recovery in the United States has been grindingly slow, too, but certain measures have picked up of late. Thomas H. Forester, manager of the Forester Value fund, noted, however, that economic output was only steady, not booming. Monthly jobs reports were strong in the first quarter until the one for March, released last Friday, which showed a sharp drop in the number of net jobs created.
''We're not exactly sure what to make of this,'' he said. ''We kind of think there's more employment, but we're not seeing it validated in other areas.''
Mr. Forester says he expects the rally in stocks to continue, although he believes it to be closer to the end than the beginning. He is concerned that 2012 may resemble 2011, when, he recalled, ''we saw a big spurt in the first three or four months, then it went flat and rolled over.'' With that in mind, he said, ''we're still a bit on the defensive side -- I still see a fair amount of risk, even if it's less than in October.''
Owning stocks with high dividend yields ''is the way to play the rest of the year,'' he advised. He is comparatively underinvested in banks, he added, and has trimmed exposure to technology.
Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup, also questions the strength of the employment rebound. He contends that warm winter weather may have pulled some job creation forward, limiting the scope for further gains.
''If we get spring early, then we don't get spring,'' Mr. Levkovich said. ''That won't derail the recovery, but there is certainly some notion that the data isn't as clean as we would normally see.''
He also cited concerns like higher gas prices and fat corporate profit margins that leave limited room for improvement. What the economy and stock market have going for them, he said, is Federal Reserve assurances that short-term interest rates will remain low until 2014.
Mr. Levkovich is bullish on stocks, but is in no hurry to buy right now. The S.& P. 500 already neared his year-end target of 1,425 in March. That high level for the index, as well as the various yellow flags, lead him to expect a modest pullback soon, perhaps 5 to 7 percent, before a fresh leg up later in the year. ''Buy on weakness,'' he said. ''Don't chase the tape at this point.''
He said he would focus on diversified financial services companies, which he considers attractively valued, and ''decent growth companies that also pay dividends while you wait'' for share prices to catch a second wind.
Mr. Levkovich finds utilities reasonably priced, and favors providers of telecommunication services, which he envisions as raising prices more rapidly as smartphones and tablets continue to catch on. That same trend should help stocks of companies that make technology hardware and semiconductors, he said.
Robert D. Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, says he is concerned about the lingering impact on consumer and other prices of the Fed's efforts to support the economy and financial system.
''If the economy does gain traction, then monetary stimulus means higher inflation sooner than most people expect,'' Mr. Arnott said. ''If the economy falters, then the stimulus is going to be astronomical; that almost guarantees more inflation.''
That perspective makes him bearish on government bonds, and he is not crazy about domestic stocks, either. He considers them ''really cheap, compared to Treasury bonds, and more expensive than almost everything else.'' He would rather have his money in stocks and bonds in emerging markets and in commodities and high-yield bonds.
Those bonds of less creditworthy borrowers were among the strongest performers in the three months through March. They helped the average bond fund in Morningstar's database gain 2.6 percent.
Stock funds fared much better. The average domestic fund was up 12 percent, led by portfolios that focus on sectors most sensitive to economic growth: consumer discretionary, financial services and cyclical industries. Technology funds were the biggest standouts, rising 20.7 percent, on average. International funds were strong, too, rising 11.4 percent.
Mr. Brown shares Mr. Arnott's doubts about long-term bonds and also advises concentrating on high-yield instruments. Among stocks, he considers the American market ''the best of a bad bunch,'' especially high-quality companies with large dividend yields. He would avoid Europe.
Mr. Yardeni also favors American stocks, but more enthusiastically. He expects the S.& P. 500 to rise as high as 1,550, exceeding the record set in 2007. He particularly likes tech stocks. ''We're seeing hardware and software companies doing extremely well,'' he said. ''The cloud is the new new thing creating demand for servers and software.''
Mr. Yardeni also recommends makers of capital equipment, in part because of rising orders from foreign industrial companies. And he encourages investors to hold energy stocks, both to benefit from acceleration of global economic growth and as a hedge against political instability in the Middle East.
Market segments he is steering clear of are consumer discretionary, a sector that includes retailers, carmakers and travel companies, and high-yield stocks. They have experienced extremely large gains, he noted, and so their best days may be behind them. The unpredictability he finds in financial stocks makes them a category to avoid, too, he said.
SOME possibilities -- rising gas prices, a Persian Gulf conflict, adverse political developments in Europe and the United States -- could temper Mr. Yardeni's bullishness, he conceded. They might prove the skeptics right about the market rally, but, channeling Mr. Dangerfield, he still advises investors to show it more respect.
''There are grounds for arguing that this will end badly,'' he said, ''but there are increasing grounds for feeling that this bull market could last awhile and that the future could be a lot brighter than investors have been thinking.''

HEADLINE: Few Fantasies, but a Traffic Jam in the Middle of the Road

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
AS an occasion known for hosting the arrival of truly benchmark cars, this New York auto show will not touch the 1954 edition, where the Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing made its debut. Nor will it compare with the unveiling of the Ford Mustang at the World's Fair in Queens in 1964, which set off a Beatles-scale national mania for the phenomenon that became the pony car.
With the auto industry and the economy each getting its second wind, this year's show is notable not for singular superstars but for a committee approach: there are a lot of team-playing sedans and crossovers, as daring as Dockers on casual Friday, all putting their conformist heads together to put ''mass'' in the market.
Aside from the rebirth of the vaunted Viper sports car and six-figure baubles like the Mercedes SL65 AMG roadster, the show at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center is notably light on fantasies destined to be enshrined on posters in teenagers' bedrooms. 
Instead, during media previews, one industry executive after another extolled the dynamic, groundbreaking status of some new -- but decidedly mainstream -- sedan freighted with obligatory LED headlamps, blind-spot detectors and Bluetooth connections. The disconnect between description and sheet metal left many in the journalistic scrum scratching their heads.
In fairness, an industry now feeling confident of topping 14 million sales in 2012 must focus on mass-market appeal rather than flashy niche models if it is to have any chance of returning to the days of 16 million annual sales.
As ever, the show's models reveal automakers' struggles to balance the quest for a breakout hit like the slinky Hyundai Sonata with a recognition that safe and boring may actually be better for the bottom line.
A prime example, or offender, is the 2013 Nissan Altima. Today's Altima rose steadily to become America's second-best-selling car in 2012 (after the Toyota Camry), and the redesigned Altima that made its debut in New York seemed to have been created expressly to defend that position rather than to seize the high ground. Despite new features and re-engineering, the Nissan looks as cautious as a first-time parent, and just as likely to induce sleep among the young.
Nissan did hone its cutting edge with the Infiniti LE concept, a glittering electric sedan based on the Nissan Leaf that the company's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, promised would reach showrooms within 24 months.
Other companies proved willing to experiment with sedans, sometimes out of necessity. Toyota, stung by endless charges of stodginess and complacency, unveiled a remade Avalon sedan that seeks to banish that model's geriatric image. Lincoln, a luxury brand on life support, offered a fresh MKZ midsize sedan whose sophisticated lines were roundly praised.
At the gutsiest end of the spectrum, Mazda, looking to reverse a devastating financial slide, showed its Takeri design study. By fall, the muscular, snaking concept sedan will evolve into the next Mazda 6. Many of those at Javits last week were crossing their fingers that the concept's bravura styling would remain intact.
As for snakes, the Viper -- no longer a Dodge, but carrying Chrysler's high-performance SRT banner -- restored the show's roar with its 640-horsepower V-10 and bone-crunching style.
Here are some highlights of the show:
ACURA The sinking RL flagship will soon be scuttled and replaced by the RLX, which appears mildly more interesting. On sale early next year, the RLX will feature a V-6 and a hybrid system with more than 370 horsepower and a 30 m.p.g. target in overall driving.
BMW Will Americans spend $40,000 or much more on a teensy crossover S.U.V., even one wearing a BMW badge? We'll find out in September, when the breadbox-size X1 arrives in America. The sDrive 28i model with a terrific new 245-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine starts at $31,545, rising to $39,345 for the 306-horsepower xDrive 35i with an in-line turbo 6.
In time for summer, BMW fans with $114,000 to spend can snap up an M6 Convertible -- and snap necks with its 560-horsepower, 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8.
CHEVROLET Long a nasty, brutish staple of rental fleets, the Impala will be transformed into a modern, shapely large sedan for 2014, though consumers cannot buy it until spring 2013. Three engine choices include a 2.4-liter 4 with General Motors' new eAssist system that promises more than 35 highway m.p.g.
FISKER Henrik Fisker says his second plug-in hybrid model, the Atlantic, which went on hiatus when the company missed targets for an Energy Department loan, has enough private financing to go into production. A BMW turbo 4 would team with a lithium-ion battery pack to operate in either electric or gasoline range-extending modes.
HONDA The Crosstour, no longer carrying the Accord nameplate, gets a freshening that includes a visible skid plate, two-tone side cladding and a bit more ground clearance. Honda calls it a concept, but the version that goes on sale this fall will not be much different from what was shown here.
HYUNDAI Another handsome Hyundai, the remade Santa Fe midsize crossover includes a long-wheelbase version with a 290-horsepower V-6 and three rows of seats. On sale this summer, the Santa Fe will offer two powertrains for the short-wheelbase model, a 190-horsepower 4-cylinder model and a 2-liter turbo with 264 horses.
INFINITI On sale by 2014, the all-electric LE sedan shares its bones with the Nissan Leaf, but fortunately not the Leaf's eco-nerd styling. Longer and lower than the Nissan, the seductive Infiniti packs a 34-kilowatt-hour battery pack under its floor, offering the usual E.V. range of roughly 100 miles. A wireless inductive charging system, in which the LE parks over a charging pad embedded in a garage floor, may be offered.
LEXUS With a confident profile and the polarizing ''spindle grille'' already seen on the GS sport sedan, the latest ES goes on sale this summer. The ES 350 operates with a 3.5-liter V-6; the 300h hybrid aims for a combined 40 m.p.g. in city and highway driving from its battery pack and a 2.5-liter gas engine.
LINCOLN One of the consensus favorites among new sedans on the show floor, the MKZ drapes a winged grille and a lovely, dramatic Kamm tail over the chassis of the new Ford Fusion. Among three powertrain choices, a 4-cylinder hybrid system adapted from the Fusion promises roughly 40 combined m.p.g. The MKZ goes on sale this fall.
MERCEDES-BENZ More luxury and a double dose of turbocharging is the news for the full-size GL-Class S.U.V. A new bi-turbo 4.6-liter V-8 with 406 horses powers the GL450. The GL550 has 429 horses; the GL350 Bluetec gets a frugal 240-horsepower diesel.
With more torque than even the Viper -- a staggering 738 pound-feet -- the SL65 AMG convertible goes on sale in November. Lofty numbers include 621 horsepower from a bi-turbo 6-liter V-12 and a price around $200,000.
NISSAN If so-so looks don't win you over, perhaps agile handling and leading fuel economy will. Nissan expects the new 4-cylinder Altima to achieve about 27/38 city/highway mileage, or 22/30 with a 270-horsepower V-6. The Altima reaches showrooms in the fall, priced from $22,280.
PORSCHEOn the heels of a hybrid version, the Cayenne S.U.V. will offer Porsche's first diesel engine in America, starting in September at a base price of $56,725.
RAM With a chain-link maw, intimidating looks and more frugal V-6 and V-8 engines -- including a 5.7-liter Hemi making 395 horses-- the bad-boy Ram pickup goes on sale this fall.
SRT Despite its vaguely Italian snout and carbon-fiber and aluminum body, the Viper remains an American superpower. The 8.4-liter V-10 makes 640 horsepower and 600 pound-feet of torque. After years of celebrating the Viper's lack of a safety net, Chrysler adds traction and stability control.
SUBARU The high-heeled Birkenstock of Subarus, the XV Crosstrek is an Impreza-based rival to the quirky Nissan Juke. The tall hatchback arrives this fall with a 148-horsepower 2-liter flat 4.
TOYOTA It has been nine years since the Avalon's last makeover, but a redesigned sedan arrives by year-end. Inside and out, the big Toyota is sleeker and more appealing than its dowdy predecessor. It's powered by a carryover version of the 3.5-liter V-6. This is the first Toyota created entirely in North America, styled in Calfornia and engineered in Ann Arbor, Mich.
The New York International Auto Show runs through Sunday, April 15, at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on 11th Avenue near 34th Street. Hours are 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sundays. Tickets are $15 for adults, $5 for children under 13. Further information is available at autoshowny.com.

HEADLINE: A Surrender to War, After an Uneasy Peace

BYLINE: By JENNY WILLIAMS. 
Jenny Williams teaches high school English and writing outside of Philadelphia.

 BODY:
''IT'S O.K.,'' I said to my husband, not knowing if I was being brave or stupid. ''Go.''
So he did. The commanding general of a new task force in Afghanistan was looking for someone with Dave's background. Dave volunteered, and on Jan. 14 off he went.
Fifteen years earlier, when we were 19, in college, not dating, and standing in the grocery store, Dave told me he had joined the Army. I don't remember what I said to him, but I later told my roommate how he had changed for me in that moment.
''I didn't know he was that kind of person,'' I said. I didn't mean it in a good way. 
Yet I still fell in love with him, and four years later I packed my Subaru and moved, jobless, to Tennessee, where Dave would be stationed for the next two and a half years with the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell. Dave lived in a house in Clarksville, Tenn., with three other infantry lieutenants. The plan was for him to spend four years on active duty and then go to law school. Four years, and we would move on with our lives.
I resisted the Army by moving to Nashville, about 45 miles south of Clarksville, where I hoped to find a teaching job. A message board for roommates led me to a Vanderbilt student named Charlie, who had a plush apartment near campus. Dave called him ''Chuck'' and installed a lock on my bedroom door. But the drive between our two cities was long, and Chuck and I didn't get along that well, so by summer I had moved to Clarksville.
My friends were 24, single and living in San Francisco, Washington and New York. But as the saying goes, sometimes you don't get what you want but what you need. I had spent my high school years naively bashing the military, so now I would live with a soldier in a military town. I wouldn't spend my Friday nights hanging out with my old friends in the Marina District or Georgetown or Union Square, but sipping margaritas at the Chili's on Wilma Rudolph Boulevard in Clarksville.
Dave and I were engaged in the summer of 2001 for a wedding in June 2002, when he would be out of the Army. When the Twin Towers fell, our wedding was just beginning to take shape. That evening Dave called to say he wouldn't be coming home. His battalion was on ''Division Ready Force-One'' status, meaning they would most likely be among the first to deploy. He suspected they might ship out within days.
I called to see if the deposit for our wedding venue was refundable and began to consider the possibility of a postponement. The next night, though, Dave was home again. They weren't going anywhere. The leaden disappointment in his face dampened my own elation. Our country had been attacked, and he wanted to go; he had trained, and he wanted to lead.
During the final nine months of Dave's active duty, I tried to ignore the disappointment in his face as each possibility of deployment evaporated. By the summer of 2002, the war in Afghanistan appeared to be winding down. When Dave left the Army and our wedding took place at the end of June as scheduled, I felt lucky. He felt guilty.
In the months and years that followed, I helped Dave choose not to return to the Army. He would bring it up every year or so: maybe he could join the National Guard or the Reserves? But it was always easy for me to explain why the timing was wrong. Couldn't he finish law school first? And what about the debt we faced and the promise of being grown-ups with children and money to spend?
Meanwhile, Dave's Army friends did their tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. We bought a house and moved to the suburbs.
Eight months after our move, Dave's former Army roommate, Jay, was killed by a suicide bomber at a checkpoint in Iraq a week before he was scheduled to leave his command. He left a wife, nine months pregnant, and two young children.
We went to West Point for the funeral. A lot of guys Dave knew from Fort Campbell and Fort Benning showed up. They were 29 years old. Those still in had all done at least one tour in Iraq or Afghanistan. After the service, Jay's widow held their newborn baby as people paid their respects. Seeing her made me feel sick and sad and lucky all at the same time.
Afterward, Dave told me he wanted to return to active duty and deploy. But we had jobs and our house, and I could see the first glimmer of our ''real'' lives. So when he deferred the decision to me, I explained again why the timing was wrong.
Six more years passed. We still have the house, and now children, too, ages 2 and 4. A year ago, Dave found himself a ''nondeployable'' job in the Army Reserves, which seemed like a fair compromise. But even then I think I knew ''nondeployable'' would not be enough.
The final straw came last September when we attended a Navy League dinner in a ballroom at the Hyatt near Old City, Philadelphia. At a table behind us, a woman and her daughter stood when the M.C. said her husband's name; he had been killed in Afghanistan. The banquet also honored the family of a Marine named Travis Manion for their service after his death.
A slide show flashed pictures of Travis looking young, handsome and alive. Even with the pictures and speeches, the war and deaths were hard to fathom from where I sat in a cushioned banquet-hall chair with my napkin in my lap. People shook hands and laughed and made small talk. I kept looking behind me at the wife and daughter of the fallen Marine. I wondered how this ballroom and social occasion felt to them.
All of the soldiers we met that night had deployed, the older ones to Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War, and the younger ones to Iraq and Afghanistan. They asked Dave where he had done his tour and how many tours he'd done.
''I didn't deploy,'' he had to say again and again. ''I was out by then.''
I felt their questions in my stomach because I knew he did. I knew it was only a matter of time before he would bring up deployment again.
A FEW weeks later, in bed, Dave told me of a new chance. ''The opportunity is perfect,'' he said, ''and I want to go. I won't if you don't want me to.''
He thought he was leaving it up to me, but I knew what my answer needed to be. I had played the conversation in my head too many times. I held that answer on my tongue until he finished, then the words tumbled out.
''It's O.K.,'' I said, using the same trick I did to conquer the high dive. Jump first, then look. ''Go.''
Women do this every day, I thought, and men, too. Small children endure months, a year, without their father or mother. I cannot be different, and six months is not that long. I have practiced my lines, and they're true: I didn't marry him to stand in his way. One percent of the country is making the sacrifice for all of us, and he needs to be part of it. He has spent nine years regretting not being there. It won't go away.
He told me the deployment would be safe, relatively speaking. In his civilian job, he runs an economic development company in Camden, N.J. To make me feel better, he told me he probably stands as good a chance of being killed in a neighborhood in Camden or another high-crime urban area in this country as he does in Afghanistan. This is supposed to make me feel better.
Now I exchange daily e-mails with Dave in Kabul and we talk face-to-face via Skype a few times a week. He is assigned to a unit that works on political and economic reform. On my computer screen I can see the small room where he sleeps and the uneven crayon heart our son drew hanging on the wall behind him. He asks if it makes me feel safer to see where he sleeps and eats -- that it's not a tiny outpost in the mountains.
I don't know the answer. The two officers who were killed recently, shot to death while working at their desks inside the Afghan ministry in the wake of the Koran-burning incident, had positions like Dave's. They were just as safe as he is supposed to be.
With each new flare-up and act of violence, I wait and wonder about our choice. Will I one day stand with my children in a banquet hall watching slides of my strong, smiling husband who was killed in a war? Would my children forgive him for choosing to leave us? Would they forgive me for letting him go?

HEADLINE: A Lively Pet From Fiat's Adopt-a-Scorpion Program

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES
HOP in the new Fiat 500 Abarth, start the engine, stab the throttle and revel in the burbling growl of its exhaust. That subversively flatulent tailpipe emanation is an attention-getter, as bracing as a slap in the face, and proof that Abarth engineers have worked their mischief on the otherwise mild-mannered little Fiat.
Besides some fancy stripes, attractive wheels and scorpion logos, the Abarth treatment gives the basic Fiat 500 a welcome jolt of performance enhancement: a 59 percent increase in horsepower, a 73 percent gain in torque, a track-worthy suspension, grippy Pirelli 195/45R16 performance tires and fade-resistant metallic brakes. A nicely bolstered sport seat keeps the driver well-positioned to preside over this little atomic bomblet of fun.
The Abarth name derives from a shop founded in 1949 by Carlo Abarth (pronounced ah-BART) that built racecars and tuned road cars for high performance, breathing new life into wheezing, underpowered Fiat engines. Eventually, it built its own engines and sports cars, using bodies from coachbuilders like Bertone and Pininfarina. Fiat bought Abarth in 1971 and turned it into the in-house racing operation. After Carlo died in 1979, the name faded out of use until it was revived in 2007 as a division of Fiat Automobiles. 
The Abarth badge -- the scorpion mascot alludes to Carlo's astrological sign -- is now applied to Fiats that get the division's hot-rod treatment.
The dose of performance is so potent, and so potentially daunting to the unskilled, that Fiat throws in a day of performance-driving training, on a track, for Abarth buyers.
Abarth performance tuning also adds at least $6,500 to the $16,200 base price of a 500. The premium can be padded by $10,000 or more by checking every box on the order form; unfortunately, a cabrio version is not available.
A loaded 500 Abarth is priced in the same neighborhood as a Mini Cooper S, although it falls a few ponies short of the Mini on power. But for Fiat fanatics -- and they are out there -- every extra dollar is money well spent.
My test drive in the Americanized Abarth, along several hundred miles of Southern California roads, came immediately after I took the European version through Italy. To my surprise, the stateside-spec Abarth significantly outperformed the European model. In my experience of testing Euro-spec offerings from most automakers, the reverse is almost always true.
Americans get a turbocharged 160-horsepower version of Fiat's 1.4-liter MultiAir 4-cylinder engine. This power output is comparable to a European Abarth special edition called the Essesse, although it has a different engine. The base Euro Abarth produces a noticeably less lively 135 horsepower. The performance of the Euro car I drove was further hampered by a wheezy Dualogic gearbox, a ''robotized manual'' that shifts automatically -- but somnambulantly -- without a clutch pedal. The only transmission currently available for the American Abarth is a 5-speed manual. Extra bracing needed for American crash-test standards created a packaging issue that precluded offering the automatic transmission, which is larger. The manual may limit the car's appeal, because so few Americans know how to drive a manual any longer.
But in speaking with the types of folks who might buy an Abarth, I found that they regarded the automatic as more of a deal-breaker than a deal-maker. The manual is essential, in my view, for wringing every ounce of performance potential out of this package.
All 160 horsepower is available, all of the time, but pressing the Sport button gives access the engine's full 170 pound-feet of torque. This tiered delivery of grunt -- a sprint from zero to 60 miles per hour happens in about seven seconds -- keeps the Abarth a little more tractable in everyday driving. It also helps to deliver fuel economy ratings of 28 miles per gallon in the city and 34 on the highway. (The basic 500 gets 30/38 with a manual and 27/34 with an automatic.) In conservative driving -- not the reason one buys an Abarth, is it? -- I found it possible to average as high as 40 m.p.g. Premium 91-octane unleaded is recommended.
''A substantial amount of work went into making the U.S. version of the Abarth,'' Joe Grace, the project's chief engineer, said in an interview. ''We tried to create a track car. We wanted it to be real neutral.''
Achieving that neutrality was a tall order in a front-drive car with nearly two-thirds of its weight up front. The ride height was lowered, the suspension was tightened, Koni shocks were added for high-speed damping and torsional stiffness was maximized. The wheel-tugging known as torque steer, almost a given in powerful front-drive cars, has been nearly dialed out of the equation. On the track, the result is a hoot. The car dives into corners, its Pirelli tires grabbing tight and refusing to let go. It shoots out onto the straightaways as if it were bolted to rails.
But the quicker Sport steering rate, satisfyingly responsive in competition, seemed a bit too nervous for the average Interstate commute.
The enhanced brakes improve on the stock 500's, but fall short of the stopping power of, say, the Cooper S.
Though so much of the Abarth is geared toward the enthusiast and potential track-day use, Mr. Grace said that ''less than half, maybe as little as 25 percent of buyers'' would use the cars in that manner.
''It's a little like the Jeep buyer demographic,'' he said. ''They want that capability, whether they are going to use it that way or not.''
He said a sizable American community of Fiat enthusiasts exists and that the brand was planning to tap into that by offering performance driving opportunities.
Interest in the Abarth's recent North American introduction was also inflamed by a saucy, sassy Super Bowl ad featuring the Romanian supermodel Catrinel Menghia. ''That attracted a new level of interest and intrigue, to what we believe is a credible product,'' Mr. Grace said. ''It helped make a performance statement about the fact this is a $22,000 Italian performance car. You just don't see anything else like that in North America.''
Nor are you likely to hear anything else like it.

HEADLINE: Titanic Centenary Lets Irish Village Express, and Maybe Stem, Its Loss

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL

 BODY:
LAHARDANE, Ireland -- For decades, abandoned stone cottages were the only mark of the Addergoole Fourteen, young emigrants who had fled the dark bogs of County Mayo with dreams of fortune in America and steerage tickets aboard the Titanic steamer setting sail from its last port of call: Queenstown, Ireland.
The devastated people of tiny Addergoole in western Ireland chose to silently mourn their loss in one of the most famous tragedies of the 20th century. The ache was too much for townspeople, who already had lost so many relatives to the Irish exodus brought on by desperate poverty.
Now, 100 years after the Titanic's sinking, the town's silence has been replaced by a cacophony of remembrance for the 11 of the Addergoole Fourteen who died and the 3 who survived -- a documentary on the town's tragedy (featuring locals), a play on the same (also featuring locals) and a week of commemorative events that is expected to include an appearance by Prime Minister Enda Kenny. 
It is a bitter twist that the town's decision to go so public with its grief comes as Addergoole is once again part of a drama bigger than itself. The debilitating financial crisis in the euro zone is chasing young Irish abroad after a brief period when, for the first time in decades, many emigrants returned home for better job prospects.
In the last year, Addergoole, with a population of fewer than 1,000 people, has lost at least 50 men and women in their 20s to emigration, and children at a local school -- which still keeps a registry of long-ago students marked ''Gone to U.S.A.'' -- talk again of leaving for work. Among residents making plans to emigrate: the son of the man who conceived the Titanic remembrances.
''What is wrong with this country that we cannot get work for our youngsters?'' asked Pauline Barrett, 60, whose great-uncle James Flynn died at age 28 aboard the Titanic, bound for New York to find jobs with two brothers already there. ''This has happened so many times. And it's happening again.''
The Addergoole Titanic Society -- formed 10 years ago when newcomers realized the region was losing its history -- has vastly expanded its ambitions from ringing a mournful church bell on Titanic anniversaries to presenting a week of activities.
''This gives us an ability to build an identity,'' said Dr. Paul Nolan, the society's chairman, whose son, Dylan, is preparing to leave for Germany. ''It's often hard to get tourism started, and this is the first step to attract people through a cultural focus.''
At the edge of the town, the society has posted a welcome sign with a black-and-white steamer and the designation ''Ireland's Titanic Village.'' Society members hope to build tourism, and an economy that might allow young people to stay, by increasing annual events and opening a Titanic memorabilia shop.
''Why speak now? We're more open,'' said Ms. Barrett, whose great-uncle was reportedly pushed away with an oar from a Titanic lifeboat with vacant seats. ''If you go back to my grandmother's generation, they were more concerned with getting a life and making a living. They took the pain and put it away. It wasn't spoken about.''
The tale of the Addergoole Fourteen is the most mournful of mournful Irish tales, starting with seeming good fortune.
In 1912, nearly every family in a town of 3,400 people pooled remittances from emigrants or sold property to send their young to America, away from the rocky soil that could not sustain the large families crowded into three-room stone cottages. Most of the Addergoole emigrants were young women, who were considered a more reliable family investment because they dutifully sent money home, according to local historians.
Those who left were not expected to return, but one did with promises of work. Catherine McGowan, 42, who ran a Chicago boardinghouse, came back in 1912 to recruit other emigrants, including her niece Annie McGowan, then 17, and others in the Addergoole Fourteen.
When Dr. Nolan moved to Addergoole in 1984, he recalled, two patients in their 90s had vivid memories of all the Titanic passengers, including Catherine, who died, and Annie, who lived.
In 2002, Mr. Nolan joined with other fellow ''blow ins'' -- the label for relative newcomers to Addergoole -- to dream up a memorial ceremony for the 90th anniversary of the Titanic's sinking.
For the society's first ritual, the church's bell, silent for 20 years, was restored. Since then, descendants gather before midnight to toll the bell every April 15 until 2:20 a.m., with somber tones for the 11 who died and thundering strike notes for the three women who survived and made it to America.
A handful of descendants participated that first year. For this anniversary, organizers expect hundreds, including descendants from New Jersey and the Chicago area, where the Addergoole Fourteen survivors -- Annie McGowan, Annie Kate Kelly and Delia McDermott -- ultimately settled. The American relatives have already financed two new stained-glass windows in the local church.
John O'Boyle, 77, said his father was one of many who never talked about the tragedy, in his case the loss of his cousins John and Mary Bourke. The brother and sister died aboard the Titanic with John Bourke's childhood sweetheart and pregnant bride, Catherine. The two women gave up their lifeboat seats because they refused to leave Mr. Bourke alone, Ms. Kelly told others. She took their place and credited them with her survival.
''I do ring the bell,'' Mr. O'Boyle said. ''It renews memories.''
For the centenary, the local volunteer force built a memorial park with donated labor and land. A 12-foot bronze sculpture of a ship's prow rises from the center along with a hearth made with stones from the ruins of the Addergoole Fourteen's cottages. The Pontoon Bridge Hotel is hosting a costumed Titanic ball.
Gillian Marsh, a producer and the wife of the town's big-animal veterinarian, raised 60,000 euros, or about $78,000, to film a documentary, ''Waking the Titanic.'' The documentary has aired in Canada, and other countries are showing interest, she said.
One of the descendants in her film is Patrick Canavan, an elderly man whose red-haired ancestor of the same name was a local hero. According to survivors, the ancestor, 21, guided other passengers from third-class steerage through to the lifeboats but was barred from taking a place.
Mr. Canavan's nephew, Paul, 23, is performing the role of his ancestor in a community play about the Addergoole Fourteen. And like the man whose life he will portray, he is dreaming of fortune abroad, laying plans to join his sister in Plano, Tex.
Despite the grander commemoration, there will be one constant this year: the bell will again toll, and some say its keening will tie the past to the present.
''When my two children are grown, the chances of them remaining here in Ireland are slim,'' said Patricia Keigher, a member of the Addergoole Titanic Society. ''The bell ringing out across the lake and the mountain is a call to say: You may not be here, but we are still thinking of you.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

As the article correctly noted, it is in County Mayo, not County Galway. (Addergoole is a common name for villages in several Irish counties. County Mayo has two Addergooles and County Galway has four.)

PERSON: Fang Lizhi 

HEADLINE: Fang Lizhi, Lodestar of Chinese Dissidents, Dies at 76

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES; Mia Li contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Fang Lizhi, whose advocacy of economic and democratic freedoms shaped China's brief era of student dissent that ended with the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and his exile, died on Friday in Tucson, Ariz., his son, Fang Ke, said Saturday.
Mr. Fang was 76. The cause of death was not known, his son said in a telephone interview. 
A brilliant scientist -- and in his early years a loyal member of the Communist Party -- Mr. Fang had become China's best-known dissident by the 1980s, his views shaped by persecution in China and exposure to Western political concepts abroad.
In early 1989, he published an open letter to China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, calling for the release of political prisoners. The letter helped galvanize a pro-democracy student movement that spring, peaking on June 4, when Chinese troops killed hundreds of student protesters among the masses occupying Tiananmen Square.
Fearing arrest, Mr. Fang sought refuge with his family at the United States Embassy in Beijing. President George Bush's decision to grant him protection there provoked a yearlong diplomatic standoff with the Chinese that ended, after secret negotiations, with a decision by Chinese leaders in June 1990 to allow the family to leave China, ostensibly for medical treatment.
Mr. Fang later became a professor of physics at the University of Arizona in Tucson, where he taught and continued to speak out on human rights until his death.
Word of his death initially spread on Twitter, where veterans of the 1989 democracy movement mourned his passing and proposed a rights award in his honor.
''No words can express my grief,'' wrote Wang Dan, who was imprisoned for four years for his leadership role in the Tiananmen protests. ''Fang Lizhi has inspired the '89 generation and has awakened the people's yearning for human rights and democracy.''
Mr. Fang's willingness to test the boundaries of his eventual academic discipline, the physics of the universe, seemed foreshadowed even at an early age by his penchant for questioning authority.
Born in 1936 to a Hangzhou postal clerk and his wife, Mr. Fang entered the prestigious Beijing University as a youth and excelled in physics. According to a 1988 article in The Atlantic Monthly, he quickly flouted official norms, taking over a founding meeting of the university's Communist Youth League and urging students to think independently instead of accepting party dogma on proper academic behavior.
He joined China's Institute of Modern Physics after graduating in 1956, only to be expelled from the Communist Party a year later during Mao Zedong's Anti-Rightist Campaign, a movement against intellectuals and others who were seen to have strayed from Communist principles. His offense was writing an essay criticizing political interference in scientific research.
Mr. Fang was considered too valuable to allow party censure to affect his work, and he continued to rise in academia. But when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, he was again persecuted, first imprisoned and then sent to rural Anhui Province to work with peasants. He carried with him but one book, on astrophysics, and his repeated readings of it led him to change his research focus from fundamental physics to cosmology.
Still an outcast, he continued to flout convention. In 1972, Mr. Fang and colleagues at the University of Science and Technology of China in Anhui province published a paper titled ''A Solution of the Cosmological Equations in Scalar-Tensor Theory, with Mass and Blackbody Radiation.''
''This innocuous-sounding article met with a furious response from leading theoretical circles of the party,'' The China Quarterly recounted in a 1990 article. ''Fang et al. had broken a longstanding taboo by introducing the Big Bang theory to the Chinese physics world. Insofar as the Big Bang contradicted Engels's declaration that the universe must be infinite in space and time, Fang's paper was tantamount to heresy.''
Like most of the persecuted, Mr. Fang was rehabilitated after Mao's death in 1976, and in Deng's more open China he traveled to conferences abroad, earning a worldwide scientific reputation. But his exposure to foreign political concepts sharpened his doubts about the Communist system, and he began to write and lecture on its shortcomings.
During a brief flowering of political openness, he gained a large following in China and abroad for his outspoken criticism of the Communist system. But in January 1987, after he helped organize pro-reform student demonstrations in cities across China, he was again expelled from the party and stripped of his job as vice president of the University of Science and Technology of China.
Anger over the demonstrations among Communist Politburo members forced the resignation days later of Hu Yaobang, the reform-minded party general secretary, who had presided over the period of openness. Mr. Hu's death in April 1989 set off the final round of student protests that ended with the occupation of Tiananmen Square and the subsequent assault on the demonstrators.
Freedom did not change Mr. Fang's disregard for authority. Not long after leaving the American Embassy for the West, he angered his host, James Lilley, the American ambassador to China, by publicly accusing the United States of holding China to a lower human rights standard than it applied to the Soviet Union and its treatment of dissidents. The charge prompted a brisk response from President Bush, who said Mr. Fang's views were mistaken and outdated.
But Mr. Fang consistently reserved his sharpest criticism for his homeland.
''Human rights are fundamental privileges that people have from birth, such as the right to think and be educated, the right to marry, and so on. But we Chinese consider those rights dangerous,'' he said 26 years ago in a speech to students at Tongji University in Shanghai.
''If we are the democratic country we say we are, these rights should be stronger here than elsewhere. But at present they are nothing more than an abstract idea.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary last Sunday about the Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi misidentified the university where he had been vice president. It is the University of Science and Technology of China, whose main campus is in Anhui Province; it is not Anhui University of Science and Technology or ''Anhui's branch of the University of Science and Technology of China.''

HEADLINE: The Army as a Cornerstone

BYLINE: By DAVID F. MELCHER. 
As told to Elizabeth Olson.

 BODY:
MY early years growing up in Allentown, Pa., gave no hint that I would have a 32-year career in the Army. I came from a middle-class family, played trumpet in the high school band, ran track and joined the football team. I had a newspaper route, and in the summer I washed dishes at a country club.
I became interested in going to the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., when I learned in junior high school that my father had been awarded a Silver Star as a combat medic in World War II. Dad was a high school social studies teacher who, like many veterans, never talked about his service. 
At West Point, I thrived on the discipline and leadership training. I ran track, played intramural sports, was the top-ranked cadet in physical fitness over four years and graduated near the top of my class. Three weeks after earning my civil engineering degree in 1976, I married my high school sweetheart, Marla, and joined the Army Corps of Engineers.
After I went through Army Ranger training at Fort Benning, Ga., I was posted to Fort Ord in California. There is nothing more challenging, or rewarding, than that first experience as a platoon leader. I was hooked on the Army.
Our first daughter was born at Fort Ord, and in 1981 the Army sent the three of us to Boston so I could attend Harvard Business School. I then taught economics at West Point, where future Army leaders like David Petraeus and Martin Dempsey were also teaching.
In 1986, our second daughter was born, and our family moved to Washington. I was chosen for a White House fellowship and was the executive assistant to the director of the Office of Management and Budget. I met President Reagan and had a front-row view on how the country's civilian leadership tackled deficit reduction and similar thorny issues we are still facing today.
In 1989, I deployed to Panama as a battalion operations officer during the mission that ousted Manuel Noriega. Three years later, it was back for a second tour in Washington. I like to joke that the Pentagon is a magnet since I spent 12 years of my career there.
From 1992 to 2002, I served as commander in three locations. I was commander of an engineer battalion at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks, Alaska, a regimental commander teaching leadership to West Point cadets, and brigade commander at Fort Hood in Texas.
We moved a lot and our daughters had to change schools often, but they learned to adapt to change -- with much guidance from my wife. This didn't sour them on military life, as both would join the Army -- one would serve in Iraq and the other in Kuwait.
I became a brigadier general in 1999, first doing Army strategic planning, then commanding the Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division in Dallas, which oversees public infrastructure. By 2002, I was back for my fourth, and final, Pentagon tour. My job for the next six years was to equip the Army at war, and to help oversee allocation of the Army's annual budget; I retired in 2008 as a lieutenant general.
In August of that year, I joined ITT Defense, then part of the ITT Corporation, as vice president of strategy, and was named president four months later. In October last year, the unit was spun off. I was named chief executive, charged with leading the company, now called ITT Exelis, through the current era of declining military spending.
Even in these leaner times, my life experiences, especially the coaching and mentoring I received, have been invaluable in setting company goals and developing leadership among our employees.

HEADLINE: America's Place in the New World

BYLINE: By CHARLES A. KUPCHAN. 
A professor of international relations at Georgetown, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and the author of ''No One's World: The West, the Rising Rest, and the Coming Global Turn.''

 BODY:
Washington
IT'S election season again, and the main contenders for the Oval Office are knocking themselves out to reassure Americans that their nation remains at the pinnacle of the global pecking order. Mitt Romney recently declared that ''this century must be an American century.'' Not to be outdone, President Obama insisted in his State of the Union address that ''anyone who tells you that America is in decline'' doesn't ''know what they're talking about.''
Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama might overdo it a bit, but they're actually not far off the mark. Despite two draining wars, sluggish growth and a diffusion of power from the West to China and the ''rising rest,'' a combination of economic resilience and military superiority will keep the United States at or near the top for decades.
Still, they're missing the point. The most potent challenge to America's dominance comes not from the continuing redistribution of global power, but from a subtler change: the new forms of governance and capitalism being forged by China and other rising nations. 
The democratic, secular and free-market model that has become synonymous with the era of Western primacy is being challenged by state capitalism in China, Russia and the Persian Gulf sheikdoms. Political Islam is rising in step with democracy across the Middle East. And left-wing populism is taking hold from India to Brazil. Rather than following the West's path of development and obediently accepting their place in the liberal international order, rising nations are fashioning their own versions of modernity and pushing back against the West's ideological ambitions.
As this century unfolds, sustaining American power will be the easy part. The hard part will be adjusting to the loss of America's ideological dominance and fashioning consensus and compromise in an increasingly diverse and unwieldy world.
If American leaders remain blind to this new reality and continue to expect conformity to Western values, they will not only misunderstand emerging powers, but also alienate the many countries tired of being herded toward Western standards of governance.
This transition won't be easy. Since the founding era, the American elite and the public have believed in the universality of their model. The end of the cold war only deepened this conviction; after the collapse of the Soviet Union, democratic capitalism seemed the only game in town. But the supposed ''end of history'' didn't last. Many developing nations have recently acquired the economic and political wherewithal to consolidate brands of modernity that present durable alternatives.
The last 30 years of Chinese development, for example, look nothing like the path followed by Europe and North America. The West's ascent was led by its middle class, which overturned absolute monarchy, insisted on a separation of church and state and unleashed the entrepreneurial and technological potential vital to the Industrial Revolution. In contrast, the authoritarian Chinese state has won over its middle class, and with reason: its economy outperforms those of Western competitors, enriching its bourgeoisie and lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty.
And in today's fast and fluid global economy, the control afforded by state capitalism has its distinct advantages, which is precisely why Russia, Vietnam and others are following China's lead.
The Middle East is similarly set to confound American expectations. Participatory politics may be arriving in the region, but most of the Muslim world recognizes no distinction between the realms of the sacred and the secular; mosque and state are inseparable, ensuring that political Islam is returning as coercive regimes fall. A poll last year revealed that nearly two-thirds of Egyptians want civil law to adhere strictly to the Koran, one of the main reasons Islamists recently prevailed in the country's parliamentary elections.
And Egypt is the rule, not the exception. If nothing else, the Arab Spring has shown that democratization does not equal Westernization, and that it is past time for Washington to rethink its longstanding alignment with the region's secular parties.
True, rising powers like India and Brazil are stable, secular democracies that appear to be hewing closely to the Western model. But these countries have democratized while their populations consist mainly of the urban and rural poor, not the middle class. As a result, both nations have embraced a left-wing populism wary of free markets and of representative institutions that seem to deliver benefits only to a privileged elite.
Rising democracies are also following their own paths on foreign policy, foiling America's effort to turn India into a strategic partner. New Delhi is at odds with Washington on issues ranging from Afghanistan to climate change, and it is deepening commercial ties with Iran just as America is tightening sanctions. Standing up to America still holds cachet in India and Brazil, one reason New Delhi and Brasilia line up with Washington less than 25 percent of the time at the United Nations.
Washington has long presumed that the world's democracies will as a matter of course ally themselves with the United States; common values supposedly mean common interests. But if India and Brazil are any indication, even rising powers that are stable democracies will chart their own courses, expediting the arrival of a world that no longer plays by Western rules.
The 21st century will not be the first time the world's major powers embraced quite different models of governance and commerce: during the 17th century, the Holy Roman Empire, Ottoman Empire, Mughal Empire, Qing Dynasty and Tokugawa Shogunate each ran its affairs according to its own distinct rules and culture.
But these powers were largely self-contained; they interacted little and thus had no need to agree on a set of common rules to guide their relations.
This century, in contrast, will be the first time in history in which multiple versions of order and modernity coexist in an interconnected world; no longer will the West anchor globalization. Multiple power centers, and the competing models they represent, will vie on a more level playing field. Effective global governance will require forging common ground amid an equalizing distribution of power and rising ideological diversity.
With that in mind, Washington should acknowledge that America's brand of capitalism and secular democracy must now compete in the marketplace of ideas.
To be sure, even as it adopts a more pluralistic approach, the United States should defend not just its interests, but also its values. It should continue to promote democracy, stand resolute in the defense of human rights and do what it can to stop indiscriminate violence of the sort unleashed by Syria's government.
But American leaders do their country no service when they trumpet a new American century or topple governments in the name of spreading Western values. Doing so will drive away the very nations the United States needs on its side to confront dangerous pariahs and manage a world in which power is broadly shared.
Standing by its own values while also recognizing that there are alternative forms of responsible and responsive governance would ultimately elevate the nation's moral authority, making it more likely that other countries would be as respectful of America's preferences as America should be of theirs.

HEADLINE: New York Economics, Inquisitions

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Near the end of his new survey of the New York City economy over the last half-century, the business journalist Greg David offers some hope, as well as a dire warning. ''Wall Street may save the city again,'' he writes.
If the financial sector and its workers prosper, the city will too, buoyed by growing tax revenues. But he cautions: ''If not, the next mayor will face the daunting task of leading New York into a future much less prosperous than its present.'' And if that mayor turns away from the business-friendly policies of recent administrations, he continues, ''The result could well be another economic and fiscal cataclysm.'' 
In ''Modern New York: The Life and Economics of a City'' (Palgrave Macmillan, $28), Mr. David, a columnist for and former editor of Crain's New York Business, argues convincingly that Wall Street has been largely responsible for the city's cycle of booms and busts since the 1960s.
As a result, the city's relationship to that industry has been all-important. Mr. David examines the government policies promoted by Mayors Fiorello H. La Guardia and John V. Lindsay, who took the view that ''business's primary role was to provide the revenue for city government to right social imbalances.'' In contrast, he writes, the ''fundamental'' philosophy of Mayors Edward I. Koch, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg has been ''putting the economy and the businesses that make it work at the center of policy.'' It is clear that Mr. David favors the more recent view.
If his verdict on the mayoralty of Mr. Lindsay seems unnecessarily harsh, given the societal turmoil that the city confronted in the late 1960s and early '70s, the credit he gives to Mr. Giuliani (for curbing crime) and to Mr. Bloomberg (for encouraging development) may be equally overstated, in view of the author's premise that Wall Street's cycles are largely independent of municipal government policy. Mr. David argues, though, that the Koch-Giuliani-Bloomberg approach gave the city an edge when Wall Street was booming.
Still, he cautions that because the gap between rich and poor is growing, ''the Koch-Giuliani-Bloomberg philosophy is under increasing attack'' from Mr. Bloomberg's likely Democratic successors.
After working as a screenwriter, a news producer and a documentary filmmaker, Mark Allen Smith has written his first novel. That he is already working on a sequel is good news.
In ''The Inquisitor'' (Henry Holt, $27), Mr. Smith introduces readers to Geiger, whose talent is ''information retrieval,'' a sanitized way of describing a professional torturer who extracts intelligence by inflicting physical and psychological suffering. New York is the vividly summoned locale for this thriller, which resonates in the debate over torture in the war on terror.
Mr. Smith crisply creates a protagonist who provokes unresolved ambivalence -- in the reader as well as in other characters. As he writes, ''When the client and Geiger had finally met, in this room, the first thing he'd noticed was that Geiger hardly ever blinked. The client prided himself on his cool, but Geiger had put him on edge.''
Back in the day, a graphic novel was called a comic book. But there is not much that is comic in Leela Corman's debut novel, ''Unterzakhn'' (Schocken, $24.95). Ms. Corman has produced a sensitive, insightful portrayal of twin sisters growing up as Jewish immigrants on the Lower East Side a century ago, and their divergent paths. She dedicates the book to New York, which the sisters and their hardscrabble stories personify.

HEADLINE: Finding Big Profits Along the Roads Less Traveled

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
MANAGERS of three of the better-performing mutual funds in the first quarter do not mind zigging while others zag. The captains of the Ivy Cundill Global Value fund and the John Hancock Global Opportunities fund seek stocks that others are shunning, while the steward at Fidelity Convertible Securities hangs onto investments far longer than his peers.
Distress and Success 
Andrew W. Massie, lead manager of Ivy Cundill Global Value, says he hunts for companies that look like ''disasters'' -- those that have experienced serious setbacks that have pushed their prices far below his estimate of fair value. ''We like cheap stocks, so negative sentiment is our friend,'' he said.
Lately, his taste for distress led him to Bank of America, which was battered by the financial crisis and its acquisition of Merrill Lynch but has shown signs of resurgence. Its stock rose nearly 75 percent in the first quarter. Mr. Massie had jumped in when other investors were shying away.
''We saw discipline coming into the loan book, and we were able to buy Bank of America at as low as 30 percent of book value,'' he said. Book value is calculated by subtracting the liabilities on the balance sheet from assets. It's a conservative estimate of what a company might be worth if liquidated.
Mr. Massie, who calls himself a deep-value investor, says he digs into balance sheets in hunting stocks, generally favoring companies with little or no debt. He concentrates his portfolio -- he held just 29 stocks at the end of 2011 -- so as not to dilute returns from his favorite ideas. The average stock fund tracked by Morningstar holds 182 stocks.
Another company that attracted him recently was Toyota. Its shares had sunk after it had to recall millions of cars. To evaluate Toyota, he compared it with Honda Motor and ended up liking Honda more. Its shares, too, had dropped, but its motorcycle business (something Toyota lacked) made it the stronger company in his view. ''Honda's motorcycle business is dominant in emerging markets,'' he said.
Mr. Massie's fund, with an expense ratio of 1.8 percent, returned 20.5 percent in the first quarter, versus 12.6 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500.
Worldwide Treasure Hunt
Like Mr. Massie, Christopher C. Arbuthnot, lead manager of John Hancock Global Opportunities, isn't afraid to seize stocks that scare others. For his developed-world investments, he says he seeks ''misunderstood, unloved companies.'' Thus he, too, owned Bank of America during its recent run.
''B. of A. is a leading financial firm in the U.S., and it gained market share last year,'' he said. ''So the underlying business was still strong, and when we started buying, the stock was $5.''
Contrarianism also led Mr. Arbuthnot to Italy -- one of the places at the center of Europe's current crisis; it's struggling with slow growth and high sovereign debt. But it remains a wealthy country and is home to sturdy, well-run companies.
''Last year, Italy was one of the worst markets out there,'' he said, ''but we knew there were stocks that weren't impaired -- that just happened to be in Italy.''
Among them was Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A., the maker of shoes and accessories. Its shares rose more than 50 percent in the first quarter.
Mr. Arbuthnot also invests in emerging markets, where he favors fast growers.
''There, we know there's growth,'' he said, ''and we want to capture it.''
Lately he has found opportunities in India and Brazil. He said that he viewed management teams of companies like Reliance Infrastructure in Mumbai and OGX in Rio de Janeiro as more shareholder-oriented than those in China. Chinese managers sometimes favor revenue growth over profitability and can be beholden to their government, he said.
Mr. Arbuthnot's fund, which carries an expense ratio of 1.47 percent, returned 22.1 percent in the first quarter.
Testing the Thesis
Thomas T. Soviero, of Fidelity Convertible Securities, also likes to hike trails ignored by other managers. For example, he holds securities longer than the typical convertible-bond fund, selling only about a quarter of his portfolio each year. The average such fund tracked by Morningstar sells 63 percent in a year.
''I'm inclined to ride out short-term ups and downs,'' he said. ''If I believe in something and it goes down, I'll buy more. If the thesis breaks -- say, the thesis was, 'This company has pricing power,' and a price war breaks out -- I'd sell. But if the thesis holds, I'll hang in there.''
Convertible bonds combine features of bonds and stocks: they are issued as bonds and pay interest but can be converted by the issuer into shares of stock. With their hybrid nature, they are seen as giving some of the downside protection of bonds along with some of the upside potential of stocks.
Mr. Soviero's fund, with an expense ratio of 0.61 percent, returned 11.9 percent in the quarter.
One sector where Mr. Soviero has lately made a big bet is American autos. Convertibles, both bonds and preferred stock, issued by General Motors and Ford Motor accounted for 12 percent of the fund's portfolio at the end of February.
''There's a rebirth happening in U.S. manufacturing, and the automotives are participating in that,'' he said. ''You've got lower wages from restructurings. You have a lower U.S. dollar. And you've got the average age of a U.S. car at 11 years, which is the highest in decades. So there's a tailwind in the sector.''
A lower dollar makes American exports more competitive, and older cars increase the likelihood that people will buy new ones as the economy improves.
Even so, Mr. Soviero isn't counting on an uninterrupted climb for domestic carmakers or any company in which he invests. If anything, the market's recent run has made him cautious.
''It was a tremendous quarter -- the best first quarter since 1998,'' he said. ''So I wouldn't be surprised if we took a breather in the capital markets sometime soon. When sentiment gets way too favorable, that can be a contrarian signal.''

HEADLINE: A Friendship Dating to 1976 Resonates in 2012

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
The two young men had woefully little in common: one was a wealthy Mormon from Michigan, the other a middle-class Jew from Israel.
But in 1976, the lives of Mitt Romney and Benjamin Netanyahu intersected, briefly but indelibly, in the 16th-floor offices of the Boston Consulting Group, where both had been recruited as corporate advisers. At the most formative time of their careers, they sized each other up during the firm's weekly brainstorming sessions, absorbing the same profoundly analytical view of the world.
That shared experience decades ago led to a warm friendship, little known to outsiders, that is now rich with political intrigue. Mr. Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, is making the case for military action against Iran as Mr. Romney, the likely Republican presidential nominee, is attacking the Obama administration for not supporting Mr. Netanyahu more robustly.
The relationship between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Romney -- nurtured over meals in Boston, New York and Jerusalem, strengthened by a network of mutual friends and heightened by their conservative ideologies -- has resulted in an unusually frank exchange of advice and insights on topics like politics, economics and the Middle East. 
When Mr. Romney was the governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Netanyahu offered him firsthand pointers on how to shrink the size of government. When Mr. Netanyahu wanted to encourage pension funds to divest from businesses tied to Iran, Mr. Romney counseled him on which American officials to meet with. And when Mr. Romney first ran for president, Mr. Netanyahu presciently asked him whether he thought Newt Gingrich would ever jump into the race.
Only a few weeks ago, on Super Tuesday, Mr. Netanyahu delivered a personal briefing by telephone to Mr. Romney about the situation in Iran.
''We can almost speak in shorthand,'' Mr. Romney said in an interview. ''We share common experiences and have a perspective and underpinning which is similar.''
Mr. Netanyahu attributed their ''easy communication'' to what he called ''B.C.G.'s intellectually rigorous boot camp.''
''So despite our very different backgrounds,'' he said through an aide, ''my sense is that we employ similar methods in analyzing problems and coming up with solutions for them.''
The ties between Mr. Romney and Mr. Netanyahu stand out because there is little precedent for two politicians of their stature to have such a history together that predates their entry into government. And that history could well influence decision-making at a time when the United States may face crucial questions about whether to attack Iran's nuclear facilities or support Israel in such an action.
Mr. Romney has suggested that he would not make any significant policy decisions about Israel without consulting Mr. Netanyahu -- a level of deference that could raise eyebrows given Mr. Netanyahu's polarizing reputation, even as it appeals to the neoconservatives and evangelical Christians who are fiercely protective of Israel.
In a telling exchange during a debate in December, Mr. Romney criticized Mr. Gingrich for making a disparaging remark about Palestinians, declaring: ''Before I made a statement of that nature, I'd get on the phone to my friend Bibi Netanyahu and say: 'Would it help if I say this? What would you like me to do?' ''
Martin S. Indyk, a United States ambassador to Israel in the Clinton administration, said that whether intentional or not, Mr. Romney's statement implied that he would ''subcontract Middle East policy to Israel.''
''That, of course, would be inappropriate,'' he added.
Mr. Netanyahu insists that he is neutral in the presidential election, but he has at best a fraught relationship with President Obama. For years, the prime minister has skillfully mobilized many Jewish groups and Congressional Republicans to pressure the Obama administration into taking a more confrontational approach against Iran.
''To the extent that their personal relationship would give Netanyahu entree to the Romney White House in a way that he doesn't now have to the Obama White House,'' Mr. Indyk said, ''the prime minister would certainly consider that to be a significant advantage.''
It was a quirk of history that the two men met at all. In the 1970s, both chose to attend business school in Boston -- Harvard for Mr. Romney, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for Mr. Netanyahu. After graduating near the top of their classes, they had their pick of jobs at the nation's biggest and most prestigious consulting firms.
The Boston Consulting Group did not yet qualify as either. Its founder, Bruce D. Henderson, was considered brilliant but idiosyncratic; his unorthodox theories -- about measuring a company's success by its market share, and dividing businesses into categories like ''cash cows'' and ''dogs'' -- were then regarded as outside the mainstream of corporate consulting.
As Mr. Romney recalled, the faculty and students at Harvard Business School routinely mocked the firm's recruitment posters. ''Boston Consulting was at the time a firm that seemed somewhat under siege,'' he said.
But the company's status as a pioneering upstart, nipping on the heels of bigger blue-chip firms like McKinsey and Booz Allen, fostered a deep camaraderie among its young employees, who traveled around the country advising clients like General Foods and the Mead Corporation.
Even in a firm of 100 M.B.A.'s, Mr. Romney and Mr. Netanyahu managed to stand apart, as much for their biography as for their brainpower. Mr. Romney's father, a former governor of Michigan, had sought the Republican presidential nomination a few years earlier. Mr. Netanyahu had his own exotic resume: he had just completed a tour of duty in an elite special forces unit of the Israeli military.
''Both clearly had an aura around them,'' said Alan Weyl, who worked at the firm from 1975 to 1989.
Although they never worked closely on a project together, Mr. Romney and Mr. Netanyahu, competitive by nature, left deep impressions on each other, which appear to have only grown.
Mr. Romney, never known for his lack of self-confidence, still recalls the sense of envy he felt watching Mr. Netanyahu effortlessly hold court during the firm's Monday morning meetings, when consultants presented their work and fielded questions from their colleagues. The sessions were renowned for their sometimes grueling interrogations.
''He was a strong personality with a distinct point of view,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I aspired to the same kind of perspective.''
Over dinner years later, aides said, Mr. Netanyahu would reveal the depth of his own scorekeeping, when he quipped, with mostly playful chagrin, that Mr. Romney had been ''Henderson's favorite.''
''His star,'' the prime minister said of Mr. Romney's time at Boston Consulting, ''had already risen.''
Mr. Romney worked at the company from 1975 to 1977; Mr. Netanyahu was involved from 1976 to 1978. But a month after Mr. Netanyahu arrived, he returned to Israel to start an antiterrorism foundation in memory of his brother, an officer killed while leading the hostage rescue force at Entebbe, Uganda. An aide said he sporadically returned to the company over the rest of that two-year period.
Mr. Romney later decamped to Bain & Company, a rival of Boston Consulting. They did, however, maintain a significant link: at Bain, Mr. Romney worked closely with Fleur Cates, Mr. Netanyahu's second wife. (Ms. Cates and Mr. Netanyahu divorced in the mid-1980s, but she remains in touch with Mr. Romney.)
The men reconnected shortly after 2003 when Mr. Romney became the governor of Massachusetts. Mr. Netanyahu paid him a visit, eager to swap tales of government life.
Mr. Netanyahu, who had recently stepped down as Israel's finance minister, regaled Mr. Romney with stories of how, in the tradition of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, he had challenged unionized workers over control of their pensions, reduced taxes and privatized formerly government-run industries, reducing the role of government in private enterprise.
He encouraged Mr. Romney to look for ways to do the same. As Mr. Romney recalled, Mr. Netanyahu told him of a favorite memory from basic training about a soldier trying to race his comrades with a fat man atop his shoulders. Naturally, he loses.
''Government,'' Mr. Romney recalled him saying, ''is the guy on your shoulders.''
As governor, Mr. Romney said, he frequently repeated the story to the heads of various agencies, reminding them that their job as regulators was to ''catch the bad guys, but also to encourage the good guys and to make business more successful in our state.''
A few years later, Mr. Romney had dinner with Mr. Netanyahu at a private home in the Jewish quarter of the Old City, in central Jerusalem, where the two spent hours discussing the American and Israeli economies. When Mr. Netanyahu informed Mr. Romney of a personal campaign to persuade American pension funds to divest from businesses tied to Iran, Mr. Romney offered up his Rolodex.
Before he left Israel, Mr. Romney set up several meetings with government officials in the United States for his old colleague. ''I immediately saw the wisdom of his thinking,'' Mr. Romney said.
Back in Massachusetts, Mr. Romney sent out letters to legislators requesting that the public pension funds they controlled sell off investments from corporations doing business with Iran.
Even as Mr. Netanyahu, a keen and eager student of American politics, has tried to avoid any hint of favoritism in the presidential election, friends say he has paid especially close attention to Mr. Romney's political fortunes in this campaign season.
And the prime minister keeps open lines of communication to the candidate. When it was Mr. Gingrich's turn to leap to the top of the polls, Mr. Netanyahu was startled in January by an article exploring why Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire casino executive and outspoken supporter of Israel, was devoting millions of dollars to back Mr. Gingrich. It described Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Adelson as close friends.
Mr. Netanyahu's office quickly relayed a message to a senior Romney adviser, Dan Senor: the prime minister had played no role in Mr. Adelson's decision to bankroll a Romney rival.

HEADLINE: Cultural Liberalism Is Not Enough

BYLINE: By ERIC ALTERMAN. 
Eric Alterman, the media columnist of The Nation, is a co-author of ''The Cause: The Fight for American Liberalism From Franklin Roosevelt to , Barack Obama,'' from which this essay is adapted.

 BODY:
As White House aides and Congressional leaders flood the media with dueling leaks about just how far President Obama was willing to go last summer to meet the budget-cutting demands of House Speaker John A. Boehner, many liberals have reacted with shock and horror at how much of their historic achievement the president appears to have been ready to bargain away. If a Democratic president could consider cutting America's shredded safety net further when unemployment remained stiffly high and the country was undergoing an explosion of inequality, was the ''liberal moment'' of American politics finally over?
Yet Maryland recently became the eighth state to join the same-sex marriage club (which includes the District of Columbia). Rush Limbaugh was force-fed a triple helping of crow for his failed attempt at ''slut shaming,'' after opening up the gender gap again. Women, young people, college graduates and mixed-race Americans, surveys indicate, are spurning conservative arguments about contraception, same-sex marriage and sexual freedom. 
In other words, economic liberalism is on life-support, while cultural liberalism thrives. The obvious question is why. The simple answer is that cultural liberalism comes cheap. Supporting same-sex marriage or a woman's right to choose does not cost the wealthy anything or restrict their ability to become wealthier. But there is more to it than that.
The United States has undoubtedly become a fairer, more open and less oppressive society thanks largely to the political and cultural struggles waged by liberals during the past half century. The progress in securing basic human and civil rights for women, African-Americans, gay men and lesbians, immigrants and their children, Americans with disabilities and so many others is a testament to liberal courage in the face of adversity and oppression. This was the work of ''those who marched and those who sang, those who sat in and those who stood firm, those who organized and those who mobilized,'' as Barack Obama recalled on the occasion of the unveiling of the memorial statue of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the National Mall in October.
Liberal optimism regarding race and progress had been buoyed by the belief that, with the right experts running the government, an expanding economic pie could be guaranteed indefinitely, which would in turn purchase peace between feuding factions. But liberals had no ready response when the global economy chose not to cooperate, first with the rise in oil prices following the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and then with the exodus of exactly the kinds of manufacturing jobs that had provided the engine driving the expansion of the middle class in the first place.
The failure of liberals to plan for the failure of their plans -- what Saul Bellow once called the ''Good Intentions Paving Company'' -- resulted in a bitter, resentful scramble for the remaining scraps. Liberal politicians proved unable to face up to the harsh realities. ''The great liberal failing of this time,'' Daniel Patrick Moynihan observed as early as 1968, was ''constantly to over-promise and to overstate, and thereby constantly to appear to under-perform.'' This not only alienated key constituencies, but it also diminished the trust between the governing and the governed that previous generations of liberals had worked so hard to earn.
Caught in the crosswinds of so many simultaneous crises -- I have not even mentioned Vietnam -- many liberals chose to focus, rather perversely, on a ''rights'' agenda and the internecine fights it engendered within their increasingly fractured coalition. They lost sight of the essential element that had made the coalition possible in the first place: the sense that liberalism stood with the common man and woman in their struggle against economic forces too large and powerful to be faced by individuals on their own.
Liberals must find a way to combine their cultural successes with new approaches to achieving economic equality. But they must do so unambiguously and unequivocally. That brings us back to President Obama.
The president often sounds as if he believes in a vigorous economic populism. Just this past Tuesday he told the American Society of News Editors: ''In this country broad-based prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few. It has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle class. That's how a generation who went to college on the G.I. Bill, including my grandfather, helped build the most prosperous economy the world has ever known.'' But so far the president has been unwilling to put his budgetary moneys where his mouth is.
In fact, Obama has proved far more adept at adapting his positions toward the increasingly radical views enunciated by the leaders of the Republican Party than he has in articulating -- and sticking to -- an alternative vision of the role of government in ensuring a fair economic shake for all its citizens.
He asked the right question on Tuesday when he said: ''Can we succeed as a country where a shrinking number of people do exceedingly well, while a growing number struggle to get by? Or are we better off when everyone gets a fair shot?'' But as liberals have repeatedly learned to their dismay, the devil is not in the poetry of the president's election-time rhetoric but in the prose of his apparent eagerness to seek out a compromise on almost any Republican proposal offered him. Liberals have spent decades trying to adjudicate the claims of their conflicting constituencies without focusing sharply enough on the economic well-being of a broad section of Americans. A fight for fairness and equity could unite the working poor and middle class in a winning coalition for the future, but the problem today for liberals is less the message itself than the credibility of the messenger.
While signaling his support for much if not all of liberalism's cultural agenda, President Obama has occasionally tossed economic liberals a rhetorical bone -- but he has also worried too much about deficit reduction. In this regard, Obama embodies the unsolved liberal conundrum. Were the president to embrace a genuinely populist economic agenda and mean it this time -- just as Franklin D. Roosevelt did in his second term -- he might go a long way toward solving the problem that has dogged liberalism now for nearly half a century.

HEADLINE: A Rich Game of Thrones: C.E.O. Pay Gains May Have Slowed, But the Numbers Are Still Numbing

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
IS any C.E.O. worth $1 million a day?
That's roughly $42,000 an hour. Or $700 a minute. Or $12 a second.
Think of it this way: In the time it took to read those words, you could've pocketed $100. Finish this article and -- well, you do the math.
At Apple, the answer to that question is an emphatic yes, and then some. Not since Steve Jobs has a chief executive at Apple, or any other public American corporation, for that matter, been as richly rewarded in stock as Timothy D. Cook, who succeeded Mr. Jobs as chief executive last August, a few months before Mr. Jobs died.
Mr. Cook was paid a cash salary of roughly $900,000 in 2011. On its own, that would have been a ho-hum paycheck for a top American C.E.O. in recent years. 
But then came a wild extra, a one-time award, in the form of Apple stock. It was initially worth a staggering $376.2 million. As of the end of last week, it was valued at roughly $634 million, reflecting Apple's soaring share price.
Many credit Mr. Cook, along with Mr. Jobs, for Apple's recent success. And the company is quick to note that Mr. Cook's pay package extends over 10 years. One-half of his stock is scheduled to vest in 2016, and the other in 2021, provided that Mr. Cook still works for Apple. And, at a time when some investors seethe over far smaller paychecks -- a mere eight figures is relatively commonplace for top chief executives these days -- Apple's shareholders are hardly up in arms over the magnitude of Mr. Cook's reward. To the contrary, a vast majority voted in favor of it.
Of course, most of us can't begin to wrap our heads around pay figures like these. An American with a bachelor's degree, after all, typically makes $2.3 million, not in a year, but over a lifetime, according to a recent study from Georgetown University.
Data on C.E.O. compensation in 2011, albeit preliminary, confirm what many of us already know: the top brass generally do much, much better than the rest of us, whether times are good or bad. After the ups and downs of the recent boom-bust years, pay among the 100 best-paid chief executives at big American corporations held fairly steady in 2011, according to Equilar, which reviewed C.E.O. compensation for The New York Times. Here are some numbers worth knowing:
Among the 100 top-paid C.E.O.s, overall pay last year rose a scant 2 percent from 2010.
The median chief executive in this group took home $14.4 million -- compared with the average annual American salary of $45,230.
In all, the combined compensation of these 100 C.E.O.s totaled $2.1 billion, the rough equivalent of the estimated annual economic output of Sierra Leone.
The full picture won't become clear until June or so, when corporate proxy statements will detail the full range of executive compensation. But data available as of March 30 suggests that a new elite is emerging in corporate America: C.E.O.'s who make $10 million-plus a year.
Granted, these are chief executives of publicly traded companies, the kind of businesses anyone can buy into on the stock market. Next to pay in the rarefied realms of private American capitalism -- the multitrillion-dollar world of hedge funds, private equity and the like -- these C.E.O.'s might seem like pikers. Top hedge fund managers collectively earned $14.4 billion last year.
But the Equilar figures also hint at the myriad ways executive compensation is as tailored as a bespoke suit. It is those custom details -- the one-off huge stock grants, in Mr. Cook's case, the token $1 annual salaries or evaporating bonuses in others -- that can turn dull proxy statements into page-turners.
Mr. Cook is an extreme example of this phenomenon. He is, experts agree, an outlier -- the only chief executive on the Equilar list to pull down a nine-figure paycheck. His stock award was so valuable, even at its initial price, that his total compensation eclipsed that of the next nine C.E.O.'s combined. Those nine included Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle, at $77.6 million, a perennial on the best-paid list, and Philippe P. Dauman, of Viacom, at $43.1 million.
Aaron Boyd, the director of research at Equilar, the executive compensation data firm based in Redwood City, Calif., that has reviewed executive compensation trends annually for Sunday Business, said Mr. Cook's pay was unique.
''The amount he got was historic to such a degree that it skews the numbers,'' Mr. Boyd said.
BUT Apple was not the only special case. Consider J. C. Penney, whose new chief executive, Ronald B. Johnson, came in third on the top 100 list, with total compensation of $53.3 million.
Why? Last year, Mr. Johnson left his position as senior vice president of retail at Apple, along with Apple stock worth $101 million at the time that had not yet vested. So, as part of his pay package, J.C. Penney gave Mr. Johnson a one-time stock award worth $52.6 million. (As of the end of last week, his Apple stock would have been worth about $159 million. His Penney stock was worth $58 million.)
Last year's other top earners included Stephen I. Chazen ($31.7 million) of Occidental Petroleum; Gregory Q. Brown ($29.3 million) of Motorola Solutions, and Howard D. Schultz ($16.1 million) of Starbucks.
Analysts say the uptick in C.E.O. pay is a sign that corporations are returning to business as usual after the last recession. When the economy soured, executive pay fell sharply at many companies, though not as much as many ordinary Americans might have hoped. With the recovery in 2010, pay then skyrocketed. Now it's stabilizing, suggesting, perhaps, that corporate boards see more predictable economic times ahead.
''On average, pay levels have moderated,'' said Doug Friske, the global head of executive compensation consulting at Towers Watson, a human resource consulting firm in New York. ''Now we are seeing normalization.''
Corporate boards also seem to be acknowledging criticism of executive pay from shareholders and the public. Some companies have reduced discretionary bonuses and linked executive pay more closely to performance metrics like revenue and share price. Last year, companies also began to hold shareholder votes on executive pay packages, so-called ''say on pay'' polls required by Dodd-Frank, the Wall Street reform law.
Corporate America hasn't entirely embraced reform. Some companies and industry groups have asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to jettison -- or at least delay putting in place -- a provision in the Dodd-Frank law that would require companies to disclose the ratio of C.E.O. pay to median employee pay, the kind of statistic that could grab headlines in this era of the 1 percent.
The 100 highest earners of 2011 have one thing in common, however. Although they could all rank among the 1 percent -- households that bring in $380,000 or more -- they actually belong in a more exclusive bracket: people with more than $10 million in pay.
But the C.E.O. wealth is hardly trickling down. During the 2010 recovery, the top 1 percent captured 93 percent of the income gains, while the incomes of the 99 percent essentially remained flat, according to a study by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
In 2011, the median weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers in the United States rose only about 1 percent, to $756, from $747 in 2010, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In constant dollars, wages fell a little more than 2 percent.
The C-suite and the shop floor have never been further apart, said Brandon Rees, the deputy director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. office of investment.
''American workers are having to make do with less,'' Mr. Rees said, ''while C.E.O.s have never had it better.''
Equilar analyzed base salaries, cash bonuses, perks, stock awards and options for the 100 most highly compensated executives at public companies that had revenue of more than $5 billion and had filed their proxy statements by March 30. (The study excluded severance pay, changes in pension values and stock awarded in previous years that vested in 2011.)
One standout on the list was Vikram S. Pandit, the chief executive of Citigroup. After the company was bailed out by taxpayers in 2009, Mr. Pandit pledged to work for $1 a year until the bank returned to profitability.
Citigroup has since repaid its bailout money, and the board has restored Mr. Pandit's pay. It amounted to $14.9 million last year, putting Mr. Pandit in 45th place on Equilar's list. Citigroup's longtime shareholders are still waiting for their payday: while the company's net income rose 3 percent last year, Equilar said; its share price fell 44 percent.
New ''say on pay'' votes, though nonbinding, have caused some companies to make a greater proportion of pay contingent on chief executives' achievement of rigorous performance goals. Some companies have even eliminated stock option awards -- the grants of stock that executives are able to buy at a fixed price -- in favor of full-value stock awards that vest only if executives meet specified goals, said Carol Bowie, head of Americas research at Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy consulting firm for institutional investors.
''We are definitely seeing a trend toward more performance-based pay,'' Ms. Bowie said. ''It remains to be seen if performance follows.''
At Hewlett-Packard, for instance, shareholders voted in March 2011 to reject the company's executive compensation plan. The board eventually responded to criticism over the company's multimillion-dollar executive severance packages. The departure last year of Leo Apotheker, who had served as C.E.O. for 11 months, for example, cost H.P. shareholders about $30 million, according to a report from I.S.S.
When H.P.'s board subsequently chose Meg Whitman as the new C.E.O., it took some steps to mollify shareholders by giving her a performance-based compensation package. The board offered her a base salary of $1, no cash bonus, no stock awards and a grant of options to purchase 1.9 million shares of H.P. stock.
Although that amounted to compensation of about $16.5 million, ranking Ms. Whitman 35th on the Equilar list, she will have to meet certain conditions for all of the stock to vest. If she remains employed at H.P., she can exercise her option to buy 100,000 shares each year for the next three years. In addition, 800,000 shares will vest if H.P.'s share price increases by 20 percent under her stewardship, and another 800,000 will vest if the stock increases by 40 percent.
THE rest of the top earners list reads like an A-list of corporate titans, from Robert A. Iger of Walt Disney, ranked seventh, with pay of $31.4 million, to William C. Weldon of Johnson & Johnson, ranked 13th, with $23.4 million. (Mr. Weldon plans to step down as chief later this month; he will stay on as chairman.)
Rupert Murdoch of the News Corporation took 10th place, with compensation of $29.4 million -- a 75 percent increase from 2010. In a year when the News Corporation and Mr. Murdoch's son James were embroiled in a scandal over phone hacking, the elder Mr. Murdoch earned a cash bonus of $12.5 million. That is because the company did well financially, analysts said, even if its reputation plummeted.
''Financially, they exceeded their target,'' said Mr. Boyd of Equilar. ''But from a publicity standpoint, News Corporation has taken a hit over the last year and a half.''
Also among the top 10, David M. Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell, received total compensation of $35.3 million, putting him in fifth place. Honeywell tends to dole out a huge bonus every other year. Last year, Mr. Cote's bonus was $23.3 million.
Clarence P. Cazalot Jr., the chief executive of Marathon Oil, received $29.9 million, an increase of 239 percent from the previous year. That put him in eighth place. Mr. Cazalot received a cash bonus of $21.8 million, the second-highest cash bonus, a majority of which came from accelerated payouts for spinning off a company unit, the Marathon Petroleum Corporation.
Next, Alan R. Mulally, who helped turn around Ford, took ninth place, with compensation of $29.5 million. Although Ford's share price fell nearly 36 percent last year, its net income increased 208 percent.
Elsewhere, Fabrizio Freda, the chief executive of the Estee Lauder Companies, made a big leap. He ranked 18th on the Equilar list, up from 54th place on a comparable list in 2010. He received compensation of nearly $21 million in 2011, a 51 percent increase. Mr. Freda is the first real outsider -- and only the second person outside the Lauder family -- to run the beauty products empire. Under his stewardship last year, Lauder's net income increased 47 percent, while its total shareholder return, the change in share price plus dividends paid, increased 90 percent.
Taken alone, Mr. Freda's compensation may seem high for a company with revenue of nearly $9 billion, said Robin Ferracone, the executive chairwoman and founder of Farient Advisors, an executive compensation and performance consulting firm. But, given the company's stellar performance and the fact that Lauder fits more in the luxury goods category than the toiletries category, she said, his compensation seemed appropriate.
''The high-fashion industry tends to pay more than the big industrials,'' Ms. Ferracone said. ''It's going to look fine to shareholders.''
BUT investors, among them employees with 401(k) plans, may want additional information to gain more context about whether executive pay packages are reasonable and appropriate.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has urged the S.E.C. to put into effect the provision in Dodd-Frank requiring companies to disclose the ratio of chief executive pay to their employees' median pay. That would give shareholders insight into compensation practices, said Mr. Rees of the labor federation, along with the ability to compare it to those of other companies.
''It puts C.E.O. pay in perspective,'' he said. ''It's material to investors.''
Don't hold your breath. The requirement isn't likely to come into effect any time soon, because many companies have complained to the S.E.C. that it would be a burden to comply with it, said Ms. Bowie of I.S.S.
''There's been a lot of pushback from companies on that,'' she said.
Mary L. Schapiro, the chairwoman of the S.E.C., said at a Congressional hearing last month that the commission was trying to work through ''a lot of technical issues'' on how companies might calculate this.
The agency has not yet set a date for companies to comply, John Nester, a spokesman for the S.E.C, said on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Divided By God

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT. 
Ross Douthat is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times. This article is adapted and excerpted from his new book, ''Bad Religion: How We Became a Nation of Heretics.''

 BODY:
IN American religious history, Nov. 8, 1960, is generally regarded as the date when the presidency ceased to be the exclusive property of Protestants. But for decades afterward, the election of the Catholic John F. Kennedy looked more like a temporary aberration.
Post-J.F.K., many of America's established churches went into an unexpected decline, struggling to make their message resonate in a more diverse, affluent and sexually permissive America. The country as a whole became more religiously fluid, with more church-switching, more start-up sects, more do-it-yourself forms of faith. Yet a nation that was increasingly nondenominational and postdenominational kept electing Protestants from established denominations to the White House.
The six presidents elected before Kennedy's famous breakthrough included two Baptists, an Episcopalian, a Congregationalist, a Presbyterian and a Quaker. The six presidents elected prior to Barack Obama's 2008 victory included two Baptists, two Episcopalians, a Methodist and a Presbyterian. Jimmy Carter's and George W. Bush's self-identification as ''born again'' added a touch of theological diversity to the mix, as did losing candidates like the Greek Orthodox Michael S. Dukakis. But over all, presidential religious affiliation has been a throwback to the Eisenhower era -- or even the McKinley era. 
That is, until now. In 2012, we finally have a presidential field whose diversity mirrors the diversity of American Christianity as a whole.
Barack Obama, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum all identify as Christians, but their theological traditions and personal experiences of faith diverge more starkly than any group of presidential contenders in recent memory. These divergences reflect America as it actually is: We're neither traditionally Christian nor straightforwardly secular. Instead, we're a nation of heretics in which most people still associate themselves with Christianity but revise its doctrines as they see fit, and nobody can agree on even the most basic definitions of what Christian faith should mean.
This diversity is not necessarily a strength. The old Christian establishment -- which by the 1950s encompassed Kennedy's Roman Catholic Church as well as the major Protestant denominations -- could be exclusivist, snobbish and intolerant. But the existence of a Christian center also helped bind a vast and teeming nation together. It was the hierarchy, discipline and institutional continuity of mainline Protestantism and later Catholicism that built hospitals and schools, orphanages and universities, and assimilated generations of immigrants. At the same time, the kind of ''mere Christianity'' (in C. S. Lewis's phrase) that the major denominations shared frequently provided a kind of invisible mortar for our culture and a framework for our great debates.
Today, that religious common ground has all but disappeared.
And the inescapability of religious polarization -- whether it pits evangelicals against Mormons, the White House against the Catholic Church, or Rick Santorum against the secular press -- during an election year that was expected to be all about the economy is a sign of what happens to a deeply religious country when its theological center cannot hold.
Our president embodies this uncentered spiritual landscape in three ways. First, like a growing share of Americans (44 percent), President Obama changed his religion as an adult, joining Chicago's Trinity United Church of Christ in his 20s after a conversion experience brought him out of agnosticism into faith. Second, he was converted by a pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, whose highly politicized theology was self-consciously at odds with much of historic Christian practice and belief. Finally, since breaking with that pastor, Obama has become a believer without a denomination or a church, which makes him part of one of the country's fastest-growing religious groups -- what the Barna Group calls the ''unchurched Christian'' bloc, consisting of Americans who accept some tenets of Christian faith without participating in any specific religious community.
Obama's likely general election rival, Mitt Romney, has had a less eventful religious journey, remaining a loyal practitioner of his childhood faith. But that faith, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is the ultimate outsider church, persecuted at its inception and regarded with suspicion even now. Christian theologians wrangle over whether Mormon beliefs should be described as Christianity; Mormons, for their part, implicitly return the favor, since they believe that true Christian faith was restored to earth by Joseph Smith after nearly two millenniums of apostasy. Indeed, between its belief in a special 19th-century revelation and other doctrinal embellishments, Mormonism is arguably as far as Jeremiah Wright's black liberation from what used to be the American religious center.
THIS leaves Romney's last significant Republican opponent, the Catholic Rick Santorum, to represent what the America of 50 years ago would have recognized as a (relatively) mainstream religious body. Except, of course, that there's nothing particularly mainstream about Santorum's theological convictions. His traditionalist zeal has made him a bigger target even than Romney or Obama for fascination, suspicion and hysteria. In a nation as religiously diverse as ours, a staunchly orthodox Christianity can seem like the weirdest heresy of all.
In a sense, the fact that the 2012 presidential race has come down to a Mormon, a traditionalist Catholic and an incumbent with ties to liberation theology is a testament to the country's impressive progress toward religious tolerance. It's a striking thing that one of the nation's two political parties is poised to nominate a politician whose ancestors in faith were murdered, persecuted and driven into exile.
It's almost as remarkable that Rick Santorum's strongest supporters are evangelical Christians in the American South, a population that once would have regarded a devout Catholic with the deepest possible suspicion. And if you took a time machine back to the tumult of the civil rights era and told people that Americans would not only someday elect a black president, but one whose pastor and spiritual mentor was steeped in the radical theologies of the late 1960s -- well, that would have seemed like science fiction.
But there are costs to being a nation in which we're all heretics to one another, and no religious orthodoxy commands wide support. Our diversity has made us more tolerant in some respects, but far more polarized in others. The myth that President Obama is a Muslim, for instance, has its origins in Obama's exotic-sounding name and Kenyan-Indonesian background. But it's become so rooted in the right-wing consciousness in part because Obama's prior institutional affiliation is with a church that seems far more alien to many white Christians than did the African-American Christianity of Martin Luther King Jr., or even Jesse Jackson.
Likewise, while Santorum no longer has to worry (as John F. Kennedy did) about assuaging evangelical fears about Vatican plots and Catholic domination, his candidacy has summoned up an equally perfervid paranoia from secular liberals, who hear intimations of theocracy in his every speech and utterance. (And not only from secularists: The liberal Catholic writer Garry Wills recently resurrected the old slur ''papist'' -- once beloved of anti-Catholic Protestants -- to dismiss Santorum as a slavish servant of the Vatican.)
Nor has Mitt Romney's slow progress to the Republican nomination altered the fact that his fast-growing church is viewed by many with deep distrust. The same polls showing that many religious conservatives don't want to vote for a Mormon also show that many independents and Democrats feel the same way, and explicit anti-Mormon sentiment percolates among evangelical preachers and liberal columnists alike.
These various fears and paranoias are nourished by the fact that America's churches are increasingly too institutionally weak, too fragmented and internally divided to bring people from different political persuasions together. About 75 percent of Mitt Romney's co-religionists identify as Republicans, and it's safe to assume that President Obama didn't meet many conservatives in the pews at Jeremiah Wright's church. American Catholicism still pitches a wide enough tent to include members of both parties, but the church has long been divided into liberal and conservative factions that can seem as distant from one another as Rush Limbaugh and Bill Maher.
In this atmosphere, religious differences are more likely to inspire baroque conspiracy theories, whether it's the far-right panic over an Islamified United States or the left-wing paranoia about a looming evangelical-led theocracy. And faith itself is more likely to serve partisan purposes -- whether it's putting the messianic sheen on Obama's ''hope and change'' campaign or supplying the storm clouds in Glenn Beck's apocalyptic monologues.
Americans have never separated religion from politics, but it makes a difference how the two are intertwined. When religious commitments are more comprehensive and religious institutions more resilient, faith is more likely to call people out of private loyalties to public purposes, more likely to inspire voters to put ideals above self-interest, more likely to inspire politicians to defy partisan categories altogether. But as orthodoxies weaken, churches split and their former adherents mix and match elements of various traditions to fit their preferences, religion is more likely to become indistinguishable from personal and ideological self-interest.
Here it's worth contrasting the civil rights era to our own. Precisely because America's religious center was stronger and its leading churches more influential, the preachers and ministers who led the civil rights movement were able to assemble the broadest possible religious coalition -- from the ministers who marched with protesters to the Catholic bishops who desegregated parochial schools and excommunicated white supremacists. Precisely because they shared so much theological common ground with white Christians, the leaders of the black churches were able to use moral and theological arguments to effectively shame many Southerners into accepting desegregation. (The latter story is told, masterfully, in David L. Chappell's ''A Stone of Hope: Prophetic Religion and the Death of Jim Crow.'')
The result was an issue where pastors led and politicians of both parties followed, where the institutional churches proved their worth as both sources of moral authority and hubs of activism, and where religious witness helped forge a genuine national consensus on an issue where even presidents feared to tread.
Today's America does not lack for causes where a similar spirit could be brought to bear for religious activists with the desire to imitate the achievements of the past. But with the disappearance of a Christian center and the decline of institutional religion more generally, we lack the capacity to translate those desires into something other than what we've seen in this, the most theologically diverse of recent presidential elections -- division, demonization and polarization without end.

HEADLINE: A Fresh Look at How Humans Are Loading Climate 'Dice'

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Two longtime climatologists explore ways to describe the impact of accumulating greenhouse gases on extreme weather events. 

 BODY:
April 10, 12:28 p.m. | Updated 
I talk about loaded climate "dice" and March heat records on The Takeaway: 
James E. Hansen, the longtime climate scientist who has turned increasingly to activism in recent years, has updated his analysis of how the buildup of human-generated greenhouse gases is loading the climate "dice" so that hotter extremes are ever more likely. 
I talked with him in 2008 about his use of this apt metaphor. Here's the video of our chat: 
Here's the abstract of his latest draft paper, "Public Perception of Climate Change and the New Climate Dice": 
"Climate dice," describing the chance of unusually warm or cool seasons relative to climatology, have become progressively "loaded" in the past 30 years, coincident with rapid global warming. The distribution of seasonal mean temperature anomalies has shifted toward higher temperatures and the range of anomalies has increased. An important change is the emergence of a category of summertime extremely hot outliers, more than three standard deviations... warmer than climatology. This hot extreme, which covered much less than 1% of Earth's surface in the period of climatology, now typically covers about 10% of the land area. It follows that we can state, with a high degree of confidence, that extreme anomalies such as those in Texas and Oklahoma in 2011 and Moscow in 2010 were a consequence of global warming, because their likelihood in the absence of global warming was exceedingly small. We discuss practical implications of this substantial, growing, climate change.
Another veteran climatologist, John Michael Wallace of the University of Washington, sees a similar message in extreme events in relation to the background push from greenhouse gases, but says efforts to demonstrate that today's heat waves are driven substantially by greenhouse heating can be a damaging distraction. 
Here's the nut of "Weather- and Climate-Related Extreme Events:
Teachable Moments," his recent essay in the American Geophysical Union publication Eos (click for pdf):
Arguing about whether or not today's extreme events are early indicators of climate change does nothing to advance the priority of global warming and other pressing environmental issues on our national policy agenda. The real significance of extreme events is as harbingers, not just of a changing climate but also of a changing world in which human society and the infrastructure that supports it are becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters. The mounting disruptions in their wake reveal the progressive deterioration of our planetary life-support systems. Extreme events are, indeed, teachable moments: "wake-up calls" that an environmental crisis of global proportions is imminent-much more so than the subtle and sometimes ambiguous early warning signs of global warming might lead us to believe.
10:39 a.m. | Addendum |I encourage you to read this prescient excerpt from a remarkable 1981 paper by Jim Hansen and collaborators on global warming (noticed via RealClimate and Jason Major at Universe Today):
Political and economic forces affecting energy use and fuel choice make it unlikely that the CO2 issue will have a major impact on energy policies until convincing observations of the global warming are in hand. In light of historical evidence that it takes several decades to complete a major change in fuel use, this makes large climate change almost inevitable. However, the degree of warming will depend strongly on the energy growth rate and choice of fuels for the next century.
Thus, CO2 effects on climate may make full exploitation of coal resources undesirable. An appropriate strategy may be to encourage energy conservation and develop alternative energy sources, while using fossil fuels as necessary during the next few decades.
The climate change induced by anthropogenic release of CO2 is likely to be the most fascinating global geophysical experiment that man will ever conduct. The scientific task is to help determine the nature of future climatic effects as early as possible. The required efforts in global observations and climate analysis are challenging, but the benefits from improved understanding of climate will surely warrant the work invested.
The political and economic realities described by Hansen and his co-authors were reflected in a different way in a pioneering article on carbon dioxide and climate published in The Times in 1956:
Coal and oil are still plentiful and cheap, and both will be consumed by industry so long as it pays to do so.
As I wrote when I last cited this, "The only change I'd suggest is to drop the words 'by industry,' given that in societies thriving on fossil fuels has harvested the present benefits while largely discounting, so far, the need to invest against long-term risks from the resulting buildup of greenhouse gases. (And of course I'd add natural gas to the fuel mix.)
Indeed, the entwined climate and energy challenges are "beyond super wicked," which is why I am among those focused on building the human capacity for resilience, inventiveness and awareness.

HEADLINE: Private Equity Firms Duel Over Water Park Operator

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: KSL Capital raised the ante for Great Wolf Resorts with a $7 a share bid, over Apollo Global's most recent $6.75 a share offer. 

 BODY:
It is rare to see private equity firms lock horns in a public bidding war. But a heated auction appears to be brewing for Great Wolf Resorts, the big indoor water park operator.
The company announced on Sunday that it had received a new takeover bid of $7 a share in cash, or $234 million total, from KSL Capital Partners, topping a $225.7 million offer by Apollo Global Management, the publicly traded buyout giant.
Both firms have now made two proposals for Great Wolf, with KSL and Apollo having raised their bids for the company over the course of a week.
 In some ways, the battle over Great Wolf further highlights the resurgence of private equity firms since the financial crisis. Buyout shops have spoken often about the hundreds of billions of dollars in uninvested capital - "dry powder," in the industry's parlance - that they are eager to pour into deals. And since late last year, two leveraged buyouts above $7 billion have been announced.
But rarely, even during the boom times of private equity, have two firms openly dueled over a target, hewing to an unspoken code of not "jumping" another shop's deal.
In some ways, Great Wolf makes for an unusual object of such a fight. Though its revenue has increased every year since 2008, it has yet to become profitable. In 2011, the company lost $25.7 million, compared to $51 million the previous year.
Yet it also holds some charm for private equity suitors. The company, based in Madison, Wis., runs 11 resorts across the country that pull in stable revenues, which can help support a leveraged buyout.
The battle over Great Wolf began last year, after the company contacted at least 33 potential suitors. Apollo and KSL, a specialist in buying resort companies, emerged as two of the leading potential buyers by late last year, according to a person briefed on the matter.
Though both firms offered $5 a share, Great Wolf and its advisers chose to go forward with Apollo late last year, in part because it offered to assume the company's debt, this person said. Great Wolf had $515.2 million of debt as of Dec. 31.
The deal holds some significance for Apollo, which had sought to buy another amusement park owner, Cedar Fair, in 2009. That effort fell apart, however, when Cedar Fair's shareholders deemed the bid too low.
Apollo's initial bid was announced on March 13. At $5 a share, it was 19 percent above Great Wolf's closing stock price the day before. But shareholders appeared unimpressed, as the company's stock traded above the offer, indicating an expectation that another bidder may emerge.
About three weeks later, on Wednesday, KSL came back with a bid worth $6.25 a share, forcing Great Wolf to evaluate the new offer as part of its duty to shareholders. On Friday, Apollo countered with a bid of $6.75 a share, which Great Wolf accepted.
With KSL's latest bid, Great Wolf and its advisers will again need to scrutinize the offer and determine whether it is in shareholders' best interests.
Representatives for Great Wolf and Apollo declined to comment.
All is not lost for Apollo, however. The firm has the right to match KSL's newest offer, or walk away and receive up to $9 million in termination fees and expense reimbursements.

HEADLINE: The Taint of 'Social Darwinism'

BYLINE: PHILIP KITCHER


HIGHLIGHT: Barack Obama used a politically charged phrase to attack the Republican budget. It also happened to be true. 

 BODY:
Given the well-known Republican antipathy to evolution, President Obama's recent description of the Republican budget as an example of "social Darwinism" may be a canny piece of political labeling. In the interests of historical accuracy, however, it should be clearly recognized that "social Darwinism" has very little to do with the ideas developed by Charles Darwin in "On the Origin of Species." Social Darwinism emerged as a movement in the late 19th-century, and has had waves of popularity ever since, but its central ideas owe more to the thought of a luminary of that time, Herbert Spencer, whose writings are (to understate) no longer widely read.
Spencer, who coined the phrase "survival of the fittest," thought about natural selection on a grand scale. Conceiving selection in pre-Darwinian terms - as a ruthless process, "red in tooth and claw" - he viewed human culture and human societies as progressing through fierce competition. Provided that policymakers do not take foolish steps to protect the weak, those people and those human achievements that are fittest - most beautiful, noble, wise, creative, virtuous, and so forth - will succeed in a fierce competition, so that, over time, humanity and its accomplishments will continually improve. Late 19th-century dynastic capitalists, especially the American "robber barons," found this vision profoundly congenial. Their contemporary successors like it for much the same reasons, just as some adolescents discover an inspiring reinforcement of their self-image in the writings of Ayn Rand .
Although social Darwinism has often been closely connected with ideas in eugenics (pampering the weak will lead to the "decline of the race") and with theories of racial superiority (the economic and political dominance of people of North European extraction is a sign that some racial groups are intrinsically better than others), these are not central to the position. 
The heart of social Darwinism is a pair of theses: first, people have intrinsic abilities and talents (and, correspondingly, intrinsic weaknesses), which will be expressed in their actions and achievements, independently of the social, economic and cultural environments in which they develop; second, intensifying competition enables the most talented to develop their potential to the full, and thereby to provide resources for a society that make life better for all. It is not entirely implausible to think that doctrines like these stand behind a vast swath of Republican proposals, including the recent budget, with its emphasis on providing greater economic benefits to the rich, transferring the burden to the middle-classes and poor, and especially in its proposals for reducing public services. Fuzzier versions of the theses have pervaded Republican rhetoric for the past decade (and even longer).
There are very good reasons to think both theses are false. Especially in the case of the Republican dynasties of our day, the Bushes and the Romneys, success has been facilitated by all kinds of social structures, by educational opportunities and legal restrictions, that were in place prior to and independently of their personal efforts or achievements. For those born into environments in which silver spoons rarely appear - Barack Obama, for instance - the contributions of the social environment are even more apparent. Without enormous support, access to inspiring teachers and skillful doctors, the backing of self-sacrificing relatives and a broader community, and without a fair bit of luck, the vast majority of people, not only in the United States but throughout the world, would never achieve the things of which they are, in principle, capable. In short, Horatio Alger needs lots of help, and a large thrust of contemporary Republican policy is dedicated to making sure he doesn't get it.
Second, even if rigorous competition enables the talented - or, better, the lucky - to realize their goals, it is completely unwarranted to suppose that their accomplishments will translate into any increased benefit for the overwhelming majority of those who are less fortunate. The strenuous struggle social Darwinism envisages might select for something, but the most likely traits are a tendency to take whatever steps are necessary to achieve a foreseeable end, a sharp focus on narrowly individual goals and a corresponding disregard for others. We might reasonably expect that a world run on social Darwinist lines would generate a cadre of plutocrats, each resolutely concerned to establish a dynasty and to secure his favored branch of industry against future competition. In practical terms it would almost certainly yield a world in which the gap between rich and poor was even larger than it is now. 
Rather than the beauty, wisdom, virtue and nobility Spencer envisioned arising from fierce competition, the likely products would be laws repealing inheritance taxes and deregulating profitable activities, and a vast population of people whose lives were even further diminished.
Yet, even if stimulating competition would achieve greater economic productivity, and even if this would, by some miraculous mechanism, yield a more egalitarian distribution of economic resources (presumably through the provision of more remunerative jobs), these welcome material benefits are not all that is needed. To quote a much-cited book, we do not "live by bread alone." If the vast majority of citizens (or, globally, of people) are to enjoy any opportunities to develop the talents they have, they need the social structures social Darwinism perceives as pampering and counter-productive. Human well-being is profoundly affected by public goods, a concept that is entirely antithetical to social Darwinism or to contemporary Republican ideology, with their mythical citizens who can fulfill their potential without rich systems of social support. It is a callous fiction to suppose that what is needed is less investment in education, health care, public transportation and affordable public housing.
So long as social Darwinism is disentangled from the ancillary eugenic and racist ideas, so long as it is viewed in its core form of the two theses about the glories of competition, the label President Obama pinned on the Republican budget is completely deserved. Because the central ideas of social Darwinism are equally false and noxious, a commitment to truth in advertising should welcome the label. And all of us, including President Obama and the many people whose less spectacular successes have been enabled by social structures and public goods, should hope that the taint of Darwinism suffices to incline conservatives who are suspicious about evolution to worry about the Republican budget, as well as its architects and supporters.

HEADLINE: Romney the Centrist Peeks Out

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Now that he is on track to win the Republican nomination, can Mitt Romney find his way back to the center? 

 BODY:
It was just one line slipped into the middle of a paragraph of Mitt Romney's speech on April 3 celebrating his primary victories in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia: "And the most vulnerable have been hurt the most - over 30 percent of single moms are struggling in poverty."
Seemingly unremarkable, these 19 words represent one of the many steps Romney will be taking as he treks back to the center in the aftermath of a primary campaign dominated by the hard right. It was only two months ago, after all, that Romney told CNN: "I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there."
Without drawing attention to his rhetorical shift, Romney, in a speech on March 30 at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisc., abandoned his attack on President Obama's "entitlement society," faulting Obama's "government-centered society" instead.
There is a powerful rationale behind this shift.
In the primaries, Romney's target audience was well to the right of the mainstream and deeply hostile to the notion of entitlement programs. In the minds of many conservatives, such programs are direct transfer payments from "hard-working" better-off citizens to the "undeserving poor." Denouncing Obama's "entitlement society" played well to angry Republican primary voters.
In the general election, however, voters are less inclined to adopt hostile views of redistributive government programs. Instead, many are likely to understand - and if they don't, Democrats will remind them - that the biggest entitlement programs are Social Security and Medicare, life support for large numbers of the elderly. Romney will have to carry a strong majority of voters over 65 if he is to win. His revamped phrasing reduces the risk of alienating this constituency.
Romney has roughly five months until Labor Day - the traditional beginning of the general election season - to redefine himself as a candidate more attractive to independent and swing voters.
Even on immigration - the issue he used to great effect to blunt last winter's challenge from the governor of Texas, Rick Perry - Romney is now modulating his stance in hopes of muting Hispanic antagonism.
Rather than reiterating his tough policies on illegal immigration and undocumented immigrants, Romney, addressing a town hall meeting at the Moore Oil Company in Milwaukee on April 2, attacked Obama for failing to live up to his promise to win approval of immigration reform legislation.
"This has always been a priority for the president, [but one that] he chooses to do nothing about," Romney told supporters. "Let the immigrant community not forget that while he uses this as a political weapon, he has not taken responsibility for fixing the problems we have."
Romney then used ingeniously ambiguous language that lends itself to multiple interpretations, including the idea that he just might be open to finding a way for illegal immigrants to stay in the United States:
This will be a priority of mine, if I become president, to make sure we finally reform our immigration laws step by step, secure the border, improve our legal immigration system, so we can keep people here and welcome people here who will make America a stronger nation.
Notice that "so we can keep people here." For those interested in the subtle movement of politicians away from the ideological extremes they advocate while primaries are underway, the most interesting part of the Romney transition is almost certain to start very soon.
Romney is now signaling a modest level of empathy - along the lines of the compassion Perry displayed last September 22 when he told his fellow candidates at a debate that "if you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for other reason than they have been brought there by no fault of their own, I don't think you have a heart."
Recall that on Sept. 23, one day after Perry spoke, Romney shot back, "if you're opposed to illegal immigration, it doesn't mean that you don't have a heart. It means that you have a heart and a brain."
Romney's newly found heart suggests that his brain is telling him that Hispanic voters could be crucial on Election Day.
Favoring baby steps, as politicians routinely do to prevent voters from noticing giant leaps over time, Romney is about to embark on an effort to blur positions he took in his primary battles with Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, especially his controversial stands on such issues as women's health and access to contraception.
In a nomination fight dominated by Tea Party supporters and the Christian Right, an unexpected litmus test emerged: any Republican candidate who wanted to remain competitive had to support an amendment sponsored by Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, allowing employers to opt out of covering contraception for women in their company's health insurance plans if the employer is morally or ethically opposed to the use of birth control.
Romney initially indicated, on Feb. 29, that he opposed the legislation.
"I'm not for the bill, but look, the idea of presidential candidates getting into questions about contraception within a relationship between a man and a women, husband and wife, I'm not going there," Romney said, adding, "Contraception is working just fine, let's just leave it alone."
Later the same day, as soon as his campaign staff learned of these comments, however, they released a statement declaring, "Governor Romney supports the Blunt Bill because he believes in a conscience exemption in health care for religious institutions and people of faith."
Then, on March 13, Romney provoked a media firestorm when he told St. Louis TV station KSDK, "You get rid of Obamacare, but there are others. Planned Parenthood, we're gonna get rid of that." Planned Parenthood provides healthcare services for women generally, including contraception and abortions.
Nearly three weeks later, on April 2, Romney acknowledged that he has a problem with some women voters. Campaigning in Middleton, Wisc., he declared:
We have work, we have work to do, to make sure we take our message to the women of America, so they understand how we're going to get good jobs and we're going to have a bright economic future for them and for their kids, and make sure that these distortions that the Democrats throw in are clarified and the truth is heard.
In a March 29 Pew Poll, Romney was losing to Obama among women by 20 points, 58-38. Among white women, a group he must carry by at least 10 points to win in November, he was just breaking even with Obama, 48-48.
There is an ongoing debate over whether Romney's comments about shutting down Planned Parenthood and his endorsement of the Blunt amendment directly influenced women voters, but there is no doubt that women are demonstrating an aversion to his campaign and to the Republican Party.
A March 24-25 CNN/ORC International survey showed the following: In a head-to-head match up, Obama led Romney by 16 points, 56-40, among all voters. The Democrat held a smaller, 10-point advantage among men, 53-43, and a landslide level of support among women, 60-37, or 23-points.
When voters were asked if they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Romney, unfavorable trumped favorable by 12 points, 49-37. Among men, this fell to 10 points, 50-40, while among women the unfavorable ratings were 14 points higher than the favorable ones, 48-34.
In the case of Obama, the numbers were reversed. Among all voters, a 14-point majority, 56-42, viewed him favorably. Among men this fell to a 10-point favorable margin, 54-44, but among women it swelled to a 17-point edge, 58-41.
An earlier FOX News poll released on March 14 showed a smaller Obama advantage over Romney, 46-42, but the pattern of support from men and women for the two candidates revealed similarly large gaps. Men backed Romney by 5 points, 48-43, while women were in Obama's camp by a solid 12 points, 49-37.
Perhaps equally troubling for Romney, the same survey reveals that the Republican Party is currently held in substantially lower esteem than the Democratic Party by both men and women.
Favorable opinions of the Democratic Party outweighed negative views in the CNN polls by a modest 3 points, 48-45. There was, however, a huge gender gap. Men were unfavorable by 8 points, 50-42, while women were favorable by 14 points, 54-40.
The Republican Party was viewed unfavorably by a wide 23-point margin, 58-35 in the CNN poll. In this case, the negative views of men and women were similar, 57-36 among men, and 59-34 among women.
The Pew Research Center has broken down Romney and Obama's support not only among men and women, but among different demographic groups of men and women:
Looking at this data, some findings stand out:
For Romney, the most important voters are white and he is falling far short of the margins he must win among these voters in order to prevail on November 6. In the close 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush beat John Kerry 51-49. Bush won among white men by 25 points, 62-37, and among white women by 11 points, 55-44. Romney, by comparison, has only a 15 point edge among white men, 55-40, and is running even, 48-48, among white women.
Romney's weaknesses among women are concentrated among those with college educations, both white and minority - he loses them in the Pew poll by 62-36, including a 57-40 margin of defeat among college-educated white women. He loses 56-39 among all women without college degrees, both white and minority, but holds a 10-point lead among white women without degrees.
There is almost no gender gap between ideologically moderate men and moderate women of all races, but Obama's advantages among both groups, 62-36 (men) and 62-32 (women) are daunting numbers for the Republican candidate.
While the partisan leanings of women vary widely by race, education and marital status, within every demographic category, women are more Democratic (or less Republican), and more liberal (or less conservative) than their male counterparts. While generally Republican, white women, for example, are roughly 10 points less Republican than white men. The Pew survey shows a consistent pattern of women of all races holding, on average, more liberal stands than men on a wide range of issues.
Women, for example, support more government assistance to the poor, the elderly and children by consistently higher margins (9 to 11 points) than men, according to Pew. In addition, women back tougher regulation of food production and packing by 61 percent, compared to 45 percent of men. Women are more in favor of stronger workplace safety regulations by 13 points more than men.
Asked whether peace is best achieved through military strength or good diplomacy, majorities of both sexes chose diplomacy, but the margin among men, 53-35, was 22 points in favor, compared to the 35-point, 62-27, among women.
In other words, Romney has his work cut out for him. As the primary process demonstrated, he is not noticeably adept at shifting ground from center to the right, although his ability to move from right back to the center has not been fully tested.
Former Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich, a Romney supporter, suggested that for the general election Romney will be a different man on women's issues than the Romney of the primaries. "When you have a one-on-one general election, they will see Governor Romney's real views, and that gender gap will disappear really quickly."
While Romney's strategies are a work in progress, trends in the 2012 campaign point to a novel reality: In past elections, Democrats have suffered at the hands of Republican skill in the use of wedge issues - race, crime, welfare, abortion and gay rights - issues that divided Democratic constituencies, weakening the party in November.
This time, Democrats have their own wedge issues to further weaken Republican support among women (reproductive rights), Hispanics (immigration reform) and seniors (Medicare cuts, as recently approved in the Paul Ryan-sponsored House budget). As Steny Hoyer, the House Democratic Whip, puts it, "There is no balance in this proposal. Seniors, middle class, vulnerable, working Americans are asked to pay the price of this agreement. Not only are they asked to pay the price, but the best-off among us is asked to do the least."
Romney faces a huge but not insurmountable task. 24 years ago, George H. W. Bush was more than 15 points behind Michael S. Dukakis in the summer of 1988 and went on to beat the Massachusetts governor by seven points, 53-46.

HEADLINE: Creating a New Taxi

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Painstakingly Reimagining City's Cabs, Down to the Floor Mats'' (news article, April 2), the factors weighed in designing New York City's Taxi of Tomorrow were described at length. Sadly, there was no mention of fuel efficiency. 
Court rulings may have barred the city from setting its own mileage standards for new taxis, but what a shame if that relegates fuel economy to the shadows. Are antimicrobial floor mats and airplane-style reading lights really more consequential?
With gas prices averaging $4 a gallon, presidential talk of invading our strategic petroleum reserves and the specter of yet another Mideast war, we need a vision worthy of this new century, not the 1950s.

HEADLINE: Funds to Train Jobless in U.S. Are Drying Up

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
With the economy slowly reviving, an executive from Atlas Van Lines recently visited Louisville, Ky., with good news: the company wanted to hire more than 100 truck drivers ahead of the summer moving season.
But a usually reliable source of workers, the local government-financed job center, could offer little help, because the federal money that local officials had designated to help train drivers was already exhausted. Without the government assistance, many of the people who would be interested in applying for the driving jobs could not afford the $4,000 classes to obtain commercial driver's licenses. Now Atlas is struggling to find eligible drivers.
Across the country, work force centers that assist the unemployed are being asked to do more with less as federal funds dwindle for job training and related services.
In Seattle, for example, the region's seven centers provided training for less than 5 percent of the 120,000 people who came in last year seeking to burnish their skills. And in Dallas, officials say they have annual funds left to support only 43 people in training programs, nowhere near enough to help the 23,500 people who have lost their jobs in the last 10 weeks alone. 
The Labor Department announced on Friday that employers had added only 120,000 new jobs in March, a disappointing gain after three previous months of nearly twice that level. But with 12.7 million people still searching for jobs, the country is actually spending less on work force training than it did in good times.
Federal money for the primary training program for dislocated workers is 18 percent lower in today's dollars than it was in 2006, even though there are six million more people looking for work now. Funds used to provide basic job search services, like guidance on resumes and coaching for interviews, have fallen by 13 percent.
Political fights have focused primarily on extensions of unemployment insurance, while the cuts in funds for training have passed with little debate and little notice.
At the peak in 2000, the federal government was spending more than $2.1 billion a year in today's dollars for training programs aimed at dislocated workers under the Workforce Investment Act. Stimulus funds added close to $1.5 billion over two years, but now annual spending has receded to about $1.2 billion.
The cuts ''make it harder to meet the employers' needs,'' said Michael Gritton, executive director of KentuckianaWorks, which oversees four government-financed job centers in Louisville. ''And obviously you have these individual customers who are asking for help to climb back into the middle class and you can't help them either.''
Employers who want to hire often complain that the jobless do not have the necessary skills. In such an environment, advocates for workers say that cutting funds for training and other services makes little sense.
''We should be spending significantly more than we were spending five years ago,'' said Andy Van Kleunen, executive director of the National Skills Coalition, a nonprofit group that promotes investment in training. ''And even then we would not be catching up to the demand.''
Jack Griffin, president and chief operating officer of the Atlas World Group, said that finding drivers should be easy given the national unemployment rate of over 8 percent. ''You would think they would be lined up at our door,'' he said.
Atlas recently lowered the number of driving hours required and is offering a signing bonus of $3,000. Mr. Griffin said the company would consider training applicants itself if they would ''sign a piece of paper saying that when they graduate they will come to work for us for two years.''
To bolster training and other services for jobless workers, the Obama administration recently proposed consolidating two programs. The general dislocated worker program paid for under the Workforce Investment Act would be combined with the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which provides training and other benefits to workers who lose their jobs because of foreign competition.
The trade program, which has an annual budget of $575 million, is typically more generous, but narrow in eligibility. The combined program would make all funds available to anyone who had lost a job, regardless of the reason.
In his latest budget proposal, President Obama also requested an additional $2.8 billion a year for job training over the next decade. ''Even in this very tight budget,'' said Gene Sperling, national economic adviser, ''the president felt that there was an imperative to call right now for a more simplified and effective training system'' that also had an increase in funds.
Whether Congress is willing to consider more aid is uncertain. The federal budget endorsed by House Republicans calls for reductions in a broad category that includes job training.
The constraints are dispiriting for people like Jacqueline Francis, who was laid off from a job in human resources about a year and a half ago. Since then, she has followed the all-too-familiar drill of sending out resumes and cover letters that are never answered.
With her savings depleted, she wants to return to school and switch careers. Ms. Francis, a divorced mother in Louisville with a daughter in high school and a son in college, has pinpointed nursing, a field she considers most likely to provide employment.
Last month, she visited a job center run by KentuckianaWorks only to learn that the $240,000 allocated for health care training had been spent.
''I could have cried,'' Ms. Francis said. She said she would apply for financial aid at the local community college and sell items in her wardrobe to pay for a nursing degree. ''I want to better my situation,'' she said.
Local employers say they also feel the pinch. ''We depend on those dollars to help us with training for more entry-level positions,'' said Tony Bohn, chief human resources officer at Norton Healthcare, which operates more than 100 doctor's offices in the area.
It is not always easy to measure whether job training helps, or to what degree.
''Traditionally, we have found that job training has not been very effective for people who have lost their job recently,'' said Kenneth R. Troske, an economist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. Research suggests it delivers better returns for people with checkered job histories, or for people from extremely low-income backgrounds.
The Labor Department is paying for a study of training programs by the Workforce Investment Act at 28 locations across the country, but the research will not be complete until 2015.
Training advocates say that paying for education yields a better return than simply continuing to pay unemployment benefits. Marlena Sessions, chief executive of the Workforce Development Council of Seattle-King County, said that every dollar spent on training dislocated workers in 2009 returned about $8.70 to the local economy as people found new jobs and increased their spending.
Some economists say that previous studies of the cost-effectiveness of training have focused too closely on a worker's starting income after completing a certificate or degree program as a measure of success.
Ken Harris, a 39-year-old former assembly line worker at a General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio, financed part of his nursing degree with federal funds. He started a job this year at an emergency room in Cincinnati. At his hourly wage, he says that he will earn an annual salary of about $55,000, with the potential for more, compared with the $74,000 he earned after 15 years with G.M.
But he has peace of mind that he is not likely to lose his job. And he is having more fun. ''At G.M. you did the same thing every 48 seconds,'' Mr. Harris said. ''In the nursing job, you don't know what's going to walk in the door.''

HEADLINE: Private Equity Firms Duel Over Water-Park Operator

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
It is rare to see private equity firms lock horns in a public bidding war. But a heated auction appears to be brewing for Great Wolf Resorts, the big indoor water park operator.
The company announced on Sunday that it had received a new takeover bid of $7 a share in cash, or $234 million total, from KSL Capital Partners, topping a $225.7 million offer by Apollo Global Management, the publicly traded buyout giant.
Both firms have now made two proposals for Great Wolf, with KSL and Apollo having raised their bids for the company over the course of a week. 
In some ways, the battle over Great Wolf further highlights the resurgence of private equity firms since the financial crisis. Buyout shops have spoken often about the hundreds of billions of dollars in uninvested capital - ''dry powder,'' in the industry's parlance - that they are eager to pour into deals. And since late last year, two leveraged buyouts above $7 billion have been announced.
But rarely, even during the boom times of private equity, have two firms openly dueled over a target, hewing to an unspoken code of not ''jumping'' another shop's deal.
In some ways, Great Wolf makes for an unusual object of such a fight. Though its revenue has increased every year since 2008, it has yet to become profitable. In 2011, the company lost $25.7 million, compared to $51 million the previous year.
Yet it also holds some charm for private equity suitors. The company, based in Madison, Wis., runs 11 resorts across the country that pull in stable revenues, which can help support a leveraged buyout.
The battle over Great Wolf began last year, after the company contacted at least 33 potential suitors. Apollo and KSL, a specialist in buying resort companies, emerged as two of the leading potential buyers by late last year, according to a person briefed on the matter.
Though both firms offered $5 a share, Great Wolf and its advisers chose to go forward with Apollo late last year, in part because it offered to assume the company's debt, this person said. Great Wolf had $515.2 million of debt as of Dec. 31.
The deal holds some significance for Apollo, which had sought to buy another amusement park owner, Cedar Fair, in 2009. That effort fell apart, however, when Cedar Fair's shareholders deemed the bid too low.
Apollo's initial bid was announced on March 13. At $5 a share, it was 19 percent above Great Wolf's closing stock price the day before. But shareholders appeared unimpressed, as the company's stock traded above the offer, indicating an expectation that another bidder may emerge.
About three weeks later, on Wednesday, KSL came back with a bid worth $6.25 a share, forcing Great Wolf to evaluate the new offer as part of its duty to shareholders. On Friday, Apollo countered with a bid of $6.75 a share, which Great Wolf accepted.
With KSL's latest bid, Great Wolf and its advisers will again need to scrutinize the offer and determine whether it is in shareholders' best interests.
Representatives for Great Wolf and Apollo declined to comment.
All is not lost for Apollo, however. The firm has the right to match KSL's newest offer, or walk away and receive up to $9 million in termination fees and expense reimbursements.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Transfers Control Of Raids To Afghanistan

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN; Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Accelerating the transition of military responsibility to the Afghan government, the United States agreed Sunday to hand control of special operations missions to Afghan forces, including night raids, relegating American troops to a supporting role and bringing the raids under Afghan judicial authority.
The deal clears the way for the two countries to move ahead with a more comprehensive partnership agreement that will establish the shape of American support to Afghanistan after the 2014 troop withdrawal deadline. And it resolves one of the most contentious issues for President Hamid Karzai, who faced intense domestic political pressure because of night raids' deep unpopularity here, even as American commanders had insisted they were the linchpin of the military mission in Afghanistan.
As recently as a year ago, American commanders expressed reservations about giving up nearly any measure of control over the raids. Since then, the relationship between the two countries has been reconfigured by a series of diplomatic crises and the American public's growing fatigue for the war, lending an increasing sense of imminence to the troop withdrawal.
At the same time, the United States has mounted an intense effort to move Afghan special operations forces to the fore, even as questions remain about the overall readiness of Afghan troops. 
At a signing ceremony in the capital, Abdul Rahim Wardak, the Afghan defense minister, and Gen. John R. Allen, the American commander here, hailed the agreement as a positive sign of Afghanistan's sovereignty and the growing abilities of its special operations forces.
''This is an important step in strengthening the sovereignty of Afghanistan,'' Mr. Wardak said, adding that it was ''a national goal'' and ''a wish of the Afghan people'' that raids be conducted and controlled by Afghans.
The memorandum of understanding signed on Sunday gives Afghan forces the lead role in night raid operations against suspected insurgents, and also requires an Afghan court warrant within 72 hours of a raid. A warrant can be issued after a raid only in cases where the intelligence needed to be acted on immediately, otherwise it must be executed in advance, according to Afghan officials.
Under the terms of the agreement, Afghan forces can still call on American troops for help and authorize them to enter Afghan residences and private compounds. The agreement covers all night raids carried out by special operations forces. However, a small number of night operations are conducted under other auspices, including special C.I.A.-trained units, that are not covered by the agreement, military and civilian officials said.
American officials close to the negotiations said that under the agreement, an interministry Afghan command center with representatives of the Defense and Interior Ministries, as well as the National Directorate of Security -- the Afghan intelligence agency -- would review or develop information about potential targets in consultation with Americans, who would continue to provide extensive intelligence support.
The interministry group would then decide whether to go after a target and send Afghan special operations forces to carry out the raid. The Afghans can request American assistance at any point in the operation -- for intelligence, for backup military support, air support, medical evacuation and post-operation intelligence gathering.
Afghan officials said that the Americans would not have the right to question detainees. Currently, they can question detainees and hold them indefinitely without trial. In practice, however, Americans might well be called on ''to assist in an investigation,'' said a United States official. The official emphasized that the relationship between Afghan and American troops was ''not an adversarial one,'' and United States officials did not appear to be worried that Americans would be denied access to detainees.
Several diplomats said that the most important aspect of the agreement, which goes into effect immediately, was that the two countries could take the next steps to complete the transition to Afghan control and allow foreign forces to leave the country.
''There's still work to be done, but clearly we have some critical momentum now,'' Ryan C. Crocker, the United States ambassador to Afghanistan, said as he left the signing ceremony.
In Washington, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta ''sees this important agreement as a sign of progress in the transition process, and as a key indicator of the enhanced capabilities of Afghan forces,'' said George Little, the Pentagon press secretary.
While the deal underscores the continuing diminution of American power here, the fact is that the United States and other allied countries still pay nearly all of the costs of Afghan security forces. That means the West will retain considerable leverage for some time to come, officials here said.
''The Americans are not giving up a huge amount,'' one Western official said. ''And if they are paying $4.1 billion a year for the Afghan military, if they want permission to question someone, I think they'll get it,'' the official added, referring to the approximate amount Western countries are expected to agree to contribute annually to cover Afghan security costs after 2014.
Still, an American military official involved in the negotiations described the agreement as ''a paradigm shift'' that substantially changed who was in charge, although the official emphasized that Afghan and American officers worked as a team, sitting side by side in an operations center, sharing intelligence and decision-making responsibilities on most targets.
In recent testimony before Congress, General Allen repeatedly assured lawmakers that an agreement would not weaken the pressure on important terrorist and insurgent leaders who have been the target of the raids. Providing new details, he said that Afghan forces took part in most of the 2,200 night operations last year, and, in practice, led many of them. He also said that civilian casualties occurred in less than 1.5 percent of the missions.
But public outrage has focused not only on civilian deaths but also on the invasion by foreign soldiers of private homes, in particular those where women and children are living. On that count, the agreement is a significant victory for Mr. Karzai, because he has long argued that the sense of outrage and violation was a pressing reason for an Afghan takeover of the raids.
With this agreement and the one reached on March 9 that laid out a six-month timetable for handing over detention operations to the Afghans, the strategic partnership agreement between the United States and Afghanistan can now go forward.
The two governments were to spend the next several weeks completing the partnership document, which would commit the United States to a 10-year involvement in Afghanistan that includes support of an array of civilian efforts including economic development and education. The Afghans and the Americans have wanted to have that agreement in place before a two-day NATO meeting in Chicago that is scheduled to start on May 20.
The NATO meeting will obligate countries in the coalition with the United States to commit to continuing financial contributions to Afghanistan's security forces and to training and equipping them. Not yet clear is the size of the Afghan security forces that the NATO countries will support, but almost certainly they will be a substantially smaller army and police force than Afghanistan has today.
The country's forces currently top 305,000, according to the Afghan Defense and Interior Ministries, and are expected to continue to rise this year to 352,000.
The night raid agreement solves one particularly thorny problem for the Americans, who have taken often-burdensome steps to make sure that when they detained Afghans and transferred them to Afghan custody, they avoided sending them to Afghan holding facilities where there was evidence of human rights abuses, including torture.
Now, Americans will no longer be responsible for detaining people and holding them, and, as a result, will not be implicated in the treatment of detainees. However, United States officials involved in the negotiations said they expected that Americans would continue to provide human rights training to the Afghan security forces.

HEADLINE: Newspaper Barons Resurface

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
Is there anything more forlorn than the American metropolitan newspaper? First readers began deserting in droves, then the advertisers followed. Family owners headed for the exits and then hedge funds and other financial players scooped up newspapers thinking they were buying at the bottom of the market. Greater fools came and went, each saying they could cut their way to former glory and renewed profitability. They got a haircut instead.
Many smaller community newspapers remain stable and newspapers with a large national footprint have generally done better. But quite a few of the midsize regional and metropolitan dailies that form the core of the industry have gone off a cliff: over all, the newspaper industry is half as big as it was seven years ago.
So if most newspapers are an uneconomical proposition incapable of sustaining profits, let alone pay off the debt so many buyers have larded on them, who is left to own them? 
Rich guys.
Not the merely well off, but the kind of men with who long ago separated themselves from humdrum economic realities of life. Sure there are other expensive hobbies, but how many antique cars or 19th-century landscapes can you own? Newspapers may be short on profits, but they have become a new form of ostentation. How rich is he? He can afford to own a newspaper, for crying out loud.
At the end of last year, Warren E. Buffett bought The Omaha World-Herald through his company, Berkshire Hathaway. This would be the same Mr. Buffett who told his annual shareholder meeting in 2009 that newspapers faced ''unending losses'' and that he would not buy most of them ''at any price.'' Yet there he was, ponying up $200 million for a relatively small regional newspaper in Berkshire Hathaway's hometown.
And he is not alone. Douglas F. Manchester, a very rich developer, bought The San Diego Union Tribune at about the same time, for a reported $110 million. At the end of last month, S. Donald Sussman, a hedge fund manager and philanthropist who is married to a congresswoman, Chellie Pingree, bought a stake in the company that owns The Portland Press Herald in Maine.
And then word came at the beginning of last week that a group of very rich, very influential Philadelphia businessmen -- including George E. Norcross III, a Democratic power broker in Southern New Jersey, and Lewis Katz, the parking magnate -- bought the Philadelphia Media Network, which owns The Inquirer, The Daily News and Philly.com.
Does all this smart money see something the rest of us have failed to? Some hidden, unlocked riches in these distressed assets? No. In each instance, the buyer was motivated, at least in part, by the fact that the newspapers faced an existential threat: but for the new owners and their deep pockets, they might go away.
The benefactors also stand to benefit in ways that may not go directly to the bottom line, but have significant value. We will give the Oracle of Omaha a bye here because no newspaper can touch him -- newsprint spitballs against a battleship -- but in San Diego, Mr. Manchester has been frank about using the paper to prosecute a pro-development, pro-new-stadium agenda.
Mr. Sussman is now wed to both a member of Congress and one of the largest newspapers in Maine, so the conflict there is manifest. And the men involved in the Philadelphia purchase have received frequent and sometimes rugged coverage from the papers there.
At this point, the media columnist is supposed to make tsk-tsk noises about editorial independence. But that moralism is a luxury that mostly belongs to another era, when newspapers had functional monopolies and everyone was dying to get their hands on them. Now selling a newspaper is akin to peddling a used Humvee, a hulking beast that has lost relevance in a changed landscape.
Besides, who is to say that it will turn out badly, at least in terms of sustaining much-needed coverage in important American cities? The Philadelphia properties have had four owners in the last five years and the recent sale price of $55 million was just 10 percent of what they were worth in 2006. One of the ownership groups was led by Brian P. Tierney, a public relations executive who was assailed for harboring all manner of agendas when he helped buy the newspapers.
At the time, a former Inquirer reporter, Ralph Cipriano, said of Mr. Tierney: ''He doesn't understand what we do. He doesn't respect what we do, and he doesn't think we should be doing it.'' He added: ''I don't see how a guy like that can run a newspaper and not just turn it into another extension of the spin machine.''
It didn't turn out that way. Mr. Tierney eventually lost control of the papers for business reasons, but when he did, the staffs and many people in Philadelphia hailed him as a hero, a man who rigorously oversaw the editorial independence of a newspaper he once fought with.
One reason he got such high marks is that he hired William K. Marimow, formerly a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter at The Inquirer. Mr. Marimow was quickly dismissed after Mr. Tierney lost control of the newspapers to his lenders.
Mr. Katz and Mr. Norcross faced similar skepticism in the run-up to their purchase. Just before the sale was announced, The Inquirer quoted a report by the New Jersey comptroller accusing Mr. Norcross of orchestrating an insurance payback scheme. Arriving with a big credibility gap, the new owners responded by bringing back Mr. Marimow from Arizona State, where he had been teaching, and reinstalling him as editor in chief.
If you pull back a few thousand feet, you can see newspapers coming full circle. Before World War II, newspapers were mostly owned by political and business interests who used them to push an agenda. People like William Randolph Hearst and Robert McCormick wielded their newspapers as cudgels to get their way. It was only when newspapers began making all kinds of money in the postwar era that they were professionalized and infused with editorial standards.
''We are going back to a form of ownership that dominated in an earlier era,'' said Alan D. Mutter, a newspaper and technology consultant. ''As newspapers become less impressive businesses, people are going to buy them as trophies or bully pulpits or some other form of personal expression.''
David Nasaw, a professor of history at the CUNY Graduate Center, has written extensively about the newspaper barons of old. He is skeptical about the motives of their modern descendants. ''People just have to be aware that other agendas exist, and the owners should be clear about that, but any time a big city newspaper is saved, I think we should stand up and salute.''
The Philly newspapers may end up being a cat toy for the new owners. Or the owners could catch the journalism bug and access the angels of their better natures.
Mr. Marimow, speaking before he had to run off to teach a class, said that it beats the alternative.
''I am coming back because I strongly believe that this ownership group, despite their connections, is interested in producing news in print and online that is going to be distinguished and will serve the public in the Philadelphia area,'' he said. ''I also believe that over the long term, they will produce a highly profitable business.''
I'm both a journalism geek and an optimist, so I'll choose to believe most of what he believes. Except that last part about ''highly profitable.''

HEADLINE: Do You Need That Test?

 BODY:
If health care costs are ever to be brought under control, the nation's doctors will have to play a leading role in eliminating unnecessary treatments. By some estimates, hundreds of billions of dollars are wasted this way every year. So it is highly encouraging that nine major physicians' groups have identified 45 tests and procedures (five for each specialty) that are commonly used but have no proven benefit for many patients and sometimes cause more harm than good. 
Many patients will be surprised at the tests and treatments that these expert groups now question. They include, for example, annual electrocardiograms for low-risk patients and routine chest X-rays for ambulatory patients in advance of surgery.
The doctors were prodded into action by a conscience-provoking article by Dr. Howard Brody, director of an institute that explores ethical issues in health care, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in early 2010. Dr. Brody criticized the performance of medical groups during the health care debates, saying they were too concerned about protecting doctors' incomes while refusing to contemplate measures (beyond malpractice reform) to reduce health care costs.
He urged each specialty society, using rigorous scientific approaches, to develop ''top five'' lists of tests and treatments whose elimination for major categories of patients would save the most money quickly ''without depriving any patient of meaningful medical benefit.'' A foundation established by the American Board of Internal Medicine financed a successful test of the approach in three primary care specialties and then encouraged a broad range of specialty groups to develop their own lists.
The first nine, including cardiology, oncology, radiology and primary care, issued ''top five'' lists last Wednesday. Among items on those lists are: cardiac stress tests for annual checkups in asymptomatic patients; brain imaging scans after fainting; antibiotics for uncomplicated sinus infections that are almost always caused by viruses, which are not treatable with antibiotics; imaging of the lower spine within the first six weeks after suffering back pain; and bone scans for early prostate and breast cancer patients at low risk of metastasis.
The societies developed the lists after months of analyses and reviews of the medical literature by expert committees. In some cases, the groups showed admirable statesmanship by proposing cuts that would affect their incomes, as when radiologists proposed limits on various tests they perform and gastroenterologists proposed limits on the frequency of colonoscopies.
Eight additional societies will release their lists next fall, expanding the campaign to cut waste more broadly through the health care system. Ultimately, the societies ought to develop top 10, 20 or 50 lists if there is enough evidence to make that possible.
Patients must take responsibility as well. They must discipline themselves not to request care of little or no value. To help patients make informed decisions, Consumer Reports is developing more-accessible versions of the lists and will join other organizations in disseminating them.
Patients with comprehensive health insurance may not care much if needless tests are performed. But if health care costs continue to soar, patients will be shouldering more of the financial burden. And there can be serious health consequences from unnecessary treatment, including excess radiation, adverse drug effects, exposure to germs in medical institutions and even exploratory surgery or biopsies when scans produce a false positive.
Eliminating needless care is not rationing. It is sound medicine and sound economics.

HEADLINE: Egyptian Presidential Candidate Carries Banner of the Old Order

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Mayy El Sheikh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Former President Hosni Mubarak's intelligence chief and vice president filed papers in Egypt on Sunday declaring himself a presidential candidate. His entry gives Egyptians a chance to cast a vote against the revolution and for the old order.
The former vice president, Omar Suleiman, has been considered a potential candidate for months, and his formal entry is unlikely to shake up the race. In a recent poll taken by Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, a state-financed research institution, about 9 percent of voters volunteered that Mr. Suleiman was the candidate they would choose, putting him in fourth place. The poll was completed before the popular Muslim Brotherhood nominated its own candidate, Khairat el-Shater. 
Mr. Suleiman, a retired general, could become a magnet for the support of Egyptians most unhappy with the revolt that ousted Mr. Mubarak. Although the uprising produced Egypt's first free and fair parliamentary elections, it has also led to more than a year of continued street protests, soaring crime rates, an economy on the brink of collapse and an increase in the power of both moderate and conservative Islamists.
Although almost no one is calling for Mr. Mubarak's release from confinement or for a restoration of his government, many long for order. And a few still whisper that it takes a strong hand to control a country like Egypt, with its high rates of poverty and illiteracy.
Mr. Suleiman's closeness to Mr. Mubarak is hard to overstate, and he was often talked about, along with the former president's son Gamal, as a potential successor. For decades, Mr. Suleiman was Mr. Mubarak's closest adviser, often trusted with the most delicate matters, like Egypt's talks with Israel and the Palestinians.
As chief of intelligence, Mr. Suleiman knew all the secrets of the old government, its friends and its enemies. American officials have said that on matters of foreign policy, talking to Mr. Suleiman was as good as talking to Mr. Mubarak himself, and State Department cables released by the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks show that Mr. Suleiman collaborated with the United States in the interrogation of people suspected of being terrorists. Torture was routine under the Mubarak government's security services.
The cables also show that Mr. Suleiman equated the Muslim Brotherhood, the moderate Islamist group that now dominates the Egyptian Parliament, with dangerous radicalism. He shared the Mubarak government's opposition to democratic reforms on the grounds that they would open Egypt to a takeover by the Brotherhood. In an American television interview in the days before Mr. Mubarak was forced from power, Mr. Suleiman said that Egypt was not ready for democracy.
After the uprising began, Mr. Mubarak said he would not run for re-election, and he named Mr. Suleiman his vice president, effectively tapping him to become the next president under Egypt's old system of rigged elections. When Mr. Mubarak was forced to leave power by a council of generals to end the revolt, Mr. Suleiman announced the transfer on state television.
His speech appeared involuntary. A burly man -- later identified as an air force officer -- stood behind him, possibly to ensure that Mr. Suleiman delivered his lines, and the guardian became an Egyptian folk hero known as ''the man behind Omar Suleiman.''
Mr. Suleiman's relationship with Egypt's military rulers and with the country's new Islamist parties is now a subject of renewed speculation. As he announced his candidacy, some analysts here argued that Mr. Suleiman could become the military's presidential pick. Mr. Suleiman, the argument goes, would be the military's champion to prevent the election of a president more determined to subject the military to civilian control.
Still, his relationship with the generals is unclear. His entry into the race, however, could draw support away from other former officials of the old government. The most popular candidate in Al Ahram's poll was Amr Moussa, a former foreign minister under Mr. Mubarak who became general secretary of the Arab League. He drew the support of more than 30 percent of the voters who said their minds were made up. Ahmed Shafiq, a former general and a former airline executive who was Mr. Mubarak's last prime minister, is another contender. The poll showed Mr. Shafiq, Mr. Suleiman and a liberal Islamist, Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, all with roughly the same level of support, 8 to 10 percent. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1,200 adults across Egypt for the poll.
Mr. Shater, in an interview with Reuters on Sunday, called Mr. Suleiman's candidacy ''an insult to the revolution and the Egyptian people.'' He said that Mr. Suleiman could ''only win through forgery, and if this happens, the revolution will kick off again.''
Sunday was the last day to register candidates, and the Muslim Brotherhood filed papers for a backup candidate, Mohamed el-Morsi, in the event of a successful legal challenge to Mr. Shater's eligibility based on a criminal conviction at a political trial under the Mubarak government.
Very little public campaigning has taken place to introduce the candidates, so name recognition appears to be playing a big role in the polls. The voting begins May 23, with a two-candidate runoff set for mid-June.
In Al Ahram's poll, nearly 60 percent of the respondents said they wanted a candidate with an Islamist background -- Islamists won more than 70 percent of the seats in Parliament -- strongly suggesting that any Islamist who reaches the runoff will have an advantage if the vote is free and fair.
Before the Brotherhood nominated Mr. Shater, the most popular Islamist in the poll was the ultraconservative candidate Hazem Salah Abu Ismail, who had the support of about 22 percent of the respondents. But he was officially disqualified over the weekend because his mother held American citizenship. His support is likely to go either to Mr. Shater, an instant front-runner because of the backing of the Muslim Brotherhood, or to Mr. Aboul Fotouh, a former leader of the Brotherhood who is running against its wishes.
Mr. Suleiman opened his campaign with a stunt that recalled former President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who once said he would resign but then held a national referendum to show that Egyptians wanted him to remain in office.
Mr. Suleiman announced last week that he would not run, only to change his mind after a relatively small demonstration by a few hundred supporters.
''I have been shaken by your strong position,'' he said in a statement addressed to ''citizens of Egypt.''
''I am a soldier who has never disobeyed an order,'' he said. ''Your faith in my ability is an honor.''

PERSON: Peter Douglas 

HEADLINE: Peter Douglas, 69, Sentry of California's Coast, Dies

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Peter Douglas, who fought for decades to preserve the California coast -- treasured for its vast stretches of pristine beaches, jagged cliffs and delicate wetlands -- died on April 1 at his sister's home in La Quinta, Calif. He was 69.
The cause was lung cancer, his son Vanja said. 
For 26 years, Mr. Douglas was the executive director of the California Coastal Commission, the powerful state agency that he helped create with a mandate to keep the coast open to the public -- and one that set a high standard for its counterparts in other states.
He brought a profound passion for the sea to the task.
Mr. Douglas was a boy when he, his mother and sister boarded a ship to cross the English Channel while emigrating from Germany after World War II, eventually coming to the United States. The roiling currents and tides entranced him, he once said, creating ''an intangible, unbreakable, lifelong bond.''
It became his mission to ensure that all Californians could swim, surf, fish or just see the sea along the 1.5 million acres of the state's 1,100 miles of coastline -- to the consternation of many commercial interests and property owners.
Mr. Douglas was the executive director of the commission from 1985 until November, when he stepped down because of his declining health.
Bearded and usually wearing Birkenstock sandals, a bolo tie and hiking pants, he was known to sometimes pull his biodiesel car to the side of a highway and stand in front of bulldozers operating without a permit.
''Few, if any, conservation leaders have had a greater impact on protecting California's stunning coastal resources, and all Americans owe him a great debt of gratitude,'' Kerry O'Toole, president of the American Land Conservancy, said when Mr. Douglas retired.
Mr. Douglas was a young lawyer working for a state assemblyman in the early 1970s when he was assigned to draft legislation to protect the coastline. In that capacity, he was the principal writer of Proposition 20, the 1972 referendum that established the commission.
He helped write the Coastal Act of 1976, which gave the commission permanent status as a quasi-judicial agency with jurisdiction that often surpasses that of city officials and the state authorities. The commission's mandate includes limiting coastal construction, ensuring public access to beaches and advocating for regulation of offshore drilling.
During Mr. Douglas's tenure, the agency helped create thousands of acres of parklands and public trails. The agency also secured more than 1,300 easements for paths to the shore through private property, and its efforts led to the preservation of much of Highway 1 as a two-lane road weaving through farmland, cliffs and dunes.
In one of its most prominent decisions, the commission denied a 1998 plan by heirs to William Randolph Hearst, the famed newspaper publisher, to build a 650-room resort and golf course on the vast Hearst estate near the shore in San Simeon. It would have obstructed views and public access and intruded on sensitive wildlife habitats, the commission concluded.
Mr. Douglas provoked considerable opposition, particularly from the Pacific Legal Foundation, which has sued the commission in dozens of cases. Paul Beard, head of the foundation's legal team, said: ''Under Douglas's leadership, the commission became the rogue agency that it is, running roughshod over people's rights, destroying economic opportunity and, ironically, making it unaffordable for all but the wealthiest to buy land in California's coastal zone.''
But for Annie Notthoff, the California advocacy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national organization, he was a groundbreaker.
''California set the standard for protecting the coast, and that has expanded to almost every other coastal state in the country,'' she said. ''So if you look out to sea anywhere in the country, California and Peter Douglas have had a major impact.''
Not enough of an impact, according to Mr. Douglas. ''The coast,'' he told The Los Angeles Times in 2001, ''is never saved. It's always being saved.''
Born Peter Michael Ehlers in Berlin on Aug. 22, 1942, (he and his sister changed their last name upon becoming American citizens), Mr. Douglas and his mother, Maria, and sister, Christiane, joined relatives in Los Angeles after arriving in the United States in 1950.
Besides his son and his sister, Mr. Douglas (who lived in Larkspur, Calif., and had a home by a river near the Oregon border) is survived by another son, Sascha; and two grandchildren. His marriage to the former Rotraut Schmidt ended in divorce.
He was ''the world's best bureaucratic street fighter,'' Steve Blank, a member of the commission, told The New York Times in 2010.
''Once he's gone, this commission will implode in the blink of an eye,'' Mr. Blank said, ''and all we'll be talking about is the color of the concrete used to pave over what's left of the coast.''

HEADLINE: Volunteers Scramble to Save a School for Immigrants

BYLINE: By RANDY LEONARD

 BODY:
As a result of the economic downturn and a dwindling endowment, the International Center, which has taught English and helped immigrants assimilate for decades, faces dissolution and eviction from its Manhattan home.
The center, which has more than 300 active volunteers and currently teaches about 1,500 students, shocked its volunteers last month with the news that it was behind on its rent and would have to close its doors on West 23rd Street, where it has been for about 20 years.
Dr. Allen Keller, who directs a program at Bellevue Hospital Center for international survivors of war and torture and often refers patients to the International Center, said the center's closing would be a ''terrible loss for us, for our city and our community.'' 
''They have helped over the years so many of the individuals we care for, who are among the most vulnerable new New Yorkers,'' Dr. Keller said. ''We need to be opening more centers and places like the International Center, not closing them.''
But volunteers and the center's few staff members said they refused to let the organization they described as a home, a family and a cultural hub die. In the past week, they have formed committees to find a new location, advertise changes and raise money (their goal is $100,000). Because the board is dissolving the nonprofit organization, they hope to reincorporate with a slightly changed name in a new location, said one volunteer, Winfield Cooper, 67.
Mr. Cooper, a retired teacher who has worked abroad, said he had been told that the board had tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with the landlord and that the center, which teaches about 200 immigrant students free of charge, would have to close by the end of the month.
The board chairman, Jack Van Hulst, and board president, Gabriella Sperry, declined to comment. The landlord, Two Trees Management, also declined to comment. On Sunday, a pop-up box on the center's Web site indicated that no new students were being accepted.
Lucy Benedict, a Holocaust survivor from Austria, started volunteering at the center when it first opened above a garage near Carnegie Hall in 1961. Asked what she would do without the center, Ms. Benedict said, ''I have not considered that.''
For Jesus Benaventa, 43, an immigrant from Venezuela who started coming to the center in August, it has been a place to learn new cultures and to develop relationships with people from all over the world. ''It's not only a school,'' he said. Mr. Benaventa was at the center last week with a volunteer, Cliff Cohen, 55, discussing items that might appear on the menu at a fried-chicken restaurant.
The center offers more than a dozen courses on subjects including pronunciation, academic writing and literature. In one class, students are reading John Steinbeck's ''Of Mice and Men.''
Another volunteer, Sharron Davis, 72, teaches a class on getting a job in the United States. At the end of her 10-week course, students have professional resumes and are ''able to market themselves in a short conversation with anyone they meet,'' she said.
''I spent my career dealing with ex-pats,'' said Ms. Davis, who has worked in human resources. ''I know what it's like to live in a foreign country and not speak the language very well and struggle to survive.''
But the center's mission, she said, was not just to teach English, but to help immigrants ''become fully productive members of American society.''
Wilzrigue Paul, 33, an accountant from Haiti, came to the center five months ago after completing basic instruction at the Riverside Language Program on the Upper West Side.
''They told me there are many schools in Manhattan, but the best they can recommend was the International Center,'' Mr. Paul said.
Patience Tamisimbi, 39, from the Democratic Republic of Congo, came to the center three months ago at the recommendation of Dr. Keller's program at Bellevue.
Last year, Ms. Tamisimbi said, the police in Kinshasa arrested her because of her political affiliation. ''They tortured me, they raped me,'' she said. After the police came looking for her at home a few days later, she fled the country.
Before she arrived in the United States, Ms. Tamisimbi said, she thought America was a big country full of rich people, but she has come to realize that ''they are just people like me.''
As her English improves, she hopes to get a job as a translator and eventually study to be a laboratory technician.
Mahmood Ali, 25, came to the United States from Yemen five months ago and said the center was where he interacted with other Arabic people. Its cafe offers a space where religion and philosophy can be discussed openly, he said, and it was the first place where he talked at length with an Israeli.
''This place cannot stop,'' Mr. Ali said. He compared the center to a tree: If it is cut, he said, ''it will blossom again and grow up again, because it has a soul.''

HEADLINE: Begrudging the Wildcats' Success and Opportunities

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A new baseball season is under way, the N.B.A. is headed toward another exciting finish, and yet the University of Kentucky's success in men's basketball has sparked outrage that lingers a week after the national championship game.
Why is there such hand-wringing?
Later this month, college underclassmen who wish to enter the N.B.A. draft must declare their intention to do so. Five of those undergraduates are expected to come from the Kentucky team that helped Coach John Calipari win his first national championship. All of Kentucky's starters -- two freshmen and three sophomores -- could be selected in the first round when the N.B.A. holds its draft in June, their next crucial step toward the realization of a cherished dream.
Yet Kentucky's success has prompted critics to predict the demise of college basketball and the end of higher education as we know it. 
In an ideal world, everyone would stay four years and graduate. But Kentucky's basketball program is in fact a tribute to a real-world system that works, preparing young people for a viable profession -- in this case, professional athletics.
Not only in basketball and football but also across the spectrum of intercollegiate sports, top-tier athletes are honing their skills for the pros. Tennis players and golfers often leave college after one or two years to turn pro. Baseball players are drafted out of high school; many of those who accept college scholarships play for two or three years before leaving for the pro ranks. In hockey, talented underclassmen leave college after the season and join the pro team that holds their rights.
Intercollegiate athletics feed and nourish the professional leagues. But they also doing what colleges are supposed to: preparing their students for a productive future.
Calipari and his staff have done this well. In his first two seasons at Kentucky, Calipari has had eight players leave early for the N.B.A. -- five of them freshmen.
So why has the prospect of five U.K. young players turning pro unsettled so many people?
If the core of the Kentucky team had been made up of white players with phenomenal athleticism and acumen at every position -- operating in the context of a largely black sport -- we would not be hearing the complaining. Their success would not be seen as a debasement. The team would be celebrated and feted -- as Butler was, as Gonzaga used to be.
Last week, I asked Tom Izzo, the basketball coach at Michigan State, if he thought a highly talented, highly athletic team of white players would be viewed differently.
''I want to answer that as honestly as I can,'' Izzo said. ''I think it would be different. I hate to say that.''
The perception is that these five black players are not serious students and don't belong at the university. If they were white, there would be more acceptance that they belong at the university.
''It's sad for me to say, but it's probably the truth,'' Izzo said. Perception or not, the reality is that the sports industry has done its part preparing young men and women for their careers as professional athletes. Only a small percentage will succeed, but only a fraction succeed at the highest level in any profession.
The question critics should be asking is how educators can do what the best high school and college coaches do: identify and develop talent and provide opportunity.
The best coaches sell young people on a dream and on working to achieve it. Too many classrooms are littered with instructors -- many with impeccable credentials -- who can't inspire students to dream. Or work.
If there were easily identifiable multibillion-dollar profits to be made by producing talented science, math and English prodigies from poor and largely black and brown neighborhoods, the John Caliparis of the world would be popping up in classrooms across America with innovative ways to get students to produce.
The one-and-done controversy is less about basketball and education and more about opportunity, at a time when opportunity and social mobility in the United States are becoming more and more narrow.
For more than two decades, I have lived in the relatively ungentrified part of Harlem and have seen young men and women scuffle with unemployment, with negative consequences of brushes with the law and the judicial system, with schools that Harlem's Queen Mother Moore once described as ''idiot factories.''
Many of them have also dealt with economic inequality. The idea of being born into or achieving great wealth is a dream a few may achieve but most will not.
This is a part of the narrative in which everyone will step back, survey his or her network of friends and pull out the exceptions -- the highly successful entrepreneur or chief executive, the lawyer, the doctor -- as examples of those who have overcome obstacles and achieved their dream.
When we look at these examples through a wider lens, we see how truly exceptional they are in the larger sea of faces who have no real shot of achieving even a replica of the American dream. Not unless they experience a growth spurt and are pulled aboard an economic express by someone like Calipari.
Izzo said this reality was why he encouraged one of his players, Zach Randolph, to turn pro after his first year at Michigan State.
Izzo knew Randolph was not ready emotionally, Randolph's mother knew it and Randolph probably knew it. But when you are being pursued by the poverty hounds and see a fence, you jump it and take your chances with whatever is on the other side.
''When Zach Randolph wanted to go, I thought he should go,'' Izzo said. ''I thought he was one of the poorest kids I ever recruited. I thought he was a good enough player that he could survive. I did not fight him at all.''
Randolph entered the 2001 N.B.A. draft. After the 2004 season, he signed a six-year, $84 million extension; last April, he agreed to a four-year extension with the Memphis Grizzlies worth a guaranteed $66 million.
''His mother was 100 percent for him staying at the time,'' Izzo said, ''although I'm sure she feels pretty good about it now.''
Athletes, like any other students, need to be able to take advantage of the opportunities they have, when they occur. It's just that for many college basketball and football players, their opportunities beyond athletics are limited, even with the benefit of an education. Many white athletes have options that go far beyond the playing field.
A few months ago during a conversation with N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell at my barber shop, he said his greatest regret was having not played college sports. Goodell was a star high school football and baseball player, but he said he did not play in college because he wasn't a great student in high school and had to prove to his parents he could turn his life around.
''To be honest with you, I started thinking that I don't think I'm going to play in the N.F.L., but I think I might be able to make a career out of it,'' he said, referring to forging an off-the-field career.
Goodell said that upon graduating college in 1981, he wrote a letter to his father, who was a United States senator, in which he said he wanted to make him proud and wanted to be the N.F.L. commissioner.
Had Goodell played big-time college sports and been a star, he may very well never have become commissioner. He could have spent his 20s chasing the dream of an athlete, not an executive, and living that life.
But even had he become immersed in the life of a pro athlete, Goodell, given his upper-middle-class background, would very likely have been pulled onto the executive path.
Professional sports can be an antidote to a harrowing reality for a young athlete. Opportunity is not equal. Even with the risks attached, the one-and-done loophole helps level a grossly uneven playing field.

HEADLINE: With Eye on General Election, 'Super PAC' Aims Blitz at Obama

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
American Crossroads, the biggest of the Republican ''super PACs,'' is planning to begin its first major anti-Obama advertising blitz of the year, a moment the Obama re-election campaign has been girding for and another sign that the general election is starting in earnest.
With an anticipated bank account of more than $200 million, officials at American Crossroads said they would probably begin their campaign this month. But they said they would focus the bulk of the first phase from May through July, which they believe is a critical period for making an impression on voters, before summer vacations and the party conventions take place.
Steven J. Law, the group's leader, said the ads would address the challenge of unseating a president who polls show is viewed favorably even though many people disapprove of his handling of the economy. Basically, Mr. Law said, ''how to dislodge voters from him.'' 
The ultimate goal of the Crossroads campaign, Mr. Law said, would be to better connect Americans' disappointment with the economy to their views of the president, especially among crucial swing voters.
The Crossroads advertising push -- the timing of which has been the subject of avid speculation at the Obama campaign headquarters in Chicago -- would give the campaign of Mitt Romney, the Republican front-runner, the time and cover to map out its national organization, replenish its bank account and put the finishing touches on its own long-discussed advertising plan, which is expected to highlight the economic pain of ordinary Americans.
Crossroads was founded with help from the Republican strategists Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie -- the latter just signed on as an adviser to Mr. Romney -- and so far it has largely been sitting on the sidelines, studying the electorate and planning for the fall as the Republican nominating contest continued.
Its decision to enter now is helped by a growing perception that the Republican race is nearly over and that Mr. Romney is the presumed nominee, particularly as speculation increases about the future of the candidacy of Rick Santorum (who is not campaigning for several days because of his daughter Bella's illness). And Crossroads' planned intervention affirms predictions that the general election campaign will be fought in large part by proxy, via the super PACs, which have been emboldened by the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling in 2010 that helped pave the way for their creation.
Combined with expected activity from a pro-Romney super PAC, Restore Our Future, and a Republican National Committee with better finances than expected, Crossroads is helping to ease fears among some Republicans that Mr. Obama's projected financial advantage -- with more than $80 million on hand and expectations to have raised at least $750 million all told -- would overwhelm Mr. Romney, who had $7.3 million on hand in his last filing report from February, especially at the start.
The prolonged and hard-fought nominating contest, Mr. Romney's advisers said, has put his campaign nearly two months behind on its initial plan to build political and field operations in the dozen states where both sides agree that most of the general election will be fought: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. (In the final phase of the campaign, Romney officials believe that the election could come down to just four states: Colorado, Nevada, Ohio and Virginia.)
Republican elected officials and strategists acknowledged in interviews that Mr. Romney had significant ground to make up -- Mr. Obama leads in many early polls of swing states.
Gov. John R. Kasich, Republican of Ohio, where Mr. Romney narrowly beat Mr. Santorum, said Mr. Romney needed to show that he can connect with voters and ''demonstrate that he understands their problems.'' But, Mr. Kasich added, ''There is going to be a part of the electorate that is a lot more interested in beating Obama than electing the Republican.''
The Republican primary season, which veered into fights over contraception, abortion and immigration, has lifted the gloom Democrats had been feeling.
Gov. Jerry Brown of California said he became more optimistic about Mr. Obama's re-election chances after ''the Republican primaries gave us these dramatic performances'' that pushed Mr. Romney ''farther and farther from the center of gravity in American politics.''
Obama campaign aides said they would not give Mr. Romney any room to recover from what several polls show to be high unfavorable ratings. A new fusillade of commercials, Web videos and Twitter posts is painting Mr. Romney as a disconnected businessman who favors the rich and will keep in place the approach that caused the financial crisis and put an unfair burden on the middle class and the poor.
David Axelrod, a senior Obama strategist, made a similar argument against American Crossroads on Sunday when asked to address its planned campaign against the president. ''That's going to be a tough sell,'' he said, adding that voters ''would see right through those who want to go back to the same failed policies that were so punishing for them and the entire country.''
Mr. Obama has his own supportive super PAC, Priorities USA Action, which is now sifting through Mr. Romney's most embarrassing campaign moments for its expected volley of commercials.
But Priorities USA Action is not nearly as well-financed as its Republican rivals. The group and its issues-oriented partner, Priorities USA, raised $6.1 million last year, with donations from the film executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Service Employees International Union and the United Auto Workers union.
American Crossroads and its affiliated Crossroads GPS raised $51 million last year, according to federal election filings, much of it from the conservative financier Harold C. Simmons and other wealthy donors with interests in coal, real estate and finance.
These groups will be formidable allies for Mr. Romney's campaign. Though they are legally prohibited from coordinating with his strategists, they are working on the same mission, to shift the debate away from issues of wealth inequality -- terrain that appears to favor Mr. Obama -- and toward what Stuart Stevens, a senior Romney strategist, said would be a referendum on the president and his promise to of economic recovery.
''There's a sense of anxiety out there that's tremendous,'' Mr. Stevens said. ''It's home heating costs, it's gas prices, the price of food is up. What about people's everyday lives is easier today than it was four years ago?''
But, Mr. Law said, Crossroads research suggests that Mr. Obama's campaign has started to gain traction among critical swing voters by arguing that Republicans, including Mr. Romney, favor an ''economic plutocracy'' in which middle-class voters can no longer count on financial security, even though they work hard and play by the rules.
''His argument is: 'The reason you feel bad is not because I've been an inadequate president but because the rules of the game are stacked against you,' '' Mr. Law said. Calling it a ''dystopian vision,'' he added, ''that narrative has some gravitational pull.''
But, Mr. Law said, interviews with independent voters, as well as uncommitted Democrats and Republicans who supported Mr. Obama in 2008, have revealed an alternate ''emerging view'' that Crossroads will seek to solidify, ''that Obama just may not be up to the job, he can't seem to fix things he promised he would fix.''
Though Mr. Law would not discuss the planned Crossroads ads in detail, he indicated that the first ones would try not to offend the sensibilities of swing voters who still like Mr. Obama, apparently in part for fear of rallying them to his side.
For all of that, both sides agree that the outcome could depend on events largely out of their control, most of them linked to the economy.
''The biggest issue,'' said Gov. Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, ''is still jobs.''

HEADLINE: How to Fix the World Bank

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. BOLLYKY. 
Thomas J. Bollyky is the senior fellow for global health, economics and development at the Council on Foreign Relations.

 BODY:
FOR the first time since the World Bank's creation at the end of World War II, the United States is facing a real challenge over the bank's leadership. Leaders of some developing and emerging economies have refused to support President Obama's unexpected choice of Jim Yong Kim, the president of Dartmouth College, to lead the bank.
As the bank's executive board prepares to vote on April 18, the Americans are likely to get their way, since an 85 percent supermajority of the bank's voting shares are needed to appoint a president, and the United States is the largest shareholder. But the controversy is not going away. The Economist and Financial Times have endorsed Dr. Kim's main competitor, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, an economist who is Nigeria's finance minister and a former managing director of the bank. Jose Antonio Ocampo, a former Colombian finance minister and high-ranking United Nations official, has also been put forward as an alternative. Petitions are circulating among former bank officials and economists supporting the alternatives to Dr. Kim. 
The controversy around Dr. Kim's nomination is understandable. For decades, America has effectively had unilateral control over who gets to lead the World Bank. Mr. Obama's unconventional pick of Dr. Kim, a physician and anthropologist, has opened the door to developing countries to put forward their own candidates whose economic and banking qualifications more closely resemble those of past leaders of the bank.
Regardless of whether Dr. Kim is the right choice -- and I happen to believe he is an inspired choice -- his candidacy and the bank will suffer unless the United States takes the high ground and uses this controversy to reform how the institution is governed. Only by embracing a competitive election process can the United States ensure that Dr. Kim will have the mandate to revitalize an institution long resistant to change.
Having an American at the helm of the bank partly served to reassure Wall Street, originally the main supplier of the bank's capital. With the globalization of capital markets, this justification for the arrangement is long outdated.
Without a competitive selection process, the best leadership ideas cannot emerge. Conversely, an election based on American citizenship, as opposed to a vision for institutional leadership, limits the support from shareholders that the president of the World Bank needs to enact bold reforms.
As a result, the World Bank remains largely stuck in an operational model of providing country-specific loans and grants that are increasingly irrelevant to its institutional mission of reducing global poverty. With the spectacular economic growth of many developing countries in the last decade, commercial investment in many emerging markets is booming. The typical aid-recipient country receives donor financing worth less than 1 percent of its income.
The pressing challenges in international development have also changed. While fewer countries are very poor, many of their citizens remain so. The number of people living on less than $2 per day has declined as a share of the world's population but has stayed around 2.5 billion since 1981. Income disparities have increased. More than two-thirds of the world's poorest people now live in middle-income countries, where health care, education and environmental regulations lag far behind economic growth. Persistent poverty, when combined with limited governance and unprecedented rates of urbanization, has produced huge slums, which now house nearly one billion people in developing countries. Many of the emerging threats to global prosperity are collective problems that no government alone can solve: climate change, water shortages, inadequate agricultural productivity.
Critics say that Dr. Kim lacks basic qualifications for the job: government management experience and expertise in macroeconomics and finance. But Dr. Kim is a refreshing change from the bankers, business executives and politicians who have long led the bank.
He is revered by public health advocates for his work on H.I.V./AIDS and drug-resistant tuberculosis as a World Health Organization official and as a founder of the advocacy and research organization Partners in Health. Dr. Kim was an early adopter of the data-driven approaches and rigorous evaluations that identify what works best in development and build accountability for their implementation.
At a time when many development challenges know no borders, his experience fighting infectious disease and mobilizing affordable treatments for the poor is more relevant than a deep understanding of capital markets. (And while Dartmouth is a much smaller institution than the World Bank, Dr. Kim demonstrated managerial resolve at the college in taking on the $100 million operating deficit that he inherited with budget cuts and layoffs, over objections from the faculty.)
Dr. Kim's lack of financial expertise and government experience are damning only if he is forced to lead an institution largely devoted to providing the country-by-country loans and grants that fewer and fewer governments need. Accordingly, the major qualification that Dr. Kim lacks to lead the World Bank is a mandate for change.
Past reform-minded World Bank presidents have recognized the imperative of adapting to changing needs. Fifteen years ago, James D. Wolfensohn pushed to transform the institution into a ''knowledge bank'' that promoted the best ideas to address the biggest challenges in global poverty. Robert B. Zoellick, the departing president, opened bank databases to outside researchers and created trust funds to tackle transnational problems like spiking global food prices. Progress on reforms remains halting, however, with a bureaucracy in which performance has traditionally been assessed on the volume of loan and grant disbursements, rather than the effectiveness of the programs financed to help the poor.
Dr. Kim and the United States should demonstrate their commitment to institutional reform by announcing their support for adopting the same voting structure at the World Bank that many regional development banks have, in which leaders must win a majority of country votes, not only those of the largest shareholders.
Under the voting system that the regional banks use, the United States and Europe would still hold more shares, but decision making would be more inclusive -- giving small and poor countries, as well as emerging economies like Brazil, China and Turkey a meaningful say in selecting a leader. The United States would not give up its veto, but would give the same collective veto power to developing countries, as a group, if they were determined to block the election of a president that did not represent the interests of the institution. I believe that Dr. Kim would win if this new election system were in place today, but the change would compel the United States to do a better job of persuading other countries of the merits of his candidacy. Meanwhile, Dr. Kim needs to be candid and specific with shareholders and the public about his agenda for revitalizing the World Bank, and why he is the most qualified candidate to lead it.
President Obama has made an inspired nomination of an unconventional candidate to lead the World Bank back into relevance. The United States must now vindicate that choice by embracing a competitive election process that would give Dr. Kim the mandate he needs to advance the interests of the world's poor, as well as America's interests.

HEADLINE: Taking Credit Where None Is Due

 BODY:
As Friday's jobless numbers showed, the economic recovery has been listless and fragile, but its upward trajectory has been clear enough that Republicans have been forced to acknowledge it. To avoid giving President Obama the slightest bit of credit for the improvement, however, they have come up with increasingly convoluted explanations that have little relationship to reality. 
Mitt Romney, for instance, has said that the American people revived the economy while Mr. Obama made it worse. And last month he said it was President George W. Bush, not Mr. Obama, who saved the economy by bailing out the financial firms that caused the recession on his watch. He seems to have trouble sticking to one nonsensical explanation at a time.
The prize for the most ridiculous spin, however, has to go to a group of freshman House Republicans who say that they are the ones who lowered the unemployment rate and began to restore stability. ''If anybody's going to get a pat on the back for [lower] unemployment and the better economy, it's House Republicans,'' Jeff Landry, a freshman from Louisiana, told The Hill recently.
Bear in mind that House Republicans opposed the stimulus bill, which did more than any other piece of legislation to reduce joblessness. Many continue to denounce the government bailout of the auto industry, which has restored it to strength and is responsible for saving more than a million jobs. And they oppose the very regulations designed to keep a similar recession from recurring.
Recall, as well, that this group of antigovernment lawmakers also created a debt-ceiling crisis that nearly drove the federal government into a ruinous default. They tried to kill the payroll tax cut for the middle class. And they succeeded in many of their demands for big cuts in spending on domestic programs, state aid and unemployment insurance that are siphoning fuel from the nation's engine.
House Republicans haven't been responsible for a single bill that has had a positive impact on the economy. But they want to take credit for the recovery, arguing that they stopped the Democrats from taking actions like raising taxes on the very rich. ''In many ways our greatest success is the things we've stopped,'' said David Schweikert, an Arizona freshman.
The public is unlikely to be persuaded by these absurd boasts. It's hard to see how these lawmakers will explain to voters that they are responsible for a recovery they have worked so hard to block.

HEADLINE: Banker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy

BYLINE: By BENN STEIL. 
Benn Steil, the director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, is the author of the forthcoming ''The Battle of Bretton Woods.''

 BODY:
PRESIDENT OBAMA recently nominated Jim Yong Kim, the president of Dartmouth, to be the next president of the World Bank -- a privilege accorded to the United States since the bank's founding in 1946. A European, in turn, gets to run the International Monetary Fund.
In the wake of World War II, such a divvying up of the top spots among the great powers was inevitable. But how did the United States, the primary founder and financer of the two institutions, wind up taking the helm of the World Bank, and not the I.M.F., which was of vastly greater importance to its government? 
In fact, that was the original goal of Harry Dexter White, the Treasury Department's key representative at the Bretton Woods conference of July 1944, where the two institutions were created. The I.M.F. was central to White's vision of a postwar global financial architecture dominated by the American dollar.
White relegated the British delegation head, John Maynard Keynes, to the commission creating the World Bank specifically to keep him away from the main event: creating the I.M.F. White so masterfully outmaneuvered the British that they wound up signing on to a dollar-centric design for the fund, one they thought they had already blocked.
Then, on Jan. 23, 1946, Harry S. Truman nominated White to be the first American executive director of the I.M.F. (such directors representing the major member countries). Truman was also widely expected to nominate White for the fund's top post of managing director.
But trouble soon arose in the form of J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. director. White had been under surveillance for two months, suspected of being a Soviet spy. Hoover prepared a report for the president, based on information provided by 30 sources, including the confessed spy Elizabeth Bentley, asserting that White was ''a valuable adjunct to an underground Soviet espionage organization,'' was placing individuals of high regard to Soviet intelligence inside the government. If word of his activities became public, Hoover stressed, it could jeopardize the survival of the fund.
Oblivious, the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency approved White's nomination on Feb. 5, the day after Hoover's report was delivered.
Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, having read the report, wanted Truman to withdraw the nomination; Treasury Secretary Fred M. Vinson wanted White out of government entirely. Truman, who did not trust Hoover but who knew he had a major political problem on his hands, decided to quarantine White as the American I.M.F. executive director, a huge step down from managing director.
Nominating another American to sit above White, however, would have raised red flags. Why was the fund's chief architect being passed over? It was a question the White House wished to avoid.
On March 5, Vinson met with Keynes, now the British governor of both the I.M.F. and the World Bank. He said Truman had decided not to put White's name forward for the I.M.F. top job, despite his being ''ideally suited'' for it. The United States would, instead, back an American for the World Bank. Keynes was shocked.
Washington got its way, of course, and a Belgian, Camille Gutt, became the first head of the I.M.F., while an American, Eugene Meyer, became the first head of the World Bank. Though the United States was clearly in a powerful enough position to claim the I.M.F. job after Gutt's departure in 1951, the fund was for the moment effectively moribund, its role supplanted by the Marshall Plan, and the United States was content keeping the World Bank post.
As for White, he resigned from the I.M.F. in 1947. The next summer Bentley and Whittaker Chambers accused him of spying for the Soviets, a charge he denied before the House Un-American Activities Committee on Aug. 13. He died of a heart attack three days later.
Following Alger Hiss's perjury conviction in 1950, Representative Richard M. Nixon revealed a handwritten memo of White's given to him by Chambers, apparently showing that White had passed classified information for transmission to the Soviets. Yet his guilt would only be firmly established after publication of Soviet intelligence cables in the late 1990s.
Instead of treating the World Bank presidency as a sacred American birthright, we should remember that it was never more than a consolation prize for an administration trying to dodge a spy scandal.

HEADLINE: The Profits of Virtue

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: In the corporate world, social responsibility is easy to talk about and harder to achieve, and at whose expense it comes is uncertain, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Corporate social responsibility has entered the lexicon of mainstream economics. Some thought this shouldn't be, others that it simply couldn't happen. Milton Friedman famously asserted that corporations' only responsibility was to maximize profits. Many of his critics insisted that they were incapable of doing anything but that. 
Reality has given theory a nudge. A detailed article in the current Journal of Economic Literature by Markus Kitzmueller and Jay Shimshack points out that nearly 11 percent of professionally managed investment in the United States is designated as socially responsible. 
More than a third of large companies have voluntarily requested external certifications for meeting social or environmental standards. Many companies routinely provide accounts of their socially responsible contributions. 
Among the important questions addressed by recent economic research are whether socially responsible commitments lower profitability and, if not, how corporations distribute the costs among their stakeholders. 
The fond hope that companies can "do well by doing good" sometimes extends to the assertion that they can even increase profitability. Skeptical economists tend to counter with "there's no such thing as a free lunch."

Neither view is strongly supported by the evidence. Mr. Kitzmueller, who works at the World Bank, and Professor Shimshack of Tulane find no strong positive or negative link between social responsibility and financial performance. 
This seems like good news for social responsibility fans, suggesting that some good and relatively cheap lunches are to be had. But the question remains: Who is paying for them?
If profitability is unaffected, shareholders aren't getting hurt.
One possibility is that socially responsible companies are able to attract particularly talented employees whose intrinsic motivation (the desire to do good) increases their willingness to work for lower salaries. The economist Robert Frank makes this point in his book "What Price the Moral High Ground? How to Succeed Without Selling Your Soul." 
But while some survey results suggest that good corporate citizenship elicits better work attitudes and higher organizational commitment, no one has conclusively shown that workers at socially responsible companies receive lower compensation than their counterparts elsewhere. 
It seems more likely that consumers pick up a share of the tab. 
Not all consumers are happy about this. Preferences for environmentally friendly and socially responsible products vary enormously. With perfect product differentiation - and perfect information - consumers could easily sort themselves into those willing and those unwilling to pay a social-responsibility premium. 
In the real world, transactions are messier. Some consumers may end up paying higher prices than they would prefer (if, say, all companies producing a particular product, like sneakers, adopt a more costly standard), while others may be frustrated that they can't buy as much social responsibility as they would like.
Interactions between businesses and consumers have strategic elements, with incentives on both sides to misrepresent willingness to pay. Marketing experts now recognize that efforts to emphasize social responsibility can backfire if consumers conclude that the efforts are dishonest, as in accusations of "greenwashing." 
Likewise, companies may worry that consumers are not willing to put their money where their mouths are. It's easier to express moral disapproval than to pay higher prices.
Participants in this game often find it difficult to agree on definitions of social responsibility or to verify claims that it has been achieved. A recent article in The Economist summarizes evidence that that codes of conduct, compliance programs and audits do more to collect information than to solve problems. 
More than simple consumer choice is involved. Politics play an important role. Communities with higher levels of civic engagement, economic bargaining power and capacity for collective action tend to fare better than others in minimizing environmental harms. 
Studies show that consumer and union boycotts often have a significant effect on stock prices. The Journal of Economic Literature article cites research showing that "one-third to one-half of firms targeted by stakeholder actions publicly announce subsequent behavioral changes that are broadly consistent with activist aims." 
Consumers and citizens clearly have moral and economic clout. Much depends on how, exactly, they choose to wield it.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Meatball or Sausage?

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: America is becoming the new Middle East, large-bank lending to small businesses remains flat, and the power of testimonials. 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: Unemployment Stays About the Same
Gallup says workplace hiring jumps. ADP says employers added (pdf) 209,000 jobs. Jobless claims are at a four-year low. ASA staffing index is the highest since 2008. The CBIZ Small Business Employment Index rose. The Intuit Small Business Employment Index shows its healthiest growth rate in two years. Bearemy Glaser lists 17 scary numbers from the first quarter, including 5.4 million: "the number of long-term unemployed (27 weeks and more) persons in February, little changed from the previous month." The bottom line is that March's official unemployment rate fell to 8.2 percent from 8.3 percent. Um, hooray?
The Economy: No More Ease?
The economic recovery is becoming more "self-sustaining" despite continuing headwinds, a Federal Reserve official said, and many believe the Fed will not be easing anytime soon. Stock markets have been relatively calm. The software maker Sage detects a brighter outlook among small businesses. Companies are starting to spend some of their cash hoards. David Wilson says America is becoming the new Middle East, but a diesel fuel index indicates we're in a recession. Robert Lenzner has doubts about the wisdom of our wise men of finance. Bruce Bartlett warns us to beware of budget gimmickry. An analysis of semiconductor chip sales suggests a slowing economy. These industries may be the winners and losers of the last recession (and this guy shows how to lose with style).
The Data: People Are Eating Out 
Small-business lending barely grew in February, and large-bank lending to small businesses remained flat. Factory orders are up. Consumer spending outpaces income gains but some wonder if consumers can keep spending. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey is the highest since February 2011. March auto sales are up 13 percent. Year over year, sales at full-service restaurants were up 11 percent in January. February's ISM Manufacturing Index was above expectations (pdf), but some say it's not rosy and Markos Kaminis says the manufacturing report offered some disturbing data. Construction spending (pdf) fell in February. Census data for 1940 is released. The office vacancy rate improves.
Red Tape Update: Wall Street Digging for Opportunities
The chairman of the House Small Business Committee, Sam Graves, applauds the Jump-start Our Business Start-ups (JOBS) Act of 2012. Meanwhile, a provision of the act raises concerns. Wall Street is already digging for opportunities, and a former con man says the new law will make frauds like him rich: "I wish legislators would consult with people like me." Ryan Caldbeck offers three reasons crowdfunding is good for entrepreneurs. Additional small-business tax bills are on the agenda in the Senate and the House. The Chamber of Commerce says America's corporate tax rate is now the highest in the world. CNBC explains the alternative minimum tax. A sense of peril for the health care law gives insurers concern.
Management: It's Smarter to Barter
Fiverr.com is changing the creative economy $5 at a time. Why did a sausage chain fail while a meatball chain thrives? And since when did the ice cream business get so complicated? Here are three places to look for energy losses in commercial buildings. Adam Toren says it's smarter to barter. Chris Zook and James Alle cite three successes that represent a model of repeatability. Barbara Weltman says there are five financial mistakes that can put you out of business, including: "misordering inventory." A supply chain expert says that lean companies need only half as many employees in their purchasing departments as non-lean companies. Kosmo explains fixed and variable costs. Maya Pillai asks, Do you have an exit plan
People: Expecting Raises
Jason Trevisan explains how to find a chief marketing officer. Despite increased physical and mental stress, small-business owners are still up for new challenges. For the first time in four years, most workers expect a raise. A Pinterest co-founder is stepping down. Shhh, Minnesota public radio takes us inside the world's quietest room. Here are the world's most powerful human resources technology experts. Women small-business owners feel more successful than men. Independent baby boomers (pdf) gain power. Maureen Aylward reports that older entrepreneurs thrive on innovation. A new online tool connects businesses with experts for custom advice. I ask you: is this basketball or football?
Start-Up: Secret No. 54
Although generally confident about the prospects for their own businesses, start-up owners are sending mixed signals (pdf) about the economic outlook for the next 12 months. This week's celebrity investor: Bono. Here are some basic considerations before starting a shipping business. Steve Strauss and eHealthInsurance Partners introduce a new online resource to provide business tips, advice and news for self-employed professionals. Rafe Needleman shares start-up secret 54: "Build for the 1 percent." An associate professor at Harvard says that most start-up failures are caused by people problems. Microsoft hosts an interesting forum for Silicon Valley start-ups. Whatever happened to those start-up superstars from 2006? Steve Blank says his about start-up epiphanies: "People who follow them tend to get rich, famous or both." The Dumbo start-up lab gives entrepreneurs in New York a leg up on office space, and Nate Hindman profiles New York's coolest start-up offices.
Around the Country: An Office in a Cab
A new contest is offering $25,000 for an office makeover. Or forget the office and take a cab ride instead. A Piqua, Ohio, community college is doing a boot camp for entrepreneurs, and Marketing Sherpa's lead-nurturing webinar is Thursday. Brian Wilson's bearded airplane hits the skies and Allegiant Airlines now charges $35 for carry-on bags. The call for entries has begun for an Entrepreneur of 2012 contest. A new book by Barry Moltz and Becky McCray explains how big brands and small businesses can prosper in a connected economy. Bank of America hires more small-business bankers in Georgia and the Carolinas. Backpacker food gets hip. Trailers are flung around like toys in video of a Dallas tornado.
Around the World: A Vacant Mall
A British teenager explains probability. Can you guess which country is the world's happiest? Germany's manufacturers aren't happy. Pensions, unemployment and interest constitute 57 percent of Spain's budget. Richard A. Clarke explains how China steals our secrets. The world's largest shopping mall remains mostly vacant in China. Minxin Pei says there are signs of a new Tiananmen.
Marketing: Veiled Threats
Derek Johnson reports that 83.3 percent of advertisers used text message marketing in 2011. Local online advertising is expected to grow 21.3 percent in 2012. Google has big plans for hangouts on air and now lets us hang out at the White House. Paul Greenberg starts a series on customer service stories. Don't underestimate the power of testimonials or the effect of colorson your Web site. Jim Smith feels that social media marketing is a must for small businesses, and Mark Schaefer explains why you must use Twitter. Debra Donston-Miller says there are five social media metrics that matter. Diana Pohly explains how to use veiled threats to get your e-mails opened. Aidan Hijleh thinks that the iPad 3 will change e-mail marketing: "Although a user may be reading an article and shopping for Web-hosting while simultaneously having their inbox open on a PC, they are much more likely to be viewing e-mail and e-mail only on their tablet."
Technology: Flying Cars
An 80-year-old woman lands a plane after the pilot passes out. Handling porn traffic is a big challenge for providers. Keep an eye on these six tech innovations and these five collaboration trends. There are reasons to spend more than $500 on a new laptop. Andreas Bernstrm says there are four ways technology can enhance efficiency in a small business. Jonathan Blum lists seven must-have gadgets for your home office. Apple's iPad tops a Consumer Reports list. Yasir Hossain explains what it will take for tablets to replace PCs. Flying cars come one step closer to reality. These Android apps are essential for small and midsize businesses. PayPal introduces a tiered suite of payment options for small businesses. Hackers steal more than 10 million MasterCard and Visa numbers. A new mobile marketplace for small-businesses has its debut. Nitro, the other PDF software company, raises $3.5 million.
The Week's Best Tip
Anne Samoilov says you might be sabotaging your business if you don't solicit advice: "Go ahead and ask friends, former customers and family members what they think of your offerings. If you want a clearer picture of what people think of your wares, consider asking your target market. If you're getting e-mails, social media shares, new clients and an increase in traffic to your Web site, then you're probably on the right track. But if you're not seeing growth in any of these areas that show people dig what you do, it's time to rework your business plan."

HIGHLIGHT: I was a guest on "Up w/Chris Hayes" Saturday, and since we didn't get to a tenth of what I wanted to discuss, I thought it worth posting. 

 BODY:
I was a guest on "Up w/Chris Hayes" Saturday, talking, it seemed, about everything: a bit of an ambitious agenda. When I go back, the conversation will continue.
Meanwhile, since the initial topic was "pink slime," about which I wrote last week, I used my pre-air time in the studio to outline the issues I thought were worth mentioning. We didn't get to a tenth of this, so I thought it worth posting.
(I was taught never to apologize for a story submission, but these are close to stream-of-consciousness. But hey: that's why god invented blogging.)
Perhaps you'll find some things of interest:
1. Democracy. Are we entitled to know what goes in our food? The answer's easy, but Big Food thinks it's "no." It's not just ammonia in beef, it's arsenic and antibiotics - banned antibiotics at that, and Prozac and all kinds of drugs - in chicken and pork. It's growth hormones in milk, it's genetically engineered ingredients in just about everything. And we're told about none of this unless some concerned and often courageous citizen or journalist starts making noise about it.
That's what's been encouraging about this pink slime business (and that's what's encouraging about ag-gag laws) - how hard it's being fought. Not that we're going to get rid of it, not because it's a major issue in the great scheme of things - it matters, of course, but there are many other, greater problems - but that public pressure is causing changes, like improved labeling. (Almost everyone polled wants to know whether there are genetically engineered products in their foods, and whether ultimately that's important or not doesn't really matter, if it's something everyone wants.) Public pressure can also reduce our reliance on factory farms and industrial agriculture in general, public pressure can make our food supply safer and better, and in turn make us a healthier country.
That's why the pink slime campaign is important: it's a victory for public pressure over corporate power and therefore one for democracy. Note, too, that this happened nationally, which shows once again that noisemaking and protests are good for more than local issues.
2. Why is this happening in the first place? Pink slime and E.coli/salmonella; the chicken arsenic and inspection issues about which Nick Kristof wrote last week, cuts in funding at the U.S.D.A., F.D.A., E.P.A., and so on what we're seeing are , and that deregulation is geared toward allowing producers to raise the animals in our food supply any damn way they please, in the most profitable way possible.
As anyone who's been following these issues knows, cattle are meant to eat grass, not grain. Yet most cattle are fed grain, almost exclusively, and grain messes with their digestive systems. Those cows' messed-up stomachs become breeding grounds for E.coli - which can cause kidney failure and death - and salmonella, which is rarely deadly but can be extremely unpleasant. (You know how when you have the flu you want to die? Like that.) To combat this, producers must use boatloads of antibiotics - 80 percent of all antibiotics used in this country are given to animals, and the vast majority of those are given prophylactically - and resort to techniques like treating meat with ammonia or (perhaps a shade less distastefully) irradiation.
You might argue that these are public health measures, and in a perverse way they are - they're making an unsafe product less so - but why do we need them in the first place? Because our production methods create problems. And Big Food, which finds these methods enormously profitable, wants us to deal with the symptoms of the problems (wash tainted meat in ammonia) rather than the problems themselves (raise healthy cattle). To defund programs that attempt to bring those production methods - the real problem - under control, to make them safer, better and healthier, is the equivalent of defunding sewage systems because we're able to wash down our streets with ammonia. If you get my drift. It ain't pretty.
3. The jobs issue: I am really annoyed about the "this costs jobs" nonsense, which is simply a line Republicans dredge up when they don't like something. They're not complaining about Apple doing all its manufacturing in China, and they don't make noise when auto workers are laid off, and they don't care when budget cuts reduce the number of ag inspectors or administrators in the SNAP program. They only about job losses when it suits them politically.
We need to push Democrats to have more spine to support intelligent measures even if they "cost jobs." The extreme example is tobacco: I'm sorry if tobacco farmers can't sell their crop, but their crop breeds death; I'll be sorry, too, when Americans stop eating so much meat and people in that industry start losing jobs. I'd be sorry for people on the automatic weapons assembly line if gun control ever develops any teeth. (I'll be sorry for the unemployed grief counselors, too.)
But if a product means death for you or your neighbor or the environment, we simply shouldn't be producing it. If people lose their jobs as a result, I'm sympathetic, but we can't be supporting a process that poisons our citizenry. The extreme example would be to complain about health care workers losing their jobs if we were to eat less industrially processed food and get healthier as a result. If the only way to keep unemployment "down" is to employ people creating deadly products or dealing with their consequences, maybe that's worth looking at.
If you want to create jobs in the food supply, let's have real farmers raise real animals, and let's double the number of inspectors, so we can create jobs that protect people, not jobs that kill them. Sheesh.
4. Finally, a word about Michael Taylor, the so-called food safety czar who is a former Monsanto lobbyist. At the moment we have little room for hope that the food system will be fundamentally changed, but it's not precisely Taylor's fault. The changes we need to see are not forthcoming because a) they're not priorities for the Obama administration and b) even if they were, the administration would be fought to death on them.
I do want to remind everyone, however, that candidate Obama thought G.M.O. labeling was a great idea; President Obama, evidently, doesn't care so much. Yet a million people signed a petition asking the F.D.A. to mandate labeling of G.M.O. foods and in polls, something like 80 or 90 percent of Americans want that to happen. The fact that it hasn't happened is not Taylor's fault, but because Monsanto still has a disproportionate amount of influence, which it would no matter who was in charge of this stuff. Margaret Hamburg, ostensibly Taylor's boss, is one of the good guys.
Not that I'm in favor of Taylor, and not that I think he's going to be helpful in getting G.M.O.s labeled. But once again, he's a symptom - not the disease.

HEADLINE: Impatience to Get Thin Sends Some to Canada

BYLINE: RONI CARYN RABIN


HIGHLIGHT: Americans are heading north of the border for a weight-loss procedure not available here: the gastric balloon. 

 BODY:
Tammy Kwarciak, a 44-year-old nurse whose weight had been creeping up for years, was determined to lose 50 pounds. So in February, she drove from her home in Port Huron, Mich., across the border into Canada and had a small balloonlike device inserted into her stomach.
The intragastric balloon, filled with liquid and left in the stomach for up to six months, is not approved for use in the United States, though it's available in Europe, South America and other parts of the world. Clinical trials required to win federal Food and Drug Administration approval are being initiated, but many Americans aren't waiting.
Since the balloon's introduction in Canada in 2006, people like Mrs. Kwarciak have been streaming north in growing numbers. Drawn by the relative ease of balloon placement, Americans account for nearly a third of patients undergoing the procedures in Canadian clinics just over the border.
"The nice thing about the balloon is that you have such a sense of satiety," said Mrs. Kwarciak, who has lost 25 pounds since she had the procedure. "I feel full all the time. I have to remind myself at times to eat."
But the balloon is a temporary measure, and once it is removed in a few months, she said, "I'm on my own."
The intragastric balloon appeals to people like Mrs. Kwarciak who have a significant amount of weight to lose but are not heavy enough to qualify for bariatric surgery like gastric bypass surgery and adjustable gastric band surgery. The patient is anesthetized, and the balloon is inserted through the esophagus - a relatively noninvasive procedure. It is removed after six months or so.
The balloon may also be an option for extremely obese people who need to lose enough weight to be considered for more invasive procedures.
But just because the placement doesn't involve surgery doesn't mean it's risk-free. Patients can suffer severe nausea and vomiting during the first few days or week after placement. On rare occasions, it can deflate and obstruct the intestines, or it can perforate the abdomen, which can be life-threatening.
Perhaps as significant, the weight loss that patients can expect is modest at best.
"That's the most common complication - not losing as much weight as the patient would like," said Dr. Sanjeev Kaila, the plastic surgeon who pioneered the intragastric balloon program in Canada. Some return for a second balloon after taking a short break, he added.
Though Mrs. Kwarciak said she lost 25 pounds in the first two months, studies say most patients experience the bulk of their weight loss during the first three to four months after the balloon's insertion.
Studies of the balloon have reported weight loss ranging from 13 to 34 pounds on average, with some individuals losing up to 50 pounds. Patients often gain weight again after the device is removed, though long-term studies are limited.
But a scathing review by The Cochrane Collaboration in 2007 noted the possibility of serious complications and concluded that "compared with conventional management, intragastric balloon did not show convincing evidence of greater weight loss." Another review suggested the device was a waste of money, saying that its use "only to reduce weight has no medical and economic justification."
The combination of potential risks and little benefit is the main reason there is no intragastric balloon on the market in the United States. An earlier version called the Garren-Edwards Gastric Bubble was approved in 1985. But officials at the Food and Drug Administration soon became concerned about the severe and frequent complications associated with the device, an agency spokeswoman said.
By 1988, the manufacturer, American Edwards Laboratories, stopped selling it, voluntarily withdrawing the balloon from the market entirely in 1992. In the interim, randomized clinical trials comparing the bubble with a sham or placebo device found that diet and exercise were equally effective for weight loss.
Getting the new intragastric balloon is not cheap: In Canada, an outpatient procedure that takes less than an hour costs $8,000. The fee includes removal of the device after six months, as well as physician follow-up and support services from a nutritionist and dietitian, usually provided over the phone and online.
F.D.A. officials would not comment on the current balloons, which are made of new, sophisticated materials, but said generally that the agency "reviews medical devices to assure American patients that they are safe and effective. Many countries will approve medical devices without first having to demonstrate that the technology is effective."
Dr. Robin Blackstone, a bariatric surgeon in Scottsdale, Ariz., and president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, who is involved in a clinical trial of a balloon in the United States, said that people who need to lose a modest amount of weight may do just as well with a more conventional approach, given the risk of complications.
"Patients who are obese are very vulnerable," she said. "They're desperate to find something that works, and it's important for people not to offer things that aren't well established."
For those who insist on trying the procedure despite its lackluster record, some cautions are in order.
The balloon is an option only for those who have less than 50 pounds to lose - Canadian clinics may accept patients with a body mass index as low as 27, if they also have weight-related health problems - or for extremely obese people who need to lose weight to be accepted for bariatric surgery.
Potential patients should consult with a primary-care physician. The metabolic and bariatric surgery organization recommends establishing a relationship with a local gastroenterologist able to remove the balloon endoscopically should a complication occur.
The balloon, usually filled with blue liquid, can rupture. The liquid will turn patients' urine green, which is how they are alerted to the problem. A ruptured balloon may pass through the intestines on its own or require endoscopic or surgical removal if it obstructs the intestines. The most serious complication is a rupture in the abdomen, which can be life-threatening. Other complications include infections and ulcers.
Patients should not have the balloon implanted if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, have a hiatus hernia or history of gastric ulcers, other gastrointestinal disease or previous abdominal surgery.
Successful weight loss with the intragastric balloon depends on lifestyle changes, including a better diet and increased physical activity, and maintaining those changes is critical to maintaining the weight loss after the balloon is removed. Many balloon programs have a team of providers, often a gastroenterologist, endocrinologist, nutritionist or dietitian, personal trainer and psychologist involved in weekly follow-up with patients.

HEADLINE: America's Place in the New World

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: American leaders have long presumed that the world's democracies will align themselves with the United States, but India and Brazil are challenging that idea. 

 BODY:
"It's election season again, and the main contenders for the Oval Office are knocking themselves out to reassure Americans that their nation remains at the pinnacle of the global pecking order," Charles A. Kupchan writes in Sunday Review of The New York Times. Mitt Romney recently declared that "this century must be an American century." Not to be outdone, President Obama insisted in his State of the Union address that "anyone who tells you that America is in decline" doesn't "know what they're talking about," Mr. Kupchan writes. 
"Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama might overdo it a bit, but they're actually not far off the mark," he writes. "Despite two draining wars, sluggish growth and a diffusion of power from the West to China and the 'rising rest,' a combination of economic resilience and military superiority will keep the United States at or near the top for decades."
Still, they're missing the point, he writes. "The most potent challenge to America's dominance comes not from the continuing redistribution of global power, but from a subtler change: the new forms of governance and capitalism being forged by China and other rising nations." 
True, rising powers like India and Brazil are stable, secular democracies that appear to be hewing closely to the Western model. But these countries have democratized while their populations consist mainly of the urban and rural poor, not the middle class. As a result, both nations have embraced a left-wing populism wary of free markets and of representative institutions that seem to deliver benefits only to a privileged elite.
Rising democracies are also following their own paths on foreign policy, foiling America's effort to turn India into a strategic partner. New Delhi is at odds with Washington on issues ranging from Afghanistan to climate change, and it is deepening commercial ties with Iran just as America is tightening sanctions. Standing up to America still holds cachet in India and Brazil, one reason New Delhi and Braslia line up with Washington less than 25 percent of the time at the United Nations. 
Washington has long presumed that the world's democracies will as a matter of course ally themselves with the United States; common values supposedly mean common interests. But if India and Brazil are any indication, even rising powers that are stable democracies will chart their own courses, expediting the arrival of a world that no longer plays by Western rules.

HEADLINE: U.S. Said to Have Picked an Ambassador to Myanmar

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: The United States will soon name Derek J. Mitchell as the new ambassador to Myanmar, according to two news reports. Mr. Mitchell is currently the administration's special envoy to the country, which it still calls Burma. Washington has not had a full-fledged ambassador there since 1990. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - It appears that the United States will soon name Derek J. Mitchell as the new ambassador to Myanmar, according to Josh Rogin on The Cable blogof Foreign Policy magazine. The report was by The Financial Times.
Two senior Obama administration officials said last week in a background briefing that a choice had already been made but protocol required that the Myanmar government first approve the selection, a process that is under way.
"We've been in close consultation with colleagues and friends on Capitol Hill about this," one of the officials said, "and we have high confidence that this will be announced formally in short order."
The naming of an ambassador had been contingent on Myanmar's holding of reasonably free and fair elections. That vote, held on April 1, resulted in a landslide for the National League for Democracy as well as a seat in Parliament for the party's leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
The ambassadorial upgrade is part of an ongoing elevation of political and economic relations with Myanmar, which the administration still calls Burma. Washington has indicated it will further ease a wide range of sanctions against the government if democratic reforms continue under President U Thein Sein. 
The United States has not had an ambassador to Myanmar since 1990, when the ruling military junta threw out the results of an election won by the N.L.D. Ambassador Burton Levin was withdrawn in protest, and Washington has since kept its senior diplomat at the charg d'affaires level. 
Mr. Mitchell, 47, who has deep experience in Asia, was sworn in last October as the administration's special representative and policy coordinator for Burma. He did much of the groundwork that set up of Hillary Rodham Clinton to Myanmar in December, the first such visit by a U.S. secretary of state since 1955.
Mr. Mitchell, who speaks Mandarin, has a master's degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. His official State Department bio is . 
Before the recent election, Mr. Mitchell gave a wide-ranging interview to the Voice of America. A video of that conversation is here.

AOL Strikes $1.1 Billion Patent Deal With Microsoft | AOL agreed on Monday to sell a portfolio of over 800 patents, and license about 300 more, to Microsoft for $1.056 billion, amid an arms race within the technology industry over intellectual property.
Under the terms of the transaction, AOL will retain a license for the patents it is selling, while Microsoft will receive a nonexclusive license for the technologies AOL is retaining.
It is the latest big deal for patents, at a time when tech companies are amassing intellectual property rights as ammunition against competitors. Last year, Google purchased Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, largely for its patent portfolio. And scores of companies, including Apple, Samsung, Facebook and Yahoo, are clashing in courtrooms over claims to technology that underpins some of the basic functions of smartphones and social networks alike.

Avon had previously announced that Andrea Jung, its current chairman and chief executive, would stay on as executive chairman after Ms. McCoy takes the reins.

HEADLINE: Facebook to Buy Photo-Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion

BYLINE: JENNA WORTHAM


HIGHLIGHT: Facebook, the world's largest social network, has agreed to buy Instagram, the popular mobile-centric photo-sharing network. Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, announced the acquisition on his Facebook page. 

 BODY:
9:07 p.m. | Updated 
Instagram, an Internet start-up in San Francisco, has no revenue and about a dozen employees. It has not yet celebrated its second birthday. But to Facebook, it is already worth a billion dollars.
Facebook announced on Monday that it would pay that much in cash and stock for Instagram, the latest big winner in an industry that seems to be more awash in money by the day.
Instagram joins other out-of-nowhere Internet hits like Groupon and YouTube. The acquisition, which is Facebook's largest to date, could give it a stronger position on mobile devices.
Instagram is essentially a social network built around photography, offering mobile apps that let people add quirky effects to their smartphone snapshots and share them with friends.
It has dozens of competitors, but Instagram stands out for its fast ascension and almost cultlike following. It has 30 million users who upload more than five million photos a day, even though it was available for only Apple devices until last week, when the company released an Android app.
For Instagram's founders, two Stanford graduates in their 20s who are now worth in the tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars, it has been a productive couple of years. The other big winners will be their early investors at venture capital firms.
"It's the Web fairy tale that all start-ups dream of," said Melissa Parrish, an analyst with Forrester Research, who added: "They took a simple behavior - sharing pictures with friends - and made it a utility that people want."
Facebook is getting ready for its own big payday. It is aiming for a public offering as soon as next month that could value the company around $100 billion. That means it can easily afford Instagram's price, if only to keep a rising star out of the hands of competitors like Google.
Facebook may also need Instagram to help it keep up with the constantly changing whims of the online audience. Facebook was born in the computer-and-browser era and is trying to adapt to a world that isincreasingly mobile-centric. Instagram is a purely mobile creation.
Rebecca Lieb, an analyst at the Altimeter Group, said buying Instagram would help Facebook with one of its most urgent needs: making its service more appealing on smartphones.
"It's easier to update Facebook when you're on the go with a snapshot rather than with text," Ms. Lieb said.
Kevin Systrom, who founded Instagram with Mike Krieger and is now its chief executive, has been on the radar ofMark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, for some time. Mr. Systrom was a sophomore at Stanford in 2004 when he developed a service called Photobox that let people send large photo files to each other. The service caught the eye of Mr. Zuckerberg, who offered him a job. But Mr. Systrom decided to finish his studies and went on to found Burbn, which let people post photos and other updates.
Burbn never attracted more than a few hundred users, but they uploaded a lot of photos. So Mr. Systrom and his team stripped it down and released a sleeker version for the iPhone, calling it Instagram. It gained early momentum because it allowed users to also post their pictures to Twitter, piquing the interest of those who saw links to the photos in their feeds.
For most of Instagram's early days, the company consisted of just four employees, including its two co-founders. They worked in what had been the early offices of Twitter in the South Park neighborhood of San Francisco, crammed in with other start-ups.
The walls were painted dark gray and Ikea lamps sat on the ground, lighting an otherwise gloomy ground-floor space that looked almost the same any time of day or night. The team sat in the middle of the room at four desks pushed together to make one large table - though none of the desks lined up quite right. This year, as staff members were added, Instagram moved to a larger office across the street.
In early 2011, Mr. Zuckerberg reached out to Instagram to discuss buying the company, but Mr. Systrom chose to keep it independent and focus on expanding it, two Facebook employees who asked not to be named said last year.
At the time, Instagram had less than seven million users. Now celebrities likeJustin Bieber and brands like Gucci post regular updates.
Not everyone was applauding the acquisition. Soon after the news broke, many Instagram fans began voicing their displeasure on the service and on Twitter and Facebook. Some, like Paul Ahlberg, seemed upset that Facebook would have access to their personal information. "I liked Instagram when it was stupid pictures and filters, not a Facebook data collector," he wrote on Twitter.
Others lamented the loss of what they saw as an alternative to Facebook and threatened to delete their accounts. "So Facebook just bought Instagram," a Twitter user named Robert Wagner wrote. "In other news, I just quit using Instagram."
Some fans were concerned about the fate of Instagram, since Facebook has bought several small start-ups to grab their talent and then shut down their original offerings.
But both Mr. Systrom and Mr. Zuckerberg stressed repeatedly in separate blog posts that Facebook planned to keep Instagram up and running as a separate service, at least for the time being.
"It's important to be clear that Instagram is not going away. We'll be working with Facebook to evolve Instagram and build the network," wrote Mr. Systrom ina company blog post. Instagram and Facebook executives declined to comment further on Monday.
Though Facebook has tended to write much smaller checks in the past, Instagram's momentum probably compelled Facebook to make a billion-dollar deal. Last week, Instagram closed a roughly $50 million financing round with several investors, including Sequoia Capital, an early backer of Google; Thrive Capital, the firm run by the real estate heir Joshua Kushner; and Greylock Partners, an early investor of LinkedIn.
The financing round valued the photo service at about $500 million, according to one person with knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity because the discussions were private. With Facebook's purchase, one week later, that investment doubled in value. The short time frame may indicate that the deal came together in a matter of days.
Instagram has talked about bringing in revenue by allowing brands to drop sponsored photos into the stream on user's screens, or being paid by brands when users tap to buy something from them, but it has not yet announced any such plans.
Facebook has also been trying to figure out how to make money as people spend more time on smaller screens.
"We really don't know how Facebook will monetize mobile platforms," Ms. Lieb said. "The first step is to make Facebook friendlier on mobile devices, and this will certainly do that."

HEADLINE: The President, Gas Prices and the Pipeline

BYLINE: DAN SCHNUR


HIGHLIGHT: As Obama runs for re-election, he must maintain a balance between dissatisfied environmentalists and angry drivers. 

 BODY:
Like every president seeking re-election, Barack Obama walks the fine line every day between the discordant goals of motivating his party's strongest loyalists and reaching out to swing voters for their support. A few weeks ago, that pathway took him to a tiny town in Oklahoma, where, caught between the anti-drilling demands of the environmental community and the thirst for more affordable gasoline from unions, business owners and drivers, the president announced his support for building half of an oil pipeline. 
The economic impact of rising energy prices in itself is considerable, but the psychological toll on voters is just as significant, as tens of millions of motorists are reminded by large signs on almost every street corner of the financial pain of filling their gas tanks. Obama and his political lieutenants are acutely aware that this growing frustration has the potential to complicate an election year that otherwise seems to be shifting in the incumbent's favor.
As a result, Obama has been hitting the energy issue hard in recent weeks, at least as hard as a candidate can hit when forced to navigate between two almost mutually exclusive political priorities. The result is a president who talks forcefully of the benefits of wind and solar power while also boasting about the amount of oil the nation produces under his leadership.
There are times when this gets slightly uncomfortable. Obama recently called for increased exploration along the Atlantic Coast but stopped short of calling for expanded drilling in that region. This is the energy policy equivalent of admitting to an experiment with marijuana but not inhaling.
Where the issue becomes more tangible and therefore trickier for Obama is when the multiple choices become binary. The debate over the proposed XL Keystone Pipeline that would transport Canadian oil through the nation's heartland to the Gulf of Mexico crystallizes the choices involved and forces a shades-of-gray conversation into starker hues of black and white. 
Obama recognizes that the devoted environmentalists who represent a critical portion of the Democratic party base need some motivation to turn out for him in the fall. But he also understands that centrist voters who support him on a range of other domestic and foreign policy matters could be lured away by a Republican opponent who either promises relief at the gas pump or who can lay blame at the White House doorstep for those higher prices. Even more complicated is the role of organized labor, which has poured immense amounts of support into Obama's re-election but also prioritizes the job-creation potential of the pipeline. 
The result of these competing political and policy pressures brought Obama to Ripley, Okla., where he tried to satisfy the needs of these various audiences without alienating any of them. First, the president endorsed the southern portion of the Keystone project in order to relieve the glut of domestically drilled oil that is now unable to make it to refineries near the Gulf of Mexico in a timely manner. This had the effect of irritating his environmental allies but failed to mollify the project's advocates, who pointed out that the review process that the president called for was already underway. 
He then reiterated the administration's antipathy toward the northern section of the pipeline, which would allow Canadian-drilled oil to be transported into this country. This provided some comfort to drilling opponents, but infuriated both the pro-oil forces and the Canadian government. The most likely outcome is that Canada will still build a pipeline, but rather one that goes westward to the Pacific Ocean north of the United States border and then ships Canadian oil to China instead of into this country. 
Even in deep-blue California, where Obama wins hypothetical general election match ups against the Republican candidatesby margins approaching voice vote, this is an issue that points to potential difficulties for the president's re-election campaign. Californians who swooned for Obama in 2008, and who seem poised for a re-swoon this fall, told a recent USC Dornsife/LA Times statewide poll that they were dissatisfied with the president's handling of the issue of the cost of gasoline by a 29-62 margin. California's unemployment rate remains around 11 percent, but the state's residents still give Obama positive marks on his work on job creation, the economy and taxes. They approve of his work on health care and by even larger margins on women's health issues. But highway-dependent West Coasters, even while they advocate for broader use of solar, wind and other alternative energies, don't like $4 per gallon gasoline and they will like paying $5 per gallon even less.
Obama won't actually lose California in November, of course. Gas prices would have to hit $10 a gallon for Mitt Romney to win the state this fall. And the same poll shows that voters blame oil companies, rather than either the president or Congress, for those high prices. However, the dissatisfaction that emanates from even a heavily Democratic patch of electoral turf such as California carries much more significant consequences in Ohio, Florida and other swing states. For the time being, Obama is gambling that directing popular anger toward the oil companies - a convenient villain if there ever was one - will allow him to keep the price of gasoline from becoming a roadblock for his campaign.
But if gas prices keep rising and voter unhappiness continues to build, look for the administration to find a way to accelerate the review process that would allow the northern leg of Keystone to move forward more quickly. Obama has been careful not to come out in absolute opposition to the pipeline, but only to call for a more meticulous examination of its possible environmental impact. A more closely competitive election than what is now expected, though, could easily lead the president to decide that his administration's review has been quite thorough enough and that the time for additional drilling has arrived.
An energy strategy that Obama now refers to as an "all of the above" approach is unlikely to turn into a "drill, baby drill" refrain between now and November. But maintaining a balance between dissatisfied but docile environmentalists on one hand and drivers whose unhappiness stops just short of violence on the other will be a key to his re-election. If his poll margins begin to narrow, a somewhat longer pipeline than the one he has already endorsed could become a very tempting insurance policy.

HEADLINE: Report Disputes Christie's Basis for Halting Train Tunnel

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey exaggerated when he declared that unforeseen costs to the state were forcing him to cancel the new train tunnel planned to relieve congested routes across the Hudson River, according to a long-awaited report by independent Congressional investigators.
The report by the Government Accountability Office, to be released this week, found that while Mr. Christie said that state transportation officials had revised cost estimates for the tunnel to at least $11 billion and potentially more than $14 billion, the range of estimates had in fact remained unchanged in the two years before he announced in 2010 that he was shutting down the project. And state transportation officials, the report says, had said the cost would be no more than $10 billion.
Mr. Christie also misstated New Jersey's share of the costs: he said the state would pay 70 percent of the project; the report found that New Jersey was paying 14.4 percent. And while the governor said that an agreement with the federal government would require the state to pay all cost overruns, the report found that there was no final agreement, and that the federal government had made several offers to share those costs. 
Canceling the tunnel, then the largest public works project in the nation, helped shape Mr. Christie's profile as a rising Republican star, an enforcer of fiscal discipline in a country drunk on debt. But the report is likely to revive criticism that his decision, which he said was about ''hard choices'' in tough economic times, was more about avoiding the need to raise the state's gasoline tax, which would have violated a campaign promise. The governor subsequently steered $4 billion earmarked for the tunnel to the state's near-bankrupt transportation trust fund, traditionally financed by the gasoline tax.
A spokesman for the governor, Michael Drewniak, said Mr. Christie's statement of costs had included $775 million to build a new portal bridge, which was required as part of the project. The 70 percent, he said, included the costs that would have been paid for by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is run by both states, as well as federal highway and stimulus funds earmarked for New Jersey. Counting those costs, which the report does not do, would put the state's share at 65.5 percent.
As for the state's share of the overruns, Mr. Drewniak said the federal government ''offered no significant increase in outright funding that would significantly mitigate the costs to New Jersey.''
''The bottom line is that the G.A.O. report simply bears out what we said in the fall of 2010 and say to this day: the ARC project was a very, very bad deal for New Jersey,'' he added, using the acronym for the project, known as Access to the Region's Core.
Martin E. Robins, the founding director of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University and an early director of the ARC project, criticized the governor. ''In hindsight, it's apparent that he had a highly important political objective: to cannibalize the project so he could find an alternate way of keeping the transportation trust fund program moving, and he went ahead and did it,'' he said.
Shutting down the tunnel project extinguished the best hope to relieve the increasing congestion not only between New Jersey and Manhattan, but also along the popular high-speed route between Boston and Washington. Now, Amtrak and New Jersey trains share two 100-year-old single-track tunnels under the Hudson. As the report notes, those tracks now operate at capacity, and demand for mass transit between New Jersey and Manhattan is expected to grow 38 percent by 2030.
One 15-minute disruption, the report said, ripples out to affect 15 other Amtrak and New Jersey trains. Last month, problems on the two tracks on two consecutive days sent delays rippling out along the Northeast.
The governor said when he canceled the project that he hoped New York City or federal officials would find another solution But last week, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said one of those, a proposed extension of the No. 7 subway line to New Jersey, was not going to happen ''in anybody's lifetime.'' Congress gave Amtrak $15 million to study a tunnel that would expand capacity by about half as much as the ARC project, but the money to build the tunnel is uncertain.
The Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress, did the report at the request of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, a Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on surface transportation, an ardent supporter of public transportation and a critic of Mr. Christie. Investigators spent a year examining official planning studies and estimates for the project and interviewing people associated with it.
Mr. Christie supported the tunnel in his campaign in 2009 and in letters to the federal Transportation Department as late as April 2010, four months after he took office. When he canceled it, he said that he supported the merits of the project, but that the state could not afford it, and that he would not put New Jersey taxpayers on ''a never-ending hook'' to pay for it.
In announcing his decision, Mr. Christie said he was relying on the advice of his ARC steering committee, led by New Jersey Transit officials, which he said had revised estimates and found that the tunnel would ''cost no less than $11 billion and could exceed $14 billion.''
The report, however, found that the estimates had not changed since August 2008, 17 months before Mr. Christie took office. New Jersey Transit and federal officials had agreed on a baseline cost of $8.7 billion, which was the figure cited in news reports, but they had also agreed, first in 2008 and then a month before Mr. Christie canceled the project, that costs would range from $9.5 billion to $12.4 billion. When federal officials argued, six weeks before Mr. Christie canceled the project, that it might cost $13.7 billion, the report said, state officials replied that they ''did not see costs rising to this level'' and said the project would cost, at most, $10 billion.
Federal officials, in response, backed off that higher estimate. But Mr. Drewniak, the spokesman for Mr. Christie, said Monday that the fluctuating estimates suggested that no one really knew how much the project would cost.
''The governor was prudent to cancel the project, given the vast disagreement between professionals,'' he said.
Mr. Christie further explained his decision by saying that the financing agreement with the federal government required him to declare that New Jersey would pay any costs above the $8.7 billion. That is the standard procedure for full-financing agreements, but the report found that there was no agreement when Mr. Christie canceled the project, and that the federal government, which was already paying 51 percent of the costs, had offered to help with any cost overruns, pledging additional money, low-interest railroad loans and public-private financing.
Before Mr. Christie declared the tunnel dead, his transportation advisers told state legislators that they had discussed taking money from the project to fill the transportation trust fund, which was almost empty.
Since then, the governor has steered $4 billion in tunnel money to the trust fund, avoiding an increase in the state's gasoline tax, the second lowest in the nation.
Mr. Drewniak criticized Mr. Lautenberg for the report, saying that he should have arranged more federal money for the project. ''He needs to stop blaming others for his failure in leadership,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Surprise, China Posts Trade Surplus

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China ran an unexpected $5.35 billion trade surplus last month, government figures released on Tuesday showed, indicating the country remains a strong exporter despite weak demand in Europe in recent months. 
The surplus is likely to bring renewed calls in the United States and elsewhere for China to allow further appreciation of its currency, the renminbi. Responding to complaints from exporters of weak overseas orders, the government has halted appreciation this year while Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has even raised the possibility of increasing tax rebates for exporters.
China's export prowess has stirred worries about job losses in the United States, especially in an election year. But the Obama administration has muted somewhat its criticisms of China's currency policies this year as the country's trade surpluses had seemed to be evaporating.
Private economists had been predicting that China would show a trade deficit of $1 billion or more last month, not a surplus. China's exports climbed 8.9 percent in March compared with a year earlier, more than expected, while import growth slowed to 5.3 percent.
China ran a $31.48 billion trade deficit in February because export factories were slow to reopen after Chinese New Year celebrations in late January while imports continued at a strong pace. The trade figure for March had been widely awaited by economists and traders as the first clear reading in months of the true health of China's trade sector.
Following the government's general policy of minimizing trade surpluses and deflecting international pressure for China to rely less on foreign markets, the official Xinhua news agency emphasized in its report that for the entire first quarter, China ran a surplus of only $670 million.
But the first quarter of the year is always the weakest season for China's trade because export factories close for Chinese New Year; by comparison, China ran a $2.2 billion deficit in the first quarter of last year.
Aside from currency policy, the trade data poses further dilemmas for policymakers in Beijing, economists said.
Weak growth in imports could be a signal of broader difficulties in the China's domestic economy. Chinese leaders are trying to deflate a real estate bubble by banning most purchases of second and third homes, a policy that has brought an abrupt slowdown in residential housing construction, with the exception of public housing projects.
But inflation has slowed less than expected, with China's National Bureau of Statistics announcing on Monday that consumer prices were up 3.6 percent in March from a year earlier, an acceleration from the 3.2 percent pace recorded in February. Together with signs of a rebound in global demand for Chinese exports, the consumer price data raises the risk that the government could rekindle inflation if it starts stimulating the economy through measures like easing controls on bank lending.
Yu Song, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a research note early Tuesday afternoon that the trade data indicated that policy easing would tend ''to be less aggressive than otherwise.''

HEADLINE: Brands Cheer Their Virtues With Anniversary Candles

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
IF Madison Avenue had its own hit parade or Hot 100, ''The Anniversary Waltz'' might be the top song of 2012.
Multiple brands are celebrating anniversaries this year with ads online and in social media like blogs, Facebook and Twitter as well as campaigns in traditional media like television, print and outdoor. The glances backward also include giveaways, events, sweepstakes, commemorative packaging, promotions and retail elements like signs in stores.
So numerous are the anniversaries, they are beginning to bunch up. For instance, this week the Motel 6 lodging chain observes its 50th with a campaign that includes an eye-catching television commercial, and the Life Savers candy brand is to host an event at its plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., to commemorate its centennial. 
Life Savers and Motel 6 join the ranks of celebrants that include Bacardi rum, 150 years; Cartier, 165; Glenfiddich Scotch whisky, 125; GMC trucks, 100; Kraft macaroni and cheese, 75; the New York Mets, 50; and Oreo cookies, 100.
Anniversary campaigns are part of a trend inspired by the economy that could be called comfort marketing, as advertisers invoke misty, water-colored memories of the past to woo consumers into buying products in the present.
A major aspect of comfort marketing is what brand managers call authenticity: reminding shoppers who seek value in the provenance of merchandise to suggest a product is worth buying because its quality has been tested for decades.
''Understanding the value of a dollar has rushed back to the forefront'' of consumer considerations, said Lance Miceli, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the Accor North America division of Accor, which owns Motel 6.
As a result, he added, the brand's promise of ''a clean, comfortable room for the lowest price of any national chain'' has become ''as valued today as it was in 1962.''
The commercial, created by the Richards Group in Dallas, shows a family in a car en route to a Motel 6. The passage of time is illustrated as the modish looks of the family, and the car, morph from 1962 to 2012.
''Over the past 50 years, the way America travels has changed a lot,'' says the announcer, Tom Bodett, who is known for the ''We'll leave the light on for you'' radio spots he has delivered for Motel 6 since 1986.
But ''no matter how much the journey changes,'' Mr. Bodett says, ''you'll know there's a light on at the end of it.'' The commercial ends with this declaration: ''Motel 6. Fifty years and the light's still on.''
The campaign for Motel 6 will also include radio commercials, digital ads and social media like Facebook and YouTube.
Social media enable brands to amplify advertising centered on authenticity because the details of their history and heritage give them a story to tell to an audience that prizes ''status and reputation,'' said Avi Savar, chief creative officer at Big Fuel, a social media agency that is majority-owned by the Publicis Groupe.
''The big idea is what's the existing social behavior a brand can tap into,'' Mr. Savar said. ''If I align with a brand, it needs to align with my values.''
To that end, the Life Savers centennial campaign, which is featured on the Life Savers Web site at life-savers.com, includes a philanthropic component, called Connect for a Cause, to underline the campaign's theme, ''100 years of sharing.''
The ''share ring'' fund-raiser for 100 charitable organizations, at lifesaverssharering.com, is meant to underline how ''Life Savers is known for creating simple and meaningful connections among its consumers,'' said Colleen DeVos, senior vice president for account management at the Chicago office of the Ryan Partnership, part of Hyper Marketing Inc., which handles promotions and retail marketing for the Life Savers parent, the Wm. Wrigley Jr. division of Mars.
Tyler Simpson, director for mints at Wrigley, also in Chicago, said: ''For 100 years, people have used Life Savers as a token of sharing. It's time for us to share with causes that matter to them.''
Other elements of the Life Savers campaign include print ads by the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. Their layout and theme, ''A hole lot of fun,'' echo the brand's ads from the 1940s through the 1960s in magazines like Life, Look and The Saturday Evening Post, which carried themes like ''The candy with the hole.''
There are also ''anniversary edition'' boxes of Life Savers in versions of the Sweet Storybook packages that were introduced in 1935. The candies inside come in vintage wrappers.
Marketers celebrating brand anniversaries say they are careful not to become too enamored of what they see in the rearview mirror because campaigns that are perceived as too nostalgic may turn off consumers who want to be assured that products meet modern-day needs.
At Motel 6, ''we have adapted to the times while remaining true to our core values,'' said Mr. Miceli of Accor North America. ''We've contemporized the brand as we go along.''
There have been updates of the brand's logo and changes inside the motels that are highlighted on the Motel 6 Web site, motel6.com, with the headline ''Bold new room designs.''
Of course, the idea of a motel room for $6 a night is as old-fashioned as the promise in those magazine ads for Life Savers that each hard-candy roll is ''still only 5 cents.'' Rooms are now available at rates that average from $39.99 a night, Mr. Miceli said.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Motel 6 observes its 50th anniversary with a television commercial in which the modish looks of the family, and the car, morph from 1962 to 2012.
 Life Savers is celebrating its 100th anniversary, including with a new print ad, top left. An ad from the 1940s, in the middle, says, ''Today our armed forces are ordering more and more Life Savers.'' And an ad from 1916, for a ''mint with the hole.''

HEADLINE: Iranian Officials Send Mixed Signals as Nuclear Talks Near Resumption

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- A senior Iranian official hinted on Monday that Iran would consider limits on its home-grown stockpile of enriched uranium, offering what seemed a modest compromise to partly meet Western concerns ahead of the planned resumption this week of nuclear talks with a group of six global powers.
The senior official, Ferydoon Abbasi, the head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization, was quoted by Iranian news agencies as saying that Iran was prepared to enrich uranium to a maximum 20 percent purity just to meet the needs for a medical research reactor. 
Mr. Abbasi was further quoted as saying that other uranium enrichment activities would be restricted to much lower levels of purity needed to fuel power generation reactors.
But in what appeared to be another set of mixed signals from Iran ahead of the talks, another high-ranking figure, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi, said Iran would not accept preconditions. Iranian news agencies quoted him as saying, ''Setting conditions before the meeting means drawing conclusions, which is completely meaningless, and none of the parties will accept conditions set before the talks.''
The apparent difference in tone between the remarks of Mr. Abbasi and Mr. Salehi seemed to reflect continued debate among the Iranian elite over the handling of the planned negotiations. But it was not immediately clear whether the mixed signals represented a deliberate strategy.
The talks, taking place as Iran faces a tightening noose of economic sanctions that include a European oil embargo coming into force in July, are set to begin in Istanbul this week.
The reports followed days of confusing signals from Iran that at one stage looked like a derailing of the negotiations. Even on Monday, disputes seemed to persist over the date, with the Iranian news media speaking of talks on Friday and a European Union official saying they would take place on Saturday. Other reports had said the talks, which would resume those suspended in January 2011 after a deadlock, would span both days.
The talks bring together Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia -- along with Germany, the so-called P5-plus-1 countries.
American and European diplomats said one demand from the Obama administration and its allies would be a halt in the production of uranium fuel that is considered just a few steps from bomb grade, and the transfer of existing stockpiles of that fuel out of the country.
Western powers would also lay out opening demands for the immediate closing and ultimate dismantling of a recently completed nuclear facility deep under a mountain, known as Fordo, near the holy city of Qum, the diplomats said. Mr. Abbasi did not refer to that demand.
The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as telling a television station that Tehran ''does not require to enrich uranium higher than 20 percent'' -- possibly a reference to Western concerns that, by processing uranium to that level of purity, Iran has taken an important technological step toward enriching to levels of more than 90 percent needed for a nuclear weapon.
But, he said, Iran had ''decided to improve its capabilities'' in producing 20-percent-enriched uranium. He did not specify how.
So far Iran has produced only about 100 kilograms of 20-percent-enriched uranium -- less than required to produce a single nuclear weapon -- but it has announced plans to increase production sharply in coming months.
Iran maintains that uranium enriched to 20 percent purity is needed to replenish a small nuclear reactor in Tehran used to make medical isotopes. Iranian officials have said in recent months, however, that they plan to produce more of the fuel enriched to 20 percent purity than is needed for the reactor.
''They have now produced nearly enough 20 percent to fuel the Tehran research reactor for the next 20 years,'' one diplomat in Europe who closely follows the agency's work in Iran said in February.
Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, while Western leaders say they suspect that Tehran is seeking the capability to build nuclear weapons.
The dispute over the location of the talks centered on Iranian concerns that Istanbul is not a neutral site. Tehran was said to regard Istanbul as compromised because of Turkey's stance on the crisis in Syria, Iran's closest regional ally, and Turkey's support for a NATO shield to block Iranian missiles. Iran had suggested other locations, including Baghdad and Beijing.
But ''after weeks of debates, Iran and the six world powers agreed to attend a first meeting in Istanbul,'' the semiofficial Fars news agency reported on Sunday, and would hold a second round of talks in Baghdad if progress was made in the initial negotiations.
President Obama has advocated tough sanctions and negotiations as a strategy to pressure Iran, but has not ruled out any option. More hawkish figures in Washington and Israel have suggested that the only way to thwart what they consider Iran's ambition to achieve nuclear weapons capability is through an attack on its suspected nuclear sites.

HEADLINE: A Health Crisis Strikes. Then What?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Down the Insurance Rabbit Hole,'' by Andrea Louise Campbell (Op-Ed, April 5):
Thank you, Ms. Campbell, for sharing your poignant family experience with us. This is the kind of discussion we need. We need to talk about real people and real lives. We need to be informed about how our health system operates and how it affects lives.
We need to realize that a person of any age can become ill or injured. We need to accept that health care is not a privilege but a right. 
We need to put a human face on this issue. We need to realize that we are all in this together, and we need to help one another, not only with decorated coffee cans, but more important, with a compassionate and realistic government willing to make a commitment to provide health care for all the people.
RUTH KASCKOW La Canada, Calif., April 5, 2012
To the Editor:
Andrea Louise Campbell's example of a sister-in-law healthy one day and in need of prolonged medical assistance the next is but one example of such occurrences. A young or old person can one day feel a lump, have a fainting or dizzy spell, experience an unusual chest pain or be advised that there is a shadow on a routine X-ray.
These are seemingly healthy people experiencing the herald of what can be an intense and protracted need for expert medical attention.
At what age does one decide that one has ''a substantial risk of incurring high medical bills,'' as Justice Antonin Scalia suggests? There is no such thing as being able to predict the need for extensive medical treatment.
ANNE MINICH New York, April 5, 2012
To the Editor:
Andrea Louise Campbell captures the specter facing us all: sudden medical disaster leading to bankruptcy. Bankruptcy of the financial kind as well as the spirit. One cannot read her article without being struck also by the byzantine description of administrative hoops through which a beneficiary must jump to obtain medical services.
Our health care administrative costs, previously pegged at 31 percent, must now surely approach 35 percent. Meanwhile, developed countries with a single-payer system report efficient management, and the citizens of those countries just need to swipe their smartcards to log in.
RAY BELLAMY Tallahassee, Fla., April 5, 2012
The writer is an orthopedist.
To the Editor:
A truly sad situation, but not so much an indictment of the health system as a warning to young people about the importance of the choices they make in life.
A young couple can't afford health insurance but can afford a child? Freedom is the opportunity to make choices. Make the right ones, and you'll be rewarded with more choices in the future; make wrong ones, and you'll have fewer choices ahead.
They could have taken many steps to reduce expenses and buy health care, but they didn't. And now their future is bleak.
CHRIS HYNES Edwards, Colo., April 6, 2012
To the Editor:
If Andrea Louise Campbell wrote ''Down the Insurance Rabbit Hole'' in the hope that her family's heartbreaking story might prevent the overturning of the Affordable Care Act by thawing the stony heart of even one conservative Supreme Court justice, I am afraid that she is mistaken.
The justice would not only be unmoved by the failure of the previous system to prevent her brother and sister-in-law's economic ruin, but he would also probably point out that it worked just as it should: family and friends, and a generous stranger's coffee-can donation drive, have saved them from life on the streets. Isn't that the way the United States is supposed to work?

HEADLINE: Microsoft's AOL Deal Intensifies Patent Wars

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR; Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The global gold rush in technology patents gained speed on Monday when Microsoft agreed to pay more than $1 billion for 800 patents held by AOL.
The lofty price -- $1.3 million a patent -- reflects the crucial role that patents are increasingly playing in the business and legal strategies of the world's major technology companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Samsung and HTC.
Patents that can be applied to both smartphones and tablet computers, which use much the same technology, are valued assets and feared weapons, as the market for those devices booms. Companies are battling in the marketplace and in courtrooms around the world, where patent claims and counterclaims are filed almost daily.
''Microsoft is increasing its arsenal, even if it is expensive,'' said James E. Bessen, a patent expert and lecturer at the Boston University School of Law. 
And AOL, an online pioneer, is increasingly shifting its focus to media, acquiring The Huffington Post and TechCrunch, a technology news and gossip site. The patents it is selling include early Internet patents that involve search, e-mail, instant messaging and custom online advertisements, according to an analysis by 3LP Advisors, a patent consulting firm in Silicon Valley.
''This is all stuff that companies want to -- and are putting in smartphones,'' said Kevin G. Rivette, a managing partner of 3LP.
Microsoft has used its deep stockpile of computing patents to prod smartphone makers to pay it licensing fees. So, analysts say, adding more patents promises to strengthen its negotiating and legal position with rivals like Google and Apple -- and handset makers using Google's Android software including HTC, Samsung and LG.
Prices for patents are rising as the big companies load up. Google last August agreed to pay $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility, a mobile phone maker with a trove of 17,000 patents. That portfolio, analysts estimate, could represent more than half the value of the deal, or more than $400,000 a patent.
Last year, Apple and Microsoft teamed up with four other companies to pay $4.5 billion for the 6,000 patents held by the bankrupt Canadian telecommunications maker Nortel Networks. That worked out to $750,000 a patent, or nearly four times the average for computer, software and telecommunications patents a few years earlier, experts say.
Last month, Facebook said it had bought 750 patents from I.B.M. for an undisclosed sum, shortly after the social networking giant was hit with a patent lawsuit by Yahoo.
Fierce patent battles have occurred throughout industrial history. The steam engine, automobile and airplane, as they opened big new markets, prompted patent wars, noted David J. Kappos, director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
''But those wars played themselves out in slow motion compared to what we're seeing now,'' Mr. Kappos said. ''What's different is the pace of technological change and market development. So the stakes are a lot higher, a lot faster.''
In the past, patents were often bought by specialist patent firms from start-ups that had failed, and used in suits against major technology companies to reach lucrative settlements or win big paydays in court. These days, though, big companies are increasingly using patents as strategic tools, said Colleen Chien, an assistant professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law.
The specialist patent holders, sometimes called trolls, are still around, but the main litigation and deal-making now are among big companies themselves, Professor Chien said. ''These major companies are using patents to gain competitive advantage rather than just seeing patents as financial assets,'' she said.
AOL's slow progress as it transforms into a media company supported by advertising has brought pressure from restive institutional shareholders. The patent sale -- AOL will hold onto 300 others -- is intended to help with both objectives.
The deal ''unlocks current dollar value for our shareholders and enables AOL to continue to aggressively execute on our strategy,'' Tim Armstrong, AOL's chief, said in a statement.
While Microsoft is struggling in the smartphone market, it is doing a brisk business in licensing its intellectual property to smartphone makers using rival software, analysts say.
The company has struck licensing deals with handset makers that account for 70 percent of sales of Android-powered phones in the United States, including HTC, Samsung and LG. Analysts estimate that Microsoft makes more on every Android phone sold than on each phone running its Windows Phone software.
Microsoft has roughly 20,000 granted patents, not counting applications pending -- about four times what Apple holds, estimates M-Cam, a patent advisory firm. A smartphone is essentially a combination of computer and telecommunications technology, and Microsoft has a deep store of patents in computing.
Microsoft's large intellectual property team tracks patent portfolios and has been scrutinizing AOL's for years, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel. Some of the patents in AOL's portfolio would be quite familiar to Microsoft, since they came from its former rival in Internet browsing software, Netscape Communications, which AOL bought in 1998 for $4.2 billion.
The $1.056 billion that Microsoft paid for the patents was higher than most patent research firms had estimated, ranging from about $300 million to $650 million. David E. Martin, chairman of M-Cam, suggested that Microsoft's high bid at the AOL auction might have been with an eye toward improving its bargaining position in licensing and legal negotiations.
''It sends the message that these giant patent estates have value, even if they don't,'' Mr. Martin said.
Patents are supposed to be fuel for innovation -- a temporary period of ownership for the holder as an incentive to invent and disclose the invention. But whether the system works as intended in a field like smartphones, with its myriad overlapping claims and various software programs, is in doubt.
David C. Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, estimated that a modern smartphone might be susceptible to as many as 250,000 potential patent claims, depending on how broadly those patents and claims were interpreted.
In a study published in 2008, Mr. Bessen and a colleague, Michael J. Meurer, an economist and professor at the Boston University School of Law, concluded that patents were a net benefit in two industries, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. But in industries like software, the researchers said, the costs of litigation are more than twice the benefits in terms of gains to inventors.
''In pharmaceutical and chemical industry, the boundaries of a chemical composition patent are well defined,'' Mr. Bessen said. ''But in fields like software and telecommunications, the claims are often so broad and vague that it is completely unpredictable what the patents cover and don't.''
Yet Professor Chien is less certain. ''The patent system is making innovation more expensive, but I also think that there has been a lot more focus on the costs than the benefits,'' she said.
''In a case like AOL, this patent sale is keeping it alive and giving it a chance to innovate elsewhere,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Impatience To Get Thin Sends Some To Canada

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
Tammy Kwarciak, a 44-year-old nurse whose weight had been creeping up for years, was determined to lose 50 pounds. So in February, she drove from her home in Port Huron, Mich., across the border into Canada and had a small balloonlike device inserted into her stomach.
The intragastric balloon, filled with liquid and left in the stomach for up to six months, is not approved for use in the United States, though it's available in Europe, South America and other parts of the world. Clinical trials required to win federal Food and Drug Administration approval are being initiated, but many Americans aren't waiting.
Since the balloon's introduction in Canada in 2006, people like Mrs. Kwarciak have been streaming north in growing numbers. Drawn by the relative ease of balloon placement, Americans account for nearly a third of patients undergoing the procedures in Canadian clinics just over the border. 
''The nice thing about the balloon is that you have such a sense of satiety,'' said Mrs. Kwarciak, who has lost 25 pounds since she had the procedure. ''I feel full all the time. I have to remind myself at times to eat.''
But the balloon is a temporary measure, and once it is removed in a few months, she said, ''I'm on my own.''
The intragastric balloon appeals to people like Mrs. Kwarciak who have a significant amount of weight to lose but are not heavy enough to qualify for bariatric surgery like gastric bypass surgery and adjustable gastric band surgery. The patient is anesthetized, and the balloon is inserted through the esophagus - a relatively noninvasive procedure. It is removed after six months or so.
The balloon may also be an option for extremely obese people who need to lose enough weight to be considered for more invasive procedures.
But just because the placement doesn't involve surgery doesn't mean it's risk-free. Patients can suffer severe nausea and vomiting during the first few days or week after placement. On rare occasions, it can deflate and obstruct the intestines, or it can perforate the abdomen, which can be life-threatening.
Perhaps as significant, the weight loss that patients can expect is modest at best.
''That's the most common complication - not losing as much weight as the patient would like,'' said Dr. Sanjeev Kaila, the plastic surgeon who pioneered the intragastric balloon program in Canada. Some return for a second balloon after taking a short break, he added.
Though Mrs. Kwarciak said she lost 25 pounds in the first two months, studies say most patients experience the bulk of their weight loss during the first three to four months after the balloon's insertion.
Studies of the balloon have reported weight loss ranging from 13 to 34 pounds on average, with some individuals losing up to 50 pounds. Patients often gain weight again after the device is removed, though long-term studies are limited.
But a scathing review by The Cochrane Collaboration in 2007 noted the possibility of serious complications and concluded that ''compared with conventional management, intragastric balloon did not show convincing evidence of greater weight loss.'' Another review suggested the device was a waste of money, saying that its use ''only to reduce weight has no medical and economic justification.''
The combination of potential risks and little benefit is the main reason there is no intragastric balloon on the market in the United States. An earlier version called the Garren-Edwards Gastric Bubble was approved in 1985. But officials at the Food and Drug Administration soon became concerned about the severe and frequent complications associated with the device, an agency spokeswoman said.
By 1988, the manufacturer, American Edwards Laboratories, stopped selling it, voluntarily withdrawing the balloon from the market entirely in 1992. In the interim, randomized clinical trials comparing the bubble with a sham or placebo device found that diet and exercise were equally effective for weight loss.
Getting the new intragastric balloon is not cheap: In Canada, an outpatient procedure that takes less than an hour costs $8,000. The fee includes removal of the device after six months, as well as physician follow-up and support services from a nutritionist and dietitian, usually provided over the phone and online.
F.D.A. officials would not comment on the current balloons, which are made of new, sophisticated materials, but said generally that the agency ''reviews medical devices to assure American patients that they are safe and effective. Many countries will approve medical devices without first having to demonstrate that the technology is effective.''
Dr. Robin Blackstone, a bariatric surgeon in Scottsdale, Ariz., and president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, who is involved in a clinical trial of a balloon in the United States, said that people who need to lose a modest amount of weight may do just as well with a more conventional approach, given the risk of complications.
''Patients who are obese are very vulnerable,'' she said. ''They're desperate to find something that works, and it's important for people not to offer things that aren't well established.''
For those who insist on trying the procedure despite its lackluster record, some cautions are in order.
The balloon is an option only for those who have less than 50 pounds to lose - Canadian clinics may accept patients with a body mass index as low as 27, if they also have weight-related health problems - or for extremely obese people who need to lose weight to be accepted for bariatric surgery.
Potential patients should consult with a primary-care physician. The metabolic and bariatric surgery organization recommends establishing a relationship with a local gastroenterologist able to remove the balloon endoscopically should a complication occur.
The balloon, usually filled with blue liquid, can rupture. The liquid will turn patients' urine green, which is how they are alerted to the problem. A ruptured balloon may pass through the intestines on its own or require endoscopic or surgical removal if it obstructs the intestines. The most serious complication is a rupture in the abdomen, which can be life-threatening. Other complications include infections and ulcers.
Patients should not have the balloon implanted if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, have a hiatus hernia or history of gastric ulcers, other gastrointestinal disease or previous abdominal surgery.
Successful weight loss with the intragastric balloon depends on lifestyle changes, including a better diet and increased physical activity, and maintaining those changes is critical to maintaining the weight loss after the balloon is removed. Many balloon programs have a team of providers, often a gastroenterologist, endocrinologist, nutritionist or dietitian, personal trainer and psychologist involved in weekly follow-up with patients.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pulling Back From the Exurbs

 BODY:
The view from a helicopter over the outer edges of Las Vegas in about 2004, at the height of the housing bubble, was of sprawl overtaking desert as fast as builders could throw up framing and lay on the stucco and roofing tiles. People were flooding in. The Clark County School District was hiring 2,000 teachers a year. 
Came the recession, and down went the boom. Las Vegas was the third-fastest-growing metro area in the country between 2000 and 2010. Between 2010 and 2011, it fell to 151st place. When the housing market collapsed, so did growth, particularly where growth had been fastest, in the outer suburbs, or exurbs. New Census Bureau data show that the tentative economic recovery has not -- or at least not yet -- led to a revival of exurban growth.
As a demographer, William Frey of the Brookings Institution, told The Times recently, exurbs were once the ''cutting edge'' of growth, but no more. ''That growth has really come to a standstill,'' he said, ''and is maybe being given up for dead at this point.'' His analysis of data found that the country's outer suburbs grew by only 0.4 percent in the fiscal year ended in July, down from 1 percent the same period before. It peaked, in 2006, above 2 percent.
For generations, Americans have migrated ever outward from city centers, pulled by affordable housing to places where long commutes were possible because of cheap gasoline. The costs of such migration -- in traffic congestion, environmental degradation and increasing addiction to fossil fuels -- were played down or ignored.
Recent trends point to a correction, driven in part by the recession, which has made it harder for families to move. The Census Bureau also recently reported that America's urban population increased by 12.1 percent from 2000 to 2010, faster than the nation's overall growth rate of 9.7 percent. The exurban tide may be receding.

HEADLINE: A Celebration of Science With a Popular Touch

BYLINE: By KAREN WEINTRAUB

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- With the applause just winding down for a scantily clad all-girl rock band, John Durant climbed onstage, carrying his 2-year-old son.
His assistants handed out cardboard placards emblazoned with ''X'' or ''Y.'' Dr. Durant asked the women in the crowd to hold up an X, the men to hold up a Y.
Their letters, Dr. Durant told them, marked the tail end of a two-mile-long scale model of the human genome that stretched from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to the stage in Harvard Square. They cheered as they became the symbolic 23rd chromosome, the one that determines sex.
That was at the inaugural Cambridge Science Festival, in 2007; this year's -- the sixth -- begins April 20. And if the science festival can be said to have an animating spirit, Dr. Durant -- whose day job is director of the M.I.T. Museum -- would be a good candidate. 
He is 61, an evangelical minister's son from England who strikes a ramrod posture, favors pressed Oxford shirts and speaks with a BBC accent that gives little hint of his boyhood in a subsidized housing project in Norwich. Like his father, he devotes much of his life to spreading the gospel -- in his case the gospel of science festivals.
Thanks in good part to Dr. Durant's advocacy, more than 20 science festivals were held across the United States last year, in science hubs like the Bay Area and in communities not known for their science, like Dayton, Ohio, and Colorado Springs.
He bristles when asked if a science festival is the same as a science fair. His answer is definitely no -- although, he hastens to add, there's nothing wrong with science fairs, which typically challenge students to design and conduct their own experiments.
A science festival has more in common with a film, art or food festival. Festivals aim to bring in tourism dollars, introduce people to scientists and demystify science in an era when researchers and large sectors of the public diverge on major policy issues like climate change, vaccines and embryonic stem cell research.
''People are living with tensions between what they think about science in one area and what they believe in another,'' Dr. Durant said. Science festivals help bridge those gaps. ''We shouldn't just be trying to shove science down people's throats. It never works and it's very uncongenial.''
Each science festival capitalizes on regional strengths, expertise and creativity. But their underlying idea is the same: Bring as many people as possible into contact with science.
Two years after inaugurating the Cambridge Science Festival, Dr. Durant won a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation to set up an alliance that would help start four festivals and inspire a few more. The Science Festival Alliance, based at the M.I.T. Museum, now expects more than 30 festivals next year, and sparked the first such festival in Egypt; it begins in Cairo on April 21.
Dr. Durant says the growth of science festivals is part of decades of efforts by him and others to integrate science and popular culture. In his early days, he said, he and his friends felt like missionaries.
''Today, it's pretty mainstream,'' he said. ''I don't feel anymore that I'm in a minority of ridiculously evangelical advocates.''
Dr. Durant's success stems only partly from his charm. He also sweeps people up with enthusiasm and idealistic vigor.
''He's smart enough to use that British accent and style to his advantage to make the science more fun,'' said P. A. d'Arbeloff, director of the Cambridge Science Festival. ''He'll make a joke about the way he phrases things or a term that he uses,'' she said. ''He'll phrase it in such a British way that he'll pull you in -- it's disarming.''
After his modest upbringing, he earned a full scholarship to Cambridge University, where he went on to earn a Ph.D. in the history of science -- driven to answer questions raised by his father's religious convictions. As a graduate student in the early 1970s, Dr. Durant was disappointed that the talk on campus so quickly turned from the radicalism of the '60s back to more capitalistic concerns. He didn't enjoy teaching undergraduates, for whom learning was often only a means to an end.
As the most junior member of the History of Science department, Dr. Durant was asked to teach a continuing education class to adults in a nearby town -- an assignment none of his colleagues wanted. But he found it so exhilarating, he pursued continuing education, rather than an academic career.
''I've always found that talking about science to people who are not specialists -- who have a general interest and are prepared to ask any and every question that occurs to them -- really compellingly interesting,'' he said.
By 1990, he was working at the Science Museum in London, which he thought overemphasized the past. There were too many exhibits about the steam age and not any about science in contemporary London, Dr. Durant said.
''It seemed not to engage anywhere with anything that visitors might be directly encountering or experiencing to do with science in their daily lives,'' he says now. ''I've spent quite a bit of time in my museum career trying to think about what it means to do something realistically in the museum environment which isn't exclusively about the remote past.''
There's a bit of unspoken rivalry between the World Science Festival in New York City and Cambridge's festival. Cambridge held the first, in 2007, as Dr. Durant points out; but New York had started planning its 2008 festival even earlier, as the World Science Festival founder and director, the physicist Brian Greene, retorts. The men have met only in passing, and each is far too gentlemanly to speak ill of the other, though each clearly favors his own formula.
''Our focus is on creating very high quality, highly artistically produced programs that bring together worlds that usually don't talk to each other,'' said Dr. Greene, a physics and math professor at Columbia and well-known popularizer of science. ''We've tried to inject the drama of science into these highly produced programs, so people leave the event saying, 'Wow, I didn't know that's what science is like.' ''
Many events for the New York festival, which this year runs from May 30 to June 3, charge fees and sell out quickly. Organizers expect 300,000 people to attend this year.
The Cambridge Science Festival cost $400,000 last year, with support from corporate donors, M.I.T., Harvard University and the state and local governments. About 50,000 people attended the festival, which aims for a more economically diverse audience, with most events free, and a somewhat lighter tone.
The most popular adult event in recent years has been Big Ideas for Busy People. Ten of the region's exciting thinkers, in just five minutes each, explain their big ideas. They then take five more minutes to answer questions. The free event was so packed last year that Dr. Durant's staff found a bigger venue for this year.
Other science festivals have largely followed Cambridge's model, because their regions lack New York's celebrity firepower and large audience. Last April, Philadelphia's first festival teamed up historians of science with comedians. They re-enacted famous scientific flops. In North Carolina, the inaugural festival in 2010 featured the science of winemaking, a rap guide to evolution and a science carnival for children -- the one feature common to festivals nationwide.
Dr. Durant wants to push beyond the constraints of a single, 10-day annual festival. He is extending the festival's outreach across Massachusetts and to an ever more diverse audience. At the Caribbean Festival in Boston in the fall, science festival staff handed out 800 backpacks and experiments in two hours.
''It's important that we don't only celebrate science where it's already flourishing,'' Dr. Durant said.

HEADLINE: Sudans' Dispute Leaves Southerners Stranded at Airport

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
KHARTOUM, Sudan (Reuters) -- Hundreds of South Sudanese were stranded at the Khartoum airport in Sudan on Monday after being denied permission to board their flights to the south in a dispute over their legal status. 
The unclear legal status for South Sudanese in Sudan is one of many unresolved issues between the former foes since the South gained independence last July under a peace agreement.
Sudan has ruled out dual citizenship for more than 500,000 southerners who have lived in the north in Sudan for decades and started treating them as foreigners on Monday after the end of a grace period.
Until Sunday, boarding for flights to the southern capital, Juba, had been conducted at the domestic terminal without passport controls. But many are now stuck in limbo, because South Sudan has failed to open an embassy in Khartoum that can issue passports.
At the airport, hundreds of South Sudanese tried checking into their flights to Juba early on Monday but immigration officials denied them entry.
''They need passports to board flights,'' a Sudanese police officer said inside the terminal.
''We don't know what to do now,'' said one young woman, sitting next to a pile of suitcases and plastic bags outside the terminal's heavily guarded front gate.
The presidents of the two countries had planned to sign agreements last week to allow citizens free residency, but Sudan called off the meeting after border fighting broke out.
With almost no passengers to check in, the state-owned Sudan Airways and other local carriers suspended their Juba flights.
''We are ready to fly but wait for a political decision,'' said an official at Sudan Airways.
The Sudanese Foreign Ministry could not be reached for comment.
About 500 South Sudanese lined up outside the embassy but were unable to get passports or temporary travel documents because the embassy was not yet fully functional.
More than 370,000 southerners, who are mostly Christians or animists, have left Sudan for home since October 2010. Tens of thousands more are now packing up, fearing that they no longer have a future in the mainly Muslim north.
President Omar Hassan al-Bashir has said Sudan will adopt an Islamic constitution, and other Sudanese officials have said the country needs to cut down on foreign workers to create jobs to fight an economic crisis.
Tensions erupted into direct clashes in disputed border regions last month, prompting the United Nations, the United States and other countries to warn of the possibility that a full-blown conflict could break out again.
On Monday, Mr. Bashir called on South Sudan to halt aid to rebel groups north of the shared border, saying security was crucial to resolving disputes.
Both sides are also arguing over how much South Sudan should pay to export crude oil through Sudan, prompting the South to halt its entire output to stop Sudan from seizing oil in lieu of ''unpaid fees.''
They also need to mark their 1,200-mile border and agree on security for the frontier regions, where they accuse each other of backing rebels in their territory.
The African Union managed to bring them to the negotiating table last week after the border fighting, but talks were adjourned with no progress.

HEADLINE: Weak Jobs Report Sends Shares Lower for 4th Day

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A disappointing jobs report, the latest sign of an uncertain economic recovery, set off the fourth consecutive daily decline for stocks on Monday.
Markets were closed in the United States on Friday when the Labor Department released its monthly report, delaying until Monday investor reaction to the news that the economy created only 120,000 net jobs in March. That was about half the number analysts had expected and about half of what had been added in each of the previous two months. 
Analysts said the jobs report reduced optimism just as concerns had sharpened over credit conditions in Europe and the economy in China.
On Wall Street, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 15.88 points, or 1.14 percent, to 1,382.20. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 130.55 points, or 1 percent, to 12,929.59, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 33.42 points, or 1.08 percent, to 3,047.08.
''I think the prior months' jobs data, and some of the other items that were positives on the macroeconomic side that have come out, had gotten expectations up for perhaps the recovery accelerating,'' said Jason Arnold, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. ''The jobs data on Friday threw the monkey wrench into the equation.''
John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds, said financial shares were hurt by lingering concerns about credit quality after the Spanish debt auction set off declines in European indexes last week. ''My guess is people are rethinking Europe,'' he said. ''Concerns about credit quality -- those are the issues that were never really addressed.''
He noted that investors might also be bracing for what they will see on balance sheets when banks report their quarterly earnings this month. ''I think it heightens people's tensions,'' he said. ''What people might be worried about a little bit is what they might hear in the second and third quarters about charge-offs.''
Bank shares fell steeply, with Bank of America off 3.25 percent at $8.93. Citigroup was down 2.36 percent at $33.07. Industrial shares plunged; General Electric lost 1.40 percent, to $19.20, and CSX declined 2.87 percent, to $21.68. Caterpillar declined 2.17 percent, to $103.57.
Company results had been a bright spot in the recovery, but analysts were predicting little if any growth in earnings when companies start reporting this week. On Monday, the Standard & Poor's Capital IQ survey said earnings growth for stocks in the index would be up 0.97 percent from the same period in 2011.
In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year note was unchanged at 99 19/32, with the yield at 2.05 percent.

HEADLINE: Owing a Debt to Europe's Woes

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
Europe may be in crisis, but that is proving to be a boon for the Continent's filmmakers. Economic austerity, social, religious and generational conflict, immigration from the Islamic world -- all those concerns and more have helped contribute to a bumper crop of movies for the fourth annual Disappearing Act European film festival in Manhattan that reflect, and reflect upon, current realities.
The most topical of the offerings is the Greek film ''Wasted Youth,'' written and directed by Argyris Papadimitropoulos and Jan Vogel. The deepening financial crisis in Greece provides both backdrop and foreground for this drama, which tracks two very different characters -- an indolent teenage skateboarder and the weary middle-aged head of a struggling family -- whose prospects have been dimmed by the implosion of the Greek economy.
''Some people said you can't make a film about something so recent, that it is still too fresh,'' Mr. Papadimitropoulos, 35, said in a telephone interview from Athens. ''But that was our point: Let's look the problem straight in the eye now so that maybe we can solve it, rather than waiting for it to become history and then trying to analyze it. To me there's no point in making that kind of film.'' 
Mr. Papadimitropoulos, the son of a journalist, spoke on Thursday, the morning after a 77-year-old pensioner committed suicide at Constitution Square, near the Greek Parliament, in an act of desperation and protest. In the film, the teenager, Harry, largely indifferent to the difficulties around him, goes there and to the foot of the Acropolis, another site laden with historical significance and symbolism, to skate and smoke joints with pals and talk girls into bed.
''As a citizen, the easiest thing to do is blame the politicians for the last 30 years of fake prosperity,'' Mr. Papadimitropoulos said. ''But I think we are to blame too, because we took that pill. We said, 'Let's take the easy way out, even though we know it is not right.' Now we're paying the price.''
The Disappearing Act festival will open on Wednesday with the American premiere of the German film ''The System'' at the IFC Center in Greenwich Village. The 24 remaining films will be shown free at the Bohemian National Hall or the French Institute Alliance Francaise, both on the East Side of Manhattan, through April 22.
Organized by 25 New York-based European cultural and consular agencies, with the Czech Center New York and the Romanian Cultural Institute in the lead, Disappearing Act features 10 American or New York premieres. But as the festival's tongue-in-cheek name indicates, there is also a focus on movies that, though critically praised in their homelands, may have had only festival showings or the briefest of commercial runs in the United States.
''This year we actually have more premieres than last year, but we don't hunt for them,'' said Irena Kovarova, an independent film programmer who is the festival's curator and a former deputy director of the Czech Center New York. ''That gives us a lot of freedom to point out quality contemporary films, often by lesser-known or emerging directors, that slipped between the cracks or should have received distribution in the U.S.''
Ms. Kovarova pointed to ''Involuntary,'' a Swedish film directed and co-written by Ruben Ostlund. His most recent movie, ''Play,'' shown at the New York Film Festival last fall, has drawn much attention for the way it used long takes to register and create discomfort in viewers as it examined European attitudes about race.
''Involuntary,'' his 2008 film, uses many of the same techniques to address other social issues. In five alternating stories that suggest how pressure to conform shapes human behavior, Mr. Ostlund conducts variations on the Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures in familiar environments, like a birthday party or a school.
In contrast, the festival opener, ''The System,'' from Marc Bauder, is a financial thriller that draws heavily on current events and suggests that Wall Street isn't the only place fatally infected by greed. Specifically, the film's subject is the competition, filled with intrigue and blackmail, to secure a contract for a pipeline that will transport natural gas from Russia to Germany.
As Mr. Bauder noted in an interview, the recent premiere of his film in Germany coincided with the ceremonial opening of the pipeline, attended by the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, and senior German officials. Though his movie is fiction, ''it's a real story,'' he said.
''We're showing the mechanism behind the crisis, and how people always behave the same, how the basics repeat themselves from one crisis to the next,'' continued Mr. Bauder, who studied business at New York University a decade ago. ''Morality is not part of the thinking of people running these business networks. It's only their personal profit that they think of.''
Mr. Bauder was born in the former West Germany, but his girlfriend, Dorte Franke, a co-writer of the script, is originally from the East, and the film deals with a problem that is one of the consequences of German reunification: former East German intelligence officers who use their knowledge of the recent and very murky past for their own material advantage.
The intrusion of the past into the present is also the theme of several other films from Eastern Europe in the festival.
''The Christening,'' from Poland, is a thriller about a gangster trying to go straight, while the Bulgarian ''Eastern Plays'' focuses on the different reactions of two brothers -- one a skinhead, the other an artist and recovering drug addict -- when they separately encounter a family from Turkey, Bulgaria's former ruler.
The common thread in many of these Eastern European films is a kind of anomie that permeates the lives of their characters. In the quietly claustrophobic ''Eighty Letters,'' the Czech director Vaclav Kadrnka returns to the Communist era and his childhood to tell the story of a mother and son trying to emigrate to the West after the father has defected, but a similar alienation also pervades the films looking at the post-1989 era.
''Nothing was happening here, no future, and now it's so wild, we don't have our place, we don't know what to do,'' Ms. Kovarova said. ''The young generation sees only the negative part of this kind of urban existence. The East is still struggling with this.''

HEADLINE: Food Stamps Helped Reduce Poverty Rate, Study Finds

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A new study by the Agriculture Department has found that food stamps, one of the country's largest social safety net programs, reduced the poverty rate substantially during the recent recession. The food stamp program, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, reduced the poverty rate by nearly 8 percent in 2009, the most recent year included in the study, a significant impact for a social program whose effects often go unnoticed by policy makers.
The food stamp program is one of the largest antipoverty efforts in the country, serving more than 46 million people. But the extra income it provides is not counted in the government's formal poverty measure, an omission that makes it difficult for officials to see the effects of the policy and get an accurate figure for the number of people beneath the poverty threshold, which was about $22,000 for a family of four in 2009. 
''SNAP plays a crucial, but often underappreciated, role in alleviating poverty,'' said Stacy Dean, an expert on the program with the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington-based research group that focuses on social programs and budget policy.
Enrollment in the food stamp program grew substantially during the recession and immediately after, rising by 45 percent from January of 2009 to January of this year, according to monthly figures on the U.S.D.A. Web site. The stimulus package pushed by President Obama and enacted by Congress significantly boosted funding for the program as a temporary relief for families who had fallen on hard times in the recession.
But the steady rise tapered off in January, when enrollment was down slightly from December, a change in direction that Ms. Dean said could signal that the recovery was having an effect even among poor families.
The program's effects have long been known among poverty researchers, and for Ms. Dean, the most interesting aspect of the report was the political context into which it was released. In a year of elections and rising budget pressures, social programs like food stamps are coming under increased scrutiny from Republican legislators, who argue that they create a kind of entitlement society.
In an e-mail to supporters on Monday, Representative Allen B. West, a Florida Republican, called the increase in food stamp use a ''highly disturbing trend.'' He said that he had noticed a sign outside a gas station in his district over the weekend alerting customers that food stamps were accepted.
''This is not something we should be proud to promote,'' he said.
Kevin W. Concannon, the under secretary of agriculture for food, nutrition and consumer services, argued that since the changes to the welfare system in the 1990s, the food stamp program was one of the few remaining antipoverty programs that provided benefits with few conditions beyond income level and legal residence.
''The numbers of people on SNAP reflect the economic challenges people are facing across the country,'' Mr. Concannon said. ''Folks who have lost their jobs or are getting fewer hours. These people haven't been invented.''
The study, which examined nine years of data, tried to measure the program's effects on people whose incomes remained below the poverty threshold. The program lifted the average poor person's income up about six percent closer to the line over the length of the study, making poverty less severe. When the benefits were included in the income of families with children, the result was that children below the threshold moved about 11 percent closer to the line.
The program had a stronger effect on children because they are more likely to be poor and they make up about half of the program's participants.
''Even if SNAP doesn't have the effect of lifting someone out of poverty, it moves them further up,'' Mr. Concannon said.

HEADLINE: Toyota, Eschewing Sedate Design, Is Ready for Pizazz

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOYOTA CITY, Japan -- After decades of emphasizing staid reliability, Toyota wants to start running with the cool kids.
In a new approach announced Monday, the company, Japan's biggest automaker, said it was overhauling its development system to give engineers more freedom to experiment with bolder, more daring designs.
''We want to take more risks,'' Akio Toyoda, the automaker's chief executive and grandson of the company's founder, told reporters Monday at the main design lab at headquarters here in Toyota City, 200 miles southwest of Tokyo. 
The company will give more power to its engineers, Mr. Toyoda said, and streamline design decisions, partly by reducing the number of executives involved in reviewing new designs. Previously, design changes could be reviewed by up to 100 executives.
But the engineers will be under pressure to cut costs by using standard parts across different models, Mr. Toyoda said at a briefing at the tightly guarded lab, where reporters' cellphones and cameras were confiscated.
Toyota will also cede more research and development for emerging-economy nations to locally based teams, allowing designers to shape models specifically to local tastes, he said.
In many ways, Toyota is eager to reinvent itself after three disastrous years marred by problems of its own making as well as those beyond its control. A collapse in trade during the global economic crisis contributed to Toyota's biggest loss ever, while widespread product recalls in 2009 tarnished its once-stellar safety record.
More recently, last year's tsunami in Japan and flooding in Thailand crimped production for months. And a strong yen continues to weigh on the company's competitiveness and bottom line.
But the 75-year-old company is also trying to refresh a design philosophy that has focused more on function, cost and efficiency than form.
Take the Camry, the sensible grocery-getter. Despite its status as the best-selling car in North America, its design has long been the butt of jokes.
''Common descriptors thrown around include 'appliance,' 'beige' and 'boring,' '' a 2011 review by Motor Trend magazine said.
Tokuo Fukuichi, who was named Toyota's chief designer last year, said that the lackluster design was the product of a consensus-driven process that tried to please everybody and therefore excited no one.
''For someone to passionately like a design, we have to be prepared for some people to hate it,'' Mr. Fukuichi said.
The restyled Avalon could be one example. Designers based in the United States had free rein to revamp the sedan, which Toyota introduced at the New York Auto Show last week. Revisions like a trapezoidal grille and wraparound taillights have greatly changed the feel of the vehicle, reviewers said.
At the auto show, Toyota's group vice president for the United States, Bob Carter, described Mr. Toyoda's elation on seeing the remodeled Avalon: ''Cool! Don't change a thing.''
Another change Toyota designers talk about is the increasingly central role the Prius gas-electric hybrid is playing in propelling vehicle development at the automaker. Once developed almost completely separately from Toyota's other cars, many designs original to the Prius, like its low-rolling-resistance tires that help improve fuel efficiency, are now shared with other models.
And in an approach uncharacteristic of Toyota -- where executives talk obsessively of listening to customer feedback -- Mr. Toyoda said that designers at the company would be encouraged to push ahead without much user input.
''Design should not be a problem of simply making what customers tell you to make,'' Mr. Toyoda said.
Asked whether the Toyota design process might soon resemble that of Apple -- a company famous for shunning market research in favor of its own designers' tastes and preferences -- Mr. Toyoda was thoughtful.
''Yes, I do think we are headed more in that direction,'' he said. ''We need to be more visionary.''

HEADLINE: The Two Economies

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The creative dynamism of American business is astounding and a little terrifying. Over the past five years, amid turmoil and uncertainty, American businesses have shed employees, becoming more efficient and more productive. According to The Wall Street Journal on Monday, the revenue per employee at S.&P. 500 companies increased from $378,000 in 2007 to $420,000 in 2011.
These efficiency gains are boosting the American economy overall and American exports in particular. Two years ago, President Obama promised to double exports over the next five years. The U.S. might actually meet that target. As Tyler Cowen reports in a fantastic article in The American Interest called ''What Export-Oriented America Means,'' American exports are surging. 
Cowen argues that America's export strength will only build in the years ahead. He points to three trends that will boost the nation's economic performance. First, smart machines. China and other low-wage countries have a huge advantage when factory floors are crowded with workers. But we are moving to an age of quiet factories, with more robots and better software. That reduces the importance of wage rates. It boosts American companies that make software and smart machines.
Then there is the shale oil and gas revolution. In the past year, fracking, a technology pioneered in the United States, has given us access to vast amounts of U.S. energy that can be sold abroad. Europe and Asian nations have much less capacity. As long as fracking can be done responsibly, U.S. exports should surge.
Finally, there is the growth of the global middle class. When China, India and such places were first climbing the income ladder, they imported a lot of raw materials from places like Canada, Australia and Chile to fuel the early stages of their economic growth. But, in the coming decades, as their consumers get richer, they will be importing more pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, planes and entertainment, important American products.
If Cowen's case is right, the U.S. is not a nation in decline. We may be in the early days of an export boom that will eventually power an economic revival, including a manufacturing revival. But, as Cowen emphasizes, this does not mean nirvana is at hand.
His work leaves the impression that there are two interrelated American economies. On the one hand, there is the globalized tradable sector -- companies that have to compete with everybody everywhere. These companies, with the sword of foreign competition hanging over them, have become relentlessly dynamic and very (sometimes brutally) efficient.
On the other hand, there is a large sector of the economy that does not face this global competition -- health care, education and government. Leaders in this economy try to improve productivity and use new technologies, but they are not compelled by do-or-die pressure, and their pace of change is slower.
A rift is opening up. The first, globalized sector is producing a lot of the productivity gains, but it is not producing a lot of the jobs. The second more protected sector is producing more jobs, but not as many productivity gains. The hypercompetitive globalized economy generates enormous profits, while the second, less tradable economy is where more Americans actually live.
In politics, we are beginning to see conflicts between those who live in Economy I and those who live in Economy II. Republicans often live in and love the efficient globalized sector and believe it should be a model for the entire society. They want to use private health care markets and choice-oriented education reforms to make society as dynamic, creative and efficient as Economy I.
Democrats are more likely to live in and respect the values of the second sector. They emphasize the destructive side of Economy I streamlining -- the huge profits at the top and the stagnant wages at the middle. They want to tamp down some of the streamlining in the global economy sector and protect health care, education and government from its remorseless logic.
Republicans believe the globalized sector is racing far out in front of government, adapting in ways inevitable and proper. If given enough freedom, Economy I entrepreneurs will create the future jobs we need. Government should prepare people to enter that sector but get out of its way as much as possible.
Democrats are more optimistic that government can enhance the productivity of the global sectors of the economy while redirecting their benefits. They want to use Economy I to subsidize Economy II.
I don't know which coalition will gain the upper hand. But I do think today's arguments are rooted in growing structural rifts. There's an urgent need to understand the interplay between the two different sectors. I'd also add that it's not always easy to be in one of those pockets -- including the media and higher education -- that are making the bumpy transition from Economy II to Economy I.

HEADLINE: Facebook To Buy Mobile Start-Up For $1 Billion

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
9:07 p.m. Updated
Instagram, an Internet start-up in San Francisco, has no revenue and about a dozen employees. It has not yet celebrated its second birthday. But to Facebook, it is already worth a billion dollars.
Facebook announced on Monday that it would pay that much in cash and stock for Instagram, the latest big winner in an industry that seems to be more awash in money by the day.
Instagram joins other out-of-nowhere Internet hits like Groupon and YouTube. The acquisition, which is Facebook's largest to date, could give it a stronger position on mobile devices.
Instagram is essentially a social network built around photography, offering mobile apps that let people add quirky effects to their smartphone snapshots and share them with friends. 
It has dozens of competitors, but Instagram stands out for its fast ascension and almost cultlike following. It has 30 million users who upload more than five million photos a day, even though it was available for only Apple devices until last week, when the company released an Android app.
For Instagram's founders, two Stanford graduates in their 20s who are now worth in the tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars, it has been a productive couple of years. The other big winners will be their early investors at venture capital firms.
''It's the Web fairy tale that all start-ups dream of,'' said Melissa Parrish, an analyst with Forrester Research, who added: ''They took a simple behavior - sharing pictures with friends - and made it a utility that people want.''
Facebook is getting ready for its own big payday. It is aiming for a public offering as soon as next month that could value the company around $100 billion. That means it can easily afford Instagram's price, if only to keep a rising star out of the hands of competitors like Google.
Facebook may also need Instagram to help it keep up with the constantly changing whims of the online audience. Facebook was born in the computer-and-browser era and is trying to adapt to a world that is increasingly mobile-centric. Instagram is a purely mobile creation.
Rebecca Lieb, an analyst at the Altimeter Group, said buying Instagram would help Facebook with one of its most urgent needs: making its service more appealing on smartphones.
''It's easier to update Facebook when you're on the go with a snapshot rather than with text,'' Ms. Lieb said.
Kevin Systrom, who founded Instagram with Mike Krieger and is now its chief executive, has been on the radar ofMark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, for some time. Mr. Systrom was a sophomore at Stanford in 2004 when he developed a service called Photobox that let people send large photo files to each other. The service caught the eye of Mr. Zuckerberg, who offered him a job. But Mr. Systrom decided to finish his studies and went on to found Burbn, which let people post photos and other updates.
Burbn never attracted more than a few hundred users, but they uploaded a lot of photos. So Mr. Systrom and his team stripped it down and released a sleeker version for the iPhone, calling it Instagram. It gained early momentum because it allowed users to also post their pictures to Twitter, piquing the interest of those who saw links to the photos in their feeds.
For most of Instagram's early days, the company consisted of just four employees, including its two co-founders. They worked in what had been the early offices of Twitter in the South Park neighborhood of San Francisco, crammed in with other start-ups.
The walls were painted dark gray and Ikea lamps sat on the ground, lighting an otherwise gloomy ground-floor space that looked almost the same any time of day or night. The team sat in the middle of the room at four desks pushed together to make one large table - though none of the tables lined up quite right. This year, as staff members were added, Instagram moved to a larger office across the street.
In early 2011, Mr. Zuckerberg reached out to Instagram to discuss buying the company, but Mr. Systrom chose to keep it independent and focus on expanding it, two Facebook employees who asked not to be named said last year.
At the time, Instagram had less than seven million users. Now celebrities likeJustin Bieber and brands like Gucci post regular updates.
Not everyone was applauding the acquisition. Soon after the news broke, many Instagram fans began voicing their displeasure on the service and on Twitter and Facebook. Some, like Paul Ahlberg, seemed upset that Facebook would have access to their personal information. ''I liked Instagram when it was stupid pictures and filters, not a Facebook data collector,'' he wrote on Twitter.
Others lamented the loss of what they saw as an alternative to Facebook and threatened to delete their accounts. ''So Facebook just bought Instagram,'' a Twitter user named Robert Wagner wrote. ''In other news, I just quit using Instagram.''
Some fans were concerned about the fate of Instagram, since Facebook has bought several small start-ups to grab their talent and then shut down their original offerings.
But both Mr. Systrom and Mr. Zuckerberg stressed repeatedly in separate blog posts that Facebook planned to keep Instagram up and running as a separate service, at least for the time being.
''It's important to be clear that Instagram is not going away. We'll be working with Facebook to evolve Instagram and build the network,'' wrote Mr. Systrom in a company blog post. Instagram and Facebook executives declined to comment further on Monday.
Though Facebook has tended to write much smaller checks in the past, Instagram's momentum probably compelled Facebook to make a billion-dollar deal. Last week, Instagram closed a roughly $50 million financing round with several investors, including Sequoia Capital, an early backer of Google; Thrive Capital, the firm run by the real estate heir Joshua Kushner; and Greylock Partners, an early investor of LinkedIn.
The financing round valued the photo service at about $500 million, according to one person with knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity because the discussions were private. With Facebook's purchase, one week later, that investment doubled in value. The short time frame may indicate that the deal came together in a matter of days.
Instagram has talked about bringing in revenue by allowing brands to drop sponsored photos into the stream on user's screens, or being paid by brands when users tap to buy something from them, but it has not yet announced any such plans.
Facebook has also been trying to figure out how to make money as people spend more time on smaller screens.
''We really don't know how Facebook will monetize mobile platforms,'' Ms. Lieb said. ''The first step is to make Facebook friendlier on mobile devices, and this will certainly do that.''
Nick Bilton, Somini Sengupta and Evelyn M. Rusli contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Killing Of Police Continues Rising As Violence Falls

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN; Michael S. Schmidt reported from Washington, and Joseph Goldstein from New York. John H. Cushman Jr. contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As violent crime has decreased across the country, a disturbing trend has emerged: rising numbers of police officers are being killed.
According to statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 72 officers were killed by perpetrators in 2011, a 25 percent increase from the previous year and a 75 percent increase from 2008.
The 2011 deaths were the first time that more officers were killed by suspects than car accidents, according to data compiled by the International Association of Chiefs of Police. The number was the highest in nearly two decades, excluding those who died in the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. 
While a majority of officers were killed in smaller cities, 13 were killed in cities of 250,000 or more. New York City lost two officers last year. On Sunday, four were wounded by a gunman in Brooklyn, bringing to eight the number of officers shot in the city since December.
''We haven't seen a period of this type of violence in a long time,'' said Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly of the New York Police Department.
While the F.B.I. and other law enforcement officials cannot fully explain the reasons for the rise in officer homicides, they are clear about the devastating consequences.
''In this law enforcement job, when you pin this badge on and go out on calls, when you leave home, you ain't got a promise that you will come back,'' said Sheriff Ray Foster of Buchanan County, Va. Two of his deputies were killed in March 2011 and two wounded -- one of them paralyzed -- by a man with a high-powered rifle.
''That was 80 percent of my day shift,'' he said.
After a spate of killings in early 2011, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. asked federal authorities to work with local police departments to try to come up with solutions to the problem.
The F.B.I., which has tracked officer deaths since 1937, paid for a study conducted by John Jay College that found that in many cases the officers were trying to arrest or stop a suspect who had previously been arrested for a violent crime.
That prompted the F.B.I. to change what information it will provide to local police departments, the officials said. Starting this year, when police officers stop a car and call its license plate into the F.B.I.'s database, they will be told whether the owner of the vehicle has a violent history. Through the first three months of this year, the number of police fatalities has dropped, though it is unclear why.
Some law enforcement officials believe that techniques pioneered by the New York Police Department over the past two decades and adopted by other departments may have put officers at greater risk by encouraging them to conduct more street stops and to seek out and confront suspects who seem likely to be armed. In New York and elsewhere, police officials moved more officers into crime-ridden areas.
''This technique has become more popular across the country as smaller departments have followed the larger cities and tried to prevent crime,'' said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. ''Unlike several decades ago, there is this expectation that police matter and that police can make a difference.''
Commissioner Kelly said, ''We try to put those officers where there is the most potential for violence.'' However, he pointed out that most of the officers who have been shot in New York since December were not part of a proactive police deployment but were responding to emergencies.
Some argue that the rise in violence is linked to the tough economy. With less money, some states are releasing prisoners earlier; police departments, after years of staffing increases, have been forced to make cutbacks.
''A lot of these killings aren't happening in major urban areas,'' said James W. McMahon, chief of staff for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. ''One of the concerns we are looking at is that a number of officers are being laid off or furloughed or not replaced.''
The police chief in Camden, N.J., J. Scott Thomson, whose force of 400 was cut by nearly half last year because of financing issues, said that having fewer officers on the street ''makes it that much more difficult to create an environment in which criminals do not feel as emboldened to assault another person, let alone a law enforcement officer.''
The murder of a veteran officer last April in Chattanooga, Tenn., was typical of many of the 2011 episodes.
Sgt. Tim Chapin, a veteran nearing retirement, rushed to provide backup to officers who had responded to reports of a robbery outside a pawnshop and were under fire. Sergeant Chapin got out of his car and chased the fleeing suspect, who had been convicted of armed robbery. During the pursuit, the sergeant was fatally shot in the head.
As part of the F.B.I.'s efforts to prevent officer deaths, the bureau trains thousands of officers each year, highlighting shootings like the one in Chattanooga to teach officers about situations in which they are most vulnerable. Those situations are typically pursuits, traffic stops and arrests, said Michelle S. Klimt, a top F.B.I. official at its Criminal Justice Information Services Center in Clarksburg, W.Va., who oversees officer training.
''Every stop can be potentially fatal, so we are trying to make sure the officers are ready and prepared every single day they go out,'' Ms. Klimt said. ''We try and teach that every day you go out, you are going to be encountered with deadly force by someone trying to kill you.''

HEADLINE: Brazil and U.S. Accentuate the Positive

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO and JACKIE CALMES; Simon Romero reported from Rio de Janeiro, and Jackie Calmes from Washington.

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Dilma Rousseff's first visit to Washington as Brazil's president was certainly cordial enough.
She had lunch at the White House on Monday with President Obama. The United States said it was opening two new consulates in Brazil in an effort to lure more free-spending Brazilian tourists. And the two countries even forged an agreement to bolster the trade of cachaca, Brazil's signature sugarcane tipple, and Tennessee whiskey.
But the friendliness belied a sense that the United States, whose once-dominant sway in Latin America is ebbing, and Brazil, the hemisphere's rising power, still do not see eye to eye on a range of important issues, from Middle East diplomacy to trade with Cuba and Brazil's ambitions of obtaining a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. 
''Brazil sees itself as having arrived or close to arriving,'' said Peter Hakim, president emeritus of the Inter-American Dialogue, a research and policy organization in Washington. ''The United States sees Brazil as big, the most important country in Latin America, but not anything like a global power.''
This disconnect was revealed in one account after another in the news media here about the visit, in which commentators lamented the fact that Ms. Rousseff was not received with the pomp of a White House state dinner, recognition granted by the Obama administration to the leaders of South Korea, India and Britain.
''The bilateral reality is far from being a disgrace, despite the points in dispute, but there's a considerable lack of mutual respect,'' Caio Blinder, a columnist for the magazine Veja, said in an essay describing the ''downgrade'' of Ms. Rousseff's visit.
Still, both governments emphasized the positive aspects of Ms. Rousseff's visit, which came a year after Mr. Obama visited Brazil. The level of diplomatic exchanges, sharing of classified military and defense information and overall trade is far more expansive than in some other parts of Latin America, like Venezuela and Ecuador, where relations remain at a low point.
The United States does not have a trade agreement with Brazil, despite reaching such deals with 11 other countries in Latin America, but trade with Brazil, which recently surpassed Britain as the world's sixth-largest economy, is nevertheless thriving.
At one point this year, the United States surpassed China as Brazil's top export market, because of rising purchases of Brazilian oil and manufactured goods. By the end of the first quarter of this year, China regained the top spot, but the relationship is not without problems, with tensions emerging over cheap Chinese imports and land acquisition by Chinese investors.
Meanwhile, the United States had a trade surplus of over $8 billion with Brazil in 2011, reflecting a surge of American exports into Latin America's largest country. Faced with rising land and labor costs, Brazil, a biofuels powerhouse, even imported a record 1.1 billion liters, about 264 million gallons, of ethanol from the United States last year.
But these trade patterns disguise tension. The strength of Brazil's currency, the real, has been a blessing for Brazilians snapping up properties in Miami and New York. At the same, the real's vigor has limited the competitiveness of Brazilian exporters by making their products costlier in foreign markets.
Mr. Obama and Ms. Rousseff met privately for two hours at the White House, and afterward sat in the Oval Office to speak briefly with reporters. Mr. Obama effused about ''the extraordinary progress that Brazil has made under President Rousseff.'' Ms. Rousseff echoed his calls for continued economic cooperation between the countries.
Ms. Rousseff also cited oil and gas production as ''a tremendous opportunity for further cooperation,'' with the United States both supplying equipment and know-how to extract the energy sources, and then buying some of the product. She welcomed the recent American reductions in tariffs on Brazil's ethanol.
Yet the leaders' eyes rarely met, and Ms. Rousseff rarely looked at Mr. Obama as he spoke. He looked intently at her during her remarks, nodding in agreement at times. But he seemed to bristle when she expressed concern that America's ''monetary expansion policy'' could impair growth in emerging economies like Brazil's. Monetary policy is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve; the White House and Congress deal with fiscal policy.
No breakthroughs were revealed regarding Brazil's policies in the Middle East, which seem to have undergone some fine-tuning under Ms. Rousseff from those of her predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who in 2010 tried to forge an ambitious uranium exchange deal with Iran.
While Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, notably bypassed Brazil on a recent tour of Latin America, and Brazil voted recently in the United Nations to censure President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, qualms persist in Brasilia about intervening in Middle East conflicts.
Meanwhile, Washington has been reluctant to explicitly support Brazil's bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council, even after the United States backed India's bid two years ago.
Brazil also supports India's bid and argues that the Security Council should be expanded to include various new members. But Susan E. Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, criticized Brazil, as well as India and South Africa, during their temporary tenures on the Council after they blocked efforts last year to pressure Mr. Assad's government.
Other issues weigh on relations, like a new Florida law targeting companies that do business with Cuba by preventing local governments from hiring them. The law could complicate matters for Odebrecht, one of Brazil's largest construction companies, which is upgrading the Port of Miami at the same time it is building Cuba's Port of Mariel.
Ms. Rousseff will focus on higher education, one of the brightest areas of cooperation between Brazil and the United States, in a visit on Tuesday to Harvard and M.I.T., where she will discuss Science Without Borders, a program that aims to send about 100,000 Brazilians to study at foreign universities. As many as half are expected to study in the United States.
''Science Without Borders will do more to advance relations between the two countries,'' said Mauricio Santoro, a professor of international relations at Fundacao Getulio Vargas, an elite university here, ''than every other diplomatic agreement under discussion.''

HEADLINE: A Rockier Pathway to Work

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of unemployed people are desperate for new skills to pull them back into the job market, but when they visit a job-training center, they are often turned away. As Motoko Rich reported in The Times on Monday, Seattle's seven centers had money to train only 5 percent of the 120,000 people who came in last year seeking new skills, and the numbers are similar elsewhere. 
The reason: drastic cuts to federal spending on training over the last six years, including $1 billion since the 2010 fiscal year. Even though training programs are already harder to get into than Ivy League universities, Republicans in the House want to put them even further out of reach.
Last month, the House passed a 2013 budget written by Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin that would reduce spending in the category of Education, Training, Employment and Social Services by $16 billion from the previous year, or 22 percent, on top of all the cuts forced by Republicans over several years. The cut in that category is typical of a budget that savages precisely the kind of domestic spending, like job training and Pell grants, needed to help people get off social-safety-net programs, while slicing open the net itself, through big reductions in Medicaid and food stamps (all while generously lowering taxes for the rich).
Mr. Ryan lacked the courage to provide the details of how sharply his budget would affect popular programs like job training or state aid to education. That task, he says cynically, will be left to the appropriating committees in Congress. When a critic like President Obama tries to point out which programs will inevitably suffer when a broad category is sharply cut, Mr. Ryan's allies, including Mitt Romney, rush in to claim that no such cut was specified in the budget. They want it both ways: to win support from those who don't care about social programs, without ever having to detail the pain the cuts would cause.
The Ryan budget is quite clear, though, about its intent to go after job-training programs. It cites a 2011 Government Accountability Office report that criticized the government for having 47 overlapping training programs spread across nine agencies and announces plans to consolidate them into a new scholarship program. The report, however, envisioned using the savings from consolidation to train ''hundreds or thousands of additional individuals,'' not using it to pay for tax cuts for the rich.
President Obama has also proposed greater consolidation of training programs, but he wants to spend an additional $2.8 billion a year on these programs. By contrast, last year, the House proposed cutting $2.5 billion, a pretty good indicator of how much it could slash when it puts in the details on this year's budget.
There are six million more unemployed people now than there were in 2006, when the decline in training programs began. Training centers and community colleges are filled to bursting. Mr. Romney, Mr. Ryan and their party have made it clear that giving the unemployed a pathway back to work is an extremely low priority.

HEADLINE: Obama Candidate Sketches Vision for World Bank

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Dr. Jim Yong Kim, the anthropologist and physician who is President Obama's surprise choice to run the World Bank, does not have a detailed public record laying out his views of economic development, the bank's central mission. He is not a development scholar nor, like previous presidents, a banker or foreign policy eminence grise.
But in a wide-ranging interview on Monday, Dr. Kim, currently the president of Dartmouth College, sketched out a vision for the World Bank that would make it more focused on results and would do more to heed the views of the poorer countries that receive its financing.
He also responded to some of the criticism that has greeted his nomination, including concerns about a decade-old book in which he critiqued the bank's development philosophy and questions about whether he has enough experience to manage the bank's global portfolio. 
''World Bank is a bank that's focused on economic development and poverty alleviation,'' Dr. Kim said. ''I've spent my entire life working to invest in human beings and human communities, to help them move down the path of economic development.''
He added: ''Economic development and poverty alleviation are so complicated that I don't think there's a single background or a single discipline that is sufficient to tackle these great human problems.''
Dr. Kim is likely to get the job -- the World Bank's board is expected to make its decision next week -- given the longstanding tradition of Europe's supporting the White House's nomination. But to rally support for his candidacy and to quell some of the criticism -- both of Washington's continued control of the institution and of Dr. Kim's own background -- he is on a ''listening tour'' across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Dr. Kim, who is 52, has devoted his career primarily to eradicating disease and other public health concerns: first as a founder of Partners In Health, a lauded nonprofit organization that runs community-focused programs for the poor; later at Harvard Medical School, where he helped start the Global Health Delivery Project; and at the World Health Organization, where he spearheaded an effort to deliver antiretroviral drugs to millions of people living with H.I.V./AIDS.
Friends and colleagues describe Dr. Kim as a listener and a consensus-builder, a believer that bottom-up strategies often work best. He describes his development philosophy as essentially technocratic, focused on using data to determine which ideas work and which do not.
In 2008, Dr. Kim's reputation in the global health community drew the Dartmouth board to him. Much as his World Bank nomination surprised people, so did the Dartmouth job.
''No one at Harvard expected him to be named the president of a university, nor did he expect it,'' said Albert G. Mulley, the director of the Dartmouth Center for Health Care Delivery Science. ''But Dartmouth wanted someone who had lived their life as if they wanted to do something, rather than be something, and that's Jim.''
He inherited a gaping deficit, a result of the school's endowment plunging to $2.8 billion from $3.7 billion during the financial crisis. Dr. Kim reduced a budget that had already suffered from cuts, a decision that proved divisive among the school's staff, more than 70 of whom lost their jobs. He has also faced some criticism that included a Rolling Stone article completed before the World Bank nomination for not doing more to crack down on abusive behavior at Dartmouth's fraternities.
At least on the budget, he has managed to win over some faculty members. On the fraternities, though, students and professors criticized Dr. Kim for not taking a more direct approach to the problem, instead setting up a committee to examine binge-drinking. For the World Bank, Obama administration officials initially came up with a shortlist of candidates that included Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations; Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat and former presidential nominee, who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; and Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, Harvard president and Obama economic adviser.
But all three would be strong candidates for top government jobs if President Obama won a second term. Moreover, Mr. Obama wanted a hands-on development expert rather than a former banker, senior administration officials said.
Dr. Kim came with a background almost ideally suited to the president's preferences. He had spent much of his career working on some of the most intractable problems in development, and yet he also had experience managing large institutions. His personal narrative -- he was born in an impoverished and war-ravaged Korea -- helped, too.
Some of the criticism surrounding his nomination has focused on whether the United States should continue to retain control of the bank by a decade's old gentlemen's agreement, particularly in light of two widely respected emerging-market candidates, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Nigerian finance minister, and Jose Antonio Ocampo, a native of Colombia and former United Nations official.
But some of the criticism has been more personal. Some aid experts worry about his lack of experience in broader economic development, given that he has focused intently on public health. And one of his scant pieces of public commentary about macroeconomic development directly criticizes the World Bank's approach.
''Dying for Growth,'' which Dr. Kim helped to edit, castigates multilateral institutions that promote economic growth without ensuring that the gains benefit the middle class and the poor.
Dr. Kim said that those concerns were outdated because the World Bank had changed. ''That book was written based on data from the early and mid-1990s,'' he said. ''Our concern was that the vision was not inclusive enough, that it wasn't, in the bank's words, 'pro-poor.' The bank has shifted tremendously since that time, and now the notion of pro-poor development is at the core of the World Bank.''
It remains unclear whether his explanation will sway his critics. Apart from the specific criticisms, the very title of the book takes aim at a core belief among economists, including many at the bank: that economic growth improves lives.
In the interview, Dr. Kim also lauded the bank for shifting away from a ''single big idea'' -- to promote economic growth -- to a more evidence-based ethos that more closely tailors programs for specific communities and problems.
That ethos ''is what I bring as both a physician and an anthropologist,'' he said, citing his careful appraisal of different cultures and focus on numbers and results.
Dr. Kim also said he believed that he had broad enough development experience to run the institution, given that tackling health problems often meant tackling problems with governance or insufficient infrastructure or other issues.
He also stressed his desire to make the bank more inclusive and responsive to global realities -- particularly given that the bulk of the world's poor now live in middle-income countries, not poor ones.
''It is a world bank,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Raising the Floor on Pay

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
As the nation's economy slowly recovers and income inequality emerges as a crucial issue in the presidential campaign, lawmakers are facing growing pressure to raise the minimum wage, which was last increased at the federal level to $7.25 an hour in July 2009.
State legislators in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois and elsewhere are pushing to raise the minimum wage above the federal level in their own states, arguing that $7.25 an hour is too meager for anyone to live on.
Massachusetts lawmakers are pushing for a big jump, with the Legislature's joint committee on labor approving a measure last month that would raise the minimum to $10 an hour, which would leapfrog Washington State, whose $9.04 minimum is the nation's highest.
Voters in Missouri may be asked to vote on a minimum wage referendum in November. 
These moves are giving momentum to an effort to persuade Congress to embrace a higher national minimum wage. Some liberal and labor groups, capitalizing on the energy and message of the Occupy Wall Street movement, are urging Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, to head a Congressional effort to raise the federal minimum to $9.80 an hour by 2014.
Congress last passed a bill to increase minimum wages in 2006, phasing in higher rates over several years. Although some states raise the minimum wage automatically every year as the cost of living increases, federal law does not provides for an automatic increase.
Many Democrats and their labor allies say the time is right to push for another increase, and not just because it is hard to live on the $15,080 a year earned by a person working full time at minimum wage. They say a public debate now over the merits of increasing wages is bound to put many Republicans on the defensive during an election year and would encourage low-income Americans -- an important part of the Democratic base -- to go to the polls this November.
''It's always good to surface an issue that captures voters' enthusiasm and distinguishes the bad guys and the good guys,'' said Jen Kern, minimum wage campaign coordinator at the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers.
The business community is not at all happy about these developments and has warned President Obama, Democratic lawmakers and labor groups that with weak job growth, the time is definitely not right to raise the minimum wage.
''It's a classic election-year ploy to make the Democrats look like they're protecting low-income workers,'' said Randal K. Johnson, senior vice president for labor issues at the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''I think it's well understood that raising the minimum wage hurts workers on the lower end of the pay scale in that it does kill jobs.''
But backers of a higher minimum wage disagree on the economics, pointing to studies that found that an increase in minimum wages did not result in a reduction in jobs. Ms. Kern argued that raising the minimum wage would even stimulate the economy. ''You ask business why they're not hiring. They say it's because no one is buying anything,'' she said. ''Well, a higher minimum wage would give people more money to spend.''
In 2010, 1.8 million hourly workers earned exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, according to federal data. About 2.5 million had wages below the minimum, in part because of exemptions under the law for certain categories of workers like many students.
Analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research organization, suggests that raising the federal minimum wage to $9.80 would lift pay for more than 28 million Americans, increase the gross domestic product by more than $25 billion and create the equivalent of more than 100,000 full-time jobs.
Advocates for a higher wage note that the issue receives strong public support. In a Quinnipiac University poll released last week, 78 percent of New Yorkers polled supported an increase, while 20 percent opposed it. Even Republicans favored an increase, 53 percent to 43 percent.
Ms. Kern's group along with other labor organizations like Interfaith Worker Justice, the Service Employees International Union and Restaurant Opportunities Centers United are mobilizing to press Congress to take action.
Supporters of a higher minimum are urging Mr. Harkin to break out the minimum wage provisions from a broader bill that would bolster workers' positions by strengthening numerous labor and safety laws.
Mr. Harkin said, ''Establishing a reasonable minimum wage is the simplest thing we can do to help hard-working families make ends meet, join the middle class, and help move the economy forward.'' However, he is waiting to attract more support for a wage increase before proposing separate legislation.
Advocates for a higher minimum wage say they are disappointed that President Obama, after supporting an increase in the minimum to $9.50 during the 2008 campaign, has done little to advance the idea since he was elected.
''The Occupy movement put inequality on the radar,'' said Dan Cantor, the executive director of the New York State Working Families Party. ''If we're serious as a society about poverty and work and decency, the minimum wage needs to eventually become a living wage.''
Ms. Kern said Mr. Obama would be smart to champion the idea to mobilize his base, although a top A.F.L.-C.I.O. official said some Democrats in the White House and on Capitol Hill felt uneasy about pushing for a higher minimum wage when the job market was so wobbly.
Mitt Romney, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has called for letting the minimum wage rise with inflation, but has said he sees no need to increase the minimum wage right now.
Isabel Tartaglia, the owner and operator of five American Steakhouse restaurants in Connecticut, said that raising the minimum wage did a disservice to everyone. ''If you raise the minimum wage, what happens is companies, especially small businesses, will not hire any extra people,'' she said. Moreover, ''now that you're raising the costs, restaurants will have to raise the costs of their products.''
In New York, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, is pushing a bill to raise the state's minimum wage, currently $7.25, to $8.50 an hour. Michael R. Bloomberg, the independent mayor of New York City, has endorsed that legislation, although the Republican-led Senate opposes it. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has taken no formal position.
In New Jersey, the Senate and Assembly leaders, both Democrats, support raising the state minimum to $8.50 an hour from $7.25, and Gov. Chris Christie has urged them to sit down with him to discuss the issue.
In Connecticut, the House labor committee voted to approve a bill that would raise that state's minimum, currently $8.25, in two 50-cent increments to $9.25 an hour by 2014. The administration of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has expressed concerns about the bill but has not said he will oppose it.
Jack Mozloom, a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business, an advocacy group for small businesses, said: ''On this issue, our members tell us overwhelmingly everywhere they hate it.''
''It's interesting that the Democratic governors of New York and Connecticut are ambivalent, even cool to the idea,'' Mr. Mozloom said. ''They seem reluctant to create an additional burden for small businesses in their state.''

HEADLINE: The Campaign Shifts to the General Election

 BODY:
With Mitt Romney now more than halfway toward the 1,144 delegates needed for the Republican nomination, and President Obama directly engaging him on the campaign trail, the battle lines for the general election are coming into view. Twelve states will probably be the main 2012 battlegrounds, and the candidates' weapons will be the depth of their financial support, as well as strong messages about their own candidacies and more skeptical portrayals of their opponents. More political coverage, nytimes.com/politics 
Obama, According to Romney
Romney's Words Last Week
''In over three years, he has failed to enact or even propose a serious plan to solve our entitlement crisis. Unlike President Obama, I have the courage to stand behind my plan and the leadership to enact it.''
''A couple of months ago, we saw a fascinating exchange on Capitol Hill that epitomized not only this administration's inaction on entitlements, but also its appalling lack of leadership.''
''I presented a detailed plan for jobs and economic growth, including 59 different proposals. I understand some people are amused that I have so many ideas. But I think the American people will prefer it to President Obama's grand total of zero.''
''In Barack Obama's government-centered society, the government has to do more because the economy is doomed to do less, because when you attack business and you vilify success, you are going to have less business and less success.''
Romney, According to Obama
Obama Campaign's Words
Flip Flopper
''They think they can just wipe the slate clean. That their words don't mean anything, that the positions they've taken don't mean anything, that they can have a do over.'' -- DAVID AXELROD, chief campaign strategist
Out of Touch
''I can't remember a presidential candidate in the recent past who seems not to understand by what he says what ordinary middle-class people are thinking about and are concerned about.'' -- VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
Lacking Courage
''If you don't have the strength to stand up to the most strident voices in your party, how are you going to stand up to Ahmadinejad, how are you going to stand up to the challenges of the presidency.'' -- MR. AXELROD
Survival of the Fittest
''...this is really the Romney-Ryan plan. It will be rubber stamped if Mitt Romney is elected president. ... It showers huge tax cuts on millionaires and billionaires paid for by seniors and veterans.'' -- DAVID PLOUFFE, a senior adviser

HEADLINE: A Shift in Strategy in Pennsylvania for Romney

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; Trip Gabriel reported from New York, and Katharine Q. Seelye from Bedford, Pa.

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's attempt to pull off a victory in Rick Santorum's home state of Pennsylvania was all set to go into overdrive Monday with attack ads highlighting how voters there soundly rejected him in his 2006 Senate race.
But the aggressive tactics that have served Mr. Romney so well in other states faced an unexpected complication: the emergency hospitalization of Mr. Santorum's disabled daughter Bella, which prompted an outpouring of public sympathy. 
The Romney camp abruptly pulled the ads on Monday morning. Bella, 3, who was born with a rare chromosomal disorder, was expected to return home soon to Virginia from the hospital, the Santorum campaign said. Her medical struggles, which in some ways have become the emotional centerpiece of Mr. Santorum's race, have the potential to complicate Mr. Romney's effort to quickly end the Republican nominating fight.
''The family has been humbled and overwhelmed by the amount of support they've received,'' said a spokesman for Mr. Santorum's campaign, Hogan Gidley, citing thousands of comments on the candidate's Facebook page and e-mailed ''prayer chains.''
Mr. Santorum's decision to cancel campaign events to be with his daughter after she was hospitalized on Friday with pneumonia -- her second bout since January -- intensified speculation that he would choose the moment to exit the race gracefully, as a chorus of Republican leaders have urged for the sake of party unity.
But Mr. Gidley doused that notion. Mr. Santorum planned to return to campaigning in the south-central Pennsylvania town of Bedford with a rally on Tuesday.
''The fact is, there is still a narrow path, but a path nonetheless, for Rick Santorum to become the nominee, and the Romney campaign knows it or they wouldn't be sending people all over Pennsylvania and Texas to prevent it,'' Mr. Gidley said.
The ad the Romney campaign pulled, after it ran at least 11 times in the Philadelphia media market, according to Kantar Media's campaign media analysis group, bluntly addressed Pennsylvania voters: ''We fired him as senator. Why promote him to president?''
The Romney campaign substituted a positive ad ''out of deference'' to Mr. Santorum, a spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, said.
Once Bella is released from the hospital, the Romney campaign is expected to put the anti-Santorum ad back into its rotation, although that could take a day or two. The Romney campaign has planned a $2.9 million barrage of advertising over the next two weeks in Pennsylvania, which Mr. Santorum has called a must-win contest, although polls show him losing ground.
Jim Roddey, chairman of the Republican Committee of Allegheny County, who has endorsed Mr. Romney, said the campaign probably would conduct polling to see whether Bella's hospitalization remained a sensitive issue. But, he said, sympathy for Bella would probably not bring Mr. Santorum any new votes, nor would it deter the Romney camp from full-throated attacks on Mr. Santorum.
''He's still not talking about the kinds of things most people are most concerned about, jobs and the economy.''
Bella, who was born with trisomy 18, a rare disorder that is fatal to most of children within their first year, has become a touchstone for Mr. Santorum, both humanizing him and serving as flashpoint for debate over health care with President Obama.
Mr. Santorum mentions her at almost every appearance, sometimes explaining that his wife is not at his side because she is home caring for her, and sometimes, especially in churches, telling of how when Bella was born, doctors sent her home to die because her disorder was ''incompatible with life.''
''It angered us to hear that,'' Mr. Santorum explains in a video on his campaign Web site. ''She was our daughter like every one of our children and we were not going to let her go.''
While many voters find Mr. Santorum's brand of social conservatism and his speaking style off-putting, it is clear at rallies that Bella softens him. Audiences listen raptly to his descriptions, sometimes wiping away tears.
Trisomy 18 results in stillbirth for about half the babies carried to term, and 90 percent of children die before their first birthday, said Dr. Robert Marion, chief of genetics and developmental medicine at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.
After the first birthday the survival odds increase, he said, although pneumonia is a common cause of hospitalization because trisomy 18 children often have congenital heart diseases that cause fluid to build up in the lungs, causing infections. The condition has become rarer in the past 25 years, Dr. Marion said, ''because people are diagnosing it prenatally and terminating the pregnancies more often now.''
That is one of the reasons Mr. Santorum cites Bella in his campaign -- an embodiment of his respect for the sanctity of life and a reason he opposes Mr. Obama's health care overhaul. He opposes its requirement that insurance plans cover prenatal screenings, principally amniocentesis, which he said are used to ''cull'' fetuses with birth defects.
The procedures ''are done by and large to find out late in pregnancy whether the child in the womb has a disability,'' Mr. Santorum said in Ohio in February.
''And as we all know, 90 percent of Down syndrome children in this country are aborted once the mother and father find out that child is going to be less than what they were expecting.''
He also maintained that the 2010 health care law, because it was designed in part to slow runaway costs, would lead to ''a brave new world'' in which doctors are pressured to ration care, and disabled children like his daughter would be denied care.
Dr. Marion, whose program sees about 7,500 children a year with developmental disabilities, said most health insurance does not cover many services the children need and that currently ''the government has washed their hands'' and there is no public financing for them either.
''It's not a matter of these kids being squeezed because there's pressure on the person providing the care,'' he said. ''What happens is we're going to have to turn away some kids with trisomy 18 because there's nobody to pay for it.''

HEADLINE: Let's Keep Our Hands Off the Emergency Oil Supply

BYLINE: By JAMES L. JONES and JASON S. GRUMET. 
James L. Jones, a former national security adviser to President Obama and a retired Marine Corps general, is a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Jason S. Grumet is president of the Bipartisan Policy Center.

 BODY:
AS oil and gasoline prices rise, political pressure to tap the roughly 700 million barrels in the national Strategic Petroleum Reserve is building, including among some in Congress. The global oil market is fundamentally strained and suffering from an array of unwelcome but unremarkable problems. Yet the oil reserve is neither designed nor well equipped to address these chronic weaknesses. Instead it should be preserved to address an emergency disruption in supply.
While no one can confidently predict the global oil market, arguments that prices will remain high throughout the year seem at least as compelling as the more optimistic alternative. Global supplies are tight, and the hope for an improving global economy will only increase demand. Historically, Saudi Arabia has maintained a cushion of spare production capacity of about 5 percent of global daily supply. This spare capacity has played a critical role in calming the market when instability threatens oil-producing nations. That spare capacity is now likely to be only 3 percent, which will make it more difficult for Saudi Arabia to increase production on short notice. 
The past year of unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has not resulted in any major supply disruptions, but roughly 1 percent of global production has come off the market because of diminished production in Sudan, Yemen and Syria, and the growing impact of United States and European sanctions on Iranian production. If successful, President Obama's recent decision to press forward with more aggressive sanctions will put pressure on Iran and strain global oil markets further. Indeed, increased international cooperation in putting the sanctions into effect is good news in the effort to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear capability.
Iran's total production is now about 3.4 million barrels per day, of which 2 million barrels per day are exported. The United States Energy Information Administration predicts that the tougher sanctions scheduled to take effect this summer could cut demand for Iranian oil exports in half. This combination of circumstances, however, does not yet constitute a severe supply disruption. Using the reserve now would be premature, reduce our national security options and perhaps even undermine the goal of calming oil markets.
Since its inception in 1975, the oil reserve has been drawn upon under two types of circumstances. There have been a variety of minor withdrawals unrelated to global market disruptions, including test sales, exchanges to address minor domestic supply interruptions and even sales in 1996 and 1997 to raise $220 million to balance the federal budget.
The oil reserve has also been employed three times to address global supply disruptions -- during the first Iraq war, after Hurricane Katrina, and last year, when President Obama authorized the release of 30 million barrels in response to the withdrawal of Libyan oil during that country's civil war. In each instance, the releases were coordinated internationally, through the International Energy Agency, with some oil offered by the European Union, the United States and other non-OPEC nations. Each of these emergency releases sought to remedy a discrete supply reduction and none offer a precedent for a release under the current circumstances.
While the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not an effective tool to address the present circumstances, the president and Congress must take more strategic and lasting action to protect the public and the economy from the effects of $100-a-barrel oil and $4-a-gallon gasoline. Despite the traditional election-year rancor, there is actually considerable bipartisan agreement on what needs to be done. Increasing domestic oil production is extremely important to our economy and to reducing our trade deficit.
The United States is the third largest oil producer in the world and United States production must continue to play a critical role in meeting global demand. That production is projected to grow by more than 1 million barrels a day by 2020. If this increase is achieved, the American contribution to the global market will push down global prices and could enable some increase in global spare capacity.
The Obama administration should continue to accelerate efforts to open new areas for production and encourage efforts to construct the distribution infrastructure needed to support increased production. However, no amount of production can insulate the United States from the global market and global price spikes.
The ability to protect our economy from oil price shocks is determined primarily by the amount of oil we use compared to the size of our economy. In 1975, our economy used 1.2 barrels of oil for every $1,000 of gross domestic product (2005 dollars); in 2010, we used only half a barrel of oil for the same amount of G.D.P. This reduction was achieved by moving away from oil in the production of electricity and by substantial increases in fuel economy.
A diversified energy sector and highly efficient vehicles are strategies supported by a vast majority of Congress. While it is certain that we will continue to rely on oil for decades, there is considerable support in both parties for efforts to diversify transportation fuels through research and development and the deployment of biofuels, electric and natural gas vehicles. All of these actions will continue to increase the oil-efficiency and resiliency of the United States economy.
For four decades, the emergency role of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to specifically address large supply disruptions has been a subject of national consensus. We must protect this critical component of our national and economic security and accelerate efforts to protect consumers and the economy from future volatility in the oil markets.

HEADLINE: America Is Eating Its Poor

BYLINE: INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE


HIGHLIGHT: As the U.S. economy worsened, fewer poor families received government checks. Is the European risk of long-term dependency worth assuring a minimum quality of life for everyone in a society? Or is the limited American system better? 

 BODY:
When Rendezvous wrote about Europe's "lost generation" of unemployed young people - and what their lot in life will mean for Europe's future - many RDV readers voiced their concerns about the overall decline of The West. Wrote Ian Walthew in France:
Any OECD society, of any political stripe, of any amount of income disparity, is going to be faced with growing social unrest for as long as the following factors remain on the table:
a) rigid labour laws concerning hiring and firing;
b) undignified minimum wage laws;
c) lack of universal healthcare;
d) failure to tax unearned investment income in the same way as earned income;
e) unequal access to higher education;
f) failing schools.
Point A is a job creation killer.
Points B-F are a recipe for revolution
Some readers commented that the United States is no better than Europe, even if its youth employment numbers look better than many European or EU economies. 
"Are we talking about Europe or the US?" asked Frederick from Orlando, Florida.
"America has already eaten many of its young people and is quietly digesting them within its prisons!" said julianzzz in Manchester, UK.
This weekend, our colleague Jason DeParle wrote a long piece on the front page of The New York Times investigating just how bad things are in the United States - not for young people but for poor people, who happen to be disproportionately young and very young. 
Despite the worst economic situation since The Great Depression, because of vast changes to the public assistance system during the Clinton administration, the number of poor people receiving cash subsidies from the U.S. government is the lowest in decades. 
"Just one in five poor children now receives cash aid, the lowest level in nearly 50 years," Jason wrote.
The number of very poor families appears to be growing. Pamela Loprest and Austin Nichols, researchers at the Urban Institute, found that one in four low-income single mothers nationwide - about 1.5 million - are jobless and without cash aid. That is twice the rate the researchers found under the old welfare law. More than 40 percent remain that way for more than a year, and many have mental or physical disabilities, sick children or problems with domestic violence. 
Using a different definition of distress, Luke Shaefer of the University of Michigan and Kathryn Edin of Harvard examined the share of households with children in a given month living on less than $2 per person per day. It has nearly doubled since 1996, to almost 4 percent. Even when counting food stamps as cash, they found one of every 50 children live in such a household.
The American social welfare system is far less generous than Continental Europe's and even Britain's - that American cousin often lumped in when the French disparage "savage capitalism." 
(The British have universal health care and amounts of public housing that are unfanthomable in the United States. Assured lodging and health care, plus more generous cash benefits make Britain look much more like Europe than America.)
In the nearly 700 comments generated by Jason's piece before the Times closed the comments, many readers - mostly Americans - lamented their country's indifference to its citizens' suffering. On the other side, many readers said they did not see why U.S. taxpayers should foot the bill for other people having children they could not afford to take care of. 
Where do you stand? Is the European risk of long-term dependency an acceptable trade for assuring a minimum quality of life for everyone in a society? Or is the American system, despite its flaws, one where the dignity of work is placed front and center and no one is coddled? Or do you think the United States is headed the way of China: little government safety net and a reliance on family and community to care for the poor instead?

HEADLINE: How to Really Simplify the Tax Code

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Trying to eliminate popular tax deductions is not worth the time and is not a substitute for a complete overhaul that would simplify the tax code, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
This week millions of Americans will be rushing to calculate and file their income taxes - and probably cursing whoever invented this confusing, complicated monstrosity. 
Many people will spend money on accountants, tax software or storefront tax-preparation services. The cost in terms of time alone runs to the tens of billions of dollars, with billions more spent out of pocket. The aggravation factor is beyond calculation.
Politicians often rail against the complexity of the tax system as the key source of taxpayer frustration. Historically, however, voters have been unwilling to support meaningful simplification efforts and happily put up with complexity if it saves them in taxes. They seem always to fear that "simplification" is some sort of code word for raising their taxes while reducing someone else's.
Another barrier to simplification is a loss of privacy. In 2003, the Treasury Department put forward a proposal to create a return-free tax system for most taxpayers, as many other countries have. In essence, the Internal Revenue Service would calculate your taxes for you and send you a bill or a refund.

The Treasury proposal went nowhere, for two reasons. 
First, reporting of income and tax withholding would have to increase to provide the I.R.S. with the data needed to accurately calculate people's taxes. But people have been highly resistant to additional withholding; a law requiring it on interest income was enacted in 1982 but almost immediately repealed after widespread complaints. 
The second problem is that the tax system would have to be radically simplified to allow the return-free system to operate.
Radical simplification sounds nice in theory; just wipe the slate clean and start from scratch, many people believe. Two years ago, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, co-chairmen of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, put forward exactly such a plan. 
It would eliminate every single deduction, exclusion and credit in the tax code, which economists call "tax expenditures," and sharply reduce tax rates to three brackets of 8, 14 and 23 percent.
The current rate structure has six brackets: 10, 15, 25, 28, 33 and 35 percent, with a 39.6 percent bracket scheduled to reappear next year. The Tax Policy Center estimates that individual tax expenditures will reduce federal revenues by $942 billion this year, while all tax expenditures, including those on the corporate side, cost $1.3 trillion.
While the Simpson-Bowles proposal continues to intrigue some people, support proved nonexistent when it was finally brought up for a vote on March 28. The entire Simpson-Bowles plan, including huge budget cuts, received only 38 votes in the House of Representatives. The New York Times reported that it was opposed by both conservative and liberal groups for various reasons.
Even if the tax side of Simpson-Bowles had been considered separately, I doubt it would have done any better. Talk is cheap when it comes to eliminating tax expenditures, but when it comes to actually naming specific preferences that would be eliminated, few are willing to step up to the plate. 
Politicians hide behind grandiose plans for wiping the slate clean because they know that support for every specific tax expenditure is very high. In practice, saying that one would eliminate all tax expenditures is meaningless, nothing more than a gesture that avoids confrontation with the constituencies supporting tax expenditures.
Perhaps the worst offender, in this regard, is Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, who promises a sharp reduction in tax rates while still balancing the budget. He says that his tax cuts, which would reduce revenues by $10 trillion over the next decade over current law, according to the Tax Policy Center, would be paid for with base-broadening and loophole-closing. 
But Mr. Ryan steadfastly refuses to name a single loophole that he would eliminate; he ordered the Congressional Budget Office to assume that federal revenues would rise to 19 percent of gross domestic product from 15.5 percent by 2030 under his plan.
Mr. Ryan's political calculation is simple. He knows that taking away the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance would greatly increase its cost and probably cause most businesses to drop coverage; repealing the mortgage-interest deduction would raise the cost of housing for homeowners and would very likely cause a further drop in home prices; abolishing the charitable-contributions deduction would decimate churches, universities, museums and every other tax-exempt organization; and rescinding the deduction for state and local taxes would vastly raise the tax burden in most states.
Mr. Ryan knows perfectly well that the most popular tax expenditures will never be repealed but pretends that they all will in order to make his phony-baloney numbers add up. The fact is that the vast bulk of tax expenditures, in dollar terms, are immensely popular and deeply imbedded in the economy and society. 
A recent study by the Congressional Research Service concluded that it would be extraordinarily difficult to get rid of 90 percent of tax expenditures, leaving at most perhaps $100 billion to $150 billion of revenue that could realistically be realized to finance rate reductions.
So how do we get out of this mess? One idea is to do what Gen. Douglas MacArthur did during World War II - bypass enemy strongholds, leaving them isolated and relatively harmless.
Prof. Michael Graetz of Columbia Law School has proposed what I believe is a MacArthur-like solution to tax reform. He would abolish the income tax for the vast bulk of Americans and replace the revenue with a 12.5 percent value-added tax. People would pay their taxes when they buy things and wouldn't need to worry about keeping records or filing tax returns at all.
The brilliance of the Graetz plan is that no tax expenditures need to be repealed. He would simply give every family a tax exemption of $100,000, which would eliminate the income tax for 90 percent of those now filing returns. For lower-income people who currently have no net income tax burden or who earn an income tax credit, Professor Graetz proposes a rebate (too complex in its details to spell out here). 
The current income tax would be retained with a top rate of 20 percent to 25 percent only for those with incomes above $100,000. But many of them already lose important tax preferences because the mortgage-interest deduction is capped for homes worth more than $1 million under current law and the alternative minimum tax already takes away the deduction for state and local taxes for those in high-tax states like New York.
Professor Graetz first laid out his plan in a 2002 Yale Law Journal article, which was expanded into a book in 2007, "100 Million Unnecessary Returns." A popular explanation of his plan appeared in the November/December issue of The American Interest, and a detailed analysis by the Tax Policy Center was published in January.
There are many other aspects of the Graetz plan too complex to discuss here. The important thing is the basic idea of avoiding a frontal assault on tax expenditures that is likely to make trench warfare seem tame by comparison and instead just make them irrelevant to the vast majority of Americans. 
I think this is a viable proposal that ought to be the starting point for a real debate on tax reform.

A Costly Toy Subsidized by Others | The winning bid for the Los Angeles Dodgers was led by Mark Walter and his firm, Guggenheim Partners, which most people in sports - and frankly, even on Wall Street - know very little about, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column.
A quick background check and some back-of-the-envelope math raises an obvious red flag: how on earth can this group of individuals afford to pay $2 billion in cash? The answer is that they probably can't - at least, not by themselves.
Mr. Walter, along with his colleague Todd Boehly, Guggenheim's president, appear to be living out a childhood fantasy using other people's money, some of whom may not even realize it. In addition to their own cash, Mr. Walter plans to use money from Guggenheim subsidiaries that are insurance companies - some state-regulated - to pay for a big chunk of his purchase of the Dodgers. Guggenheim controls Guggenheim Life, a life insurer, and Security Benefit, which manages some $30 billion, among others.

Despite Good Health, Bank Holds Tight to TARP Funds | It's the bank bailout mystery. M&T Bank performed solidly during the financial crisis. Now, in the aftermath, the lender isn't cutting dividends or selling shares to bolster capital, in contrast to regional bank peers. And M&T's stock has traded with a relatively high valuation, illustrating investors' faith in the bank.
Yet M&T, which is based in Buffalo, finds itself in the company of financial sector slackers - those banks that have yet to fully pay back the bailout money they received as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. While M&T redeemed $700 million of the government's preferred shares, it still owes taxpayers $382 million.
So why is M&T still hanging onto taxpayer money?

HEADLINE: For Job Seekers, a Fracking Fair

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: An event in Broome County, N.Y., will highlight the economic opportunities that natural gas development offers, including jobs for engineers, land surveyors, mechanics, welders, and wildlife and wetland specialists 

 BODY:
Undeterred by New York State's delays in deciding whether to allow fracking for natural gas, Broome County Community College, a business group and a coalition of landowners are holding a "career and education expo" on Wednesday for residents interested in learning about jobs in the gas industry.
Susan Oliver, a spokeswoman for the Joint Landowners Coalition of New York, a group representing those who plan to lease their lands to gas companies for drilling, said the event would highlight the economic opportunities that natural gas development opens up, including jobs for engineers, land surveyors, mechanics, welders, and wildlife and wetlands specialists. It is to be held from 3 to 7 p.m. at the college, in Binghamton, N.Y., and there is no admission charge.
Broome County is in the southern tier region bordering Pennsylvania, which expected to be the epicenter of drilling in New York State. Environmental regulators have spent years examining the controversial hydraulic fracturing or fracking process, which uses high volumes of water to extract gas, and the state has yet to give the go-ahead for the drilling.
While opponents emphasize that drilling poses major environmental risks, supporters say it will give the area a significant economic boost. The job expo is also sponsored by Broome-Tioga Workforce New York, a partnership of government and businesses in Broome and Tioga Counties that offers employment services. The community college is developing a curriculum centered on natural gas development.
Janet M. Hertzog, director of work force development at the community college, said the curriculum will start in June with a certification program for "roustabouts," as the general laborers who assist on well pads are called, that includes 133 hours of intensive training. She said the college, which will hold the training at the Broome-Tioga Board of Cooperative Educational Services in Binghamton, is considering training for other specialties like production technician, welder and truck driver.
Ms. Hertzog noted that while New York is deciding about fracking, Pennsylvania already offers the jobs.
"We have a high unemployment rate in our area and for us, it's all about providing training to get jobs, whether in New York or Pennsylvania," she said.

TOP STORIES
A Costly Toy Subsidized by Others | The winning bid for the Los Angeles Dodgers was led by Mark Walter and his firm, Guggenheim Partners, which most people in sports - and frankly, even on Wall Street - know very little about, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column.
A quick background check and some back-of-the-envelope math raises an obvious red flag: how on earth can this group of individuals afford to pay $2 billion in cash? The answer is that they probably can't, at least not by themselves.
Mr. Walter, along with his colleague Todd Boehly, Guggenheim's president, appear to be living out a childhood fantasy using other people's money, some of whom may not even realize it. In addition to their own cash, Mr. Walter plans to use money from Guggenheim subsidiaries that are insurance companies - some state-regulated - to pay for a big chunk of the Dodgers purchase. Guggenheim controls Guggenheim Life, a life insurer, and Security Benefit, which manages some $30 billion, among others. DealBook 
Despite Good Health, Bank Holds Tight to TARP Funds | It's the bank bailout mystery. M&T Bank performed solidly during the financial crisis. Now, in the aftermath, the lender is not cutting dividends or selling shares to bolster capital, in contrast to regional bank peers. And M&T's stock has traded with a relatively high valuation, illustrating investor faith in the bank.
Yet M&T, which is based in Buffalo, finds itself in the company of financial sector slackers - those banks that have yet to fully pay back the bailout money they received as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. While M&T redeemed $700 million of the government's preferred shares, it still owes taxpayers $382 million.
So why is M&T still hanging onto taxpayer money? DealBook

HEADLINE: Utah Breach Shows Vulnerability of Health Records

BYLINE: NICOLE PERLROTH


HIGHLIGHT: As banks step up their security measures, health providers and retailers have become a more prevalent target for hackers. A breach in Utah is a case in point. 

 BODY:
Eastern European hackers have stolen personal records for 780,000 people in the breach of a computer server in Utah. 
The list of victims include recipients of Medicaid and a health care program for low-income children in Utah, officials at Utah's Department of Health said in a statement. Hackers were able to breach the servers by exploiting a technician's weak password. On March 30, they downloaded 24,000 files to computers in Eastern Europe. Each file contained records for hundreds of recipients. 
Utah's Department of Health has updated the number of victims three times. It initially said 24,000 people were affected but by Monday evening, the list had expanded to include 780,000. Of those, the department said 280,000 had their Social Security numbers stolen, according to the revised statement. 
Some security experts said the breach pointed to a problem with the way personal records were increasingly stored in bulk. 
"Why do we continue to see these large aggregate databases?" Eddie Schwartz, chief information security officer at the computer security firm RSA, said in an interview on Tuesday. "Why should hackers be able to steal 10 million credit card numbers or 700,000 personal records at once? We need to think about distributing that information so that when networks do get penetrated, we're not looking an all-or-nothing situation."

In this case, officials at Utah's Department of Health said they had recently moved claim records to a new server. Despite several layers of security in place, they said hackers were able to bypass the system because a technician configured the server with a weak password. The department said it has since shut down the server, put new security measures in place and was inspecting other servers across the state. 
As banks step up their security measures, health providers and retailers have become a more prevalent target for hackers, security experts note. The same day hackers infiltrated the server in Utah, for instance, reports surfaced that another group of hackers had pilfered information for as many as three million credit card accounts in an attack on Global Payments, an Atlanta company that processes payments for retailers. According to sources briefed on the investigation, the breach marked the second time the payment processor had been attacked in the last year.
Security experts said health and insurance records were also becoming a target for hackers because personal information, like the kind stored by Utah's Department of Health, could fetch a higher price on the black market than a single credit card record. 
"Credit cards have a much lower per-unit-value compared to identities which have a much higher per-unit-value on the black market," Mr. Schwartz said. 
Child records, in particular, are valuable to criminals because their lack of a credit report or bank account makes it difficult to monitor them for identity theft. Their identity can be exploited for years before it is uncovered. According to AllClear ID, a company that offers identity protection services, some 10 percent of children in the United States have had their identity stolen. 
Utah's Department of Health said it was cooperating with the F.B.I. on its breach and working to notify victims, with priority given to those whose Social Security numbers were stolen. The department said it would provide free credit monitoring to those victims. 
It suggested that Utah's Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Plan recipients, as well as anyone whose health-care provider might have submitted information to the state for Medicaid coverage within the last four months, monitor their credit and bank accounts.

HIGHLIGHT: A collection of links from the reporters and editors of the Dining section. 

 BODY:
Bloomberg: The United States has agreed to formally recognize cachaa as a distinctly Brazilian spirit. Since 2000, Brazil has had to label its native liquor-which is distilled from sugar cane juice-as "Brazilian rum," a label that has irked some cachaa producers. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau will begin the process by publishing notice of the proposed change and soliciting comment. Should the measure go through, Brazil will also extend official recognition of America's bourbon and Tennessee whiskey. -- Robert Simonson
The New Yorker: The researcher Maksin Syrnikov, a self-appointed guardian of authentic Russian fare, is trying to rekindle respect for classic Russian cooking -- and original agrarian food -- in a nation long obsessed with French, Italian and Japanese cuisine. He points out that borscht is actually Ukrainian. And potatoes? An import from the Americas. -- Glenn Collins

The Daily Beast: A charge that last year when television's Dr. Phil McGraw initially touted a weight-loss book, "The 17 Day Diet" -- making it into a best seller -- he didn't disclose that his son Jay, a producer of his show, had a financial interest in the book. A legal scholar says that could be a violation of Federal Trade Commission law. Dr. Phil insists he didn't receive payments from the publisher. -- Glenn Collins

The New York Times: The economics of matzo, or how you manage to stay in business selling "something that about 2 percent of the U.S. population has to buy for one week a year but isn't all that popular at any other time or with any other group." -- Patrick Farrell

HIGHLIGHT: A collection of links from the reporters and editors of the Dining section. 

 BODY:
Bloomberg: The United States has agreed to formally recognize cachaa as a distinctly Brazilian spirit. Since 2000, Brazil has had to label its native liquor-which is distilled from sugar cane juice-as "Brazilian rum," a label that has irked some cachaa producers. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau will begin the process by publishing notice of the proposed change and soliciting comment. Should the measure go through, Brazil will also extend official recognition of America's bourbon and Tennessee whiskey. -- Robert Simonson
The New Yorker: The researcher Maksin Syrnikov, a self-appointed guardian of authentic Russian fare, is trying to rekindle respect for classic Russian cooking -- and original agrarian food -- in a nation long obsessed with French, Italian and Japanese cuisine. He points out that borscht is actually Ukrainian. And potatoes? An import from the Americas. -- Glenn Collins 
Julia della Croce: The ultimate in literary food porn: photos of a day spent cooking with the Duchess of Palma in her Sicilian palazzo. Click to find the connection to "Il Gattopardo," the great novel of the end of European aristocracy. -- Julia Moskin
The New York Times: Frank Bruni on Craig Claiborne, marking the 50th anniversary of Claiborne's first restaurant review for The Times and the coming publication of the first serious biography of him. -- Eric Asimov 
Grist: A major objection to pink slime -- beyond its disgusting name -- is the ammonia used to disinfect it. But here are 10 foods that may contain even more ammonia, starting with cheese, salami, peanut butter, mayonnaise and ketchup. ...
: ... And while you're sneering at that Twinkie, here are eight foods that contain more sugar -- including yogurt, canned tomato sauce and fat-free salad dressing. -- Patrick Farrell 
The Daily Beast: A charge that last year when television's Dr. Phil McGraw initially touted a weight-loss book, "The 17 Day Diet" -- making it into a best seller -- he didn't disclose that his son Jay, a producer of his show, had a financial interest in the book. A legal scholar says that could be a violation of Federal Trade Commission law. Dr. Phil insists he didn't receive payments from the publisher. -- Glenn Collins 
Afar: In Hoi An, a deep dive into a bowl of one of Vietnam's great noodle soups, cao lau. -- Julia Moskin
: Ruth Reichl spills the beans on how to make great hummus -- and how not to use it: "The first time you meet it you experience an almost irresistible desire to slather it on your body." -- Patrick Farrell 
: American syrah is at its best, Jon Bonn says, when grown in cool climates like the Sonoma Coast. -- Eric Asimov
The New York Times: The economics of matzo, or how you manage to stay in business selling "something that about 2 percent of the U.S. population has to buy for one week a year but isn't all that popular at any other time or with any other group." -- Patrick Farrell 
GQ: Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare tops Alan Richman's list of the 10 New York restaurants, followed by Le Bernardin, Corton and Eleven Madison Park. And despite the serious prices, he defends fine dining as "shockingly democratic, not elitist at all." (Via Grub Street) -- Patrick Farrell

HEADLINE: Christie the Cannibilizer

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The true story of the tunnel. 

 BODY:
An important report in the Times about Governor Yells-at-people:
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey exaggerated when he declared that unforeseen costs to the state were forcing him to cancel the new train tunnel planned to relieve congested routes across the Hudson River, according to a long-awaited report by independent Congressional investigators.
The report by the Government Accountability Office, to be released this week, found that while Mr. Christie said that state transportation officials had revised cost estimates for the tunnel to at least $11 billion and potentially more than $14 billion, the range of estimates had in fact remained unchanged in the two years before he announced in 2010 that he was shutting down the project. And state transportation officials, the report says, had said the cost would be no more than $10 billion.
Mr. Christie also misstated New Jersey's share of the costs: he said the state would pay 70 percent of the project; the report found that New Jersey was paying 14.4 percent. And while the governor said that an agreement with the federal government would require the state to pay all cost overruns, the report found that there was no final agreement, and that the federal government had made several offers to share those costs.
Canceling the tunnel, then the largest public works project in the nation, helped shape Mr. Christie's profile as a rising Republican star, an enforcer of fiscal discipline in a country drunk on debt. But the report is likely to revive criticism that his decision, which he said was about "hard choices" in tough economic times, was more about avoiding the need to raise the state's gasoline tax, which would have violated a campaign promise. The governor subsequently steered $4 billion earmarked for the tunnel to the state's near-bankrupt transportation trust fund, traditionally financed by the gasoline tax. 
More on this when the full GAO report is public. But one thing to emphasize here is that this turns Christie's whole narrative on its head. He poses as the tough guy willing to make hard choices to secure his state's future. Instead, he turns out to be a guy willing to eat the state's seed corn -- as one of the critics quoted in the article says, to "cannibilize" a project essential to the state's future -- so as to secure a short-term political advantage.
This fits a broader pattern: in general, the politicians who make the loudest noise about taking care of future generations, taking the long view, etc., are the ones who are in fact most irresponsible about public investments, both in infrastructure and in human issues like child health and nutrition.
And public investment really, really has been lagging. Here's real public and private investment since 1995, when the data start:

HEADLINE: Teenage Birthrates at Record Low

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Births to mothers 15 to 19 years old are at their lowest levels in the United States since at least 1940, when the government began keeping track. 

 BODY:
Despite (or because of?) the popularity of shows like "Teen Mom" and "16 and Pregnant," teenage birthrates are at record lows in the United States.
The teenage birthrate fell to 34.3 births per 1,000 women 15 to 19 years old in 2010, the lowest rate at least since the government began keeping track in 1940, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The rate has been falling relatively steadily since the early 1990s, and is now just over half the level it was in 1991. The report estimates that if the 1991 rate had stayed steady over the last two decades, the country would have seen an additional 3.4 million babies born to teenagers in that time.
Still, as Motoko Rich wrote last week, the United States continues to have higher teenage birthrates than many of its peers.
The individual American states also vary tremendously on this measure, from a low of 15.7 births per 1,000 women ages 15 to 19 in New Hampshire, to 55 in Mississippi.

HEADLINE: On a New Web Site, 'The Real George Zimmerman' Speaks, and Solicits Funds

BYLINE: CHANNING JOSEPH and ROBERT MACKEY


HIGHLIGHT: George Zimmerman, the Florida man who fatally shot an unarmed Florida teenager in February, has set up a Web site to speak to supporters - and ask for money. 

 BODY:
Last Updated | 5:46 p.m. George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot and killed an unarmed, black teenager in Florida six weeks ago, broke his public silence over the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin on a new Web site: TheRealGeorgeZimmerman.com.
On the home page of his new site, which features an American flag as its background, and a prominent link to a PayPal account, Mr. Zimmerman writes:
I am the real George Zimmerman. On Sunday February 26th, I was involved in a life altering event which led me to become the subject of intense media coverage. As a result of the incident and subsequent media coverage, I have been forced to leave my home, my school, my employer, my family and ultimately, my entire life.
Mr. Zimmerman's lawyer, Hal Uhrig, confirmed to WOFL-FOX 35, an Orlando, Fl. Fox News affiliate, that the site was produced by his client. (Late Tuesday, Mr. Uhrig and another attorney, Craig Sonner, announced that they were no longer representing Mr. Zimmerman. Their client stopped returning their calls on Sunday, the men said. The lawyers added that Mr. Zimmerman had contacted Sean Hannity of Fox News without consulting them and called the office of the special prosecutor investigating him.) 
The Orlando Sentinel reports that Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Trayvon's family, criticized the site in an appearance on Good Morning America on Tuesday, saying: "George Zimmerman is trying to have us believe that his life is so terrible now." He added: "You know he says that he experienced a life-altering event. Well, Trayvon Martin experienced a life-ending event."
The site's photo album section features images of two messages written by the gunman's supporters, both of which demonstrate how the case has become part of the wider American debate over multicultural living. One image shows a sign reading "Justice for Zimmerman," which was displayed at a rally last month led by Terry Jones, the anti-Islam Florida pastor famous for burning copies of the Koran. The second images shows the graffiti-scrawled words "Long Live Zimmerman," which were spray-painted on the wall of a black cultural center at Ohio State University last Thursday.
The image from Ohio appears to be a still frame from video of the graffiti posted online by Ohio State's student newspaper, The Lantern, which was brought to the attention of a wider audience on Thursday by Trymaine Lee of The Huffington Post.
In the introduction to the site, Mr. Zimmerman writes: "This website's sole purpose is to ensure my supporters they are receiving my full attention without any intermediaries." He adds:
I have created a Paypal account solely linked on this website as I would like to provide an avenue to thank my supporters personally and ensure that any funds provided are used only for living expenses and legal defense, in lieu of my forced inability to maintain employment. I will also personally, maintain accountability of all funds received. I reassure you, every donation is appreciated.
Although he never directly addresses any of the questions being raised in the media on the shooting, there are quotations sprinkled throughout the Web site -- attributed to prominent philosophers, writers and historians -- that touch on some of the themes being discussed in the public sphere: racism, and standards of evidence, in particular.
In a section titled "My Race," Mr. Zimmerman cites a common, if incorrect, formulation of thoughts by Thomas Paine, the British philosopher of the American revolution, writing: "The world is my country, all mankind are my brethren, and to do good is my religion." (In "The Rights of Man," Paine wrote: "my country is the world, and my religion is to do good." In 1923, when a plaque was unveiled on the Greenwich Village house where the British-American political philosopher had died in 1809, a New York Times report described the inscriptions "The World Is My Country," "To Do Good Is My Religion," and "All Mankind Are My Brethren," as
"three of his famous sayings.")
In another section of his site called "The Facts," Mr. Zimmerman cites the quote, "People have a right to their own opinions, but not to their own facts. Evidence must be located, not created, and opinions not backed by evidence cannot be given much weight," which he attributes to the historian James Loewen. (The observation is often attributed to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York senator who died in 2003, but the editor of a revised edition of The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs noted last year that a very similar remark was made in 1950 by Bernard M. Baruch, an American financier who advised Franklin Delano Roosevelt on the economy.)
The Web site also includes a contact page for readers wishing to write directly to Mr. Zimmerman. Although he says he cannot "discuss the details of the event on February 26th," Mr. Zimmerman writes, "Any and all words of support and kindness will be read and appreciated." He adds: "every attempt to reply to my supporters will be made personally."
As our colleagues Lizette Alvarez and John Schwartz report, the special prosecutor appointed to investigate the case, Angela Corey, said on Monday that she had decided not to convene a grand jury. Ms. Corey said in a statement that that decision "should not be considered a factor in the final determination of the case."

HEADLINE: Energy Sector Deals Keep Coming, as Chesapeake Strikes 3

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Struggling amid a surplus of natural gas and depressed demand, energy companies continue to look to deal-making to bolster their financial positions, with Chesapeake raising $2.6 billion with its latest moves. 

 BODY:
Struggling amid a surplus of natural gas and depressed demand, energy companies continue to look to deal-making to bolster their financial positions.
In the latest, the Chesapeake Energy Corporation has announced three deals that will raise $2.6 billion in cash for the natural gas giant, moves that will help it cope with low prices.
It has been a tough environment for Chesapeake and other energy companies, which have been dealing with the effects of a warm winter and a sputtering economy. Natural gas prices are about half what they were a year ago, putting pressure on producers.
 Such issues have prompted several companies this year to strike deals and raise cash. In January, the Devon Energy Corporation sold a stake in its shale operations to Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production for $2.2 billion. The Blackstone Group earlier this year agreed to provide $2 billion in financing to Cheniere Energy.
Chesapeake, the nation's second-largest natural gas producer after Exxon Mobil, has been particularly aggressive. It has made a flurry of deals in the last year, seeking to raise cash to reduce debt and bolster what are expected to be sagging earnings.
While its management has insisted that natural gas prices will begin rising late this year, the company is also seeking to diversify its holdings, including by finding lucrative properties that contain crude oil and natural gas as well as natural gas liquids.
Yet Chesapeake has continued to hunt for new shale assets as well, hoping to maintain its status as one of the nation's top producers of natural gas.
Under the largest deal announced on Monday, Chesapeake reaped $1.25 billion from selling preferred shares of a new subsidiary, CHK Cleveland Tonkawa, which owns "unconventional liquids-rich" assets in Oklahoma.
The investors who acquired the stake were led by GSO Capital Partners, an arm of the Blackstone Group, the private equity giant that has delved deep into the natural gas industry in recent months. The investors, who also included TPG Capital, Magnetar Capital and EIG Global Energy Partners, will earn a 6 percent quarterly dividend and a 3.75 percent royalty from the first 1,000 new wells drilled on the land in Oklahoma.
In the second deal, Chesapeake sold a 10-year volumetric production payment, or V.P.P., which requires the company to deliver natural gas at a future date in exchange for cash upfront. The company struck the deal, worth $745 million, with an an affiliate of Morgan Stanley. Chesapeake retained drilling rights on the properties involved in the deal, including the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma.
The deal was Chesapeake's 10th such transaction since December 2007.
Under the final deal announced on Monday, Chesapeake sold 58,400 acres of land in Oklahoma to XTO Energy, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil. The transaction, expected to close later this month, raised $590 million in cash for Chesapeake.
Chesapeake, in a statement, said it would carry out several transactions in the coming months to raise up to $10 billion.
Already this year, the company sold a portion of its shale operation in Ohio to the French oil giant Total for $2.32 billion. It also forged a partnership with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm.

HIGHLIGHT: Subaru recently announced pricing for its 2013 BRZ, a rear-wheel-drive coupe whose systems and chassis are shared by the Scion FR-S. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 During a press conference at the New York auto show last week, Tom Doll, executive vice president of Subaru of America, announced pricing for the 2013 BRZ, the rear-wheel-drive coupe co-developed with Toyota. Prices will range from $26,265 to $29,365 including delivery charges, depending on options and transmission choices. The Toyota equivalent, marketed in the United States as the Scion FR-S, is priced from $24,930. (Subaru)
 Volvo Cars recently announced that it would invest $11 billion in developing new vehicles and vehicle systems in coming years. The Swedish automaker, which is majority-owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, a Chinese company, intends to double its worldwide sales, to 800,000 units, in 10 years. Per-Ake Froberg, a Volvo spokesman, told the German newspaper WirtschaftsWoche that the financing would not come from the company's Chinese parent. (Reuters)
 The 2013 Porsche Cayenne GTS, a higher-horsepower version of the German automaker's sport utility vehicle, is scheduled to have its debut at the Beijing motor show later this month. In its power and pricing, the GTS slots between the Cayenne S and Cayenne Turbo, with 420 horsepower and a price of $83,025. The ride height is also lowered by roughly 3/4 an inch. Sales are expected to begin in August. (Porsche)
 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it would close an investigation opened in December 2009 into Ford E-Series vans for a potential fire hazard. The agency concluded that a series of control-switch failures, two of which likely having resulted in fires, did not constitute a sufficient safety hazard to warrant a recall. Ford agreed to make a production-line change to the switches to make them less susceptible to short circuits. (The Detroit News)
Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One boss, said in an interview with The Times of London that the series could not compel teams to race in the restive former Gulf emirate of Bahrain, where a grand prix is scheduled for April 22. The 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix was canceled amid civil unrest, and security concerns were heightened this week when a homemade bomb was detonated Monday at an anti-government protest. "If the teams don't want to go, then we cannot make them," Mr. Ecclestone said. (The Times of London, via Autosport)

HEADLINE: Bush Weighs in on Tax Debate

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: An offhand remark by former President George W. Bush indicated that he is paying attention to one of the most heated debates in Washington - the future of the tax cuts he championed. 

 BODY:
George W. Bush has been virtually invisible for most of President Obama's time in office.
But an offhand remark at a conference in New York City indicated that Mr. Bush is paying attention to one of the most heated debates in Washington - the future of the tax cuts he championed.
"I wish they weren't called the Bush tax cuts," Mr. Bush said Tuesday at the start of a conference sponsored by the Bush Institute. "If they're called some other body's tax cuts, they're probably less likely to be raised."
The comment, said with a chuckle, was nonetheless a rare example of Mr. Bush injecting himself into the current political discussion. 
He stayed silent during the opening of Mr. Obama's administration even as his successor set about to derail or turn back many of the policies Mr. Bush put in place. 
When it came to national security, for example, Mr. Bush left it to his vice president, Dick Cheney, to lead the rhetorical assault against Mr. Obama's policies on torture and the prosecution of terrorism detainees.
And Mr. Bush has stayed out of the Republican primary during the last six months, even as his father, former president George H. W. Bush, and his brother Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, haveendorsedMitt Romney.
The future of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, which were enacted in 2001 and 2003, are at the center of the economic debate between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney, the likely Republican nominee.
After reluctantly agreeing to a two-year extension of the tax cuts in 2010, Mr. Obama now says he wants to allow taxes on wealthy Americans to rise starting in 2013. Republicans, including Mr. Romney, have said they want the tax cuts named for Mr. Bush to remain in place.
Appearing on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program on Tuesday, David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, said the president would not compromise on the issue again.
"The president's going to win in November, and we are not going to extend those tax cuts for the wealthy," Mr. Axelrod promised on the show.

HEADLINE: European Bank Shares Take a Nosedive

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Shares in some of the Europe's largest financial institutions fell as much as 8 percent on Tuesday as fears about the debt crisis re-emerged. 

 BODY:
LONDON - It was a bad day for European banking stocks.
On Tuesday, shares of several of the region's largest financial institutions fell as much as 8 percent as fears about the debt crisis in Europe re-emerged.
After weeks of renewed optimism, particularly after the European Central Bank pumped in more than $1 trillion to prop up local banks, concerns are growing that countries like Spain and Italy will not be able to pay their debts. 
 Mounting questions about those to nations' abilities to finance their loans are affecting banks because many institutions have been actively buying billions of dollars of state-backed debt. 
Spanish banks, for example, increased their holdings of government bonds by 68 billion euros ($89 billion) from November to February. Italian firms bought 54 billion euros ($71 billion) of government securities over the same period.
And investors continue to fret. The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds, for example, rose to nearly 6 percent on Tuesday despite an announcement from the country's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, about an additional 10 billion euros ($13 billion) of budget cuts.
Shares in Banco Santander dropped 3.9 percent on Tuesday, while the stock in BBVA of Spain fell 3.6 percent.
The effect on European banking stocks was worsened by the long Easter weekend for most European countries, when the Continent's largest exchanges were closed on both Friday and Monday. 
That meant Tuesday was the first day when European traders could respond to the worse-than-expected job numbers announced in the United States on Friday.
The pain was most acute in Italy. Shares in UniCredit, the country's largest bank, fell 8.1 percent, while the stock of its local rival Intesa Sanpaolo slipped 7.9 percent. 
The declines came after local media reports said the Italian government would cut its growth forecast for 2012. Italy is expected to grow by a mere 0.4 percent, according to statistics from the European Union.
The falling share prices, however, were not limited to debt-laden Southern European countries. Slow growth is forecast across Europe, which is expected to hurt some of region's largest banks.
On Tuesday, the stock of Deutsche Bank of Germany dropped 4.2 percent. Shares in Barclays of Britain fell 5.9 percent, while those of BNP Paribas of France declined by 5.7 percent.

HEADLINE: The Buffett Rule

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Few things capture the difference in values between Mr. Obama and the Republicans as neatly as their positions on the Paying a Fair Share Act. 

 BODY:
Few things capture the difference in values between President Obama and his Republican opponents quite as neatly as their positions on the Warren Buffet-inspired Buffett Rule, which would require Americans making over $1 million a year to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes.
As Mr. Obama sees it, the government has a role to play in encouraging (something that at least resembles) an equal opportunity society, and raising tax rates on millionaires is one of many possible mechanisms for promoting fairness. He's scheduled to discuss the Buffett Rule-technically the Paying a Fair Share Act-later today at Florida Atlantic University, and according to a copy of his prepared remarks sent around by the White House, he's going long on morality.
Right now, the share of our national income flowing to the top 1% has climbed to levels last seen in the 1920s. And yet those same people are also paying taxes at one of the lowest rates in 50 years. You might have heard this, but Warren Buffett is paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.
That's wrong. It isn't fair. And it's time for us to choose which direction we want to go in as a country. Do we want to keep giving tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans like me, or Warren Buffett, or Bill Gates - people who don't need them and never asked for them? Or do we want to keep investing in things that will grow our economy and keep us secure? That's the choice.
Many Republicans are uncomfortable with government-sponsored fairness, which they believe can edge into the territory of social engineering, and perceive the rule as an anti-competitive gimmick. That's what they want us to think, anyway-if you ask me, they're just beholden to thoroughly debunked trickle-down nostrums that amount to giving advantages to people who already have plenty of them.
Ahead of the Florida address, Mr. Romney's campaign accused the president of waging "class warfare" - a term Republicans use when Democrats appeal to the middle class. When Republicans appeal to really rich people, they call it job creation.
The Republicans complain that the Buffet Rule will not make a big dent in the federal budget deficit. They're right. It would mean an extra $47 billion or so for the federal treasury over 10 years and that's not real money these days. The real money would come from letting the Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year; that's worth about $1 trillion over a decade. But the Republicans are determined not to let that happen.
Neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Buffett has ever said the millionaires' rate is about deficit reduction. It is about making the tax code truly progressive. When Mr. Buffett pays a smaller share of his income to the government than his secretary, we are not just rewarding Mr. Buffett, we are punishing the secretary.

HEADLINE: Bush Weighs in on Tax Debate

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: An offhand remark by former President George W. Bush indicated that he is paying attention to one of the most heated debates in Washington - the future of the tax cuts he championed. 

 BODY:
George W. Bush has been virtually invisible for most of President Obama's time in office.
But an offhand remark at a conference in New York City indicated that Mr. Bush is paying attention to one of the most heated debates in Washington - the future of the tax cuts he championed.
"I wish they weren't called the Bush tax cuts," Mr. Bush said Tuesday at the start of a conference sponsored by the Bush Institute. "If they're called some other body's tax cuts, they're probably less likely to be raised."
The comment, said with a chuckle, was nonetheless a rare example of Mr. Bush injecting himself into the current political discussion. 
He stayed silent during the opening of Mr. Obama's administration even as his successor set about to derail or turn back many of the policies Mr. Bush put in place. 
When it came to national security, for example, Mr. Bush left it to his vice president, Dick Cheney, to lead the rhetorical assault against Mr. Obama's policies on torture and the prosecution of terrorism detainees.
And Mr. Bush has stayed out of the Republican primary during the last six months, even as his father, former president George H. W. Bush, and his brother Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, haveendorsedMitt Romney.
The future of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, which were enacted in 2001 and 2003, are at the center of the economic debate between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney, the likely Republican nominee.
After reluctantly agreeing to a two-year extension of the tax cuts in 2010, Mr. Obama now says he wants to allow taxes on wealthy Americans to rise starting in 2013. Republicans, including Mr. Romney, have said they want the tax cuts named for Mr. Bush to remain in place.
Appearing on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program on Tuesday, David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, said the president would not compromise on the issue again.
"The president's going to win in November, and we are not going to extend those tax cuts for the wealthy," Mr. Axelrod promised on the show.

HEADLINE: Santorum Suspends Presidential Campaign

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JIM RUTENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum is suspending his campaign, ending his improbable, come-from-behind quest to become the Republican Party's conservative standard-bearer in the fall. 

 BODY:
3:08 p.m. | Updated Rick Santorum suspended his presidential campaign on Tuesday, bowing to the inevitability of Mitt Romney's nomination and ending his improbable, come-from-behind quest to become the party's conservative standard-bearer in the fall.
"We made a decision over the weekend, that while this presidential race for us is over, for me, and we will suspend our campaign today, we are not done fighting," Mr. Santorum said. 
Mr. Santorum made the announcement at a stop in his home state of Pennsylvania after a weekend in which he tended to his 3-year-old daughter, Bella, who had been hospitalized with pneumonia.
Mr. Santorum, who was holding back tears, did not exactly specify why he was ending his presidential bid. He referred to his daughter's illness, but said she was making great progress and was back home after being hospitalized over the weekend.
Mr. Santorum called Mr. Romney earlier in the day to tell him of his plans to suspend his campaign. Mr. Santorum told Mr. Romney that he is committed to defeating President Obama, but that he is not going to endorse immediately, said a source familiar with the call. 
Mr. Santorum made no mention of Mr. Romney in a 12-minute speech in which he extolled the people he had met during the campaign and said he was inspired by their stories of struggle and faith.
After spending months accusing Mr. Romney of being a weak challenger for President Obama, Mr. Santorum said only that he would continue to fight to elect a Republican president and to ensure Republican control of Congress.
"This game is a long, long, long way from over," he said. 
Mr. Romney issued a statement moments after Mr. Santorum concluded his remarks.
"Senator Santorum is an able and worthy competitor, and I congratulate him on the campaign he ran," Mr. Romney said. "He has proven himself to be an important voice in our party and in the nation. We both recognize that what is most important is putting the failures of the last three years behind us and setting America back on the path to prosperity."
As recently as December, Mr. Santorum was operating a shoestring campaign in Iowa, traveling with just a handful of aides in a pickup truck. But his brand of conservative populism caught fire in Iowa, where he defeated Mr. Romney. And then it caught fire again in several Midwest primaries in which he surprised Mr. Romney.
But ultimately, Mr. Santorum's campaign struggled under a nearly constant barrage of negative ads paid for by Mr. Romney and the "super PAC" supporting him, Restore Our Future, which has spent millions in an effort to ensure that Mr. Romney captures the nomination in his second attempt. 
Mr. Santorum's withdrawal abruptly upends not only the political calculus for Mr. Romney and his campaign team, but also their financial picture.
Both candidates had faced fund-raising challenges in the coming weeks, with Mr. Santorum limping by on fumes and Mr. Romney rapidly tapping his top contributors for the maximum contribution, challenging him to seek out new sources of cash. Mr. Romney had committed $2.9 million to the Pennsylvania primary, hoping to deliver Mr. Santorum a knockout blow, and Restore Our Future had begun spending there as well.
Mr. Santorum's withdrawal will allow both Mr. Romney and the super PAC to redirect that money to other states, either to head off any lingering challenge from Newt Gingrich and Representative Ron Paul of Texas, or to begin preparing for what seems to be an increasingly likely general election matchup against Mr. Obama.
A former congressman and senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum had built a reputation as an unwavering social conservative whose opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage helped catapult him into national office. 
Among the people who had been publicly encouraging Mr. Santorum to reconsider a drawn-out challenge to Mr. Romney were some evangelical leaders who had been suspicious of Mr. Romney's commitment to their most important causes.
Richard Land, the president of the ethics commission at the Southern Baptist Convention, said as much an hour before word of Mr. Santorum's decision reached the press.
"As his friend, I would say, you know you've done an incredible job resurrecting your career. You've done better than anybody thought you could," Mr. Land told reporters and editors of The New York Times.
Mr. Land said that if Mr. Santorum pressed ahead, he would jeopardize that success. And he said that Mr. Santorum had a good future if he acknowledged Mr. Romney's claim to the nomination this year.
"In eight years, Rick Santorum will be three years younger than Romney is now. He's only 53 years old," Mr. Land said. "He'll be a significant player. I would think he could have a significant role in a Romney administration if he wanted to. Maybe H.H.S. secretary?"
Ralph Reed, a leading social conservative who oversees the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said Mr. Santorum had proved himself as the strongest insurgent conservative candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1976.
"It was an impressive performance and it leaves him with an elevated status and a prominent role as a leader for evangelicals and conservatives," Mr. Reed said on Tuesday. "No one can know what the future holds, but my guess is we haven't heard the last from Rick Santorum."
Mr. Santorum's candidacy benefited from the comparison to Mr. Romney as the Republican candidates appealed to a conservative segment of the Republican Party during the primary process. Mr. Santorum regularly mocked Mr. Romney as a flip-flopper on social and conservative issues who could not be trusted.
That helped Mr. Santorum win several Southern primaries in which evangelical voters and Tea Party supporters dominated the primary electorate. 
But Mr. Santorum also cast himself as the true economic conservative who understood the needs of the middle class. His campaign attacked Mr. Romney, a multimillionaire, as out of touch with the needs and interests of regular working Americans.
Mr. Santorum's quick rise in the polls also led to repeated gaffes that knocked him off that economic message and pulled him back into an extended conversation about contraception and other social issues.
Those issues did not play as well in states like Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois, where Mr. Santorum lost to Mr. Romney. Those losses helped create a mounting sense of frustration inside the Republican establishment that Mr. Santorum was waging a quixotic battle against Mr. Romney that would ultimately hurt the party's chances against Mr. Obama.
Mr. Santorum's decision will all but clear the way for Mr. Romney to claim the nomination.
Mr. Gingrich recently scaled back his ambitions, acknowledging that it was impossible for him to accumulate enough delegates to win the nomination before the national convention. Mr. Gingrich conceded on Sunday that Mr. Romney would most likely be the nominee, and said his primary goal in continuing to campaign was to influence the party's platform at the convention.
Mr. Gingrich released a statement praising Mr. Santorum and his campaign, but also stressing his commitment to remaining in the race. 
"I am committed to staying in this race all the way to Tampa so that the conservative movement has a real choice," the statement read. "I humbly ask Senator Santorum's supporters to visit Newt.org to review my conservative record and join us as we bring these values to Tampa. We know well that only a conservative can protect life, defend the Constitution, restore jobs and growth and return to a balanced budget."
Mr. Paul also is continuing to wage his effort to win the Republican nomination and is scheduled to campaign this week.
But Mr. Santorum had been the last remaining candidate with a potential shot at stopping Mr. Romney - and even that opportunity was dwindling fast as Mr. Romney accumulated delegates.
Officials at the Republican National Committee had already begun considering the possibilities for beginning the traditional effort to merge their general election efforts with Mr. Romney's Boston-based campaign. The decision by Mr. Santorum will make that easier. 
It also could clear the way for Mr. Santorum to play a bigger role - and have a potentially bigger voice - in Mr. Romney's campaign and perhaps in a Romney administration.

HEADLINE: For Some Corporate Chiefs, Private Security Is a Tax Break

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: Dozens of corporate boards, including those of Halliburton, Kraft, Home Depot and Waste Management, insist or recommend their C.E.O.'s fly on private jets for security reasons. It's a common corporate tax trick. 

 BODY:
Most people would think that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court would need more security than Alan R. Mulally, the chief executive of Ford Motor Company.
Ford's directors don't seem to agree. The board requires that Mr. Mulally - for safety reasons - fly on a private jet whether he is going to Washington for business or Hawaii for vacation.
Justice Ginsburg flies commercial with all its attendant hassles. Last year, she and other passengers were forced to evacuate a United Airlines flight via an emergency slide.
Mr. Mulally is not alone. Dozens of corporate boards, including those of Halliburton, Kraft, Home Depot and Waste Management, insist or recommend that their top executives fly on private jets for security reasons.
In the name of security, companies also pay for home alarm systems, 24-hour monitoring and even chauffeurs. The Macy's board provides its chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren, with a car and driver to ensure his "personal safety," a perk that is also bestowed on the heads of Cablevision, NCR, Time Warner and Tootsie Roll Industries. Hertz even provides a driver trained in "evasive driving techniques," whatever that means.
Are corporate chieftains really in that much danger?
The answer has to be no in most cases. The number of people who know the name of Tootsie Roll's boss, Melvin J. Gordon, is likely to be smaller than the number of law students who study Justice Ginsburg's cases. Steven P. Jobs, arguably the most famous chief executive, received no security services from Apple last year before he died.
Rather, directors often dole out personal safety perks to ease a chief executive's tax bill. By classifying the benefits as security measures, the executives typically get a better tax treatment on the services.
It's a common corporate tax trick.
Each year, companies spend millions of dollars to ensure the ostensible safety of their executives, services that sometimes extend to others. Ford, for example, picks up the tab for family members who fly with Mr. Mulally. The automaker estimated that it spent $178,571 on Mr. Mulally's and his family's personal air travel last year. Ford declined to comment.
Board members, too, can benefit.
Last year, Northrop Grumman paid to put its lead independent director, Lewis W. Coleman, in a "more secure residence," according to a regulatory filing. For those who need translation, it seems that Northrop Grumman helped Mr. Coleman buy a new house.
He's an expensive board member. Over all, Northrop Grumman spent $5,203,559 on security protection for Mr. Coleman, including about $1.5 million for personal travel for him and his family. Northrop Grumman even appears to pay to fly him in a private jet when he is traveling on business for his day job as president of DreamWorks Animation.
Northrop Grumman justifies the expense because of "specific threat information" from law enforcement. I find it telling that DreamWorks doesn't require security for him. Northrop Grumman declined to comment further.
Such perks persist even against the backdrop of political or shareholder pressure.
Ford shed its fleet of corporate jets in 2008, after a furor at the automakers' use of private planes to fly their chiefs to Congressional hearings during the financial crisis. But Ford still pays a jet charter service for Mr. Mulally and his family. At General Motors, which still has to repay its taxpayer bailout, its chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, must fly commercial, unless he gets special dispensation from the government.
The corporate jet is so valued that it is often the last service to be cut.
In 2011, Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken, ended some of its executive perks, including a car and driver, club membership and annual physical. But Yum still requires its chief executive, David C. Novak, to take a private jet for all his travel. The restaurant chain estimates that it spent $214,017 on personal air travel for Mr. Novak last year.
Those personal safety perks create big tax savings.
Let's say you are a chief executive who wants to take the company's jet. If the trip is business related, then it's all pretty straightforward. The company pays for it and deducts the expense under a complicated formula.
It's a different case for personal travel. In those cases, chief executives are required to pay income tax on the imputed portion of the flight - that is, the amount the company paid for the flight. So a chief executive who is a frequent flier can rack up a rather large tax bill.
Luckily, the tax code offers executives a break.
If an outside security consultant determines that executives need a private jet and other services for their safety, the Internal Revenue Service cuts corporate chieftains a break. In such cases, the chief executive will pay a reduced tax bill or sometimes no tax at all.
Even when tax is due, the company sometimes takes care of it. Northrop Grumman spent $174,953 last year to cover the tax bill for Mr. Coleman's personal air travel.
The loser is, you guessed it, the federal government, which receives less tax revenue.
I typically have no problem with private jet travel for executives doing company business. Just try to travel through La Guardia Airport, and you can see what a time saver it would be to avoid the security lines.
But companies cite security issues to get their executives better tax treatment for things like personal air travel. It's also a way to justify the expense to shareholders. In this era of crimped earnings and sluggish economic growth, the benefits - and the reasons the companies give for them - ring especially hollow.
While statistics are not available, some companies are reversing longstanding policies to provide jets and the like for security reasons. This year, the Williams Companies, the natural gas producer, eliminated the home security program and the air travel requirement for its chief executive.
The shift comes as profits and stocks slump. Years ago, "executives were looking for methods of reducing the fringe benefit cost of using the company aircraft," said Keith G. Swirsky, president and chairman of the aviation and tax groups of GKG Law, a firm that focuses on transportation law. Now, he added, companies are looking to eliminate the perks partly in deference to shareholders.
Perhaps if the tax laws were revised, chief executives would still take the private jet while Justice Ginsburg flew commercial. But at least the taxpayers wouldn't be subsidizing it in the name of security.

HEADLINE: Romney Turns Attention to Obama, Focusing on Women's Job Losses

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's turn toward the general election addressed one of his biggest vulnerabilities according to polls: a gender gap that shows women currently prefer President Obama by large margins. 

 BODY:
WILMINGTON, Del. - On the day that Rick Santorum withdrew from the race, Mitt Romney's turn toward the general election addressed one of his biggest vulnerabilities according to polls: a gender gap that shows women currently prefer President Obama by large margins.
Mr. Romney fought back on his preferred turf, jobs and the economy, making the case that women had faced heavy job losses since President Obama took office. 
After a hard-fought Republican primary race that featured sharp battles among candidates over health care, abortion, immigration and education, the gender gap yawned most recently in a Washington Post/ABC News poll this week. It found that women preferred Mr. Obama to Mr. Romney by 19 percentage points. Mr. Romney held an 8 percent advantage among men. An earlier USA Today/Gallup poll showed Mr. Obama leading Mr. Romney among women by a similar margin in 12 battleground states. 
Analysts have said the gap could be a serious problem for Mr. Romney in November, and he forcefully addressed it.

"There's been some talk about the war on women," he said, referring to claims by Democratic leaders that the Republican Party is hostile toward women with its positions on issues like abortion and health care. "The real war on women has been waged by the Obama administration's failure on the economy.''
He repeatedly cited the figure of 92.3 percent, which he said was women's share of all the jobs lost since the president's inauguration in January 2009. 
"The president is so out of touch, I don't think he knew that number,'' Mr. Romney said here, at R.C. Fabricators, a company that makes steel girders for heavy construction, and whose chief executive is a woman, Becky Suppe. 
"And if he did," Mr. Romney continued, "he probably would have sad that his administration has been a great success. He says he's not only done a good job, he says he's done a great job even with 92.3 percent of the job losses being women. He thinks he's done a great job. A historically great job. And he did not say that on 'Saturday Night Live.' "
Mr. Romney's figure of 92.3 percent is one his campaign began citing earlier in April. It is based on numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which show a net loss of 740,000 nonfarm jobs since Mr. Obama's inauguration. Women have lost 683,000 jobs in that time, or about 92 percent.
But the number drew a skeptical response from the fact-checking Web site PolitiFact, which pointed out that historically in recessions, men are the first to lose jobs in industries like construction, and women's layoffs -- in fields like education and government -- follow. The statistic, which appears to be a talking point Mr. Romney intends to use regularly, was rated "mostly false" by PolitiFact.
Before his speech, Mr. Romney met privately with a dozen female leaders of businesses. At one point, he noticed a member of the audience, Christine O'Donnell, who ran unsuccessfully for the Senate from Delaware in 2010, and seemed to do a double take. 
"I see one of my supporters over here - Christine O'Donnell - didn't know you were going to be here,'' he said. "Thanks, Christine, good to see you.''
Mr. Romney spoke only briefly about Mr. Santorum at the beginning of his remarks. "This has been a good day for me," he said. "Senator Santorum has decided not to proceed with his campaign. I had the chance to speak with him this morning."
He went on to praise Mr. Santorum for raising "issues he cares very deeply about" and making them part of the debate during the nominating race. 
As a result, Mr. Romney said, Mr. Santorum "will continue to have a major role in the Republican Party, and I look forward to his work in helping assure victories for Republicans across the country in November."
Mr. Romney is headed to Connecticut and Rhode Island on Wednesday, which, like Delaware, will hold primaries on April 24, but it is unclear whether he will continue with planned campaign stops on Thursday in Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum's home, which also votes that day. 
In his second appearance on Tuesday, Mr. Romney crossed the border into Pennsylvania to speak to the Chester County Republican Party. "This could be the deciding state" in November, he told an audience of several hundred. "This could be a battleground state.'' 
He was introduced by Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, a conservative star who Mr. Santorum once declined to endorse, earning a measure of disdain from party faithful. Mr. Toomey introduced Mr. Romney and gave him his endorsement. 
Mr. Romney said, "We have work ahead of us, we members of the Republican Party."

HEADLINE: A Tax Code Of Politics, Not Reason

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
The deadline for filing tax returns is almost upon us. If you are like me, you must be pondering how such a rich, high-technology democracy as the United States could endure what must be the most inefficient, mind-bogglingly complex tax system known to man.
Either you've hired an accountant to prepare your tax returns or you've spent countless hours plowing through schedule after schedule, noting deductions, exemptions and limitations and hoping the software you are using will get it right. Exhausted and anxious, you're thinking surely there must be a better way.
There are, in fact, more efficient ways for government to collect money. They are much less complicated. And they can raise a lot of revenue to solve our long-run budget deficit and pay for the increased benefits demanded by our aging society. What's more, they can do so without raising income tax rates. Unfortunately, history suggests we won't really consider these alternatives.
Our byzantine tax code is built upon a longstanding political deal: Democrats wanted a tax scale with higher rates for richer Americans to finance social programs aimed at the poor and the middle class. Republicans countered by pushing for tax exceptions, exclusions and deductions that shielded the incomes of the rich from the taxman and reduced government revenue. 
This compromise has left us with a loophole-riddled code that isn't very good at raising money. The richest 1 percent of Americans, who make $1.5 million on average, pay 28 percent of their income in federal taxes, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That's way below the top rate of 35 percent. The rest of us also pay little. The bottom 85 percent of taxpayers have an average federal tax rate of 12 percent. The poorest 25 percent pay less than 1 percent of their income -- $77 a family, on average.
Compared to other developed countries, the United States doesn't collect much tax at all. Tax revenue at all levels of government adds up to less than 25 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, putting us behind every other rich country and even some poor ones. Among the 34 nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, only Mexico and Chile collect less in taxes. The average across the O.E.C.D. is 9 percentage points higher.
In my column two weeks ago, I argued that given the giant budget deficits on the horizon, the government might consider raising the top tax rate on the rich to 50 percent or more. Recent economic research suggests that top rates could go pretty high without slowing growth. And they could bring in a lot of money.
Yet, as a few readers pointed out, increasing revenue from income taxes might be harder than it looks: bigger loopholes could easily wipe out any gains from higher rates. Since the end of World War II, top federal income tax rates have topped out at more than 90 percent. Yet federal tax revenue has not surpassed 21 percent of the nation's output. Last year it was under 15 percent.
Not only is our tax code bad at raising money, it is also plagued with perverse incentives that, added up across the population, can push us to distort the economy and slow it down. When I came to New York eight years ago, I bought a bigger house, got a bigger mortgage and plowed more of my savings into the place than I would have otherwise because the Internal Revenue Service let me deduct the interest from my taxes. Today, that doesn't look quite as wise as it did then.
Allowing businesses to give health insurance to their workers tax-free does promote insurance, but it also encourages overspending on health care. Letting companies deduct interest on their debt encourages them to borrow. Placing high taxes on income and capital can reduce the incentives for people to work and invest.
The only reason our stilted code doesn't do more harm is that it generates so little in revenue that the perverse incentives aren't that significant. If more money was involved, the economic damage would be greater. And our representatives in Congress would have more of an incentive to ditch the tax code and come up with a better, more effective and efficient alternative.
What would a better tax system look like? Most other rich countries have one. While each country has a different version, they share a core feature: they raise a lot of money taxing people's consumption, at the point of sale.
Consumption taxes create fewer perverse incentives because taxing what people buy doesn't affect their choices about work and investment. If anything, such a system might promote savings, generally good for growth. These taxes are also easy to collect and hard to evade. They don't add complexity to your tax return. Because they produce few perverse incentives, they can be used to raise a lot of money.
Consumption taxes are supported by a vast majority of economists. They underpin Western Europe's welfare systems, which are based on the proposition that all citizens are entitled to similar income support and services to guarantee a minimum standard of living, and that everybody should pay proportionately for them. Denmark and Sweden collect about 10 percent of their gross domestic product with a value-added tax, a modern tax on consumption.
In the United States, by contrast, states raise only 2.2 percent of G.D.P. through various sales taxes. There is no federal consumption tax at all. And that's probably not going to change any time soon.
A federal consumption tax has beenproposed more than once. A report last year by the Congressional Research Service found that for every 1 percent levied in a value-added tax, the federal government would raise up to $55 billion a year. This new source of money could help change the political deal underpinning our tax system and pave the way to cull loopholes and reduce our top tax rates.
In 2010, the Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force -- headed by Pete Domenici, a former Republican senator from New Mexico, and Alice Rivlin, former vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve -- proposed a 6.5 percent sales tax to raise more than $3 trillion from 2012 to 2020.
But a consumption tax suffers from two political weaknesses. As Lawrence Summers put it in 1988, before he became Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration or worked as an adviser for President Obama, ''Liberals think it's regressive, and conservatives think it's a money machine.''
Consumption taxes are regressive because the poor spend a bigger share of their income than the rich. But the charge misses a couple of points: our current tax schedule isn't very progressive, either, pockmarked as it is by exclusions and exceptions. European welfare systems that rely heavily on consumption taxes to provide generous benefits do a better job at reducing income inequality than the government does here. The poor pay more into the system, but they also get more from it.
Mr. Summers suggested that politics might turn in favor of a value-added tax if only the politicians were to focus on the opposite end of the argument. If conservatives realized that the expansion of government would be financed in part by the poor and the middle class rather than the rich, they might be less adamant in their opposition. If Democrats focused on the amount of money they could raise, they, too, might come around.
But the precedent is not heartening. Al Ullman, the Oregon Democrat who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed a 10 percent value-added tax coupled to a reduction in income and payroll taxes in 1979. The idea died. In 1980, Mr. Ullman was defeated by a Republican who accused him of having lost touch.

HEADLINE: Real-Time Data to Reduce Electric Use

BYLINE: By JIM WITKIN

 BODY:
WHEN Max Dunn walks through his kitchen in San Jose, Calif., he often glances at the home energy monitor that sits on the countertop. The monitor resembles a car's GPS device and connects wirelessly to the home's power meter.
The display tells him at any given moment how much electricity the house is using, and on a recent afternoon, the reading was higher than usual for that time of day. So he turned off a home computer that no one was using and the lights in an unoccupied room. 
By spending $149 on the monitor and just a few minutes a day checking it and turning things off or down, he has consistently reduced his electricity use, he says -- in some months, by up to 30 percent.
Mr. Dunn, who works as a software consultant in Silicon Valley, is what marketing executives call an early adopter, someone who is quick to embrace new technology ahead of the mainstream.
Still, according to Parks Associates, a consumer research firm, about 60 percent of homes will have some form of home energy management network by 2022. This is good news for the companies that make these devices and the retailers who sell them. But are Mr. Dunn's results a statistical outlier, or will all this technology help significantly reduce the power our homes consume and the dollars we spend?
Savings are possible, according to recent research, as long as the technology is easy for the average consumer to use, and clearly shows which actions can reduce consumption.
''Simply making energy usage visible can have an impact,'' said Dan Yates, chief executive of Opower, a company that provides monthly home-energy reports to about 11 million households across the country on behalf of local utility companies. The report compares the home's energy consumption with previous months, compares it with neighboring homes, and offers tips on saving energy like replacing inefficient light bulbs or taking shorter showers.
Those 11 million households that received the reports averaged annual energy savings of 2 to 3 percent, enough energy to power a city the size of Orlando for a year, according to company-sponsored research. According to that research, the results were consistent among various demographic groups and whether the motivation was saving money or saving the planet.
''Bottom line is people don't like to waste,'' said Mr. Yates, ''especially when you show them their usage compared to norms, like similar homes in the neighborhood.''
Getting immediate feedback from an in-home display like Mr. Dunn's, rather than a monthly mailer, can increase these savings, according to research by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research and educational group.
The group recently analyzed results from several pilot programs, most of them utility-sponsored, in which homeowners used monitors to track their energy consumption. Participants in these pilots reduced their energy bills by an average of 4 percent, with those in the most successful program saving close to 20 percent.
Ben Foster, a senior analyst at the council, said the programs that provided the best results did a better job of engaging the customer, and that ''engagement seems to be enabled by the types of information provided by the device.'' For example, customers were more engaged, he said, when they could learn from the device how their homes used energy and whether their conservation efforts were having an effect.
Understanding how people will use the feedback is the goal of a pilot program just introduced by Pacific Gas & Electric, the utility that serves most of Northern California.
In March, the company began installing energy monitors with 500 volunteer homeowners. The monitor pulls current use data from the power meter every 20 seconds. The display offers a set of gauges similar to a car's dashboard.
A so-called speedometer shows how much electricity the home is using at that moment. When the speedometer needle moves into the red zone, the home is close to its peak levels in relation to the previous 30-day period. Another gauge shows the current price of the electricity, and it will change colors when the amount of use puts the home into a higher-priced tier.
''Energy usage data is complex,'' said Steve Malnight, the company's vice president for customer energy solutions. ''But when you see it on the speedometer and can judge if it's too high, especially when the price is higher, you can take action like turning off lights or turning down the air-conditioner.''
Using these types of monitors will be voluntary for homeowners, said Mr. Malnight, but he said he expected the technologies to play a crucial role in the utility's conservation efforts.
''Only when you are aware can you take action,'' Mr. Malnight said, ''and any time you can shorten the loop between taking action and getting feedback, you will see better results.''

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Udell, 55, is the president of Weichert Commercial Brokerage and Weichert New Home, which focuses on new residential developments like 77 Hudson in Jersey City. This year he celebrated his 20th anniversary at the company.
Interview conducted and condensed by
VIVIAN MARINO 
Q.You wear two hats at Weichert.
A. Yes, I do. They are two separate affiliated companies.
But even though I lead these two business units, I always try to stay in touch with the point of sale. So I enjoy being invited to go on some pitches and try to win some business.
Q.Speaking of business, how are sales going at some of the new residential developments you represent?
A. So far, we're over 25 percent from where we were last year -- year over year -- for new development sales. We've been enjoying anywhere from 20 to 40 sales a month, and in some cases higher.
Q.What percentage of these projects are in the New York area?
A. I'd say 90 percent of our business is in the New York metropolitan area. We're representing K. Hovnanian in Jersey City at 77 Hudson and we're representing 40 Park in Morristown, N.J. It's an area that's doing very well.
Q.You seem optimistic about the spring selling season.
A. Sales are more promising this spring since the last time we enjoyed the market -- you can say May 2005 marked the big change, but it's still carried through 2006.
Q.How are prices?
A. Well, they're more stable. We've had to make price adjustments -- we like to call them price improvements.
77 Hudson is in line right now for a price increase, because we've had tremendous demand. We're going through the process where we're going to determine what that price increase is and when. Prices now are from the high $400,000s for a one-bedroom to over $2 million for a three-bedroom.
Q.What effects have the stabilized prices had on financing?
A. Because the price deflation is no longer happening and the prices are no longer going down, the appraisals are coming in satisfactory, and so financing is easier. It's far from the way it used to be, but the institutions have gotten a little bit more liberal in their financing. With that said, we still have a lot of cash purchases -- more so than we've had in any given market. About 30 to 40 percent are cash purchasers.
Q.Let's put on your commercial hat now. How much of Weichert's business is in commercial property?
A. It's funny, each hat I might switch off during the day.
Commercial is a small portion, obviously, because the residential portion is so large. But I don't have that number for you, quite frankly.
Q.You don't represent any specific properties in Manhattan, do you?
A. Our Manhattan work has been exclusively tenant representation. They're exclusively corporate clients. We represented Anheuser-Busch for their 250 Park Avenue offices and Axis Reinsurance for 1211 Avenue of the Americas. And we're working in partnership through our core affiliate on a couple of sublets right now on Park Avenue.
Q.Is it your goal to eventually represent developers?
A. No. We have expansion goals for Manhattan. The way that we expand our company is through good people. We added 11 new associates last year, and we're actually looking to double that number this year.
Q.Are you as optimistic about the commercial market as you were about residential?
A. I'm very optimistic on both the commercial and residential. At the end of last year was a fantastic quarter for us. The beginning of the year was very quiet so I spent a lot of time trying to look at the different segments and trying to figure out what the slowdown was attributed to.
So I talked to executives at companies: the only thing we've been able to determine was that they were going to take their time before they began their search this year. I told my team, ''Don't fret. I know it's quiet right now.'' I told them to write down Feb. 1, because that's when I felt the activity will start. I was a week off.
Q.What drew you to real estate?
A. I feel like I was born and bred in real estate. When I was a young kid, I was on the back of a truck with my dad; he was a builder.
He later bought a ski area in Rockaway Township. It was called Craigmeur Ski Area. I used to be a ski racer. I used to ski seven or eight months a year. This year it was almost impossible to go anywhere to ski.

HEADLINE: Denny's Uses Web Series to Speak to Young Adults

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
THE commercials showing now for Denny's depict homey restaurants where waitresses call customers ''Hon'' and feature the slogan ''America's Diner Is Always Open.'' The campaign, by Gotham, New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, is humorous but far from edgy, befitting a family restaurant.
But in an effort to pitch Denny's to consumers aged 18 to 25, the company is producing a Web series that strikes a decidedly more provocative tone. 
The series, ''Always Open'' features the comedian Dave Koechner, the ''Saturday Night Live'' alumnus and a star of movies including ''Anchorman,'' who interviews celebrities while they share a booth at a Denny's. ''You climbed Mount Kilimanjaro,'' Mr. Koechner tells his guest, the actress Jessica Biel, in a new video. ''Let's say we're trapped on the mountain together, both of us, we're freezing, and we need to share bodily warmth. Do you think it would get romantic?''
In a video scheduled to be introduced on June 6 featuring Andy Richter, the comedian and Conan O'Brien sidekick, Mr. Koechner presents him with a plate squirted with ketchup and mustard and explains it is a Rorschach test.
Mr. Richter puts on reading glasses and ponders the plate. He slaps Mr. Koechner. ''How dare you?'' says Mr. Richter. ''I told you that in confidence!''
The unscripted videos, between three and four minutes long, are released on CollegeHumor.com and on Denny's Facebook page. Conceived by Gotham, they are produced by DumbDumb, a production company headed by the actors Jason Bateman and Will Arnett. DumbDumb produces branded content, marketing parlance for videos that feature brands but eschew overt sales pitches.
In the videos, set in a Denny's on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, the only direct reference to the brand is in the closing seconds of the episodes, which feature its logo and slogan.
''Always Open'' installments, which began appearing online in March 2011, include interviews with Mr. Bateman and Mr. Arnett. They collectively have more than six million views.
Also featured is the comedian Sarah Silverman, who makes a casual reference to an embarrassing medical problem. Such talk in a Denny's commercial might infuriate some consumers, but the company reports receiving no negative responses from any videos.
Frances Allen, chief marketing officer for Denny's, said the brand avoided controversy by releasing videos on CollegeHumor.com, where much content is provocative.
''We're really tight with our targeting, and that is why we home in on CollegeHumor.com,'' Ms. Allen said. ''Being mindful of not being offensive, brands have to take the guardrails off a little.''
Engaging younger consumers, who flit from screen to screen, can confound advertisers. According to a study commissioned by Time Inc., and cited in Advertising Age, during nonworking hours, consumers in their 20s switch their attention from one media device to another an average of 27 times an hour.
The Web videos, in contrast, represent an ''engaging brand moment for millennials,'' said Ms. Allen, using a term for those born around the early 1980s to mid-1990s. Even without highlighting the menu, she continued, the series ''communicates our brand message that diners are really welcoming places where everyone can come as they are.''
Denny's, which declined to reveal the cost of the effort, spent $63.9 million on advertising in 2011, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.
With about 1,680 restaurants in the United States and abroad, the company was hobbled by the recession but appears to be recovering. Same-restaurant sales dropped 5.2 percent in 2009 from the previous year, and another 3.7 percent in 2010, but they increased 0.7 percent in 2011.
Another common industry measure, average guest check, rose 0.6 percent in 2011 after declining 1.7 percent in 2010.
''I love commercials and think that the hacky cliche of them being 'mini movies' is really true,'' said Mr. Bateman. The actor, who appeared with Mr. Arnett in the television comedy ''Arrested Development,'' said he was an ''aspiring filmmaker'' but lacked the aptitude for conventional commercials.
DumbDumb, which is two years old, let him cut his teeth on directing comedy sketches and improvisation, which ''is something that I didn't feel apologetic about asking for the keys to,'' Mr. Batemen said.
That guests on the show do not gush about Denny's is a practical matter as well as an aesthetic one.
''Not only would that be distasteful to me and the friends we're soliciting, but it also would trigger an endorsement fee,'' said Mr. Bateman. ''Quite frankly, the people we're asking to play with us wouldn't be open to that, and the brand wouldn't be open to paying that.''
If Denny's ''had been more heavy-handed with pushing an offer, they may not have had the same level of distribution with the content,'' said Teal Newland, vice president of sales at StumbleUpon, a site for discovering and sharing Web material.
Ms. Newland said that rather than banking on the videos going viral based on entertainment alone, Denny's takes the more effective approach of releasing them on CollegeHumor.com, where they will find a likely audience, and working with performers popular on social media. (Among those who have tweeted about the videos are Ms. Silverman, with 2.8 million Twitter followers, Mr. Arnett, with 523,000, and Mr. Bateman, with 504,000.)
''If you want to reach millennials, you want to go where they're living online,'' she said. ''You want a very tight distribution plan to be baked in the moment you start concepting the show.''

HEADLINE: A Chef Whose Touch Will Last

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN

 BODY:
CHICAGO
THE first thing the chefs in Charlie Trotter's kitchen had my father do was peel a big pile of pearl onions.
''They told me a little secret: if you put them in a little warm water, it comes off easier,'' he would recall years later. ''Then they let me pick some parsley leaves off the twigs of parsley. They said, 'Charlie doesn't like any of these stems.'
''I said, 'You know, I've had a knife in my hand before.' ''
Indeed, my father's first job was at Cohen's Deli on Nantasket Beach, near Boston, where he started as a busboy at 15 but soon graduated to counterman. He met my mother slicing corned beef at the Langley Delicatessen in Newton, Mass. (and proposed to her in a booth). He drove trucks for food companies, had his own butcher business for decades, gives lavish dinners for holidays. He practically lives with a knife in his hand. But, no, he had never peeled pearl onions before that afternoon in the summer of 2006. 
That was when Dad became one of some 4,000 people over the years to serve as Chef for a Day at Charlie Trotter's, part of a charity program that has raised millions of dollars for Chicago causes.
So when Mr. Trotter announced on New Year's Day that his legendary restaurant would close in August, on its 25th anniversary, it seemed to me that Chicago might feel the absence most at its galas and balls. During my five years living there, Chef for a Day was auctioned at virtually every charity event, for autism and affordable housing, museums and mammograms, this synagogue or that sports league. But I can hardly remember anyone I knew talking about actually eating there.
There is no doubt that Mr. Trotter, 52, has had a huge and lasting impact on the city's culinary landscape, if not the nation's. First, by pioneering the meticulous, indulgent and seemingly endless degustation menus that are now a staple of high-end dining, then by training legions of innovative cooks -- Grant Achatz, Graham Elliot Bowles, Giuseppe Tentori, Michael Carlson -- who spawned the restaurants where everyone I knew did eat.
But about 60 percent of Trotter's patrons live outside Chicago. Ray Harris, who has consumed more than 400 meals there (''And never had the same dish twice,'' Mr. Trotter loves to point out), is an investment banker in New York.
The food is still sublime, the service impeccable, the overall experience astounding (if astronomically priced). And yet, as a 40-something friend who has lived almost his whole life in or around Chicago but has never been to Trotter's, put it, ''It seems like he's been yesterday for so many years.''
Jeff Ruby, Chicago magazine's restaurant critic, summed it up this way: ''In the Mount Rushmore of Chicago, his face would probably be up there: Michael Jordan, Al Capone, Charlie Trotter, Mayor Daley -- and they'd all be scowling. The irony is, people haven't been there in a long time. People have kind of moved on in a way.''
Many such people viewed Mr. Trotter's plan to trade his monogrammed chef's coat for elbow-patched tweed and pursue a graduate degree in philosophy as evidence that the culinary moment had passed him by -- proof that this chef who had revolutionized the American restaurant experience could no longer keep up with his proteges, that the recession had indeed hit hard, that he was getting stale.
In an interview, Mr. Trotter acknowledged that business has been down 15 to 20 percent in the last few years, after what he described as ''20 consecutive years of growth,'' but insisted his decision was about none of these things.
''On our worst day, we're still in the top three restaurants in America,'' he said (then added, ''I don't want to sound arrogant when I say that'').
''I love what I do. It's very glamorous. It's unbelievably lucrative. But that's not good enough.
''I don't ever want to lose that mind-set where you've got to be able to realize different ideas-slash-fantasies-slash-possibilities in your life.''
Stories abound of Chef Trotter as a tyrant in the kitchen; this is not one of those stories. To me and my dad -- who lives in Newton but has eaten at the restaurant perhaps a dozen times over the last two decades -- he has been utterly charming and generous.
''He took me all the way through to every station in the kitchen and all the way down to the wine cellar,'' Dad recalled of an early visit that included a guided tour. ''He had a different refrigerator for vegetables and for meat, because he keeps the vegetables at a different temperature.''
When my dad turned 60, in 2000, I compiled a cookbook, asking for recipes from foodies and chefs he knew or admired, writers and restaurants he favored and frequented. Mr. Trotter sent one for grilled lamb loin and balsamic red onion salad with artichoke vinaigrette, with the handwritten message, ''You're not getting older, you're getting better!''
I moved to Chicago the next year, and shortly afterward was roundly outbid for Chef for a Day at a charity event. And so it went at umpteen auctions for the next five years, with bidding always starting above my pay grade and sometimes hitting five figures. Then I went to my nephew's public-school auction, where my sister and I managed to steal the prize for $600-something.
''I could see when I got there that the average person that buys this thing, they're worried that they don't know anything about the kitchen,'' Dad recalled. ''They kept asking me if I wanted to sit down, if I wanted to relax.''
After the pearl onions and the parsley, he stood at the appetizer station, helping assemble a dish he remembers as having ''seven or nine steps,'' with ''a piece of tuna poached in a bag, chopped parsley, soft-cooked egg.'' They gave him a white coat, poured him Champagne, took lots of pictures. And then seven members of our family joined him for a dinner that cost about as much as a small car.
Mr. Trotter said he came up with the Chef for a Day concept early on, out of concern for the bottom line: Charities were constantly asking him to donate dinners for six or eight, when he was doing maybe 100 covers a night. ''Do you call General Motors and say, 'Can you donate 6 to 8 percent of your business?' '' he asked.
As with so many of Mr. Trotter's innovations, other restaurants soon adopted the practice, and wealthy would-be chefs were picking up paring knives all over the place. Next, Mr. Trotter started auctioning Dinner in Your Home: he and his team would fly around the country to cook for the highest bidder. He has done maybe 150 of these in the last four years, plus 30 more in his town house a couple of blocks from the restaurant. They go for five- or six-figure sums; once, he said, after a bidding war to $180,000, he agreed to do two dinners, netting $360,000 for his friend Emeril Lagasse's children's foundation.
''We're in the mind-blowing business,'' he said. ''Always have been.''
Most nights when the restaurant is open, Mr. Trotter also hosts 15 to 20 students from local high schools, who are served the Grand Menu (current retail price: $195) in a private dining room as they watch the action next door on large screens.
And then there are the quieter acts of kindness. Once a week or so, Mr. Trotter said, he or one of his employees will spot a bedraggled person in the neighborhood and extend a lunch invitation.
''We put their carts in the garage,'' he explained. ''We make sure they wash their hands. We sit them down at the kitchen table. We give them an eight-course meal.'' And, yes, offer a glass (or three) of red or white. ''They're out there in the cold weather, scrounging through Dumpsters,'' Mr. Trotter said. ''Why not give them a little wine?''
Ah, wine. Mr. Trotter has 26,000 bottles at the restaurant (plus another 1,500 in the cellar at home, where a couple of cans of Pepsi and a partly drunk bottle of blue Gatorade share the shelves). What will become of the collection when the restaurant closes, I wondered?
''I did a mathematical calculation,'' he said. ''If I live to the average life expectancy of the American male -- 78.9 -- and I consume one bottle of wine every day, I should consume the last bottle on my last day on this planet.''
Is that how he timed the decision to cut bait? ''That factored into it,'' he said.
Mr. Trotter's math is way off, but the fact that he seems to have made no moves to sell the wine -- or, for that matter, the twin town houses he bought in the 1980s for $3 million apiece that house the restaurant and offices -- has many foodies wondering if this philosophy thing isn't just a brief hiatus before he returns with a newfangled establishment.
The chef insists he is serious about school, but he is by no means giving up food. He plans to continue giving corporate speeches (''This is like printing money,'' he said); writing cookbooks (he has done 14); and maybe making Dinners in Your Home (or his).
''It's always there,'' he said of the restaurant business. ''What if I do something for two years and I don't like it? I can always get back in.''
Since the announcement, Mr. Trotter said, there has been an uptick in reservations, though the night I was there, one of the three dining rooms was dark. He said he had received a call from Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who said he had never eaten at the restaurant and wants to. Mr. Emanuel's predecessor, Richard M. Daley, who has dined at Trotter's, promised to bring the family in one last time. There's talk the Obamas might even come, though it's a very 1 percent venue for an election year.
Mr. Harris, the dean of the regulars, has taken a table for every night of the last week and asked to be the restaurant's final customer: ''If he seats people at 9 o'clock, I want to be seated at 9:02,'' he said in an interview. Steven Greystone, a Boston wine consultant who has logged some 200 meals, plans to use the occasion to open a melchior -- that's an 18-liter bottle, the equivalent of two cases -- of L'Ermita, one of two 1995 bottles from the Spanish vintner Palacios that he gave Mr. Trotter years ago.
My dad, my sister, her husband and I went back recently for our own farewell dinner at the kitchen table, where there were 19 courses for $250 a head (plus $175 a person for the wine pairing). Each plate had innumerable components, dust of this and pickle of that; I seem to recall pearls of some sort. Each was presented by four servers with immaculate precision, and the chefs came around to chat whenever we had questions.
It was a delightful evening, remarkable, special -- although not at all unlike the other meals we've had there, and in that way, inevitably, less astounding. A little yesterday.
''Is this the end?'' my dad asked the executive chef, Michael Rotondo, as the third panoply of desserts -- criollo cake with merlot jelly and candied vanilla; guava and caramelized white chocolate with pink peppercorn meringue -- landed in front of him.
''It's never the end,'' Mr. Rotondo said.

HEADLINE: Brazil, Where Oil and Women Mix Powerfully

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO
THE global oil industry has long been a male-dominated bastion, represented in the popular imagination by real gulf sheiks and fictional swaggerers like J. R. Ewing in ''Dallas.'' But an exception to this rule has emerged in Brazil, Latin America's rising oil power, where women now occupy the most powerful positions in the nation's booming energy industry.
In a matter of weeks this year, Maria das Gracas Foster, a longtime chemical engineer, rose to the top job at Petrobras, Brazil's state-controlled oil company, and Magda Chambriard was nominated to lead the National Petroleum Agency, which regulates Brazil's oil sector.
Placing women in such commanding positions is a priority of President Dilma Rousseff, the first woman to lead Brazil. Ms. Rousseff, who visited the United States this week, is a former energy minister who headed Petrobras's board for seven years during the administration of her predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. 
''She knows the industry very well, and can be extremely demanding,'' Ms. Foster said in an interview here of Ms. Rousseff, an economist about whom tales of browbeating of subordinates are legend, giving Brazilian comedians ample material for skits. ''When she calls, I need to have the answer on the tip of my tongue,'' Ms. Foster said.
There aren't many examples of women rising high in the energy industry. Within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Diezani Alison-Madueke, the oil minister of Nigeria, is a woman. In the United States, Lynn Elsenhans was Sunoco's chief executive for four years before stepping down this year. The chief executive of Pertamina, Malaysia's oil company, and the head of Schlumberger Asia, a branch of the oil-field services company, are also women.
But running Petrobras, charged with exploiting vast new oil discoveries deep offshore, is another matter. The company, created 58 years ago and led in its early years by Walter Link, an American oilman, is investing by some estimates more in inflation-adjusted terms than NASA did in the 1960s to put a man on the moon, to produce oil from reserves found under miles of water, rock, sand and salt.
''The program that Petrobras is launching is both critical for Brazil and the global market,'' said Daniel Yergin, author of ''The Quest,'' a new book about the international energy industry. ''She sees the big picture and, at the same time, pays close attention to the details,'' he said of its new head. ''She will quickly become known as one of the most important people in the world oil industry, and certainly the most important and influential woman in the business worldwide.''
If Petrobras is able to meet its own ambitious production goals by the 2020s, Brazil could catapult past Latin America's oil powerhouses, Mexico and Venezuela, into the top ranks of global producers. Ventures with Petrobras are already making Rio's economy sizzle, with droves of foreign oilmen driving up rents in exclusive seaside districts like Ipanema and Leblon.
Ms. Foster, on the other hand, still lives in an apartment in Copacabana, a less lustrous area hemmed in by big apartment blocks and hillside favelas, or slums. She stands out as an anomaly in the oil patch, not just as the mother of two adult children but because she chooses not even to own a car. Taxi drivers in Copacabana often call out to her with a cheer, ''the lady with the fuel,'' trying to get her business.
She was born 58 years ago, about the time Petrobras was conceived to reduce Brazil's dependence on foreign oil. In the 1950s, her parents moved from the interior of the neighboring state of Minas Gerais to Rio, where they lived in Morro do Adeus, a poor hillside area that now is part of Complexo do Alemao, a collection of favelas occupied by Brazilian security forces.
As an 8-year-old, she contributed to her family's meager income by working as a trash recycler, collecting discarded cans and paper. She said she had also earned money by writing and reading letters for her neighbors, a family of immigrants from Portugal.
After attending public schools here, she became an intern at Petrobras while studying chemical engineering at the Federal Fluminense University. Then she was lured away into postgraduate studies in nuclear engineering, at a time when Brazil was developing its nuclear energy capacity. But she balked at the prospect of spending five years in Germany to delve further into the field, so she returned to Petrobras. Once back at the company, she never left, rising through a series of management posts and obtaining an M.B.A. at Fundacao Getulio Vargas, an elite Brazilian university.
In 1998, while working for a Petrobras unit involved in a pipeline to import natural gas from Bolivia, she met Ms. Rousseff, then an obscure energy official in Rio Grande do Sul, a southern Brazilian state. Ms. Foster, a supporter of the leftist Workers Party, which has been in power in Brazil since 2002, saw eye-to-eye ideologically with Ms. Rousseff, a Marxist guerrilla in her youth; they both are now committed to welcoming foreign investment in Brazil's oil industry and exposing Petrobras to market forces.
When the former president, Mr. da Silva, appointed Ms. Rousseff to his cabinet as Brazil's energy minister, she named Ms. Foster as one of her top aides in Brasilia, the capital. After serving in that position for two years, she chose to return to more hands-on responsibilities at Petrobras. ''My business,'' she said, ''is oil and gas.''
Shares in Petrobras jumped nearly 4 percent on the day in January she was named as chief executive, replacing the economist Jose Sergio Gabrielli. But important challenges await her.
Already, she is facing the scrutiny of Brazil's media, arguably Latin America's most aggressive in questioning the power structures at large companies like Petrobras. The newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported in 2010 that a company controlled by Ms. Foster's husband, Colin Foster, a Briton who has long lived in Brazil, had won numerous contracts since 2007 worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to supply Petrobras with electronic equipment.
Petrobras has denied any wrongdoing, contending that none of the acquisitions was carried out by the unit, gas and energy, under Ms. Foster's command.
In addition, a company spokeswoman said in a written reply to questions about these contracts that Petrobras had made only ''small purchases'' from 2005 to 2010 from Mr. Foster's company.
The company's shares have slumped more than 30 percent over the last year as concerns persist about a range of issues, from delays in procuring ships from Brazilian shipyards for Petrobras's offshore operations to the costs associated with selling gasoline domestically at relatively low prices and importing refined products from abroad.
The most pressing challenge of all at Petrobras, perhaps, may be in meeting expectations of raising output to an estimated 4.5 million barrels a day, from 2.3 million. Doing so will require guiding Petrobras, Latin America's largest company, past equipment bottlenecks, the development of complex new drilling technologies and concerns over spills at offshore fields.
''We're working to get there,'' Ms. Foster said about meeting Petrobras's output goals.
Naming Ms. Foster to lead Petrobras is just one example of Ms. Rousseff's push to place women in the highest levels of government since taking office last year. Her 38-member cabinet includes 10 women in ministerial posts, including her chief of staff, Gleisi Hoffmann, and Ideli Salvatti, who manages the administration's delicate relations with a Congress of uncertain loyalties.
While Ms. Rousseff maintains a high approval rating of more than 70 percent, reactions to her nominations have been mixed. Evangelical Christian leaders recently lashed out at Eleonora Menicucci, the minister for women's affairs, over her support of abortion in cases of rape or in which a woman's health is at risk. And in 2011, the defense minister, Nelson Jobim, questioned Ms. Salvatti, the minister of institutional relations, calling her ''very weak'' in published remarks. Ms. Rousseff responded by quickly removing Mr. Jobim from his post, replacing him with Celso Amorim, a former minister of foreign affairs.
Ms. Foster said she was well aware of the challenges awaiting her as a woman leading an oil company with 82,100 employees in a male-dominated industry. She said she welcomed a certain degree of confrontation, even if it took place in the executive suite.
''The best people to work with me are those who interrupt me, even question me,'' she said. ''If I'm speaking loudly, speak louder. When you discuss, you have an environment that's more intense, that's actually warmer, where you arrive at the best solutions for the company.''

HEADLINE: Natural Gas Signals a 'Manufacturing Renaissance'

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
AS horizontal drilling and the controversial extraction technique known as fracking have made domestically produced natural gas more available and sharply cheaper, that gas has been widely embraced by industry, electric utilities and trucking fleets.
The rapid development of shale gas technology has helped reduce energy imports and, in some cases, encouraged companies producing petrochemicals, steel, fertilizers and other products to return to the United States after relocating overseas. Natural gas exports are growing and terminals built to hold imported supplies are being repurposed for international sales.
The American petrochemical industry, for example, uses natural gas as both its primary raw material, in the form of liquid ethane, and as an energy fuel. And cheaper prices have led to a major expansion of capacity in the United States.
The hydrocarbon molecules in natural gas are split apart and then recombined as building blocks for many products, including bulk chemicals and fertilizers. The chemical ethylene, which is largely derived from natural gas, is used to make things like pool liners, building insulation and food packaging. 
According to Kevin Swift, chief economist at the American Chemistry Council, European producers mostly use oil-derived raw materials for making these same products. ''The U.S. has a competitive advantage when oil is seven times as expensive as natural gas, but now we have more like a 50-to-1 advantage,'' he said. ''The 'shale gale' is really driving this. A million B.T.U.'s of natural gas that might cost $11 in Europe and $14 in South Korea is $2.25 in the U.S. Partly because of that, chemical producers have plans to expand ethylene capacity in the U.S. by more than 25 percent between now and 2017.''
A 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers study estimates that high rates of shale gas recovery could result in a million new manufacturing jobs by 2025. Robert McCutcheon, United States industrial products leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said in a statement that the revived natural gas industry ''has the potential to spark a manufacturing renaissance in the U.S., including billions in cost savings, a significant number of new jobs and a greater investment in U.S. plants.''
The growing commitment to natural gas faces some headwinds because of continuing concern over the safety of fracking, which involves forcing pressurized fluids into shale formations to fracture the rock and release the gas deposits.
Some environmentalists say that fracking can cause drinking water to become contaminated with chemicals and released methane, which is a powerful naturally occurring greenhouse gas and the primary ingredient in natural gas. Other complaints tie the disposal of fracking wastewater to a series of small earthquakes. Some states and municipalities with questions about fracking have imposed temporary moratoriums on the extraction technique.
Despite these issues, natural gas is expanding its reach in manufacturing. The Nucor Corporation, which makes direct-reduced iron in a process heavily reliant on natural gas, said in 2010 that it would build a $750 million facility in Louisiana. In 2004, the company dismantled a similar Louisiana plant and shipped it to Trinidad.
According to Nucor, affordable domestic natural gas means its made-in-Louisiana direct-reduced iron, which is sold in pellet or briquette form as a raw material for steel mills, can be delivered at the same price as the product shipped from Trinidad. ''Affordable American shale gas has completely changed the economics for us,'' said Katherine Miller, a Nucor spokeswoman.
Methanex, a Canadian company that makes methanol from natural gas is planning to move a plant from Chile to Louisiana, with production to begin in 2014. Gary Rowan, a Methanex vice president, said that his company had also shut down a Louisiana plant in the early 2000s. ''Certainly, the outlook for low North American natural gas prices is one of the reasons we selected Louisiana as a new location for our methanol plant,'' he said.
Electric utilities see a significant natural gas price advantage over other fuels, but because of pending and potential environmental regulations they are also motivated by its status as the fossil fuel with the lowest carbon emissions. On March 27, the Obama administration proposed the first-ever rule to limit greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants. Natural gas plants are expected to meet the standard, but coal burners will have a much harder time. ''The electricity sector is the principal growth area for natural gas under carbon dioxide emission constraints,'' said an M.I.T. study titled ''The Future of Natural Gas.''
Another advantage, according to Richard McMahon, a vice president of finance and energy supply at the Edison Electric Institute, is that natural gas plants are cheaper to build than coal plants.
''Natural gas generally has a smaller footprint,'' he said. ''Coal plants need to store coal, but natural gas plants get their fuel from a pipeline and don't need physical storage.'' The Obama greenhouse rules would widen the price gap by requiring new coal plants to include carbon capture technology.
The United States still has a big investment in coal plants, and a transition will be gradual. The federal Energy Information Administration estimates that electricity generation from natural gas will increase about 9 percent in 2012, at the same time that coal production declines almost 5 percent. If there is a constraint on utility commitment to natural gas, it is the fuel's history of large price fluctuations.
Thomas Farrell, chairman and chief executive of Dominion Resources, a utility that delivers electric power and natural gas to four states, describes natural gas as ''very volatile in its pricing. We're a utility whose customers rely on us to think through 60-year power plant investments, and we've found that the best approach is to have diverse sources and not depend on one predominant source of fuel.''
But he added that the company was definitely benefiting from low natural gas prices now. Dominion Virginia Power's 13 percent natural gas electricity production in 2010 jumped to 17 percent in 2011. The company recently completed a natural gas plant and is constructing another, but it also has large nuclear and coal investments.
The share of natural gas as a transportation fuel has never been large, but it is growing rapidly. Refueling is an issue, because there are about 1,000 natural gas stations in the United States (compared with nearly 160,000 gasoline stations) and only half of those are open to the public. Only one automaker, Honda, sells a natural gas passenger car on the American market, and consumers are unlikely to buy them in large numbers any time soon. But the opportunities for truck fleets are quite different.
Almost 40 percent of new garbage trucks and 25 percent of new transit buses can run on natural gas, said the trade organization Natural Gas Vehicles for America. Dan Ustian, chief executive of the truck maker Navistar, said that garbage truck number could grow to 50 percent by the end of next year. Navistar is also building long-range trucks.
Although natural gas cars and small trucks usually run on compressed natural gas, known as C.N.G., to avoid frequent refueling, the larger trucks will mostly use the liquefied form, L.N.G., which has much greater energy density per volume (but must be kept at very cold ''cryogenic'' temperatures).
Mr. Ustian estimates that, because of quick paybacks with a $1.50 a gallon equivalent price advantage, natural gas could capture 10 percent to 20 percent of the new tractor-trailer vehicle market within a year.
Chrysler, Ford and General Motors have all recently introduced ''bifuel'' pickup trucks that can run on both natural gas and gasoline. To ensure that such trucks have a place to fill up, Navistar has joined with a natural gas provider, Clean Energy Fuels, and Pilot-Flying J Travel Centers to locate stations 250 miles apart along Interstates. By the end of the year, Clean Energy hopes to have 75 stations open in 33 states.
Andrew Littlefair, president and chief executive of Clean Energy, said that the aim was to make natural gas refueling available on the major trucking corridors. ''You don't need 23,000 truck stops with natural gas,'' he said. ''You need hundreds in the right places and you can move a lot of fuel. These stations will be where the trucks go now, and the economics look very good.''
In March, Chesapeake Energy, a major natural gas producer, and General Electric said they would collaborate on developing natural gas infrastructure for vehicles, including construction of more than 250 C.N.G. stations beginning this fall.
The prospects exist for American producers to become significant natural gas exporters. In 2011, Dominion won approval from the Energy Department to export L.N.G. from its Cove Point terminal in the Chesapeake Bay to about 20 countries that have free trade agreements with the United States. It has applied for a permit to service the rest of the world. Dominion said that its terminal work force -- initially intended to handle imports before the United States became a powerhouse producer -- could nearly double with the added workload.
''It's definitely ironic,'' Mr. Farrell said. ''Ten years ago, even the futurists wouldn't have predicted that we'd be exporting natural gas today.''

HEADLINE: China Scandal's Latest Twist Revives Case of Dead Briton

BYLINE: By SHARON LAFRANIERE, JOHN F. BURNS and JONATHAN ANSFIELD.; Sharon LaFraniere and Jonathan Ansfield reported from Beijing, and John F. Burns from London. Ravi Somaiya contributed reporting from London, and Michael Wines from Beijing. Edy Lin, Li Bibo and Mai Li contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The mysterious death of a 41-year-old British businessman in a Chongqing hotel room late last year was thrust to the center of the biggest political scandal to hit China's Communist Party in a generation on Tuesday, as the authorities declared the death a murder and named the wife of one of China's most powerful men the leading suspect.
The death of the businessman, Neil Heywood, initially attributed to alcohol poisoning, is now considered an ''intentional homicide,'' the Xinhua news agency announced. That made the case the most sensational in a series of charges against the family of Bo Xilai, who was until March the Chongqing party chief and seen as one of the handful of rising leaders slated to run China.
On Tuesday, Mr. Bo was suspended from his post on the Politburo, the 25-member body that runs China, and from the larger Central Committee, on suspicion of serious disciplinary infractions, the government announced. His wife, Gu Kailai, who is a lawyer, was being investigated in the killing of Mr. Heywood. 
Not since the purges after the crackdown on democracy protests in 1989 has the Chinese leadership been exposed to so much turmoil. Excruciatingly for top officials, who prize unity and secrecy above all, this one involves foreigners in an embarrassingly intrusive way -- both the death of a British citizen and also the attempt by a senior police official to seek American asylum.
That official, Wang Lijun, a onetime close aide to Mr. Bo who was himself under investigation for corruption, fled to the consulate of the United States in Chengdu in February and spent more than 30 hours there. He said Mr. Heywood had been poisoned and revealed what he knew about the death -- and about jockeying for power inside the country's closed political system, several people briefed on the matter said.
Although he handed over a treasure trove of intelligence, Mr. Wang was told he could not be granted asylum. He left the consulate and was taken into custody, where he has been since.
Mr. Bo has also been under some form of confinement since mid-March, and his wife, too, has been detained. No one representing any of the three could be reached for comment.
Mr. Heywood was an elusive business consultant who married a Chinese woman and carved a lucrative career in Beijing and Chongqing while keeping other British businessmen guessing about how he made much of his money, and he hinted of deep links to the Bo family.
When his body was found in a hotel room on Nov. 15 in Chongqing, the ''alcohol-poisoning'' death certificate was issued, although friends said Mr. Heywood rarely drank. His relatives said that they had been told he died of a heart attack, and that the body was cremated with their consent, without autopsy.
The announcement of an ''intentional homicide'' appeared to surprise the British government, which had seemed anxious in recent weeks to distance itself from a major Chinese political scandal, saying that suspicions about the death they had passed to the Chinese were those of other Britons in China, not anything they could substantiate on their own.
After an urgent huddle with other British officials, William Hague, the British foreign minister, told reporters in London: ''It's a death that needs to be investigated, on its own terms and on its own merits, without political considerations. So I hope they will go about it in that way, and I welcome the fact that there will be an investigation.''
Xinhua's statement appeared to confirm one of the swirling rumors in the case, that Mr. Heywood's death was linked to business dealings gone awry. The Chinese news agency said Ms. Gu and her son, Bo Guagua, had had close relations with Mr. Heywood but later had ''a conflict over economic interests.'' But Xinhua did not specify how Mr. Heywood died, or what business interests were involved. The only other suspect in his death, Zhang Xiaojun, was described as an ''orderly'' working in Mr. Bo's home.
The shock of the Chinese announcement -- claiming that a member of the ruling elite was linked through his wife to a possible murder, and that the killing grew out of private business interests of the kind that have made many Chinese officials rich -- had far-reaching implications for the way that China is governed. The impact was amplified since China is facing a once-in-a-decade shift in power this fall to a new generation of leaders. Mr. Bo, 62, had become a contender for a seat in the inner sanctum of power, the nine-member standing committee of the Communist Party's Politburo.
A charismatic figure, Mr. Bo tried to build his political stature by taking a page from the political playbook of Mao Zedong, presenting himself as a populist attuned to the interests of ordinary people and stirring up nostalgia for the hugely destructive Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and '70s, waged in the name of ordinary people against the Communist Party elite.
At the same time, Mr. Bo presided over a state-led economic boom in Chongqing, a provincial-level metropolitan region in southwestern China, and, detractors said, perverted the law enforcement process in what was billed as a campaign against organized crime. As the son of the legendary revolutionary leader Bo Yibo, he built a following among others with ties to Mao, as well as those unhappy with the get-rich-quick culture of recent decades -- among them, top generals and unreformed leftists in the Communist elite.
With Mr. Bo's disgrace, top power holders in Beijing seem to have quashed his bid for power.
''China is a socialist country ruled by law, and the sanctity and authority of law shall not be trampled,'' Xinhua said in its announcement of his ouster on Tuesday, attributing the remarks to unnamed senior officials. ''Whoever has broken the law will be handled in accordance with law and will not be tolerated, no matter who is involved.''
According to one person who said he was briefly shown a copy of confidential information for party officials that was circulated on Tuesday, Mr. Bo was faulted for failing to oversee underlings, a reference to Mr. Wang, and mismanaging his family, a reference to the Heywood case, and flouting party procedures in those and other cases.
Significantly, the party document did not suggest Mr. Bo was a murder suspect, but rather implied he could have had a role in trying to cover up the killing by obstructing attempts to report the case and stripping Mr. Wang's police powers without party authorization.
The murder investigation appears to be based on information provided by Mr. Wang, who as the top police official in Chongqing was one of Mr. Bo's closest aides -- until he sought refuge at the American consulate. Mr. Wang is now being investigated for treason for that, according to Chinese sources familiar with the case, but is being credited with having come forward with evidence in Mr. Heywood's death.
Before Mr. Heywood's death, Mr. Bo and Mr. Wang were already under scrutiny by central disciplinary authorities over corruption and other allegations, according to these sources, and to others with ties to senior party figures. If so, the evidence of a murder would have come as an opportune development in the inner-party struggle over the new leadership lineup.
During more than 30 hours spent at the consulate, Mr. Wang told officials that Ms. Gu had plotted to poison Mr. Heywood, and turned over a police file with highly technical documents, according to people knowledgeable about the case. But Mr. Wang, these people said, also apparently revealed far more: an unprecedented trove of knowledge on the leadership struggle.
A man answering the door on Tuesday at the London home of Mr. Heywood's mother, Ann Margaret Heywood, said she was not available for comment. But 10 days earlier, she rejected any suggestion that her son might have been murdered, insisting that he had a heart attack, like his father at age 63. ''I don't know where it comes from, this stuff about his being poisoned and so on,'' she said. ''This is not about Neil, this is about Chinese politics, and people's desire to write about Chinese politics. It is absolutely horrid to be caught up in this side of things.''
Friends of Mr. Heywood in Britain and China have said that his habit of giving little away about his business dealings left them with few clues as to what may have gone wrong in his dealings with Mr. Bo's wife, Ms. Gu.
A maverick who chain-smoked, drove a Jaguar and loved sailing with his wife and two children, Mr. Heywood told friends he met Mr. Bo in the northeastern city of Dalian, where Mr. Bo served as mayor and in other posts from 1993 to 2004. He told a friend, a British journalist named Tom Reed, that he sent out letters of self-introduction to a flock of officials and that Mr. Bo answered.
There also Mr. Heywood met Wang Lu, whom he married. Later on, Mr. Heywood told friends, he was instrumental in getting the Bos' son Guagua into his alma mater, Harrow, and in making the contacts that eased the son's way to Oxford.
Ms. Gu, who wrote a book about how she won a case in the United States, is listed as a partner in a Beijing law firm, but a spokesman there said she had not practiced at the firm for 10 years.
Mr. Reed said in an interview that the exact nature of Mr. Heywood's relations with the Bos was always unclear. ''I didn't get the impression it was anything commercial,'' Mr. Reed said. ''I got the impression it was much more informal.'' He said that three nights before Mr. Heywood's death, they met for dinner in suburban Beijing. Mr. Heywood said he had not seen Mr. Bo for about a year because of a falling out, and that back then ''someone in Bo's inner circle was talking against him because of fears of his influence over Bo.''
Mr. Heywood acknowledged that at one point he had been concerned, and even considered leaving China with his family, Mr. Reed said. But, Mr. Reed said: ''I got the impression that Bo had moved on, and Neil had moved on. He couldn't have seemed less worried.''

HEADLINE: Lenders Again Dealing Credit To Risky Clients

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Annette Alejandro just emerged from bankruptcy and doesn't have a job, and her car was repossessed last year. Still, after spending her days job hunting, she returns to her apartment in Brooklyn where, in disbelief, she sorts through the piles of credit card and auto loan offers that have come in the mail.
''Even I wouldn't make a loan to me at this point,'' Ms. Alejandro said.
In the depths of the financial crisis, borrowers with tarnished credit like Ms. Alejandro were almost entirely shut out by traditional lenders. It was hard enough for people with stellar credit to get loans. 
But as financial institutions recover from the losses on loans made to troubled borrowers, some of the largest lenders to the less than creditworthy, including Capital One and GM Financial, are trying to woo them back, while HSBC and JPMorgan Chase are among those tiptoeing again into subprime lending.
Credit card lenders gave out 1.1 million new cards to borrowers with damaged credit in December, up 12.3 percent from the same month a year earlier, according to Equifax's credit trends report released in March. These borrowers accounted for 23 percent of new auto loans in the fourth quarter of 2011, up from 17 percent in the same period of 2009, Experian, a credit scoring firm, said.
Consumer advocates and lawyers worry that the financial institutions are again preying on the most vulnerable and least financially sophisticated borrowers, who are often willing to take out credit at any cost.
''These people are addicted to credit, and banks are pushing it,'' said Charles Juntikka, a bankruptcy lawyer in Manhattan.
The banks, for their part, are looking to make up the billions in fee income wiped out by regulations enacted after the financial crisis by focusing on two parts of their business -- the high and the low ends -- industry consultants say. Subprime borrowers typically pay high interest rates, up to 29 percent, and often rack up fees for late payments.
Some former banking regulators said they worried that this kind of lending, even in its early stages, signaled a potentially dangerous return to the same risky lending that helped fuel the credit crisis.
''It's clear that we are returning to business as usual,'' said Mark T. Williams, a former Federal Reserve bank examiner.
The lenders argue that they have learned their lesson and are distinguishing between chronic deadbeats and what some in the industry call ''fallen angels,'' those who had good payment histories before falling behind as the economy foundered.
A spokesman for Chase, Steve O'Halloran, said the bank ''seeks to be a careful, responsible lender,'' adding that it ''is constantly evaluating the risks and costs of funding loans.''
Regulators with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees the nation's largest banks, said that as long as lenders adhered to strict underwriting standards and monitored risk, there was nothing inherently dangerous about extending credit to a wider swath of people.
In fact, an increase in lending is a sign that the economy is improving, economists say. While unemployment remains high, consumers have been reducing their debts. Delinquencies on credit card accounts and auto loans are down sharply from their heights in the crisis. ''This is a natural loosening of credit standards because the banks feel they can expand again,'' said Michael Binz, a managing director at Standard & Poor's.
And lenders miss many potential customers if they focus just on people with perfect credit.
''You can't simply ignore this segment anymore,'' said Deron Weston, a principal in Deloitte's banking practice.
The definition of subprime borrowers varies, but is generally considered those with credit scores of 660 and below.
The push for subprime borrowers has not extended to the mortgage market, which remains closed to all but the most creditworthy.
Capital One is one lender that has been courting borrowers with damaged credit, even those who have just emerged from bankruptcy, with pitches like, ''We want to win you back as a customer.''
Pam Girardo, a spokeswoman for Capital One, said, ''Our strategy is to provide reasonable access to credit with appropriate guardrails in place to ensure consumers stay on track as they rebuild their credit.''
Ms. Alejandro, 46, was one of the borrowers fresh out of bankruptcy courted by Capital One. So far, she has turned it down.
David W. Nelms, chief executive of Discover Financial Services, the sixth-largest credit card lender in the United States, told investors this month that the company planned to extend credit to a broader group of borrowers. But, he added, Discover is not ''suddenly going to go into the subprime business.''
Credit card lenders extended $12.5 billion in loans to subprime borrowers last year, up 54.7 percent from 2010, according to Equifax and Moody's, but still below the $41.6 billion in 2007.
Lenders are ramping up their advertising, according to Synovate, a market research firm. Others are developing credit cards specifically aimed at borrowers with damaged credit. Capital One, for instance, introduced a credit card last year that allows these borrowers to lower their interest rate after making timely payments for a year.
Auto loans are particularly attractive for lenders since they were largely untouched by many of the new regulations. The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said it had not yet decided whether it would oversee the largest nonbank auto lenders.
At the same time, the market for securities made up of bundles of auto loans is heating up. Last year, investors scooped up $11.7 billion in auto loan securities, up from $2.17 billion in 2008. The pace of securitization in credit cards is slower, with lenders selling roughly 30 percent of their card portfolios to investors, down from 60 percent before the financial crisis, according to S&P.
Steve Bowman, the chief credit and risk officer for GM Financial, an auto lender, said he expected subprime auto loans to continue to grow. Unlike mortgage lenders, Mr. Bowman argued, auto lenders understand how to manage risk while still making loans to borrowers with poor credit.
But Moody's was already sounding the alarm last year that some very risky borrowers were getting auto loans. The market, Moody's wrote in a report in March 2011, could be growing ''too much too fast.''
Ms. Alejandro is not the only borrower with bad credit to question why anyone would offer a loan. The offer, of course, does not necessarily translate into the issuing of a card.
Shauna Ames, 41, an office manager from St. Paul, said she got a credit card offer from Capital One even though the company had won a lawsuit against her for $5,485 in overdue credit card debt last September. Ms. Ames, who had filed for bankruptcy, said she was surprised at the offer. ''I still can't believe it,'' she said.
Ms. Girardo, the Capital One spokeswoman, said the bank doesn't solicit customers that it has previously sued. ''We believe we can establish long-term relationships with products that are predicated on consumer success,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Even Without New Contracts, Many Public Employees Get Raises

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Public employees are working without contracts in cities and counties across New York State, as labor negotiations stall because local governments say they cannot afford to raise wages.
But many union members are still taking home larger paychecks, thanks to a state law that allows workers to continue receiving longevity-based salary increases after their contracts expire.
The pattern is seen throughout the state. All labor contracts in Albany, New Rochelle and Yonkers have expired. So have seven of nine contracts in Syracuse, six of eight in Buffalo and most of the contracts in New York City. 
And the same trend is unfolding at the county level. The New York State Association of Counties surveyed 17 counties at the request of The New York Times and found that 41 of 67 labor contracts had expired.
Each side blames the other for the holdup. But it is clear that in many cases, unions are strategically deciding they are better off stalling negotiations now, given the grim financial picture. That is partly because New York's 30-year-old Triborough Amendment guarantees that the terms of public labor contracts remain in place even after they expire.
In Westchester County, where all eight labor contracts have expired, the executive, Robert P. Astorino, a Republican, has sought to have union members pay a share of their health care costs. But in December, the county's largest union, the Civil Service Employees Association, balked and declared negotiations at an impasse.
And that is where negotiations remain -- stalled. Before Triborough, ''if you declared impasse, labor would be putting itself at considerable peril,'' said Stephen Madarasz, CSEA's spokesman, adding, ''Before they used this principle, you basically had a situation where management could impose its will once a contract expired.''
When times are good, the impact of the Triborough Amendment is blunted, because municipalities can afford to offer salary increases as part of contract negotiations. But when budgets are squeezed, as they are now, municipal leaders often seek wage or benefit concessions, which leave unions with little incentive to come to the bargaining table and negotiate in earnest.
''Most labor leaders, when they are negotiating with the executive branch, are realistic,'' said Mayor Mike Spano of Yonkers, a Democrat. ''In this environment, there's going to be no greater benefit that's going to get offered to them, so why settle?''
Union leaders acknowledged that getting deals done was harder than it once was, though they denied deliberate efforts to halt the negotiations.
''It's a complicated time,'' said Mr. Madarasz, the CSEA spokesman. ''We're still settling contracts, but they are probably taking a little bit longer and starting a little bit later. More municipalities are waiting until they are close to the deadline to start negotiations or starting after contracts expired.''
The effect of the Triborough Amendment is significant: Edmund J. McMahon, senior fellow at the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative research group, has estimated that longevity-based pay increases for teachers, guaranteed by the amendment even after contracts expire, add $300 million to school budgets annually. Mr. McMahon is an advocate for repealing the measure, saying workers have enough protections elsewhere in state regulations.
''Triborough is most noticeable in an economic and fiscal environment like the present one,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''It's less noticeable in a boom period.''
There is one way cities and counties can sometimes freeze wages: when their finances deteriorate so badly that they are taken over by control boards, as has happened in Nassau and Erie Counties.
''The ability to freeze wages is an essential tool for a control board,'' said Ronald A. Stack, chairman of the Nassau County Interim Finance Authority, adding that it ''can help avoid more severe labor cost-saving measures such as layoffs or furloughs.''
But in Nassau, unions are suing to prevent the control board there from imposing wage freezes for a second year.
Many other municipalities, finding their budgets strained by soaring pension and health care costs, are resorting to layoffs and service cuts to balance their budgets -- or to try to bring unions back to the bargaining table.
In Rensselaer County, the executive, Kathleen M. Jimino, a Republican, cut 46 jobs last year after unions declined to switch to a less expensive health plan. This year, after she warned that she would again resort to layoffs, half of the city's contracts remain expired, but she was able to settle the city's largest labor contract.
''This time they knew they could take us at our word,'' she said. ''We would have to reduce jobs.''
Ms. Jimino and Mr. Astorino are among a number of mayors and county leaders from both major political parties who have advocated for the repeal of the Triborough Amendment, which was named after a labor dispute at the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, arguing that the measure strips them of leverage during contract talks.
''Legislators in Albany like to continuously kick the can down the road,'' Mr. Astorino said. ''The problem is, there is no more pavement left. It's all exploding right now.''
But union leaders say the Triborough Amendment provides needed bargaining leverage for workers, compensating for a provision in state law that forbids strikes by public employees.
Christopher Policano, a spokesman for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said, ''In the absence of Triborough, bargaining could become a meaningless exercise as the employer may simply insist on its position and implement it without facing any consequences.''
''The employees would be completely disadvantaged,'' he added. ''This thwarts the purpose of the labor law, which is to promote constructive bargaining.''
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who has taken on labor over several issues, has yet to express a position on the Triborough Amendment, but a top aide, Lawrence Schwartz, said last year that the administration would explore options, including proposing the suspension of the amendment. That would require the approval of the Legislature, and many lawmakers in both parties have received significant campaign contributions from public sector unions.
But the unions are not in a mood to cede further ground, after failing this year to block legislation that reduced pension benefits for future public workers. In a message to his members, Keith Olson, president of the Yonkers Police Benevolent Association, warned that if the governor was able to pass a proposal to reduce pension benefits for new workers, ''he will surely be coming for something else (Triborough Amendment, etc.) next!''

HEADLINE: Christie Stands by His Decision to Cancel Train Tunnel

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE; Michael Cooper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey defended on Tuesday his decision to cancel a train tunnel long planned to relieve increasing congestion across the Hudson River, saying it was a matter of principle.
Responding to a report by the Government Accountability Office that found he had overstated the cost of the tunnel to New Jersey, the governor also derided the tunnel plan, though he had said when he canceled the project in October 2010 that he believed in its merits. While the tunnel would have expanded the number of subway lines available to those who commute to Pennsylvania Station in New York City, he characterized it on Tuesday as a dead-end to a department store.
''So when they want to build a tunnel to the basement of Macy's, and stick the New Jersey taxpayers with a bill of three-to-five billion dollars over -- no matter how much the administration yells and screams, you have to say no,'' he said in a speech at a conference on taxes and the economy in Manhattan held by the George W. Bush Institute. 
''You have to look them right in the eye, no matter how much they try to vilify you for it, and you have to say no,'' the governor told an audience that included Mr. Bush, Karl Rove and other prominent Republicans and business executives. ''You have to be willing to say no to those things that compromise your principles.''
The tunnel would have doubled capacity for commuters on New Jersey Transit and Amtrak trains, which now share two 100-year-old single track tunnels to cross the Hudson. The tracks are at capacity, and commuter demand is expected to rise 38 percent by 2030.
While the governor forcefully defended on Tuesday his decision to scrap the tunnel plan, he did not directly mention the report or address its specifics.
Mr. Christie said in 2010 that his steering committee for the project, known as ARC for Access to the Region's Core, had told him that the tunnel would cost at least $11 billion and potentially more than $14 billion. But the report by the Government Accountability Office, an independent, nonpartisan Congressional investigative agency, found that New Jersey and federal officials had agreed that the costs would be from $9.5 billion to $12.4 billion. New Jersey Transit officials, who led the governor's steering committee, said the tunnel would cost no more than $10 billion, the report found.
Mr. Christie also said in 2010 that the state would pay 70 percent of the cost; the report said the state's share was 14.4 percent. And he said the federal government was requiring the state to pay any cost overruns; the report said that there was no final agreement, and that the federal government had offered to help pay with grants, loans and public-private partnerships.
The report prompted criticism of Mr. Christie from several New Jersey Democrats. Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, the chairman of the transportation committee and of the state's Democratic Party, said the decision was ''shortsighted and politically driven,'' because the governor directed money from the tunnel to fill the state's transportation trust fund, allowing him to keep a campaign promise not to raise the gasoline tax.
''This was a tunnel that benefited New Jersey, for which New Jersey had a small share of the cost, in which we had the ability to negotiate cost overruns,'' he said. ''The governor seized upon incorrect facts and followed the old saw that says if you repeat something often enough, it becomes the truth.''
In defending the decision, the governor and his office this week cited an initial cost of $8.7 billion for the tunnel. That was the figure that state and federal officials agreed upon in 2009 as the basis of the first federal grant to the state. Mr. Christie has said that the costs were expected to rise $2 billion to $5 billion above that, and in an interview in January, Mr. Christie told ''Meet the Press'' on NBC that the tunnel would cost ''an additional $8 billion.''
But federal and state officials had always known there was a range of costs.
Mr. Christie's office said Tuesday that federal officials had ''confirmed'' that the tunnel would cost from $10.8 billion to $13.7 billion. But New Jersey officials had disputed that estimate a day after federal officials made it, according to the Government Accountability Office report, saying the tunnel would cost no more than $10 billion.

HEADLINE: The High Cost of Gambling on Oil

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. KENNEDY II. 
Joseph P. Kennedy II, a former United States representative from Massachusetts, is the founder, chairman and president of Citizens Energy Corporation.

 BODY:
Boston
THE drastic rise in the price of oil and gasoline is in part the result of forces beyond our control: as high-growth countries like China and India increase the demand for petroleum, the price will go up.
But there are factors contributing to the high price of oil that we can do something about. Chief among them is the effect of ''pure'' speculators -- investors who buy and sell oil futures but never take physical possession of actual barrels of oil. These middlemen add little value and lots of cost as they bid up the price of oil in pursuit of financial gain. They should be banned from the world's commodity exchanges, which could drive down the price of oil by as much as 40 percent and the price of gasoline by as much as $1 a gallon. 
Today, speculators dominate the trading of oil futures. According to Congressional testimony by the commodities specialist Michael W. Masters in 2009, the oil futures markets routinely trade more than one billion barrels of oil per day. Given that the entire world produces only around 85 million actual ''wet'' barrels a day, this means that more than 90 percent of trading involves speculators' exchanging ''paper'' barrels with one another.
Because of speculation, today's oil prices of about $100 a barrel have become disconnected from the costs of extraction, which average $11 a barrel worldwide. Pure speculators account for as much as 40 percent of that high price, according to testimony that Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of ExxonMobil, gave to Congress last year. That estimate is bolstered by a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
Many economists contend that speculation on oil futures is a good thing, because it increases liquidity and better distributes risk, allowing refiners, producers, wholesalers and consumers (like airlines) to ''hedge'' their positions more efficiently, protecting themselves against unseen future shifts in the price of oil.
But it's one thing to have a trading system in which oil industry players place strategic bets on where prices will be months into the future; it's another thing to have a system in which hedge funds and bankers pump billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges, chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price. The same concern explains why the United States government placed limits on pure speculators in grain exchanges after repeated manipulations of crop prices during the Great Depression.
The market for oil futures differs from the markets for other commodities in the sheer size and scope of trading and in the impact it has on a strategically important resource. There is a fundamental difference between oil futures and, say, orange juice futures. If orange juice gets too pricey (perhaps because of a speculative bubble), we can easily switch to apple juice. The same does not hold with oil. Higher oil prices act like a choke-chain on the economy, dragging down profits for ordinary businesses and depressing investment.
When I started buying and selling oil more than 30 years ago for my nonprofit organization, speculation wasn't a significant aspect of the industry. But in 1991, just a few years after oil futures began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Goldman Sachs made an argument to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that Wall Street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades.
The commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed Goldman Sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades. Other exemptions followed. By 2008, eight investment banks accounted for 32 percent of the total oil futures market. According to a recent analysis by McClatchy, only about 30 percent of oil futures traders are actual oil industry participants.
Congress was jolted into action when it learned of the full extent of Commodity Futures Trading Commission's lax oversight. In the wake of the economic crisis, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law required greater trading transparency and limited speculators who lacked a legitimate business-hedging purpose to positions of no greater than 25 percent of the futures market.
This is an important step, but limiting speculators in the oil markets doesn't go far enough. Even with the restrictions currently in place, those eight investment banks alone can severely inflate the price of oil. Federal legislation should bar pure oil speculators entirely from commodity exchanges in the United States. And the United States should use its clout to get European and Asian markets to follow its lead, chasing oil speculators from the world's commodity markets.
Eliminating pure speculation on oil futures is a question of fairness. The choice is between a world of hedge-fund traders who make enormous amounts of money at the expense of people who need to drive their cars and heat their homes, and a world where the fundamentals of life -- food, housing, health care, education and energy -- remain affordable for all.

HEADLINE: Alcoa Surpasses Estimates in a Bellwether Report

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Alcoa, the aluminum manufacturer, said Tuesday that it earned 9 cents a share in the first quarter, topping analysts' forecasts on a modest increase in sales.
It surpassed analysts' forecasts for a small loss by selling more aluminum to a wide range of customers, including carmakers and aircraft manufacturers, and operating its plants more efficiently. 
Alcoa said it earned $94 million in the period, marking a turnaround from the fourth quarter, when it lost $191 million, but falling 70 percent below net income of $308 million, or 27 cents a share, posted in the first quarter of 2011.
Revenue rose to $6 billion from $5.96 billion.
Analysts had predicted revenue of $5.77 billion.
Alcoa said sales rose from the fourth quarter across most of its markets, including automobiles, aerospace and other transportation, to packaging and industrial products. That offset lower realized prices for aluminum and alumina, a material used in processing aluminum.
Investors were anxiously waiting to see Alcoa's results, scheduled for after the market closed on Tuesday. Fears of a bad earnings season contributed to a recent losing streak in stocks.
In the after-hours session, shares of Alcoa rose more than 5 percent.
Investors were also watching for Alcoa's forecast for 2012 global aluminum demand. It reaffirmed its expectation for a 7 percent increase. The company expects demand for aluminum used in autos, heavy trucks and trailers to remain strong in North America, which accounts for nearly 50 percent of Alcoa's business.
In the United States, auto sales rose 13 percent, to 3.5 million cars and trucks in the first quarter, and car companies and suppliers were scrambling to meet demand. Many analysts expect the auto industry to have its best sales year since 2007.
The company also expects China's automotive market to grow as much as 7 percent this year. Demand for aluminum remains weak in Europe, which is struggling to resolve a sovereign debt crisis.
Alcoa's upbeat earnings could be a good sign for other materials companies. The materials sector -- including metals and mining, diversified chemicals and construction materials -- was expected to show the biggest decline.
''When you look at all the cost cuts companies did during the recession, they're a lot leaner now than they were a couple of years ago,'' said Bill Selesky, an analyst at Argus Research. ''I think it points to companies doing a bit better than originally expected just based on running a more efficient, leaner company.''
Alcoa cut some smelting and refining operations earlier this year after demand fell late in 2011 as customers became concerned about a slowing global economy. And, faced with high costs for raw materials and energy, Alcoa improved productivity.
''It's just a significant effort from all of our businesses and, obviously, the key factor in our earnings improvement,'' the chief financial officer, Charles D. McLane Jr., told analysts during a conference call.

HEADLINE: Fertilizer Billionaire Buys Buildings His Way, in Cash

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
It is rare when a buyer pays all cash for a real estate property, and even rarer when the dollar figure is in excess of $300 million. But that was the case last week when a fertilizer tycoon, Alex Rovt, acquired a majority stake in 14 Wall Street, the 1-million-square-foot office building across from the New York Stock Exchange in Lower Manhattan.
''I was looking at several different office buildings to buy, but with this one I was successful and was able to buy out all of the creditors,'' said Mr. Rovt, 59. He has set aside another $300 million to $400 million, he said, to make additional residential and commercial buys in Manhattan. 
While there have been previous all-cash purchases of large office towers in New York City, brokers said the $303 million price tag was certainly noteworthy. The strategy is not unusual, however, for Mr. Rovt.
''I haven't known him to use financing in any of his deals,'' said Matthew Lesser, a vice president at Leslie J. Garfield & Company, who has represented Mr. Rovt in several New York real estate transactions. Mr. Lesser was a consultant to Mr. Rovt on 14 Wall Street; he did not have a broker.
''If you have the cash on hand, why pay to borrow more?'' said Mr. Lesser, adding that by removing financing from the equation, ''it allows him to quickly close a transaction.'' Like many all-cash purchasers, Mr. Rovt may decide to take out some financing on the building at a later date.
As part of the deal for 14 Wall Street, also known as the Bankers Trust Building, Mr. Rovt paid off at a discount all of the remaining debt. At face value, that included a $145 million first mortgage that was scheduled to come due in May, $100 million in mezzanine debt held by Brookfield Office Properties and additional mezzanine debt totaling $75 million held by Shorenstein Properties.
Mr. Rovt, a native of Ukraine who is now a United States citizen and president of a fertilizer company, the IBE Trade Corporation, is ranked 372nd in Forbes's list of the 400 wealthiest Americans. with an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion. From humble Jewish beginnings -- his father was the manager of a knitting factory and his mother was a housewife -- he came to America on a work visa in 1984. With a Ph.D. in international economics from the Lvov State University of Trade and Economics, he worked his way through various jobs here, including a stint at his uncle's deli, before joining the privately held IBE Trade Corporation. There, he leveraged his Russian contacts and his ambition to climb the corporate ladder, eventually taking control of the business.
The owner of more than 23 properties around the city, Mr. Rovt has had plenty of experience with splashy real estate: last year he made headlines when he paid $34 million in cash for the Henry T. Sloane mansion on East 68th Street, just an hour before the circa 1905 Beaux-Arts town house was set to go to a foreclosure auction. The new home dwarfs his family's former dwelling, a town house at 232 East 63rd Street that is on the market for $27 million. ''This new house is much bigger and better,'' he said with a smile. ''The other house is just too small for my wife and I -- it is only 11,000 square feet.''
As for 14 Wall Street, Capstone Equities, which bought the building with the Carlyle Group at the height of the market in 2007 for $325 million, will maintain a minority stake. The Carlyle Group is no longer involved. While Capstone will continue to be an owner, its duties will be relegated to ''a minor management role,'' Mr. Rovt said. His two sons, Philip, 33, and Maxwell, 24, will take over the majority of the management of the building, which consists of 985,000 square feet of office space and 24,000 square feet of retail, including a T. J. Maxx on the ground floor.
''We are very excited to continue having a stake in the property, as we believe in the neighborhood and the excellence of the building,'' said Joshua Zamir, a managing principal at Capstone.
The building has 300,000 square feet of vacancy. Three tenants, including a publicly traded insurance company, are in talks to lease roughly 200,000 square feet. The commercial brokerage firm CBRE represented the building under Capstone, but Mr. Rovt said he had not decided whether to hire an outside firm or handle the leasing internally. CBRE declined to comment.
''Capstone's strategy was to buy the building, bring rents high and then sell the building at a higher price,'' said Mr. Rovt. ''But my position is different -- I am looking to hold the building for a long time and am not looking for high, high rent, just a reasonable market price.''
Still, the $303 million price that Mr. Rovt paid is not a major discount to the $325 million that Capstone and the Carlyle Group paid at the height of the real estate bubble. And when additional costs like tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions are calculated, the deal could end up costing Mr. Rovt some $330 a square foot, brokers estimated. In contrast, the average sales price downtown for Class A office buildings was just $297 a square foot in the first quarter of the year, according to data from Cushman & Wakefield.
''Two years ago, some people would have thought this was a lot to pay for a building downtown,'' said Douglas L. Harmon, a senior managing director at Eastdil Secured who, with his colleague Adam Spies, represented Capstone and Shorenstein Properties in the sale. ''But the neighborhood has truly transformed and today the area attracts a broader-based investment appeal than it ever has.''

HEADLINE: An Uncertain Fate for Urban Projects in California

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- It is impossible to miss the long-moribund Santa Barbara Plaza, a collection of mostly boarded-up retail buildings in South Los Angeles across the street from a shopping center that just underwent a $30 million overhaul. After some costly missteps that only worsened the blight, plans to transform the ugly 19.2-acre site into a mixed-use development called Marlton Square finally seemed to be gathering steam, and the city redevelopment agency started clearing the land last summer.
But now Marlton Square, like many urban development projects in California, is in limbo. The state's 397 community redevelopment agencies, including the one that was shepherding Marlton Square, went out of business on Feb. 1, victims of the state's fiscal crisis. Legislation enacted last June to eliminate the agencies was upheld in December by the California Supreme Court.
California's community redevelopment agencies were created in the 1940s to encourage urban renewal. The agencies could acquire property, including through condemnation, finance infrastructure improvements and sell the land to private owners at below-market prices. Their dissolution has thrown into question the fate of hundreds of projects, including housing developments intended for low- and moderate-income people. 
In California, it is relatively rare for developers to be offered tax abatements, density bonuses and other incentives for building in places that are considered risky. Instead, the redevelopment agencies could use the additional property taxes that were generated by enhancing the value of the land, and this so-called tax increment financing became the primary redevelopment tool. This year the incremental tax would have amounted to $5 billion, or 12 percent of all of the property tax collected throughout the state.
Since February, local officials throughout the state have been sifting through billions of dollars' worth of projects to determine which ones qualify as enforceable obligations entered into before June 29, 2011, the date the legislation was signed into law.
''We have very specific goals and instructions: to complete the unwinding as expeditiously as possible and to maximize value,'' said Nelson Rising, a prominent Los Angeles real estate developer. Mr. Rising is one of three board members appointed by Gov. Jerry Brown to lead the so-called designated local authority, which will review pending projects in Los Angeles and try to dispose of land that it is not committed to develop.
Redevelopment agencies proliferated after 1978 and the passage of Proposition 13, the ballot measure that severely limited revenue for cities by capping property taxes. Los Angeles County alone had 71 of these agencies.
The agencies have been credited with many successful efforts to revive neighborhoods, including downtown Los Angeles, the Mission Bay section of San Francisco and the Gaslamp Quarter in San Diego. But critics have long argued that the agencies operated without sufficient oversight. Particularly in smaller cities, redevelopment officials have been accused of mismanaging the money or financing projects that have nothing to do with alleviating blight.
Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said the redevelopment funds were a ''honey pot'' that were often used merely to enrich developers or build sports stadiums rather than fulfill the agencies' original mission. ''The reason the governor made a run on the redevelopment agencies is that they had ceased to be faithful to the purposes of redevelopment,'' Mr. Yaroslavsky said.
Dismantling the redevelopment agencies may have been the least controversial action Mr. Brown could have taken after inheriting an operating deficit of $25 billion, several real estate specialists said. Many Californians believed that the money was more urgently needed for schools and the police.
In voting for dissolution, the California legislature also approved a compromise measure that would have kept the agencies alive if they shared some of their tax increment revenue with cities and counties. But the League of California Cities, a lobbying group for municipalities, refused to accept this compromise and challenged both laws. The court struck down the revenue-sharing measure, a double loss for the league.
''It became an all-or-nothing thing, and they got nothing,'' said Dan Rosenfeld, a senior deputy to Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor and a proponent of redevelopment agencies. Supporters say they have had a crucial role in creating affordable housing, and stimulating economic development and improvements to public transit.
''A lot of these projects would not otherwise pencil out without subsidy'' from the redevelopment agencies, said Tim Kawahara, the executive director of the Ziman Center for Real Estate at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Of greatest immediate concern is how dissolution will affect the development of housing for people with low and moderate incomes. Since 1979, 20 percent of the property taxes diverted to the agencies had been set aside for this purpose. But Mr. Kawahara said lawmakers seemed determined to make up for the loss of as much as $1 billion a year in subsidies.
Thomas L. Safran, a leading developer of affordable housing in the Los Angeles area, said he wondered whether he would be able to build a small apartment building on a site on Sherman Way in the San Fernando Valley community of Reseda, replacing a movie theater that has been closed for decades.
''It's up in the air,'' Mr. Safran said. The redevelopment board had given his company the exclusive right to negotiate for a small loan and the land, but no development agreement was signed before the bill became law on June 29.
Also up in the air are the plans by Trammell Crow, a Dallas-based developer, to build a factory in downtown Los Angeles that would make light-rail cars, batteries for electric cars, solar panels and other renewable energy products.
The factory, called the CleanTech Manufacturing Center, would be on a contaminated 20.6-acre site where buses were once produced. Last fall, the community redevelopment agency approved the sale of the land to Trammell Crow for $15.4 million; the developer would have to pay off the maturing bank loan that had financed the acquisition of the land. Bradley Cox, who runs Trammell Crow's Los Angeles office, said several tenants had expressed interest in occupying the center's 400,000 square feet of space.
Even if the new designated local authority group approves the post-June 29 purchase agreement, Trammell Crow will not necessarily have the deal sewn up. The decision will be reviewed by an oversight committee representing the taxing agencies. That committee's ruling could be rejected by the state Finance Department.
Mr. Cox said he was optimistic. ''We think we're the right developer,'' he said. ''We have a lot of experience with environmentally challenged properties.''
Though no deal had been completed for Marlton Square in South Los Angeles, the project to replace the derelict shopping center is not necessarily dead, said David Bloom, a spokesman for the new designated local authority.
Kenneth T. Lombard of Capri Capital Partners, a Chicago company that owns the neighboring Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, said moving forward with the Marlton Square project was essential for the long-term success of his shopping center. ''We've got a much better story to tell,'' he said, ''but that story will be even stronger when I can eliminate the question, 'What's going on across the street?' ''
But Mr. Bloom said it was hard to see how Marlton Square could come together in the absence of the guiding hand of a redevelopment agency. What has been lost, he said, is the means to look way beyond the terms of current officeholders to bring about change.
The community redevelopment agency ''was charged with taking a very long-term view on the recovery of challenged neighborhoods,'' he said. ''It allowed for continuity. That's not easy to achieve in government today.''

HEADLINE: Fuel to Burn: Now What?

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
THE reversal of fortune in America's energy supplies in recent years holds the promise of abundant and cheaper fuel, and it could have profound effects on what people drive, domestic manufacturing and America's foreign policy.
Cheaper fuel produced domestically could reduce the cost of shipping and manufacturing, trim heating and cooling bills, improve the auto market and provide tens of thousands of new jobs.
It might also pose new environmental challenges, both predictable and unforeseen, by damping enthusiasm for clean forms of energy and derailing efforts to wean the nation from its wasteful energy habits.
But for Americans battered by rising gasoline prices, frustrated by the dependence on foreign oil, skeptical of the benefits or practicality of renewable fuels and afraid of nuclear power, the appeal of plentiful domestic oil and gas could far outweigh the costs. 
Just a few years ago, the dominant theme in discussions about energy was of declining production and the fear of running out of oil. Even today, political tensions in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf, have fanned fears of supply disruptions that are keeping prices high.
But a new boom in energy production in recent years has upended these expectations in record time. High energy prices led to a wave of successful oil and gas exploration in North America, including in fields that were deemed uneconomical only a few years ago. Using techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, oil companies are tapping into deeply buried reserves in shale rocks and in the ocean's depths.
The surge in energy prices, along with a recession and new government rules that tightened fuel-economy standards, led to a sharp cutback in gasoline consumption. This decline in demand in the last five years reversed decades of almost uninterrupted growth that made the United States the world's top energy consumer, accounting for one in every four barrels of oil burned around the globe.
The North American energy revival is primarily the result of so-called unconventional sources of energy -- like shale oil and shale gas across the United States, oil sands in Canada and deepwater production in the Gulf of Mexico. In the last five years, the United States and Canada combined have become the fastest-growing sources of new oil supplies around the world, overtaking producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia.
''The transformation unfolding in North America represents a potentially decisive shift in the history of energy,'' Rex W. Tillerson, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, who is not usually given to hyperbole, said in a speech in Houston last month.
Ed Morse, head of global commodity research at Citigroup and a longtime energy analyst, says North America has the potential to become a ''new Middle East.''
''The reduced vulnerability of North America -- and the world market -- to oil price spikes also has deep consequences geopolitically, including the reduced strategic importance to the U.S. of changes in oil- and natural gas-producing countries worldwide,'' Mr. Morse said in a recent 92-page report called Energy 2020. ''Pressures towards isolationism in the U.S. will likely grow, with consequences for global stability that can only just begin to become understood.''
''The only thing that could stop this is politics -- environmentalists getting the upper hand over supply in the U.S., for instance,'' the report said.
The new supplies ensure that the United States will remain well entrenched in oil, but the continuing reliance on fossil fuels also carries significant environmental concerns -- whether from the risk of offshore drilling, or the hazards, many still unknown, of hydraulic fracturing. It also means that greenhouse gas emissions will most likely increase, at least until carbon emissions are capped or new technology to store carbon dioxide underground is developed.
The glut of natural gas supplies cuts two ways on emissions. It has effectively put an end in the United States to any new investment in coal plants, which produce much more emissions. But it also makes the economics of alternative, noncarbon energy sources like wind power or solar power difficult to justify without public support and subsidies.
Regardless of the environmental impact, there is no guarantee that new supplies will inevitably lead to lower gasoline prices, as proponents of unfettered domestic drilling argue. Oil is a global commodity with a price set on the global market. With rising demand around the world, particularly in emerging economies, and instability in many oil-producing countries, many analysts predict global oil prices will remain volatile -- and high -- for many years to come.
And with gasoline prices above $4 a gallon, the nation's energy resources remain a polarizing topic, pitting Republicans against Democrats, environmentalists against oil companies, and conservationists against advocates of unfettered drilling.
''It is remarkable how quickly perceptions have changed,'' says Guy Caruso, the administrator of the United States Energy Information Administration from 2002 to 2008, who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''We may be in the early stage of this transformation, and clearly things could still go wrong.''
Energy production is an inherently risky business, but recent history suggests that when resources are available they end up being developed.
After the explosion of BP's deepwater well two years ago in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to the biggest oil spill in American history, the Obama administration imposed a moratorium on offshore drilling. But it took only about a year for exploration and production to resume offshore.
Cheaper energy costs -- particularly for natural gas -- would benefit a variety of domestic industries, like chemicals, pharmaceuticals and fertilizers. The rise in natural gas production has already led many utility companies to shift their electrical production away from coal; it also calls into question talk of a nuclear revival in the United States.
Economists say that ample gas supplies might also provide the basis for a resurgence of American manufacturing, which has been battered by high energy costs for much of the last decade.
Natural gas prices have fluctuated wildly in recent years, rising to $14 for a thousand cubic feet from $2 within a few years. The current glut, however, has driven prices back down again, to near $2 for a thousand cubic feet.
With America becoming one of the top natural gas producers, some domestic companies might rethink moving parts of their business to countries with cheaper energy costs. (At current consumption rates, American gas reserves would last at least 75 years, an estimate some experts say is conservative.)
Lower natural gas costs would also have cascading benefits to other commercial sectors, like retailing. Shipping costs may be lower, particularly if transportation companies shift their fleets to natural gas-powered or electric vehicles. FedEx, for instance, has already been adding clean energy trucks to its fleet, including hybrid and all-electric delivery trucks in cities like Chicago.
Citigroup estimates that as many as 3.6 million new jobs might be created by 2020 thanks to the energy boom. The current trade deficit might fall by 60 percent by the end of the decade from today's level, according to the bank's estimates, and the dollar could appreciate by as much as 5.4 percent as imports shrink.
''In a world of high energy prices, the potential economic activity generated by this wave of new hydrocarbon production is extraordinary and should strongly boost national output, increase incomes, create wealth, stimulate consumption and create jobs,'' according to Citigroup.
Given how swiftly expectations have shifted to describe America's energy prospects, however, some caution may be warranted.
Opposition from environmental groups and concerns about climate change -- which is caused by increased carbon emissions from fossil fuels -- could lead to tighter regulation of petroleum products or derail infrastructure projects like pipelines.
That is what has happened to the extension of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which its supporters say is needed to increase the import of oil from Canada's oil sands into the United States. That project has faced stiff opposition from environmental groups because oil sands are more energy-intensive and emit more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than traditional oil sources.
The increased reliance on these unconventional oil sources, including oil sands and shale oil, has led some energy experts to talk about a ''re-carbonization'' of energy supplies if that reliance distracts from the need to develop renewable fuels.
''As we run out of conventional fossil fuels, we face some fundamental choices,'' said Dan Lashof, the climate program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''Are we going to switch to cleaner energy sources, or are we going to switch to dirtier energy sources? That's why the Keystone pipeline was so hard fought. It's because we face a real fork in the road. And depending which way we go, solving our environmental problems might become impossible.''
Environmental groups are also concerned about the effects on underground aquifers of hydraulic fracturing -- in which water under high pressure is used to break apart shale rocks to release natural gas.
While natural gas emits less carbon dioxide than coal when burned for electrical production, which has led producers to try to brand it as a ''clean'' energy source, it remains a fossil fuel that emits carbon into the atmosphere when burned. Because it is suddenly plentiful, and relatively cheap, doubts have been raised about future investments in renewable power sources that had been favored to replace coal.
''Cheap natural gas has delivered significant near-term environmental benefits, but it clouds the outlook for renewable energy,'' said Trevor Houser, a partner at the Rhodium Group, an economic research firm. ''Without an extension of current tax credits or adoption of new pro-renewables policy, wind power and other renewable energy sources will have a tough time competing with natural gas in the years ahead.''
Geologists have long known that shale basins across the country, like the Bakken field in North Dakota, Eagle Ford and Barnett in Texas, and the Marcellus in the Northeast, held tremendous oil and gas reserves. But energy companies had no economic way to collect them until new technology recently changed that.
The results have been impressive. Production from the Bakken region alone has gone from negligible quantities to 500,000 barrels of oil a day in just a few years. Production at Eagle Ford produced just 787 barrels in 2004. Last year, its production reached 30.5 million barrels, according to state regulators, and it is still growing. Natural gas production there went from nothing to 243 billion cubic feet in just three years.
The National Petroleum Council, an industry-led group that provides advice to the secretary of energy, recently outlined its view of how the nation's larger-than-expected resource might be developed.
In a major study released last year, the group forecast that North American oil production might exceed 20 million barrels a day by 2035 under a ''high potential'' situation of unfettered access.
However, under a ''limited'' situation where production was constrained for a variety of environmental or political reasons, domestic supplies might fall to less than 10 million barrels a day.
Some experts are more bullish. Mr. Morse of Citigroup forecast that North American oil production could reach an astounding 27 million barrels a day by 2020, almost twice the rate of production of 15 million barrels a day at the end of 2011. Production from the United States could grow to 15.6 million barrels a day by 2020, up from nine million barrels a day in 2011.
If that trend continues, the growth in oil and natural gas supplies in the next decades could turn the United States into a top energy exporter, rivaling some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Natural gas could be sold to Mexico and Canada (because exploiting oil sands is so energy-intensive, Canada might have to import natural gas to produce its oil). Refined petroleum products, and even crude oil, could find customers in Europe and Latin America. Coal could be exported to China.
With less gasoline demand, the nation's surplus refining capacity means the United States is already exporting petroleum products -- like gasoline and diesel. The United States is now the top exporter of refined products, just ahead of Russia.
The United States has been a net oil importer since the middle of the last century. America's dependence on imports grew as the country's consumption rose and domestic production dropped, and reached a peak in 2005. That year, domestic consumption of oil was about 21 million barrels of oil a day -- a quarter of global oil demand. More than two-thirds of that was imported.
But this was most likely the high-water mark for oil imports, at least in the foreseeable future. The nation's oil consumption has since fallen by about three million barrels a day as consumers cut back on their gasoline use.
Analysts say this trend is actually deep-seated, and is likely to continue. Americans are buying fewer cars, and they are driving shorter distances. The average distance traveled peaked at 12,500 miles a year in 2003, according to Citigroup, and could fall to 11,600 miles a year by 2020.
At the same time, federal fuel-efficiency standards are being tightened. The Obama administration and automakers last year agreed to new fuel-efficiency targets, aiming to raise the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency, or CAFE, standard to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, with the goal of saving 12 billion barrels of oil over the life of the program.
Political attitudes, once hard and fast, are undergoing a transformation.
''For 20 years, Democrats opposed opening public lands to oil production and Republicans opposed increases in fuel economy standards, but the run-up in oil prices shattered all that,'' said Paul W. Bledsoe, a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a research group in Washington. ''The shift in politics was amazingly swift. As was the change in psychology, where the United States was viewed as an energy-depleted nation, to the view now of an energy-rich superpower.''
The rise in fuel efficiency in conventional vehicles, along with the growing popularity of hybrids, could also mean all-electric cars will struggle to gain much market share, according to a report released last year by the Boston Consulting Group. In fact, the report found that by 2020, electric cars in the United States would account for a lower share of the market than in either China or the European Union, where they are likely to benefit from government support.
Assessing falling American dependence on foreign oil, analysts with the financial firm Raymond James said imports fell from 65 percent of demand, or 13.5 million barrels a day, their peak in 2005, to 9.8 million barrels a day in 2011, or 52 percent of demand. They predicted that imports would keep falling, reaching 4.5 million barrels a day -- or just a quarter of domestic oil demand -- by 2015. By 2020, they forecast, the United States would not need to import foreign oil anymore.
''The resulting savings from the standpoint of the trade deficit are highly meaningful,'' the analysts said, ''especially when the benefits of cheaper energy for domestic manufacturing are taken into account. Maybe the real question is, When will Washington apply to join OPEC?''
While the question is provocative, the change in outlook for domestic supplies, along with the changed role of the United States in global energy markets, carries important economic and geopolitical lessons.
Nationalism over natural resources in countries like Venezuela, Russia and much of the Middle East has increasingly forced Western oil companies to look for oil and gas closer to home. And exports are already shrinking for many OPEC producers as their own domestic demand soars -- a result of energy subsidies that keep prices artificially low.
It is still too early to get a clear sense of the political implications of this reduced reliance on oil from places like the Middle East. Four of the top five sources of foreign oil to the United States are already outside the Middle East -- Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela and Mexico. The fifth is Saudi Arabia.
James Brick, an energy analyst with Wood Mackenzie, a research firm, said in a recent report that by 2030 the United States could end up exporting 500 million tons of coal a year, 3.2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas and 2.5 million barrels a day of oil products.
''The United States will be playing a very different role on the energy markets, a much more international role and a much more complicated and sophisticated one,'' said Mr. Brick. ''As with any forecast there are uncertainties but no matter how you cut it, the United States has the resources in the ground.''

HEADLINE: For 6 Decades, the Sound of Good News in Haiti

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
Since the founding of the Orchestre Septentrional in 1948, the band's homeland, Haiti, has endured the nearly three-decade Duvalier family dictatorship, 26 other governments, a foreign intervention, a devastating earthquake and, most recently, a cholera epidemic.
Through it all Septen, as the group is known to its fans, has been that rare Haitian entity that functions flawlessly.
Onstage, whether playing an elegant ballroom or an outdoors festival in the countryside, Septen is a dynamo, with a heady combination of drums and horns driving dancers onto their feet. But to Haitians, Septen's ability to thrive when all else seems to be falling apart makes the orchestra something more -- a bulwark and a solace.
''They've created a community institution that is really unlike anything else in Haiti,'' Gage Averill, author of ''A Day for the Hunter. A Day for the Prey: Popular Music and Power in Haiti'' and an ethnomusicologist at the University of British Columbia. ''It's amazing. Few countries can speak of the political swings and economic challenges that Haiti can, but here's this orchestra that even as it changes with the times, has carved out a distinct sound and approach to music making. In terms of longevity and impact, they are remarkable.'' 
Though little known outside Haiti and its diaspora, Septen is enjoying a burst of attention. The band is the subject of a new documentary by Whitney Dow, ''When the Drum Is Beating,'' that will be broadcast nationally on PBS on Thursday night (on Sunday in New York and Los Angeles) and is in the middle of a North American tour that includes three engagements this weekend in the New York metropolitan area.
''Because music is not just a source of entertainment, but one of the primary elements within Haitian culture, it offers a different path into the country,'' Mr. Dow said when asked what motivated him to make the film. ''Haiti is always defined by its current problem, but by mixing music and history, you can show strengths as well as weaknesses. And Septen is definitely one of those strengths.''
Like many Haitian ensembles, Septen's rhythmic foundation draws heavily on the complex drum parts traditionally played at voodoo ceremonies and festivals. In more recent years the band has incorporated varied guitar styles from outside Haiti, the most important being chicken-scratch funk and the light and airy patterns typical of the Francophone Afro-pop heard on Haitian radio stations.
But the band's trademark remains its large Cuban-derived brass section. Hulric Pierre-Louis, a Septen founder and its maestro for many years, used to tell stories of how as a young man growing up in Cap-Haitien on the northern coast, he would listen to radio stations in Santiago, Cuba, on the other side of the narrow Windward Passage, and transcribe the music he heard coming over the airwaves.
''Haitian music is a blend of a lot of different rhythms and styles from a lot of places -- from Africa, Europe, the Caribbean, Latin America,'' said Francois Nikol Levy, a conservatory-trained keyboard player and arranger who for the past decade has been the orchestra's musical director. ''You're going to hear that melange in the songs Septen writes and plays.''
Mr. Dow's film, shot from 2006 to 2010, captures Septen in a transitional stage. Younger players, steeped in funk and jazz, were being brought into the band to keep its sound current, and the discomfort of some of the veterans is palpable.
''Today certain people are trying to change Septen's sound,'' Michel Tassy, a singer who joined the orchestra in 1963 and is now 68, complains to the camera. ''If you do that, you get caught up in the fire. I need a little respect from the institution. Without that, things won't work.''
Mr. Tassy remains in the orchestra and still sings lead on many of its biggest hits. But leadership onstage has clearly passed to Jocelyn Alce, a bass player who says, ''I am the motor of the band,'' and doesn't mind interjecting flourishes that recall Stanley Clarke or Larry Graham into the music.
At the moment Septen's youngest member, hired in December, is a 19-year-old saxophonist. He is not on the current tour -- as is the band's custom, he is still back in Haiti learning Septen's repertory of more than 500 original compositions, in styles ranging from fast-moving merengues to slow and romantic boleros. But he represents the fifth generation of musicians in the band, which numbers from 14 to 19; Mr. Tassy is from the second generation.
''It's something delicate that people don't like to talk about, but we have to get ready for the next generation'' of both musicians and fans, said Ulrich Pierre-Louis, a son of the Septen founder who is also a band manager. ''Haitians consider us their own band, and we need to keep the loyalty of those fans if we are to survive.''
When on tour in Haiti, Septen travels over the country's notoriously decrepit roads on its own bus, with a truck lugging the orchestra's instruments, sheet music and electrical generators, necessary whenever power goes out, which is often. That truck was stolen from a show a few years ago, forcing Mr. Levy to rewrite many of the arrangements from memory.
To survive in Haiti's harsh and unpredictable political climate, Septen has sometimes made accommodations. Mr. Dow's film features, for example, the song ''President for Life,'' a homage to Francois Duvalier, the dictator known a s Papa Doc, that portrays Haitians as happy and flourishing under his repressive rule.
It turns out, however, that the song was written under duress. As the elder Mr. Pierre-Louis tells the story in the film, a member of Duvalier's Tonton Macoute paramilitary force came into a nightclub where Septen was playing, and sprayed the dancers and bandstand with machine-gun fire, killing an orchestra member. ''We didn't want any more problems,'' Mr. Pierre-Louis, who died in 2009 at 79, told Mr. Dow.
Septen has mostly steered clear of trouble and managed to stay afloat financially by striving to become a self-contained and autonomous entity that, in contrast to other bands, does not have to rely on outside promoters, record companies or political patrons. The band even operates its own nightclub, the Feu Vert, or Green Light, in Cap-Haitien, which doubles as a rehearsal space and business office.
''They had the foresight not to be dependent on other people and to instead build their own headquarters and create their own context for their music,'' said Mr. Averill, the ethnomusicologist. ''That they have a business plan and have been able to create this intergenerational presence is a signal achievement.''
''They've done something,'' he added, ''that no one else has been able to pull off.''

HEADLINE: Never Mind Factories. Think Services.

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
In the drive to double America's exports, Washington has been focusing on manufacturers. But that may be the wrong target.
With an educated work force, a culture of innovation and strong capital markets, the United States has a larger comparative advantage in high-skilled services like engineering, law and finance than in lower-skilled manufacturing jobs that rely on cheap labor.
For these reasons, economists see tremendous potential for growth -- if, that is, Washington helps clear the way.
''There is for some reason this manufacturing fetish in America that is not consistent with U.S.'s fundamental economic interests.'' said Aaditya Mattoo, the research manager at the World Bank. ''Meanwhile, there are these barriers which American services companies face in establishing abroad, and no one talks about them.'' 
Under current policy, manufacturing companies enjoy special tax cuts and other subsidies, and can count on the government to protest when American goods face unfair tariffs. For example, when India passed tariffs on alcohol imports that tripled the price of Jack Daniels whisky, the United States fought back. But to this day India requires New York Life Insurance to give three-quarters of its Indian profits to a local partner, Washington does not intervene.
As the developed world has gotten wealthier, global demand for skills and services -- especially the higher-end ones -- has risen.
In the United States, services increasingly dominate the economy. Employment in this sector has risen steadily since the 1960s, with 70 percent of Americans now working in service industries.
And America already exports more services than any other country in the world, even more than the next two competitors combined. In 2011, that amounted to $612 billion exported in services, up 10.1 percent from 2009, and up 136 percent since 1991.
Still, there is great untapped potential for more, since all of these exports are being sold from a tiny share of all the American companies that could participate in the global marketplace.
''There is this huge infrastructure boom where these big, fast-growing economies are going to need to build out their roads, sewers, telecommunications networks, factories, airports, harbors, you name it,'' said J. Bradford Jensen, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and author of a recent book on global services trade. ''All those projects require armies of architects, engineers, project managers, financial insurers. These are all the kinds of tradable services that we have an advantage in providing.''
Given these opportunities, Mr. Jensen estimates that the United States has the potential to more than double its annual exports of services annually, creating an additional $800 billion in tradable business services like engineering and law alone. (''Tradable'' refers to services that can easily be done across borders, as opposed to work like cutting hair or drawing blood.)
Meeting this potential in business services would support or create about three million jobs, by his estimate. These jobs pay significantly higher wages than manufacturing jobs, even when controlling for how educated workers are and other demographics, he added.
To some extent American companies are staying at home because of cultural or language barriers, worries about intellectual property protection and corruption, and sometimes lack of interest.
Often, though, countries ban or place quotas on services from abroad that make these imports prohibitively expensive. One 2010 study estimated discrimination against services imports in some of the major emerging markets like China, India and Indonesia was effectively equivalent to a tariff on these imports of more than 60 percent.
In Malaysia, for example, 80 percent of television programming must originate from local production companies owned by ethnic Malays. Brazil has similar quotas for movie screenings.
In other cases, foreign laws make it extremely expensive or complicated for American entrants. In India, foreigners are not allowed to own more than 26 percent equity in an insurance company, regardless of how much the local partners provide.
''Taking a minority shareholding and doing 100 percent work doesn't hold up for us,'' Ajit Jain, who heads Berkshire Hathaway's reinsurance business, told an Indian newspaper last year. The company opted to sell another company's insurance products through a Web site rather than to expand its own underwriting business in India. Mr. Jain did not return calls from The Times.
China has many similar partnership requirements, along with other limits on foreign businesses. For example, the government tightly restricts the routes of planes operated by foreign delivery services.
''There's a very narrow band of space we can fly in,'' said Daniel J. Brutto, the president of U.P.S. International. ''If there's bad weather in China, our planes are not going anywhere. That means our deliveries will take longer.''
Other American companies have been comparably restricted, if they can get into the country at all.
Cigna has been selling health insurance in China since 2003 (with a Chinese partner), but has been allowed to expand into only one new province a year, according to Tyrrell Schmidt, Cigna International's chief marketing officer.
A director at a major international bank -- who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from the Chinese government, as did managers at other companies interviewed about expanding abroad -- said the organization had scores of employees in China, and about 90 percent of them were there solely to deal with the country's regulatory issues and licensing requirements for foreigners.
Most of America's public efforts to increase exports to China, however, involve whether the country's currency policies are making its goods artificially cheap.
''What we really care about is market access,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, a trade economist at Cornell University who focuses on China. ''And that's where we're having trouble getting politicians to take notice.''
Part of the reason that the United States doesn't aggressively protest when other countries hinder services is that it doesn't have the authority.
Multilateral trade agreements have led to relatively freer trade in goods, but not in services. The United States can file a dispute with the World Trade Organization over a tariff, but generally cannot do the same for licensing fees, partnership requirements and other obstacles that countries can impose on services.
The United States has negotiated freer market access with a few countries, including South Korea and Chile. Though a broader services agreement has been talked about for decades, it has repeatedly been put off for various reasons.
Developing countries have declared they must liberalize trade in agriculture before even considering services, and Congress is reluctant to dismantle its generous agricultural subsidies.
Another obstacle is that the states, and not the federal government, control market access for many services through licenses. For example, the federal government doesn't control whether a worker can practice law in Arizona; Arizona does. That makes it difficult for America's federal trade negotiator to work with other countries over licensing issues.
Some business leaders also want to fight protectionism with protectionism rather than invest more efforts in trade negotiations.
Because some foreign governments allow only their own engineering firms to bid on state-financed projects, there are questions about whether American projects should remain open to international competitors.
''It's not a level playing field,'' said Gregs G. Thomopulos, the chief executive of Stanley Consultants in Muscatine, Iowa, and a past president of the International Federation of Consulting Engineers. He said the American government should retaliate by blocking foreign bids on American aid projects.
''We're using American money and we need to showcase American experience,'' he said. ''What better way to help the job process than by employing American firms and American staff who pay taxes here?''
Perhaps the most basic constraint is not abroad but here in the United States, which has relatively tight immigration controls. Services often require workers to travel freely across borders. Asking India to allow American consultants to enter and leave Delhi at will is difficult if the United States cannot -- or, more accurately, will not -- reciprocate.
Economists acknowledge concerns about freer trade displacing some American workers. But they say the United States would nonetheless have a net gain in jobs if borders everywhere were more open.
''We need to have a visa policy that allows businesses to operate efficiently at home and abroad, and that allows all professionals to be able to move back and forth between corporate offices,'' said Jeffrey J. Schott, a former trade negotiator and now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute. ''If we don't, why would anyone else?''

HEADLINE: Meccas of Shopping Try Hand at Being Misers of Energy

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
FOR most people, talking about commercial air filters is a great way to end a conversation. To Charlie Brantl and Bob Devine, it is an invitation to an hourlong discussion.
They are engineers, in charge of finding ways to conserve energy and reduce waste at the Mall of America south of Minneapolis, the country's largest shopping and entertainment complex. And they talk excitedly about everything related to saving energy, including skylights, low-flush toilets and, yes, commercial air filters.
Their enthusiasm is a prime reason the Mall of America, now in its 20th year, can claim to continually reduce costs through conservation. But it is a complicated process because the mall is not just large, but also composed of hundreds of enterprises -- stores, restaurants and an amusement park. And it is heated not conventionally but by skylights, electric lights and the body heat of 45 million visitors annually.
Still, because the Mall of America is so vast -- 4.2 million square feet and growing, a space that could fit seven Yankee Stadiums -- companies with energy savings to sell clamor to have Mr. Brantl and Mr. Devine test and, they hope, order their products. As a result, the mall has become a proving ground for the most energy-efficient and reasonably priced technology. 
''We get calls about new technology and dig into it and see if it is smoke and mirrors,'' Mr. Brantl said, adding that many products he sees do not meet his employer's requirement that investments pay for themselves in energy savings within four years. ''We only purchase what we've tested.''
The Mall of America is among the many companies investing more in energy efficiency. For years, ''conservation was sometimes seen as a penalty, a heavy cost, a cutting-back, a reduction in living standards, a form of self-denial,'' Daniel Yergin wrote in his book ''The Quest: Energy, Security and the Remaking of the Modern World.''
That view has changed, he and others say, because developing nations are consuming more of the world's resources, leading to higher costs for all in a sluggish economy. To many, energy efficiency has become the ''Fifth Fuel'' -- after coal, petroleum, nuclear power and renewables like wind and solar -- and an important way to address environmental concerns like global warming.
But unlike wind turbines, solar panels and other technologies that increase supply (or replace dirtier energy), conservation reduces demand, which can be more difficult to calculate and justify financially.
''Energy efficiency is a negative,'' said Ben Finkelor, the executive director of the Energy Efficiency Center at the University of California, Davis. ''It's easier to say how many kilowatts we produced. Calculating the kilowatt avoided is much harder.''
Energy conservation got its first lift after the oil shocks of the 1970s, and some of the measures taken by President Jimmy Carter have worked. The United States uses only half as much energy for the same economic output as four decades ago, Mr. Yergin said. And while the economy has almost tripled in size, adjusted for inflation, total energy use has grown only about 30 percent, he said. President Obama has made energy efficiency a priority as well. Last year, he announced the Better Buildings Initiative, setting a national target of improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings by 20 percent by 2020. If met, that goal would reduce the energy bills of American businesses by $40 billion a year. Many industries and service providers have embraced efficiency. Hotels are using fewer towels, banks are going paperless, and grocery stores are rewarding customers who use their own bags.
Retailers and shopping malls, though, provide one of the best chances to save energy, Mr. Finkelor said -- and not just through the consumer energy-saving gadgets sold at home improvement stores and departments. Retailers themselves use about 20 percent of the energy consumed by all commercial businesses, and they are the fastest-growing commercial category of energy users, according to the Energy Department.
Retailers invested more in energy efficiency during the recession to offset declines in consumer spending, take advantage of state and federal tax incentives and meet demands from shareholders to cut costs. Wal-Mart, for instance, has been painting store roofs white to reflect sunlight and reduce the use of air-conditioning. It is also capturing rain in storage tanks for flushing toilets and other uses that do not require potable water, and installing LED lights in parking lots to cut energy use by more than 50 percent and maintenance by more than 30 percent.
''The bottom line for us is we're really committed to our mission to save our customers money, which means preserving everyday low prices, which means having everyday low costs,'' said Kim Saylors-Laster, the vice president of energy at Wal-Mart, which aims for a three-year payback on its investments in energy efficiency projects.
The Mall of America is installing more efficient air filters in its 33 mammoth cooling units. The new filters eliminate the need for more than 3,000 pre-filters to be changed each year, which reduces waste. And because the new filters are thinner, they require less power to push air through them.
Macy's has cut its energy bill by 30 percent since 2002 by, among other things, adding sensors that automatically turn off lights in stockrooms, turning off signs at night and installing one million LED lights, according to Bill Lyon, vice president of energy management. Macy's centrally schedules and controls its lighting and air-conditioning and monitors energy use to spot waste. ''Twenty years ago, we'd get information on energy use in a report at the end of the month,'' said Daniel Butler, vice president of retail operations at the National Retail Federation. ''Now, we can quickly address it in a day.''
Challenges remain. Retailers with older stores must spend more to retrofit them. Mall operators are also trying to move away from leases that include energy costs because tenants have less incentive to conserve. Instead, they are installing meters in individual stores to track use and having the tenants pay their own energy bills, encouraging them to save energy, too.
Retailers are also signing long-term deals with utilities and, when possible, installing solar panels and wind turbines. Wal-Mart, Kohl's, Safeway and Macy's are among the top 20 producers of clean energy on their premises, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Wal-Mart, the country's largest retailer, is the most aggressive. In 2005, it set a target of using 100 percent renewable energy. To hold itself accountable, Wal-Mart now publishes a quarterly figure to chart progress. In the first quarter, it produced 4 percent of its own energy and bought an additional 18 percent of green power from the grid. (A spokesman explained that ''sometimes our size and scale can work against us.'')
Still, the company says, hundreds of locations meet as much as 30 percent of their power needs with renewable energy. In California, the company aims to put solar panels on 75 percent of its stores by the end of 2013. It says the panels will provide 20 to 30 percent of each location's electricity needs. In Texas, Wal-Mart buys wind energy to provide up to 15 percent of the total energy for more than 360 stores.
Contracting for clean energy ''is sort of the win-win for retailers,'' said Michael Bernier, senior manager in the national tax group at Ernst & Young, who helps companies find tax credits for renewable energy. ''You get the benefit from going green, you turn electricity to a fixed cost from a variable cost, and in very attractive states you can often get immediate cost savings.''

HEADLINE: Economic Theory Plots a Course for Good Food

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
ALEXANDRIA, Va.
TAKE a renowned economist to lunch, and you learn a few things. For instance, if you dine where children are among the patrons, you can count on bad food. Children are, in fact, one of the reasons American food got so bad. The other reason? Prohibition.
At Starbucks, the price of coffee isn't so expensive. But the profit margin changes when you order any special blended milk and sugar concoction. And speaking of beverage prices, if you must order a Coke with your meal, it tends to be cheapest at Chinese restaurants.
Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University, compiles these findings and more in a new book, ''An Economist Gets Lunch,'' which is part economic history of American food, part attack on the self-righteousness of locavores and other food snobs and part guide to getting a better meal at home or a restaurant. 
Some tips on good eating from Professor Cowen:
If something on the menu sounds bad, it might well be especially good. Order the ugly and the unknown.
Avoid restaurants with beautiful women, hipsters and smiling and laughing people.
Look for the most Islamic of Pakistani restaurants. No alcohol means they have to emphasize the quality of the food to win customers.
Professor Cowen is an expert on the economics of culture and the arts. ''I consider the economics of food to follow that,'' he said. ''It's a form of commercialized culture.'' He has traveled to 80 countries for lectures or research (he wrote a book on the economics of a small town in Mexico) and sometimes just to eat. In addition to his job as a professor, he writes two blogs, Marginal Revolution, on economics, and Tyler Cowen's Ethnic Dining Guide, on Washington-area food.
So where did Professor Cowen, who lives in Northern Virginia, choose to have lunch to discuss his book? An Ethiopian restaurant in a strip mall wedged between Falls Church and Alexandria, a place that illustrates his belief that anybody can use simple economic analysis to improve their odds of getting a good meal. Professor Cowen said that some of the best food in America can be found in such immigrant restaurants in malls like the ones along El Camino Real in Silicon Valley in California or on Main Street and Northern Boulevard in Flushing, Queens. The best food is not the most expensive and is rarely found in Midtown Manhattan, he said.
This restaurant, Eyo's, is off Interstate 395, near apartment towers populated by affluent Ethiopians. It is one of six restaurants in the tiny mall with a 7-Eleven sitting on one end. That's not all, Professor Cowen said: ''There are six more in the back. I've tried them all.'' His point being, of course, that a restaurant facing competition has a better chance of being good.
It's a sports bar, which seems like an unlikely choice, but not to Professor Cowen's way of thinking. He chose it precisely because it was an unlikely choice. An American sports bar might mean Buffalo wings and cheeseburgers, but an Ethiopian sports bar? ''They are making no attempt to appeal to non-Ethiopians,'' he said.
How does he know it is good? Ethiopians eat there. It's crowded. People look prosperous. But the two-page menu offers more clues. A few American items are tucked down in a corner, but other than that it is all Ethiopian. It has Ethiopian breakfast items. The descriptions are sparse, because why would they need explaining to its core audience? There are dishes on the menu that he doesn't recognize. ''That's always a good sign,'' he said.
Professor Cowen is a big believer in random ordering as a strategy. ''You increase the chances you'll find something really special,'' he said. Of course he ordered doro wot, the Ethiopian national dish, but also chose awaze tibs, a special kitfo and a vegetarian combo. The food took a while to come out of the kitchen, which Professor Cowen sees as a good sign, too; it was not sitting under a heat lamp or zapped in a microwave.
While we waited, Professor Cowen talked a little about obesity and health, the bigger issues he takes on in his book, at times sounding like Michael Pollan. He suggests people shop in Asian supermarkets. The greens are a loss leader there, he said, like milk at Safeway, and so are cheap, even as they are varied and of high quality.
He is a bit of a locavore, determining that local food tastes better. His book has a chapter on the difference between Mexican food in El Paso, Tex., and across the river in Ciudad Juarez. (The hogs are fed scraps on the Mexican side so the lard used in cooking has better flavor, he explains.)
But he is troubled by locavores who insist that they will eat only food that is trucked in from local farms. ''The environmental fetishism of the locavore is misplaced,'' he said. ''Food snobbery is pessimistic, paternalistic and most of all it is anti-innovation,'' he writes in his book. As far as carbon footprints go, he said, the local farmer's truck can use far more energy per pound of produce than the ship bringing in food from overseas. ''To me, it is a sign of how much of the debate is about image.''
Professor Cowen places some of the blame for the Dark Age of American food through most of the 20th century on Prohibition. Before the 18th Amendment banned the sale of alcohol, he said, restaurant meals in America were better because the cost of alcohol helped subsidize the food. Restaurants that survived Prohibition were better at bribery and making connections than at cooking, he said. Cheap food, and restaurants that catered to children, prospered.
He reserves his harshest comments for the damage children have done to American food. He says the exalted status children have had in dictating our food choices since the 1950s is one reason so much food is bland and not very nutritious.
He said he never preached to his daughter about eating what he ate or cooked. With the confidence of an economist who believes in market incentives with all his being, he figured that if it tasted good, she would eat it.
As for the food at Eyo's Sports Bar, it persuaded me on his thesis that immigrants rejuvenated the American palate and it was best to leave the finicky children, or teenagers, at home.
A Delicious Forecast: Dining tips from Tyler Cowen: Eat ethnic and off the beaten track. Order adventurously to find something special. Eat local, but don't lapse into food snobbery.
Online Correction: April 10, 2012, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to the Ethiopian dish doro wot as door wot. Additionally, the article referred incorrectly to awaze tibs as aware ties.

HEADLINE: Renewable Sources Of Power Survive, But in a Patchwork

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
JUST a few years ago, the future of renewable energy looked as bright and shiny as a white turbine blade coming out of the mold. The federal government was handing out money under the stimulus package, states were approving clean energy mandates, young companies were racing ahead with promising new technologies and big global developers were planting stakes for ambitious, utility-scale projects.
Now that picture has dimmed. The low price of natural gas has made renewable power less appealing to utilities and energy companies. The high price of gasoline -- which has become an issue in the presidential campaign, as Republican candidates seek to use it against President Obama, has renewed calls to increase oil exploration and production at the expense of alternatives. State lawmakers are reconsidering requirements for utilities to buy green power. Surprisingly fierce competition from Chinese photovoltaic manufacturers has driven American ventures to the brink of bankruptcy and beyond.
And the problems of Solyndra, a would-be solar panel maker that collapsed despite receiving a $535 million federal loan guarantee, have given subsidies for green energy a bad name, which in turn has weakened interest from the private sector in financing it. A tax grant program important to the solar industry has already expired, while a tax credit favored by the wind industry is scheduled to end this year. 
''Gas is wiping out every other technology in its path,'' said David Crane, chief executive of NRG Energy, a developer that canceled the Bluewater wind park off the Delaware coast last year because it could not find an investment partner. ''If renewables had gotten a couple more years of support from the federal government, it would be smooth sailing.''
Yet, though the waters ahead are choppy, with businesses laying off workers and shutting down, the prospects for renewables continue to grow. Major companies like General Electric, Dow Chemical and ConocoPhillips are developing or investing in new technologies. Many projects -- some rushing to start in time to qualify for federal tax breaks before they disappear -- are going forward.
And the Obama administration has been using some of its powers to promote clean energy, taking steps to open public lands and waters to private development of solar and wind power, while the Defense Department has been aggressively pursuing alternatives, both for its bases and for forces in the field. Late last year, for instance, SolarCity, a company based in San Mateo, Calif., announced that Merrill Lynch was lending it up to $350 million to install enough panels to power 120,000 military homes.
Many business executives, policy analysts and investors say there is a robust future for domestic solar energy distributed in medium-size arrays and on commercial and residential rooftops, especially in markets with high electricity prices or strong mandates, like Hawaii, California and much of the Northeast.
The low cost of solar panels, whose average price dropped 50 percent last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, has helped. So have new financing methods that allow owners to lease systems long term, cutting their current electricity costs with little or no upfront investment. Last year, about 1,855 megawatts of new photovoltaic capacity was installed, according to a report by the association, more than double the 887 megawatts of the year before.
Despite having lost the program that allowed developers to recoup 30 percent of their costs as a cash grant, the solar industry is still eligible through 2016 for a tax credit to be taken over five years, making its future seem in some ways more solid than that of the wind power industry, even though it far outstrips solar already.
''There's a great environment for solar for the next four years, and wind potentially falls off a cliff at the end of 2012,'' said John Ewen, head of investment banking at Ardour Capital, which focuses on energy, referring to a wind power production tax credit that has been in place since 1992 but is scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Part of the appeal of solar power as a long-term investment, he said, was that the sun's cost as a fuel was predictable and essentially free.
''It's clearly a better credit to bet on the sun coming up tomorrow than the price of natural gas,'' he said.
Although wind has some of the same advantages, development faces a different set of challenges. Unlike solar power, which can operate efficiently on a small scale, wind projects often make economic sense only if they are huge, but they can end up generating electricity far from where it is needed, throwing up the political, logistical and parochial hurdles of streaming electrons across county and state lines.
Still, plans for enormous projects are beginning to move ahead. One such project, by Clean Line Energy, which develops high-voltage transmission lines, would create enough capacity to take 3,500 megawatts of wind power from Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota to Illinois and states to the east.
With national energy policy bedeviled -- and without a controlled market like China's or the feed-in tariffs that have driven the use of renewables in Europe (to mixed results) -- the United States is developing into a green-energy crazy quilt, a kind of regional patchwork driven by mandates.
''There's a coalition of the willing here among states and regions that already have parts of these policies, and it does seem to be the U.S. tradition to have diverse, often-conflicting policies state by state,'' said Daniel M. Kammen, a professor of energy, nuclear engineering and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. ''This is kind of a chaotic picture moving in the right direction.''
So New Jersey, which has a robust set of solar incentives and a relatively strong state mandate for clean power, has become the nation's second-biggest solar market (after California) and the national leader in commercial rooftop photovoltaic installations. But in Georgia, where the main utility says it has the sole authority to sell electricity, small-scale solar power has not flourished because property owners must purchase systems themselves rather than lease them from companies like Sunrun for a monthly fee.
Hawaii has made itself into a multi-island energy laboratory, experimenting with everything it can, including wave, wind, solar and biomass sources. California is to start a carbon market in November. And New Mexico is expected to be home to Tres Amigas, a kind of electricity hub that is to connect three United States grids and integrate power from solar, wind and geothermal sources by 2014.
How all this plays out remains to be seen. ''This industry is going through a transformation and elements of it are going to probably be fairly disruptive, but I think it's kind of inevitable that a lot of these things are going to unfold,'' said Theodore F. Craver, Jr., chief executive of Edison International, whose subsidiaries include electric power generators and Southern California Edison, one of the nation's largest utilities. ''Getting the timing right, figuring out exactly what direction some of these changes are going to take -- of course that's the big question.''

HEADLINE: Nuclear Power's Death Somewhat Exaggerated

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
NUCLEAR energy is going through an odd patch. It refuses to die, but it does not prosper.
This is how modest the nuclear industry's prospects now look: Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican who has called for building 100 reactors in the next few years, told a conference of industry specialists in late March that the long-ballyhooed ''nuclear renaissance'' did not really exist anymore. Now, he said, it is an ''awakening to the awareness of nuclear.''
But it is an awakening with a price of $30 billion or more. Mr. Alexander was speaking to a conference convened on the 33rd anniversary of the Three Mile Island accident, a few weeks after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave permission to build a power reactor for the first time in more than 30 years, for the twin Vogtle reactors near Augusta, Ga.
Those will cost $14 billion, if all goes well, and more if it does not. A few days after he spoke, the commission approved a license for another pair of reactors in South Carolina, which will cost about the same. Several other companies are laying out hundreds of millions of dollars in planning for reactors that may or may not get to the groundbreaking stage. 
The industry's three great recent stumbling blocks, the Fukushima accident of March 2011, the exceptionally low price of natural gas and a recession that has stunted demand for power, mock the idea that dozens of new reactors are waiting in the wings. But in an era of worry over global warming, support is plentiful for at least keeping a toe in the water.
''Even if global warming science was not explicitly invented by the nuclear lobby, the science could hardly suit the lobby better,'' complained a book published last month, ''The Doomsday Machine,'' a polemic on the evils of splitting the atom. In fact, the industry continues to argue that in the United States it is by far the largest source of zero-carbon energy, and recently began a campaign of upbeat ads to improve its image.
According to the authors of ''The Doomsday Machine,'' Martin Cohen and Andrew McKillop, ''In almost every country -- usually for reasons completely unrelated to its ability to deliver electricity -- there is almost universal political support for nuclear power.''
That is probably an exaggeration, with Japan leaving almost all of its 54 reactors idle at the moment because of the Fukushima Daiichi triple meltdown, and Germany promising to close its fleet. But China and India, two countries with enormous demand for electricity and not much hand-wringing over global warming, are planning huge reactor construction projects.
And even the Japanese catastrophe plays in some quarters as a reason to build new reactors. For example, the reactors being built in Georgia and South Carolina are the AP1000 model, with the letters standing for ''advanced passive,'' because emergency cooling relies on natural forces like gravity, evaporation and convection, not power-operated pumps and valves that require a supply of electricity, the force that Fukushima simply did not have.
At the same conference that Senator Alexander addressed, Jim Ferland, then the president and chief executive of Westinghouse Electric, insisted, ''If an AP1000 had been there, we wouldn't be having this discussion today; that plant would be back on line.'' General Electric, which designed the reactors used by Tokyo Electric Power at Fukushima, has made similar claims for its new ''passively safe'' design.
If the nation's 104 reactors, all but one finished by the 1980s, were eventually replaced, it would be with equipment that has fewer moving parts and fewer ways to get into accidents. But they may not be replaced because the competition from other sources of electricity is strong.
In the United States, nuclear power is stumbling forward because of an energy policy of limited diversity -- what President Obama refers to as his ''all of the above'' strategy. That means loan guarantees and production tax credits for new reactors, created in the George W. Bush administration, are viewed favorably in the Obama White House. But ''all of the above'' also means support for solar and wind, as well as support for oil and natural gas production, especially hydraulic fracturing for gas in shale rock.
Fracking, as it is known, has turned gas into a formidable competitor. Gas is priced in a unit called a million B.T.U.'s, a quantity that will produce about 150 kilowatt-hours, about as much as a small house uses in a week.
When gas was $14 per million B.T.U.'s, it cost 9 cents per kilowatt-hour just for the fuel. Today, with natural gas priced at about $3 per million B.T.U.'s, the fuel cost to make a kilowatt-hour is about 2 cents. That does not count the cost of building the plant to burn the gas, but it does make almost anything else, including zero-carbon sources like solar, wind and nuclear, much less attractive.
In the wings are other competitors, including the possibility of a better reactor. The Energy Department recently said it might spend $450 million on ''small modular reactors'' that could be built in a factory and trucked to sites to replace old coal plants or power small communities. The government, though, researches far more types of reactors than ever achieve commercial life.
And the Fukushima meltdowns did not help. ''It seems like every time something happens, you always get these prognostications this is the end, the nuclear industry has come to a halt,'' said William D. Magwood IV, one of the five members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and a former assistant secretary of energy in charge of promoting nuclear power.
Fukushima, said Bart Gordon, a former Democratic representative from Tennessee and former chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, was ''undermining some of the environmental converts, so the political issue is more difficult.''
Fukushima certainly did not help the South Texas Project expansion, one of the four selected by the Energy Department as prime candidates for loan guarantees. That project was in trouble before March 2011, because an important municipal partner had dropped out.
One of the replacement partners was the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which is now hardly in a position to invest in new reactors abroad. Another candidate for a loan guarantee, now probably dead, was the Calvert Cliffs 3 project, about 40 miles south of Washington, which was supposed to be built in a competitive marketplace, where the price of power was set by natural gas. That made even the Energy Department rather skeptical about its prospects.
Mr. Magwood argues that the situation is not so dire, though, because the ''renaissance'' was never as big as some people assumed. He said he calculated in 2008 that of the 23 or so projects that were under discussion, only 12 were actually under development, and of those, only 10 faced no real licensing or technical hurdles. But only five of those had clear sources of financing. He assumed three would be in the first wave; now it is two. The industry insists that even its small-scale rebirth is a step forward. Those two pairs of reactors could lay the groundwork for more.
Mr. Ferland said that AP1000s in this country would be easier to build because of the experience of construction in China. For example, he said, technicians there had misrigged one heavy component at a plant, bending it slightly and causing a two-week delay. That will not happen in Georgia or South Carolina, he said. Smaller lessons, like how to lay out cable trays so they do not occupy space later needed for other components, were accumulating rapidly, he said.
Simply breaking ground on a reactor and finishing it, something this country has not done for 30 years, would be a step forward.

HEADLINE: New Stance On Forgiving Mortgages

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The overseer of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Tuesday opened the door to forgiving some mortgage debt of homeowners who owe more than their houses are worth, as the Obama administration has recently urged.
The acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Edward J. DeMarco, said that in some circumstances it might make economic sense for the government-run companies to reduce borrowers' mortgages, taking a hit to modify the loan but also making it less likely that a homeowner will default.
But in his speech at the Brookings Institution, Mr. DeMarco described as limited the benefits from principal reduction, saying it would hardly be a magic bullet for struggling homeowners and noting that it might carry significant costs for taxpayers. His comments left doubt about whether he would change his long-held stance against principal reduction. 
''This is not about some huge difference-making program that will rescue the housing market,'' he said. ''It is a debate about which tools, at the margin, better balance two goals: maximizing assistance to several hundred thousand homeowners while minimizing further cost to all other homeowners and taxpayers.''
In a new analysis cited by Mr. DeMarco, the F.H.F.A. found that reducing mortgage principal for about 691,000 eligible underwater homeowners would reduce Fannie and Freddie's losses by about $1.7 billion, compared with doing another form of loan modification. But the Treasury Department would pay out $3.8 billion in incentives for the principal reductions, meaning a $2.1 billion net loss for the taxpayer.
Mr. DeMarco warned that allowing principal reduction might encourage some homeowners to stop paying their mortgages for the assistance, increasing the costs of such a policy. Moreover, he cautioned that it would aid fewer than one in 10 of the 11 million homeowners who owe more than their house is worth.
Mr. DeMarco also raised the thorny issue of second liens on homes where the first lien -- the mortgage -- has been reduced. Housing finance experts have expressed concern that principal reduction would unfairly benefit the banks that own many of those second liens, with some calling for second liens to be wiped out if the first lien gets cut.
Still, his remarks raised speculation that the F.H.F.A. might change its rules to allow principal reduction on mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. The agency, which oversees the two mortgage finance giants, is expected to make a decision on principal reduction in the coming weeks.
For months, Mr. DeMarco has come under fire from the administration and Democrats for objecting to principal reductions for loans backed by Fannie and Freddie on the grounds that other programs aid homeowners while saving taxpayers money. Since the government takeover, the housing companies have received more than $170 billion in federal support.
But the administration says that principal reduction can save money by reducing the chance that homeowners who are deeply under water will eventually give up on their mortgages. Moreover, it could help keep families in their homes and stabilize the overall housing market, which remains a significant drag on the recovery.
''We think there is a set of cases where it is clearly in the interest of the taxpayer to do principal reduction,'' Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, told a House subcommittee last month. ''Where it makes sense, we should do it.''
Democrats on Capitol Hill have slammed Mr. DeMarco while calling for principal write-downs. ''It appears that your refusal to follow Congress's direction and allow principal reduction programs is based more on ideology and fear of political backlash than on a straightforward analysis of the interests of American taxpayers,'' Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland and Representative John F. Tierney of Massachusetts wrote to Mr. DeMarco in a February letter.
Mr. DeMarco's resistance has also led to calls for the White House to replace him. (He is a civil servant, not an administration appointee.)
Economists have suggested that principal reductions, if granted judiciously to underwater homeowners, would help the economy. In a February white paper, the Federal Reserve supported principal reductions from the government-sponsored enterprises as one option for helping the housing market.
Mr. DeMarco's latest comments suggested that his stance might change, even though he talked down principal reduction and talked up the benefits of other F.H.F.A. policies for troubled homeowners, like letting homeowners delay mortgage payments, reducing their monthly mortgage costs or lowering their interest rates.
The analysis showing a cost to the taxpayer might not be an insurmountable barrier. If Fannie and Freddie allowed principal reduction, the Treasury Department would be taking losses. It is offering incentives to lenders using funds from the 2009 Troubled Asset Relief Program -- and it has urged F.H.F.A. to change its rules.
''Today's analysis is a step in the right direction,'' said Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, in a statement. ''We moved mountains saving the major financial institutions in 2008 and 2009. It's now time to bring the same energy and conviction to restore health to our housing market and help families stay in their homes.''

HEADLINE: Obama Goes on Offensive Over Taxes on Wealthy

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
BOCA RATON, Fla. -- All but certain now that his Republican opponent will be Mitt Romney, President Obama has made his proposed ''Buffett Rule'' minimum tax for the wealthiest Americans like Mr. Romney a centerpiece of his re-election campaign, defying the political risk of being seen as a tax-and-spender by wary voters.
With a rousing speech on Tuesday to a receptive university audience of about 5,000 in this battleground state, Mr. Obama defined the coming contest as a clash of philosophies: His argument that tax fairness and the common good demand the richest Americans pay at least as much as middle-income taxpayers do, contrasted with Republicans' opposition to any tax increases as job killers and class warfare, even at the cost of deep cuts in domestic programs.
While voters have not often rewarded candidates who advocate tax increases, Mr. Obama and his campaign advisers, in league with Democrats in Congress, express confidence that voters are on their side, with polls showing that Americans overwhelmingly agree that wealthy taxpayers should pay more and that they favor spending for programs like education, research and health care. 
The Democrats' offensive, not coincidentally, is tied to the likelihood that Mr. Romney will be the nominee. Even as Mr. Obama was speaking at Florida Atlantic University, Mr. Romney's chief Republican rival, former Senator Rick Santorum, was announcing that he is leaving the race. In past months Mr. Romney's Republican rivals had caricatured him as a Wall Street investor raking in millions with job-cutting corporate takeovers and slashing his taxes through loopholes and Swiss bank accounts, so he was hardly likely to get off more easily with Democrats.
At bottom, Mr. Obama seeks to talk about the still-weak economy and job creation in a way that plays to Mr. Romney's weaknesses, and Republicans' generally, and underplays his own political liabilities at a time of continued high unemployment and gas prices.
''These folks, they keep telling us that if we just weaken regulations that keep our air or our water clean or protect our consumers, if we would just convert these investments that we're making through our government in education and research and health care -- if we just turned those into tax cuts, especially for the wealthy, then somehow the economy is going to grow stronger. That's the theory,'' Mr. Obama said, to applause and cheers. ''And here's the news: We tried this for eight years before I took office.''
But despite anemic job growth in that period and then a recession and financial crash, Mr. Obama added, ''A lot of the folks who were peddling these same trickle-down theories -- including members of Congress and some people who are running for a certain office right now, who shall not be named -- they're doubling down on these old broken-down theories.''
Even before Mr. Obama spoke, Mr. Romney and other Republicans were firing back, making clear they will try to make the president's political gamble a loser.
''President Obama is the first president in history to openly campaign for re-election on a platform of higher taxes,'' the Romney campaign said in a statement from a spokeswoman, Gail Gitcho. ''He has already raised taxes on millions of Americans, but he won't stop there. He wants to raise taxes on millions more by taxing small businesses and job creators.''
Before the Florida trip, the White House released a report by Mr. Obama's economic team making the substantive case for what is essentially a political proposal since it has no chance of advancing in Congress before the election. The Buffett Rule would set a minimum tax rate of 30 percent for individuals on their annual income above $1 million.
The report argued that the minimum tax would restore some fairness to the tax code and reduce economically inefficient gaming of the system. Over five decades since 1960, it said, the average tax rate paid by the wealthiest Americans has dropped much more than the rate for middle-income taxpayers, even as the income of those at the top of the scale has grown significantly more than for everyone else.
''Look, I want folks to get rich in this country,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I think it's wonderful when people are successful. That's part of the American dream.''
''But understand,'' he added, ''the share of our national income going to the top 1 percent has climbed to levels we haven't seen since the 1920s. The folks who are benefiting from this are paying taxes at one of the lowest rates in 50 years.''
And Mr. Romney will personify that issue if the Obama campaign has its way. With income mostly from investments, Mr. Romney paid a tax rate of about 14 percent on about $21 million in income in each of the past two years. That effective tax rate was far below the 35 percent top rate on the highest incomes because much of his income is from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at 15 percent, and because he claimed an assortment of tax deductions. Hedge fund managers and private equity investors similarly pay the 15 percent rate on their income.
On a White House conference call with reporters, one asked administration officials why they did not simply call it the Romney Rule, given the political overtones.
Yet the politics are not clear-cut.
''If the focus is making the wealthy pay their fair share to reduce the deficit, or even fairness more generally, Democrats do well,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. ''If the issue is taxes, Democrats can have trouble. It's a delicate line to walk.''
''But here,'' Mr. Mellman added, ''Republicans are on the defensive because they have proven willing to sacrifice anything and everything to protect tax breaks for millionaires.''
While Republicans are reviving the label of tax-and-spend liberal to tar Mr. Obama, David Winston, a Republican pollster who advises House leaders, said the president's bigger risk was that voters would decide ''that he doesn't have a solution to the problem of jobs and the economy.''
''The No. 1 issue is jobs and the economy, so any proposal put forward has to look like it will advance that,'' Mr. Winston said, adding, ''I don't think anybody believes that raising taxes ever grows the economy and creates jobs.''
Mr. Obama's speech was billed as official business -- and thus his trip was partly billed to taxpayers -- yet it was sandwiched between his appearances at political fund-raisers, including with donors who would be hit by the tax increase. The speech, too, seemed like a campaign rally with Mr. Obama in rolled-up shirt-sleeves and shouting at times, and his audience -- full of the young voters whose support he seeks again -- shouting back his slogan, ''Yes we can!'' and ''Four more years!''

HEADLINE: Bush Makes a Cameo In the Tax-Cut Debate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
George W. Bush has been virtually invisible for most of President Obama's time in office.
But an offhand remark at a conference in New York City indicated that Mr. Bush is paying attention to one of the most heated debates in Washington - the future of the tax cuts he championed. 
''I wish they weren't called the Bush tax cuts,'' Mr. Bush said Tuesday at the start of a conference sponsored by the Bush Institute. ''If they're called some other body's tax cuts, they're probably less likely to be raised.''
The comment, said with a chuckle, was nonetheless a rare example of Mr. Bush injecting himself into the current political discussion.
He stayed silent during the opening of Mr. Obama's administration even as his successor set about to derail or turn back many of the policies Mr. Bush put in place.
When it came to national security, for example, Mr. Bush left it to his vice president, Dick Cheney, to lead the rhetorical assault against Mr. Obama's policies on torture and the prosecution of terrorism detainees.
And Mr. Bush has stayed out of the Republican primary during the last six months, even as his father, former president George H. W. Bush, and his brother Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, haveendorsedMitt Romney.
The future of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, which were enacted in 2001 and 2003, are at the center of the economic debate between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney, the likely Republican nominee.
After reluctantly agreeing to a two-year extension of the tax cuts in 2010, Mr. Obama now says he wants to allow taxes on wealthy Americans to rise starting in 2013. Republicans, including Mr. Romney, have said they want the tax cuts named for Mr. Bush to remain in place.
Appearing on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe'' program on Tuesday, David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, said the president would not compromise on the issue again.
''The president's going to win in November, and we are not going to extend those tax cuts for the wealthy,'' Mr. Axelrod promised on the show.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: An End to a Divisive Campaign

 BODY:
Rick Santorum's exit from the Republican presidential race deprives it of its most divisive and most sincere candidate. Where Newt Gingrich has sought new and increasingly cynical ways to pander, and Mitt Romney has desperately tried to swim away from his centrist past, Mr. Santorum seemed to believe what he was saying. 
He could stand at a microphone in a small Iowa town and make the preposterous claim that health care reform was a fundamental assault on American liberty and connect with voters who sensed that he shared their unfounded fear of government. Mr. Romney could never make that sale, having enacted his own version of universal health care as governor of Massachusetts.
But the biggest reason for the improbable rise of Mr. Santorum was his appeal to the most extreme social conservatives and evangelical Christians. His problem, in the end, was that there just weren't enough of them.
Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, sensed early on that Mr. Romney was not adequately feeding the fury of the religious right toward President Obama, and he found a singular way to combine contempt for government with the fervor of faith.
When Mr. Obama would make a public-health argument in favor of prenatal testing, or insurance coverage for contraceptives, Mr. Santorum wouldn't just disagree with him. He would accuse the president of trampling on religious freedom.
Mr. Obama's ideas of public policy constituted a ''phony theology,'' he said, an incendiary charge in a volatile political environment, as was his skeptical statement that ''the president says he's a Christian.'' Mr. Santorum didn't care about the damage he caused because it won him states with high concentrations of evangelical voters.
Mr. Santorum's strategy was insufficient, however, in part because there were enough primary voters who recognized that an extremist social message would crumble against the president in the general election campaign. He was also unable to compete with Mr. Romney's vastly superior organization and money.
With the race for the nomination now essentially over, Mr. Romney may be tempted to court Mr. Santorum's voters with a similar appeal. His embrace of the Paul Ryan budget, with its unconscionable cuts to the social safety net, represents an economic extremism not that different from Mr. Santorum's.
But, for the most part, he has stayed away from trying to split the country along religious lines. The country will benefit if that kind of politics departs from the campaign along with the man who practiced it.

HEADLINE: I'm Not Mitt Romney

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Last week Politico reported that, ever since announcing his re-election bid, President Obama's campaign has been struggling to find a slogan to sum up his reason for running. He's cycled through ''Winning the Future,'' ''We Can't Wait,'' ''An America Built to Last,'' ''A Fair Shot.'' Bruce Newman, Bill Clinton's message adviser, was quoted as saying of Obama: ''He's all over the place.'' So far, the most accurate slogan for Obama's campaign would have to be: ''I'm not Mitt Romney.'' And when you consider that Romney -- a former liberal Republican governor -- has spent the whole campaign disavowing his past, for the first time in history both candidates could legitimately run on the same slogan: ''I'm not Mitt Romney.'' 
And that's our problem. Romney has embraced the Republican budget drawn up by Representative Paul Ryan that proposes to shrink our long-term structural deficit in a way that not only would make the rich richer and the poor poorer but would deprive the country of the very discretionary spending required to do what we need most: nation-building at home. Sure, Ryan makes deep spending cuts to balance the budget in the long term. If I cut off both my thumbs, I'd also lose weight. But I'd also have a hard time getting another job.
What do we need from a presidential candidate today? We need a credible plan to do three specific things: cut, tax and invest. As the economy improves, we need to cut spending, including all entitlement programs, to fix our long-term structural deficit. We also need to raise revenue through tax reform so we don't just shred our safety nets and so we still have resources, not only for defense, but to invest in all the things that have made us great as a country: education, infrastructure, quality government institutions and government-funded research.
Finally, the plan has to win bipartisan support, so the candidate advocating it not only wins the election but has a mandate to implement his plan afterward.
The Ryan-Romney budget fails that test. As Maya MacGuineas, the president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, notes: It does not ''protect the truly disadvantaged,'' and it doesn't put tax increases for the wealthy ''on the table,'' so it has zero chance of bipartisan support.
Obama has proposed his own 10-year budget. It is much better than Ryan's at balancing our near-term need to revitalize the pillars of American success, by cutting, taxing and investing. But it does not credibly address the country's long-term fiscal imbalances, which require cuts in Medicare and Social Security.
Said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: ''The president's budget [is] a step in the right direction on deficit reduction, but not nearly sufficient. The president's budget would stabilize the debt as a share of the economy through the second half of the decade, but would do so at too high of a level and without the necessary entitlement reforms to bring down the debt over the long-run. ... It is highly disappointing that the president didn't go further in his proposals and offer a plan that is large enough to deal with the nation's fiscal challenges in the medium and long term.''
Or as Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner testified to Congress: ''Even if Congress were to enact this budget, we would still be left with -- in the outer decades as millions of Americans retire -- what are still unsustainable commitments in Medicare and Medicaid.''
So the president, too, lacks a long-term plan to cut, spend and invest at the scale we need in a way to win enough bipartisan support to make it implementable. This gets to my core difference with the president's strategy. I believed he should have accepted his own Simpson-Bowles deficit commission because it offered a plan to cut and tax that was at the scale of the problem and enjoyed at least some G.O.P. support, had the overwhelming backing of independents and even Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader, now says she felt ''fully ready to vote for that.''
If Obama had embraced the long-term deficit commission, he would have had a chance of combining it with some near-term stimulus -- investments in infrastructure -- that would have helped the economy and grow jobs. Without pairing it with Simpson-Bowles, Obama had no chance of getting more stimulus.
Obama says his plan incorporates the best of Simpson-Bowles. Not only is that not true, but it misses the politics. Republicans will never vote for an ''Obama plan.'' But had Obama embraced the bipartisan ''Simpson-Bowles,'' and added his own stimulus, he would have split the G.O.P., attracted gobs of independents and been able to honestly look the country in the eye and say he had a plan to fix what needs fixing. He would have angered the Tea Party and his left wing, which would have shown him as a strong leader ready to make hard choices -- and isolated Romney-Ryan on the fringe.
Instead, Obama is running on a suboptimal plan -- when we absolutely must have optimal -- and the slogan ''I'm not Mitt Romney.'' If he's lucky, he might win by a whisker. If Obama went big, and dared to lead, he'd win for sure, and so would the country, because he'd have a mandate to do what needs doing.

HEADLINE: Senate Race Testing Politics Of Likability

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Senator Scott P. Brown posed for pictures with President Obama two days in a row last week, smiling as Mr. Obama signed two bills that Mr. Brown co-sponsored. Never mind that he is a Republican seeking re-election in a season of strident partisanship. Mr. Brown is on a mission to persuade the voters of Massachusetts that he is as independent as politicians come.
His carefully cultivated image -- of a genial Everyman beholden to no one, flashing a moderate streak even as his friend and erstwhile mentor Mitt Romney hews to conservative ideas in the Republican presidential primary contest -- is at the core of Mr. Brown's strategy in what has become a tight race against Elizabeth Warren, his presumed Democratic opponent.
Ms. Warren, the Harvard professor and nationally known consumer advocate, entered the race beloved by the national Democratic base and has enchanted party loyalists here. She is also raising far more money than Mr. Brown, including an extraordinary $6.9 million in the first quarter of this year, compared with $3.4 million for him. 
But for all her fans and campaign riches, Ms. Warren, has a lot of work ahead to persuade voters to oust Mr. Brown. In a Boston Globe poll released last week, 57 percent of respondents said Mr. Brown was the most likable candidate, compared with 23 percent for Ms. Warren. Asked which candidate was best able to work with the opposite party, 49 percent chose Mr. Brown and 27 percent Ms. Warren.
Over all, the poll found a dead heat, with 37 percent supporting Mr. Brown, 35 percent behind Ms. Warren and 26 percent undecided. But Mr. Brown had a 3-to-1 advantage with independent voters, who make up more than half the Massachusetts electorate. He even won praise from Democrats, 40 percent of whom said he was the most likable candidate.
Such numbers suggest that Mr. Brown may be having some success in his effort to define Ms. Warren as a Harvard elitist and a partisan ''rock-thrower.'' Meanwhile, he is playing up his Average Joe qualities on the campaign trail, using not only his famous pickup truck but also the same barn jacket that helped him beat a much better-known Democrat in the 2010 special election for what he called ''the people's seat.''
His recent schedule has been full of pickup basketball games, chili cook-offs and other events that showcase that persona.
Without the advantage of incumbency, Ms. Warren often relies on local Democratic officials or labor leaders to introduce her around. And while she is poised and energetic on the campaign trail, giving a stump speech that details her rise from the daughter of a maintenance man in Oklahoma to a ''fancy professor'' who champions the middle class, hers is a different kind of interaction with voters.
She is new at it, and learning on an unusually prominent stage. Despite her folksy approach, the response of those who meet her for the first time is often polite formality, not the warmer, more familiar type of exchange that voters tend to have with Mr. Brown.
At a St. Patrick's Day lunch in Quincy, Ms. Warren gamely joined a dais full of local politicians and offered a few jokes that promptly fell flat.
''I'll get there with you guys,'' she ventured after a joke about Rick Santorum fizzled.
Yet two days later, at a much larger breakfast in South Boston, Ms. Warren breezed through a comedy routine, drawing particular laughs when she said she had heard that Mr. Brown's barn jacket cost $600.
''Wow, here's a guy who could use a consumer advocate,'' she said.
Like Mr. Brown, she is also using social media to share personal details that might help her connect. On Saturday, she posted a picture of herself on Facebook dyeing eggs with her young granddaughters. She has posted on Facebook and Twitter about her golden retriever, Otis, and about the fact that she bakes ''a wicked apple pie.''
While may voters who meet her are noncommittal, Ms. Warren frequently encounters one or two people who know her background and are already loyal fans.
''She is really an expert economically,'' said Delia Roffo, a self-described liberal Democrat who wanted her picture taken with Ms. Warren in Brighton, a working-class neighborhood of Boston. ''I think it'll be a close race, if only because Scott Brown isn't a right-wing Republican. But I am really confident she's going to make it.''
Ms. Roffo said she was certain that Ms. Warren would capture the female vote, a bloc that she undoubtedly needs to win. But Mr. Brown has been actively courting women: he recently visited a shelter for victims of domestic violence, called for women to have combat roles in the military and announced a Women for Brown committee with Senator Olympia J. Snowe, the moderate Maine Republican who is retiring at year's end.
Democrats like to point out that Ms. Warren will be on the ticket in a presidential election year, in a state where Mr. Obama remains popular. That alone could make it hard for Mr. Brown to beat her, although a number of independents and even some Democrats could split their ticket out of fondness for Mr. Brown.
For now, Ms. Warren says that if voters realize how long and hard she has fought for the middle class, she will win. She constantly reminds them of her work setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington and, before that, as a bankruptcy expert shining a light on the erosion of the middle class.
''I'm the one out there working for America's middle class,'' Ms. Warren said in a recent interview. ''I really think that's what this race is about: whose side do you stand on?''
But she is also aware that another question -- ''Are you one of us?'' -- matters, too. In announcing her fund-raising total for the first quarter of 2012, Ms. Warren emphasized that she raised more money from Massachusetts residents, about $2.5 million, than Mr. Brown. That could help combat Republican criticism that she is buoyed mostly by outside support.
The Brown campaign, meanwhile, is playing up a new fund-raising appeal called ''Win a day with Scott Brown.'' Voters can enter the contest by contributing to his campaign; the winner will get to ride with Mr. Brown in his truck and share lunch with him at Kelly's Roast Beef, a Boston-area institution. The two will also ''squeeze in a round of bowling'' and a beer at a Boston pub.
To date, Ms. Warren has offered no such sweepstakes. But she predicted that Mr. Brown's attempt to paint the race as between a regular guy and an out-of-touch academic would ring hollow as voters got to know her better.
''His best shot is to call me names and try to describe me as something I'm not,'' she said. ''I've got another seven months to just keep saying, 'This is who I am.' ''

HEADLINE: Deal Professor: For Some Corporate Chiefs, Private Security Is a Tax Break

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer, is a professor of law and finance at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Most people would think that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court would need more security than Alan R. Mulally, the chief executive of Ford Motor Company.
Ford's directors don't seem to agree. The board requires that Mr. Mulally - for safety reasons - fly on a private jet whether he is going to Washington for business or Hawaii for vacation.
Justice Ginsburg flies commercial with all its attendant hassles. Last year, she and other passengers were forced to evacuate a United Airlines flight via an emergency slide. 
Mr. Mulally is not alone. Dozens of corporate boards, including those of Halliburton, Kraft, Home Depot and Waste Management, insist or recommend that their top executives fly on private jets for security reasons.
In the name of security, companies also pay for home alarm systems, 24-hour monitoring and even chauffeurs. The Macy's board provides its chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren, with a car and driver to ensure his ''personal safety,'' a perk that is also bestowed on the heads of Cablevision, NCR, Time Warner and Tootsie Roll Industries. Hertz even provides a driver trained in ''evasive driving techniques,'' whatever that means.
Are corporate chieftains really in that much danger?
The answer has to be no in most cases. The number of people who know the name of Tootsie Roll's boss, Melvin J. Gordon, is likely to be smaller than the number of law students who study Justice Ginsburg's cases. Steven P. Jobs, arguably the most famous chief executive, received no security services from Apple last year before he died.
Rather, directors often dole out personal safety perks to ease a chief executive's tax bill. By classifying the benefits as security measures, the executives typically get a better tax treatment on the services.
It's a common corporate tax trick.
Each year, companies spend millions of dollars to ensure the ostensible safety of their executives, services that sometimes extend to others. Ford, for example, picks up the tab for family members who fly with Mr. Mulally. The automaker estimated that it spent $178,571 on Mr. Mulally's and his family's personal air travel last year. Ford declined to comment.
Board members, too, can benefit.
Last year, Northrop Grumman paid to put its lead independent director, Lewis W. Coleman, in a ''more secure residence,'' according to a regulatory filing. For those who need translation, it seems that Northrop Grumman helped Mr. Coleman buy a new house.
He's an expensive board member. Over all, Northrop Grumman spent $5,203,559 on security protection for Mr. Coleman, including about $1.5 million for personal travel for him and his family. Northrop Grumman even appears to pay to fly him in a private jet when he is traveling on business for his day job as president of DreamWorks Animation.
Northrop Grumman justifies the expense because of ''specific threat information'' from law enforcement. I find it telling that DreamWorks doesn't require security for him. Northrop Grumman declined to comment further.
Such perks persist even against the backdrop of political or shareholder pressure.
Ford shed its fleet of corporate jets in 2008, after a furor at the automakers' use of private planes to fly their chiefs to Congressional hearings during the financial crisis. But Ford still pays a jet charter service for Mr. Mulally and his family. At General Motors, which still has to repay its taxpayer bailout, its chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, must fly commercial, unless he gets special dispensation from the government.
The corporate jet is so valued that it is often the last service to be cut.
In 2011, Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken, ended some of its executive perks, including a car and driver, club membership and annual physical. But Yum still requires its chief executive, David C. Novak, to take a private jet for all his travel. The restaurant chain estimates that it spent $214,017 on personal air travel for Mr. Novak last year.
Those personal safety perks create big tax savings.
Let's say you are a chief executive who wants to take the company's jet. If the trip is business related, then it's all pretty straightforward. The company pays for it and deducts the expense under a complicated formula.
It's a different case for personal travel. In those cases, chief executives are required to pay income tax on the imputed portion of the flight - that is, the amount the company paid for the flight. So a chief executive who is a frequent flier can rack up a rather large tax bill.
Luckily, the tax code offers executives a break.
If an outside security consultant determines that executives need a private jet and other services for their safety, the Internal Revenue Service cuts corporate chieftains a break. In such cases, the chief executive will pay a reduced tax bill or sometimes no tax at all.
Even when tax is due, the company sometimes takes care of it. Northrop Grumman spent $174,953 last year to cover the tax bill for Mr. Coleman's personal air travel.
The loser is, you guessed it, the federal government, which receives less tax revenue.
I typically have no problem with private jet travel for executives doing company business. Just try to travel through La Guardia Airport, and you can see what a time saver it would be to avoid the security lines.
But companies cite security issues to get their executives better tax treatment for things like personal air travel. It's also a way to justify the expense to shareholders. In this era of crimped earnings and sluggish economic growth, the benefits - and the reasons the companies give for them - ring especially hollow.
While statistics are not available, some companies are reversing longstanding policies to provide jets and the like for security reasons. This year, the Williams Companies, the natural gas producer, eliminated the home security program and the air travel requirement for its chief executive.
The shift comes as profits and stocks slump. Years ago, ''executives were looking for methods of reducing the fringe benefit cost of using the company aircraft,'' said Keith G. Swirsky, president and chairman of the aviation and tax groups of GKG Law, a firm that focuses on transportation law. Now, he added, companies are looking to eliminate the perks partly in deference to shareholders.
Perhaps if the tax laws were revised, chief executives would still take the private jet while Justice Ginsburg flew commercial. But at least the taxpayers wouldn't be subsidizing it in the name of security.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Mr. Obama and the 'Buffett Rule'

 BODY:
President Obama accomplished two things when he made the case on Tuesday for the so-called Buffett Rule, which would require millionaires to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes. He persuasively argued that it would be a step toward fairness in a tax code tilted in favor of the wealthiest Americans. Not incidentally, it allowed him to take an implicit shot at his virtually certain opponent, Mitt Romney, both personally and politically.
Mr. Romney disclosed in January that his tax bill last year came to about 14 percent of his $21 million income, roughly the same percentage faced by middle-rung taxpayers. Even more important, Mr. Romney is determined to continue slashing taxes for the rich, starving the nation of needed revenue, while deepening the deficit. 
The Buffett Rule, which would raise an estimated $50 billion over 10 years, would not make an appreciable dent in the deficit or provide a lot more for essential programs. By comparison, letting the Bush-era tax cuts expire for taxpayers making more than $250,000 a year, as the president has also called for, would raise $800 billion over 10 years.
Mr. Obama must ensure that the Buffett Rule does not become a substitute for ending those tax cuts.
The president is right that income inequality is a serious and growing problem and should be a central issue in this year's campaign. On Tuesday, he said the big question for Americans is, can ''we succeed as a nation where a shrinking number of people are doing really, really well, but a growing number are struggling to get by? Or are we better off when everybody gets a fair shot?''
Unfairness in the tax burden is one important example and driver of that divide. The White House released tax data showing that the average federal tax rate of the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans has fallen from 51 percent to 26 percent over the last 50 years. At the same time, the middle-class tax burden was basically unchanged or slightly higher, with those taxpayers paying 16 percent of their income in federal taxes in 2010, versus 14 percent 50 years ago.
What Mr. Obama did not say, but which must be part of a serious tax debate, is that the main reason for the low tax rates on the wealthy is the preferential treatment of investment income. It is taxed at a top rate of 15 percent, versus top rates between 25 percent and 35 percent on wages and salary for many working Americans. Applying the same tax rates to all forms of income would be a more direct way to address tax inequality.
The Buffett Rule is a compelling symbol, but it comes with policy risks. After setting the standard for wealth at $1 million in annual income, Mr. Obama will now have to vigilantly fend off lawmakers, from both parties, who will be eager to preserve the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone making less than that. The $250,000 threshold is not only fair, it is essential for raising substantial and much-needed revenue.
The discussion of inequality must not end with a debate on taxes. To ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared among all Americans, Washington must do a lot more to strengthen the institutions that foster broad prosperity. Those include public education, universal health care, Social Security, affirmative action, financial regulation and the minimum wage.
Mr. Obama has set his campaign in the right direction. But it is only a start.

HEADLINE: Income and Living Standards

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: It has proved much harder to measure consumer consumption precisely than to measure income, but three researchers have found one way to take a close look, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
 
Perhaps the most important indicator in economics is the standard of living, often identified with "consumption": the amount of consumer goods and services that people acquire. Despite a wealth of data on other economic subjects, our measurement of consumption is still rather primitive.
A recent study by my University of Chicago colleague Erik Hurst and Profs. Orazio Attanasio and Luigi Pistaferri attempts some repairs on the little consumption data we have, in order to get a better understanding of how living standards relate to income. 
Economists believe that maintaining and enhancing one's standard of living are among the most important motivators of economic behavior. A few people work purely for the sake of working, but many others work with the primary intention of providing for themselves and their families. A few people save purely for the joy of saving, but many others save so that they can maintain their living standard in the future, when they might be unemployed or retired. One criticism of the Soviet Union's economic approach was that while it could create a vast military infrastructure it generated relatively little for consumers.

For these reasons, consumption may be a more important economic indicator than even gross domestic product, which is the total production in the economy. 
Although much attention is accorded to the various monthly reports of United States consumer-spending statistics, we economists have surprisingly little information about the amount and nature of consumer spending. A large number of household surveys carefully measure family incomes and their various sources but offer little or no indication of how much those households spend.
One reflection of the lack of consumer spending data is that we know a lot more about the income situation of the poor than we know about what they are spending and what their standards of living are.
We also know a lot about how incomes have evolved over time, especially how less-skilled workers saw little growth in their earning power over the last several decades while skilled workers saw sharp increases in their incomes. These trends are sometimes described as growing wage or income "inequality" - that is, say, a growing gap between the wages of people above average and the wages of those below average.
Less is known about the equality or inequality of living standards, because there is less data on consumer spending by households. To make matters worse, some of the relatively little household spending data we have appears to be ill suited for measuring the amount of inequality in living standards and how it has changed over time. 
Among other things, higher-income households appear to underreport their consumer spending relative to low-income households and to an increasing degree over time.
The study by Professors Hurst, Attanasio and Pistaferri tried to correct for these measurement challenges by looking at, among other things, the gaps between high- and low-income households in terms of their spending on entertainment and on food and in terms of the number of vehicles they own. 
The results suggest that consumer-spending inequality has increased over the last 30 years, much like the well-known increases in wage and income inequality.

HEADLINE: Should the U.S. Focus on Exporting Services?

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: While manufacturing has received government support, a growth in services exports may be more likely, some experts say. 

 BODY:
"In the drive to double America's exports, Washington has been focusing on manufacturers," Catherine Rampell writes in The New York Times. "But that may be the wrong target."
The United States' educated work force and culture of innovation means it has an advantage in high-skilled jobs like engineering, law and finance, she writes. But the government has focused on supporting manufacturing instead. Take this Indian example: 
"Under current policy, manufacturing companies enjoy special tax cuts and other subsidies, and can count on the government to protest when American goods face unfair tariffs. For example, when India passed tariffs on alcohol imports that tripled the price of Jack Daniels whisky, the United States fought back. But to this day India requires New York Life Insurance to give three-quarters of its Indian profits to a local partner, Washington does not intervene." 
Economists see tremendous potential for growth - if, that is, Washington helps clear the way, she writes. 
As the developed world has gotten wealthier, global demand for skills and services - especially the higher-end ones - has risen.
And America already exports more services than any other country in the world, even more than the next two competitors combined. In 2011, that amounted to $612 billion exported in services, up 10.1 percent from 2009, and up 136 percent since 1991.
Still, there is great untapped potential for more, since all of these exports are being sold from a tiny share of all the American companies that could participate in the global marketplace.
"There is this huge infrastructure boom where these big, fast-growing economies are going to need to build out their roads, sewers, telecommunications networks, factories, airports, harbors, you name it," said J. Bradford Jensen, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and author of a recent book on global services trade. 
"All those projects require armies of architects, engineers, project managers, financial insurers. These are all the kinds of tradable services that we have an advantage in providing."

TOP STORIES
For Some Corporate Chiefs, Private Security Is a Tax Break | Dozens of corporate boards, including those of Halliburton, Kraft, Home Depot and Waste Management, insist or recommend their chief executives fly on private jets for security reasons. It is a common corporate tax trick, the Deal Professor writes.
In the name of security, companies also pay for home alarm systems, 24-hour monitoring and even chauffeurs. The Macy's board provides its chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren, with a car and driver to ensure his "personal safety," a perk that is also bestowed on the heads of Cablevision, NCR, Time Warner and Tootsie Roll Industries. Hertz even provides a driver trained in "evasive driving techniques," whatever that means. DealBook 
Bernanke Quietly Criticizes Lack of Repo Reforms | Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, does not sound very happy with the state of affairs in a crucial part of the financial system.
In a speech on Monday night, Mr. Bernanke highlighted the lack of progress in overhauling something called the tri-party repo market, through which banks and other financial firms borrow and lend money. It follows an announcement in February by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that a special industry task force it sponsored to promote repo reforms had not achieved its goals in the time expected.
What is it about the tri-party repo market - which totaled $2.8 trillion before the 2008 financial crisis - that is prompting the Fed to make rare expressions of impatience? Most concerns center on the role of the two banks - JPMorgan Chase and BNY Mellon - that handle crucial parts of the repo trades. DealBook

HEADLINE: Daily Report: A Turning Point for Mobile

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Facebook's acquisition of Instagram could be something of a turning point, as even Facebook tries to get a better grasp on a market that requires a rethinking of old rules. But it was probably not crazy to pay $1 billion. 

 BODY:
The $1 billion deal for Instagram reveals quite a bit about the shifting technology industry.
Facebook's acquisition of Instagram looks like something of a turning point, as even the Web giant Facebook tries to get a better grasp on a market that requires a rethinking of old rules, writes Jenna Wortham. Smartphones are everywhere now, allowing apps like Foursquare and Path to be self-contained social worlds, existing almost entirely on mobile devices. It is a major change from just a few years ago, underscoring how the momentum in the tech world is shifting to mobile from computers.
Somini Sengupta and Nick Bilton also report that the history of Silicon Valley suggests that expensive purchases of start-ups by start-ups may not always be so crazy.
There was eBay buying PayPal in 2002. Google bought YouTube in 2006. Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of PayPal who went on to found LinkedIn, the social networking site, said that acquisitions were made partly to gain something valuable, but also to stave off the competition. "History shows they fail most of the time, but when they win it's very valuable," he said. "There's always the blended question of opportunity and threat." 
At Wired.com, Andy Baio made an interesting observation about the price Facebook agreed to pay. He wrote that although the price-to-user ratio of Instagram is low compared with other high-priced tech acquisitions, the price-to-employee ratio was one of the highest. "No bubble to see here," is the headline. 
Mike Panzario at Nextweb points out that Instagram, for the first time, is at the top of the Apple App Store rankings. 
Jack Shafer at Reuters riffs on the path from the telephone to Instagram.
 "At least as of yesterday, as our progression from voice (via telephone) to text (via email) to voice (via mobile phone) and back to text again has been interrupted by Instagram's pictures. These pictures take us to a post-verbal, post-textual place that cries out for Marshall McLuhan to interpret." he writes. 
Fixing reference to the price-to-employee ratio in the Instagram deal, which is high, not low.

HEADLINE: Reminders of Romney's Comments, From the Obama Camp

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: With a new video, the Obama campaign is working to remind voters of the things Mitt Romney said during the primary. 

 BODY:
 As Mitt Romney begins to pivot to the general election, President Obama's campaign is working to remind voters of the things Mr. Romney said during the primary.
In a new "greatest hits" video, the Obama campaign highlights what it calls "memories to last a lifetime" from the campaign trail. They include some of Mr. Romney's most oft-cited comments on issues that may come back to haunt him as he tries to attract swing voters, including: 
"Corporations are people, my friend."
"I like being able to fire people that provide services to me."
"I was a severely conservative Republican governor."
The video by Mr. Obama's "Truth Team" makes no effort to put any of Mr. Romney's statements into context. For example, the comment about liking to fire people was really said about being able to change health insurance providers.
But as the campaigns begin to engage each other more directly, it is clear that the competing narratives are set.
Mr. Obama and his advisers are hoping to portray Mr. Romney as an out-of-touch, wealthy conservative whose statements about a number of issues - immigration, women's health, the budget - appear too extreme to moderate and independent voters.
The video shows Mr. Romney saying he would support an amendment to establish that life begins at conception. It shows him saying the way to fix the housing market is to "let it run the course, hit the bottom." It shows him pledging to veto the Dream Act, which would offer some illegal immigrants brought to this country as children a path to citizenship.
Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, said that: "It's no surprise with the worst job creation record in modern history and a platform of raising taxes that President Obama would try to distract Americans from the real issues. Unemployment is up, incomes are down and gas prices are through the roof. Mitt Romney is running to get Americans back to work and the country back on track."

HEADLINE: Appeals Court Limits Law Used in Goldman Programmer Case

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The federal law, the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, should not have been used to convict Sergey Aleynikov, the appeals court said. 

 BODY:
A federal appeals court has restricted the use of a national law cited in federal prosecutors' efforts to convict a former Goldman Sachs programmer accused of illegally downloading computer code from his onetime employer.
In an opinion released on Wednesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the former employee, Sergey Aleynikov, had not violated the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 or federal stolen property laws. The opinion elaborates on the February decision by a three-judge panel of the appeals court to overturn Mr. Aleynikov's conviction, a reversal that dealt a blow to one of the most prominent federal prosecutions of corporate espionage in recent years.
"This is a case where the facts didn't fit the federal statute," said William H. Devaney, a partner at the law firm Venable and a former federal prosecutor. "I wouldn't be surprised at all to see an attempt to amend the statutes in Congress to cover fact patterns like the one presented in this case."
Mr. Aleynikov was arrested nearly three years ago, after Goldman accused him of downloading code for its high-speed computerized trading operations.
The highly paid programmer, who had accepted a job at a software company catering to other trading firms, uploaded critical source code to an overseas server in his final days. By doing so, he was able to circumvent the bank's security system.
Mr. Aleynikov was convicted in December 2010.
The appeal centered on whether his actions constituted a crime under the Economic Espionage Act. Prosecutors argued that Goldman's high-frequency trading system was produced for interstate commerce, while Mr. Aleynikov's lawyers countered that it was meant for internal use.
Writing for the appeals court, Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs, who presided over the February appeals hearing, agreed with the defense. While conceding that Goldman's code was "highly valuable," he said the investment bank's trading program was never intended to be sold. That fell short of the interstate commerce requirements of the Economic Espionage Act, according to the appeals court's reading of the statute.
Because the high-frequency trading system "was not designed to enter or pass in commerce, or to make something that does, Aleynikov's theft of source code relating to that system was not an offense" under the Economic Espionage Act, Judge Jacobs wrote in the opinion.
"This is a complete repudiation of a prosecution that should never have been brought," Kevin H. Marino, a lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov, said in a telephone interview. "The principal lesson to be drawn from this is that the business of prosecuting criminal cases ought to be left to the executive branch, not the hands of a powerful private party like Goldman Sachs."
The judge also found that while Mr. Aleynikov had taken code and uploaded it to his own computers, he had not actually taken a physical object - and therefore had not violated the letter of federal law. That he later transferred the code to a thumb drive still did not make his actions a federal crime.
"We decline to stretch or update statutory words of plain and ordinary meaning in order to better accommodate the digital age," Judge Jacobs wrote.
In a separate opinion, Judge Guido Calabresi said that while he agreed with the court's analysis, it was hard for him "to conclude that Congress, in this law, actually meant to exempt the kind of behavior in which Aleynikov engaged." Judge Calabresi said he hoped Congress would return to the issue and clarify what it meant to make criminal under the Economic Espionage Act.
A spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment.

Appeals Court Opinion on Sergey Aleynikov
An earlier version of this post misidentified the federal law cited in the case against Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs programmer. It is the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, not the Electronic Espionage Act.

HEADLINE: Etching Back to the Mainstream

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: With Rick Santorum out, Mitt Romney needs to move away from the fringe-and fast. 

 BODY:
Now that Rick Santorum has cleared Mitt Romney's calendar for the rest of the pre-convention season, the presumptive nominee and the Republican Party can straighten out their strategy for the general election.
If they actually want to win in the fall, they have to give the vast majority of American voters who don't participate in Republican primaries a reason to vote for Mr. Romney that is more substantial than badly sung lyrics from "America the Beautiful," dog-whistle lines about President Obama's patriotism, and a relentless attack on women's rights. They need to find a way to Etch A Sketch back from the fringe-and fast. BuzzFeed published polling data Wednesday showing that Mr. Romney is the first non-incumbent since 1996 headed for a major party's nomination with a net negative rating among voters at this point in the campaign.

Mr. Romney might try coming up with an actual plan for economic recovery instead of droning on in a faux-Reagan way about trickle-down economics. That's unlikely to happen, though, since he seems to believe, genuinely, in the merits of keeping taxes low for the very rich.
He could also consider dropping the venomous anti-gay anti-abortion anti-woman social agenda that permeated the Republican primaries. Falling in with the party line by, just for instance, joining in the assault on Planned Parenthood cost him a lot, especially among women. In January, Mr. Obama had an edge of 8 percentage points over Mr. Romney among women voters. Now it's 23 percentage points, with 60 percent of women favoring the president.
But Mr. Romney won't find it easy to discard his primary positions. Erik Eckholm reported in the Times today that evangelical leaders will urge Mr. Romney to build a fall strategy based on firing up the hard-right base in states like Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said that Mr. Romney must "demonstrate a genuine and solid commitment to the core values issues."
If he wants, Mr. Santorum could give his former rival a hand with evangelicals. Using his hard-right social bona fides, he could encourage Mr. Perkins and others to give Mr. Romney some space in the name of defeating the Democrats.
Or the Republicans can go for the nuclear option. They can give up on molding their candidate back into someone resembling a centrist, consolidate all those tens of millions of dollars in super PAC money (without any coordination of course) and use it to destroy Mr. Obama - through ads that distort his policies, question his patriotism, and accuse him of being a Muslim and a Marxist.
It would leave the country even more divided and bruised and fearful and angry than it is now. But hey, you gotta break a few eggs, right?

HEADLINE: Romney Camp Stumbles on Pay Equity Question

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: As Mitt Romney courts women, his campaign has difficulty on one key gender issue. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's campaign scrambled Wednesday afternoon to clarify his support for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act after top aides were caught flat-footed by the question.
In a statement, Amanda Hennenberg, a campaign spokeswoman, said Mr. Romney "supports pay equity and is not looking to change current law." 
That came after top policy aides to the former Massachusetts governor seemed uncertain how to respond when a reporter asked about Mr. Romney's position on it during a campaign conference call.
"We'll get back to you on that," the adviser told reporters. 
The stumble comes as Mr. Romney's campaign is searching for ways to address the large lead that President Obama holds among female voters. That lead developed during the last several months, as Mr. Romney expressed positions that have angered many women.
The fumble on the Lilly Ledbetter law is not likely to help his case.
The law, which makes it easier for women to sue in equal pay cases, was the first bill that Mr. Obama signed into law, just nine days after taking office. It is despised by conservatives who claim it is leading to a flurry of unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits.
But the law is hailed by many women's organizations as a step forward toward rectifying discriminatory salary situations. Democrats immediately jumped on the campaign's hesitance to support the law, quickly distributing audio of the conference call.
"If he is truly concerned about women in this economy, he wouldn't have to take time to 'think' about whether he supports the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act," Ms. Ledbetter said in a statement distributed by Mr. Obama's campaign. "This act not only ensures women have the tools to get equal pay for equal work, but it means their families will be better served also."
Mr. Romney's campaign reacted quickly, putting out statements from women attacking the impact of Mr. Obama's policies on women.
"Barack Obama talks a good game on women in the economy, but the facts don't back him up," Representative Mary Bono Mack, Republican of California, said in a statement. "Women in the Obama economy are facing hardships of historical proportions."
The Democratic National Convention quickly noted that Ms. Bono Mack voted against the Ledbetter Act when it passed in Congress in 2009.

HEADLINE: Santorum's Dusted Indigo Period

BYLINE: TOM FERRICK JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Part of what made Rick Santorum a surprising success in 2012 is that he learned nothing from his defeat in 2006. 

 BODY:
Of all the amazing statements Rick Santorum made during this year's presidential race, the one that astonished me the most was one that seemed innocuous.
In a speech in late March before Republicans in suburban Harrisburg, Santorum said that losing his Senate seat in 2006 was a "tremendous gift," a lesson in humility that he had taken to heart.
"The people of Pennsylvania didn't always give me what I wanted but they always gave me what I needed," he said. "And it was a great, in many respects for me, a great gift to get away, to separate out, to get back and involved in the private sector. I had a little distance from Washington to see what was going on."
Santorum should have felt humbled. He was a two-term incumbent who spent $20 million on his re-election campaign and still lost by nearly 18 points.
To me, one measure of electability is a candidate's reach outside his party base. The Rick Santorum of 2006 had no reach. He ended up with 41.3 percent of the popular vote, while Republicans in Pennsylvania constituted 40.3 percent of the electorate.
CNN exit polls confirmed the shellacking Santorum took from his Democratic opponent Bob Casey Jr., losing virtually every voter group by wide margins: Democrats, of course, (Casey won 93 percent of the Democratic vote); independents (Casey 73 percent); moderates (65 percent); women (61 percent) and so on and so forth.
Santorum wasn't defeated by the voters in 2006; he was repudiated. They did not like his politics. They did not like his personality. To put it in terms he might use, they cast him out of the Senate and into the darkness.
If that had happened to me, it would have been a cause of great pain and some soul searching.
An analogous situation is how the United States military reacted after Vietnam. It engaged in a long self-analysis that resulted in transformative changes in strategy, tactics and leadership with the goal of never, ever repeating the mistakes made in that war.
Santorum's statement implies that in 2006 voters gave him the opportunity to engage in a similar self-analysis: What did he do that he should never repeat? What aspects of his personality could he alter to positive effect? How should his strategy and tactics be changed to improve the outcome?
Handed this "tremendous gift" from the voters, Santorum emerged from the crucible of his 2006 defeat unchanged. He was older, a little thicker around the middle, but in every other aspect he was the same Rick as in 2006. Only instead of playing on the smaller field of Pennsylvania, he decided to go nationwide and run for president.
It was as if the generals in the Pentagon, after reviewing their loss in Vietnam, decided that the best corrective action would be to attack China. That the mistake they made - waging a land war in a small country - could be rectified by waging a land war in a huge country.
Analogies can only take you so far. For Santorum, what made 2012 different was that while he did not change, his audience did. In Pennsylvania, he always appealed to the most conservative of the conservatives, and he did the same in the Republican primaries.
Where we Pennsylvanians saw arrogance, conservative and Tea Party Republicans saw passion. Where we saw rigidity on moral and social issues, they saw rectitude. Where we saw a hard-right politician, they saw a righteous warrior for their cause.
The very attributes and positions that made Santorum anathema to so many Pennsylvania voters in 2006 lifted him into contention in 2012 among a core of activist, angry Republicans.
Among the general electorate, one's ability to like Santorum tends to be in inverse ratio to one's exposure to him. The more regular voters saw him, the less they liked him.
When Santorum first announced for president, I thought he would be underestimated as a candidate (which he was) and that he had great potential if he portrayed himself as an economic populist: a man with working-class roots and disdain for the Richie Riches of this world. You know, guys with Harvard M.B.A.'s who worked for private equity investment firms. Not to mention any names.
But that didn't get his juices flowing. The rights of homosexuals, the morality of abortion and contraception, the evil of Islamofacism, lectures on how moral turpitude had weakened America. Those were the subjects that got Santorum going.
In this way, he fit Winston Churchill's definition of a fanatic - someone who can't change his mind and won't change the topic.
When I covered the Senate race in 2006, Santorum's advisers privately rolled their eyes and clucked over this tendency. In public, they just shrugged and called it "Rick being Rick." In 2006, though, they tried their best to make Rick a little less Rick.
By the summer of that year, Santorum's numbers against Casey had not improved. The needle was stuck on a double-digit lead for the Democrat. Something had to be done. So John Brabender, Santorum's talented political and media guru, went up with a series of television ads designed to soften his candidate's image, trying to recast Santorum as a nice guy with centrist instincts. I call this the Dusted Indigo Period of Santorum's political career.
For these ads, Brabender had Santorum shuck his pin-striped blue suit with red power tie. Instead, he appeared on the screen in khaki slacks and buttoned-down cotton shirts - the kind seen in Eddie Bauer and L.L. Bean catalogs, offered in a palette of solid colors with names like Merlot, Cabin Red, Juniper and Dusted Indigo.
In one, he appeared in a wrestling ring. As huge guys smashed each other in the background, Santorum declared that he deplored the smash-and-whack politics in Washington and that he had reached across the aisle to work with senators such as Joe Lieberman, Barbara Boxer and even (gasp!) Hillary Clinton.
In another, he appeared on the dance floor of a polka party, surrounded by seniors. He smiled as he recounted all that he had done to make sure their Social Security was protected (not mentioning how he supported President Bush's plan to privatize parts of it.)
In a third, he sat at a kitchen table, shaking his head over how some in the media called him too conservative, while other called him too liberal. "The right thing to call me," he said, "is passionate about helping the families of Pennsylvania."
When I saw that last ad, I picked up the phone and called the Santorum campaign. Who, I asked, has ever called Rick Santorum too liberal?
There was someone. An ultra-conservative columnist for the very conservative Pittsburgh Tribune-Review had blasted Santorum for supporting an increase in the minimum wage. "Santorum, 'too extreme'?," the columnist Colin McNickle wrote. "Pshaw! Try too liberal, at least on matters economic."
The Dusted Indigo ads were clever, smartly done and showed Santorum in his best light.
But they also are an object lesson on the limits of hitting the reset button on your image and political identity. To use a current example, it's not like an Etch A Sketch. The shadows of the real Rick Santorum remained embedded in voter's minds. The ads did not work. The needle did not budge. In November 2006, he lost to Casey by a margin of 708,000 votes statewide.
There's something admirable in Santorum's consistency. He never temporizes. He remains true to his core values. He is a righteous man. He is also poison politically.
What happened to him in Pennsylvania in 2006 would have happened to him nationally in 2012 had he won the Republican nomination.
Santorum got out of the race at the right moment. He won't have to worry about winning or losing the Pennsylvania primary. He scores points among Republican leaders for not prolonging the race. He is getting mentioned as a possible candidate in 2016.
From the ashes of his 2006 campaign, Santorum has resurrected his political career. This experience of running for president has been a tremendous gift, too. Once again, he will have an opportunity to learn from his mistakes. Once again, he will not.
When he re-emerges on the political stage, he will be the same as when he exited it. It will be more of "Rick being Rick." It's what he does best.

HEADLINE: How About the Bush Recession?

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: George W. Bush wishes 'The Bush Tax Cuts' were called something else. 

 BODY:
Poor George W. Bush. Presidents are supposed to have things named after them (although generally they have to die for the big-ticket items, like airports), or at least have big ideas associated with them (like FDR's New Deal, or LBJ's Great Society). Ronald Reagan had a whole era named for him, not to mention Reaganomics.
Bill Clinton had An End to Welfare as We Know It. Mr. Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, had The New World Order, and he got that one barely halfway through his single term.
For a while, Mr. Bush had The Bush Doctrine-the idea that the president can use military force whenever he feels like it so long as he calls it "pre-emption"-but that's remembered mostly for the fact that Sarah Palin didn't know what it was. Now he's down to one "signature" achievement: The Bush Tax Cuts.

And apparently Mr. Bush is not amused. During a speech at the George W. Bush Presidential Center (that doesn't count, everyone gets a center or a library), Mr. Bush said the best way to create jobs is to help small business owners and the best way to do that is to extend the tax cuts that he pushed through Congress when he was president.
"I wish they weren't called the Bush tax cuts," he said. "If they were called some other body's tax cuts, they're probably less likely to be raised."
That got a chuckle from the audience, but the joke glosses over a crucial detail: Some of The Bush Tax Cuts are more popular than others. By and large, the public supports the cuts for those earning less than $250,000. And Democrats may well balk at repealing them.
What Americans don't like is the cut for those making $250,000 and up, and that's not because Mr. Bush's name is attached to it, although that doesn't help. They don't like it because it's not fair and it hurts the economy.

HEADLINE: Dr. Chu on Profits, Horse Manure and Other Forces of Technological Change

BYLINE: VINDU GOEL


HIGHLIGHT: Steven Chu, the secretary of energy, discussed the prospects for renewable energy and the forces that can drive technological change at a New York Times energy conference on Wednesday. 

 BODY:
Steven Chu, the secretary of energy, is optimistic about the future of renewable energy.
"The clean tech industry is making great strides,"he said on Wednesday at the New York Times Energy for Tomorrow conference in New York. Technologies like battery storage have vastly improved, solar efficiency is improving and electric cars are just at the beginning of their development.
And despite the political partisanship in Washington, he said, "there are people on the other side of the aisle that recognize the economic opportunity."
Dr. Chu discussed Solyndra and the government loan program under which it received half a billion dollars, but didn't reveal anything he hadn't already said in Congressional hearings.
I thought the highlight of his remarks was a tale he told to illustrate how quickly technological change can happen -- and what can drive it.
Dr. Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning academic before he joined the Obama administration, noted that a century ago, automobiles replaced horses and horse-drawn carriages within the space of about 25 years. "It was accelerated by the fact that there was an environmental imperative," he said. 
What kind of imperative? Well, New York City alone had about 160,000 horses hauling people and goods around at that time. "There was a very visible environmental impact that was piling up on corners all over the place," Dr. Chu said. "So it hastened the shift remarkably."
You can watch the full video of Dr. Chu's discussion with the New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman, as well as recordings of all the other panels at the conference, on the conference Web site.

HEADLINE: A Claim About Jobs Doesn't Tell Full Story

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney has said that women's jobs make up 92.3 percent of the net job loss since President Obama took office, but that takes into account only a small part of the recession. 

 BODY:
At campaign events on Tuesday and Wednesday, Mitt Romney made the claim that 92.3 percent of the net total of jobs lost since President Obama took office belonged to women.
The assertion is technically accurate but misses several important pieces of context.
PolitiFact, a nonpartisan organization that judges political claims, rated Mr. Romney's statement "mostly false" on Tuesday. "We found that though the numbers are accurate, their reading of them isn't," PolitiFact wrote.
The Romney campaign disputed the finding. Lanhee J. Chen, the policy director of the campaign, said in a detailed statement that there were "obvious problems with rating an accurate statement mostly false," including inconsistent standards, and that it showed an "Obama-for-America spin."
The net number of jobs held by women has fallen by 683,000 since Mr. Obama's inauguration in January 2009, according to a monthly survey of employers by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Male employment has fallen by only 57,000.
But men started out in a much worse position than women in January 2009, because men had already borne the brunt of the layoffs from the recession that began more than a year earlier.
From December 2007, when the downturn officially started, to the Obama inauguration, men lost 3,264,000 jobs, while women lost 1,157,000 jobs. For this reason, this recession has also been nicknamed the "mancession."
Women, in other words, were the second shoe to drop, and they were not even the heavier shoe. Even today, the share of working-age American men who are employed is around its lowest level since 1948, when the government began collecting this data.
The reason that job losses have been concentrated among women in the past three years and among men in 2008 largely has to do with the kinds of industries that employ them.
Men work disproportionately in industries sensitive to early swings in the economy, like manufacturing and construction. These industries took especially big hits this time around, given the housing bust and the troubles of American automakers.
In fact, of the overall job losses from December 2007 to January 2009, nearly half were in these two male-dominated industries. (These industries are still not doing particularly well, either.)
