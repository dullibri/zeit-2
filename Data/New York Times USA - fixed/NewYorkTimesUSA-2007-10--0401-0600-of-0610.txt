HEADLINE: The Gloomsayers Should Look Up

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN

 BODY:
BEFORE I start on this little tour d'horizon, I just want to say that a good, fresh Taco Supreme from Taco Bell is more tasty than just about anything at any fancy-pants restaurant anywhere in the world. And they didn't pay me, and they don't even know me. Just for perspective.
 And really, the whole story about the economy, credit, morality and rescues is about perspective. Start with the good news about perspective: The economy is basically in fine shape. Not perfect, but darned good. Almost all mortgages are not in default. Almost all workers in the labor force who care to work are not unemployed. The largest percentage ever of American household units, what were called ''families'' in the old days, own their own homes. 
 The stock market, in both absolute terms (the number on the Dow) and relative terms (the relationship of price to earnings), reflects optimism and an extraordinary, robust level of profits. 
 On a more sophisticated note of analysis, the spread between the interest rate paid on risk-free Treasury issues and on the Merrill Lynch master junk-bond index is far, far less than it was in the dark days of the tech meltdown from 2000 to 2002. (This data comes from Marty Fridson of FridsonVision, le dernier cri when it comes to junk.) This is a sign of less than horrific fear about high-risk debt.
 Newspapers (which often sell on fear, not on fact) talk frequently about a mortgage freeze. However, for all but the least qualified buyers, mortgage money is plentiful, and in fact the potential borrower is bombarded with offers. Hotels and airplanes are full. Casinos in Las Vegas are jam-packed. There is still a long waiting list for Bentleys in Beverly Hills.
 This country does not look like a country in economic trouble. Nevertheless, some extremely worrisome things have happened and are now being revealed, and worse are to come.
 As everyone knows, we have a housing correction on a large scale. True, it's a correction from a high level, but it's still a big correction. There has been a spectacular upsurge in mortgage delinquencies among subprime borrowers. While the sums involved are tiny, compared with the dimensions of our lusciously huge economy, they are unfortunate in many ways, as we will see.
 There has been a stupendous wave of fear washing over Wall Street and the large ''money center'' banks because of commitments to finance mergers and leveraged buyouts that now look questionable. The large banks and investment banks are committed to lend hundreds of billions of dollars for deals that looked sweet when deal guys were playing musical chairs but look dicey now that the music has stopped. Some people think that the game won't start again for a while (although I happen to think it will restart very, very soon -- the fees are just too good for this game to stop).
 In recent weeks, there has been another tsunami of fear about money tied up in so-called conduits. These are basically incredibly risky and foolish instruments in which money is borrowed short to be lent long. Every finance student in the world is taught to be wary of this deal because when it goes bad, it goes really bad, but nevertheless, there are many big players in Europe and the United States who have done these deals.
 There is deep worry that lenders caught up in bad loans to subprime borrowers, failed conduits and Wall Street deal makers will have to take big losses that will impair the capital of the lenders and shake the foundations of the nation, credit-wise.
 Now comes the ''and there is worse to come'' part. It certainly looks to little me as if the top dogs on Wall Street made some staggering mistakes. They took on very risky loans. They tried to juice returns in a low-interest-rate world by maneuvers so dicey that the maneuvers would not survive scrutiny and had to be hidden on off-balance-sheet entities, sometimes outside the country.
 All those titans of the Street at Merrill Lynch, Citigroupand elsewhere can fire their underlings and blame them for their losses. But the C.E.O.'s are paid big bucks to know what's happening and to run their companies prudently (as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan apparently did). Clearly, with immense losses in a wide variety of investments, prudence was not used in the last several years at some of our most esteemed money houses. 
 As I have said for 20 years, it's basic when you are lending to subprime borrowers to take substantial reserves for likely defaults. Obviously, this was not done. When you borrow short and secure and lend long and risky, you take huge reserves for the day when the trade turns sour. This was apparently not done. If it had been done, there would be no problem.
 Those at the top can blame anyone they like for their companies' imprudence, but they are ultimately responsible. Why are they still in their jobs? Not one C.E.O. of a major commercial or investment bank has lost his job despite some staggering write-downs. Why? Is this the board of directors' old buddy system at work? Sure looks like it.
 Now, the ultimate Wall Street player and insider, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, has bestirred himself to take serious notice of the credit problems faced by some very big lenders. He wants to create a bailout fund in which banks that still appear sound buy some of the debt of the troubled players like Citigroup. 
 THE deal, as far as I can tell, is that they buy the most secure levels of debt that Citigroup and others own, get large fees and allow Citigroup and the others to keep the debts off their balance sheets. But there are at least two giant issues here. 
 One is that it's a bit too predictable that Mr. Paulson would basically pooh-pooh the subprime problems until major Wall Street powers got in trouble and then -- presto! -- swing into action. It might have been inspiring had he stepped up to the plate when smaller players like home buyers were getting burned, but that's not really his style.
 The other is that it's hard to see what good the maneuver would do. Suppose Citigroup or some other lender has a perfectly good loan to sell. Why does Citigroup need a big Treasury-sponsored organization to sell it? They can sell it to anyone right now. The problem is with the questionable loans. And they seemingly are not part of the plan from the Treasury. 
 The Treasury plan is either just plain foolish (an explanation not to be sneered at) or it's the thin edge of the wedge: what may follow is to have a government fund to buy the slightly less fragrant parts of the portfolio. Indeed, that would seem inevitable to me, and I'll tell you why.
 The goal is to keep Citigroup and others from taking large losses on bad loans. If the loans are sold to supershrewd buyers of debt like Leon Black or David Tepper or our resident megagenius, Warren E. Buffett, those buyers will demand a big haircut on the deal. Losses will have to be taken. The only buyers who might step in to pay full price are -- drumroll, please -- you and I, the taxpaying suckers. 
 I could easily be wrong, but I suspect that at the end of the day, you and I will be bailing out the hundred-million-a-year finance titans who messed this up in the first place. This is what happened with the savings-and-loan disaster. The S.& L. chieftains -- very often connected with Michael R. Milken and Drexel's junk-bond world -- became multimillionaires and billionaires by wheeling and dealing with government-insured money. When the loans went bad, you and I picked up the bill while the bankers went shopping for their Bentleys.
 NOW, let me go back to my role as Little Benjy Sunshine. None of this will sink our glorious economy. The losses are nothing comparedwith the losses in the tech debacle. They will be nothing like the numbers bandied about in the fear-mongering media. If there is a questionable $200 billion pool of loans, that means a small percent will be lost, not all of it. This big, strong economy will sail on through.
 But the vicious, cruel truth is that some very greedy, selfish and, yes, stupid men made fortunes on deals that were economically and/or ethically wrong. (Why else hide them off balance sheet or abroad?) They got immense fees, stunning paychecks and the inheritance of maharajahs. Their great-grandchildren will be rich from their deeds and misdeeds. As far as I can tell, they are not being called to account in any major way. The ones at the top aren't fired or, if they are fired, are fired very rich. (Never mind that silly mouth music from Citigroup about ''the year of no excuses.'') Despite what looks to me like a breathtaking lack of disclosure, I have not seen any lawsuits by the Securities and Exchange Commission against any of these big money-center princes or principalities -- not to mention criminal investigations from other law enforcement authorities.
 And we stockholders and taxpayers foot the bill, of course. But even this is not the worst part: there are still lots of people who can say with a straight face that the world of finance is overregulated, that we should trust the power players to do the right thing, that if we put finance under a microscope, or allow financial miscreants to be sued for misconduct, America will be harmed. There are still people, and I know many of them well, who believe that old myth that you can trust the markets to fix everything -- that old magical thinking that some thieves will stop other thieves from robbing the sheep like us. That's the really sad part. Some babies never learn. 
 But in the meantime, try that Taco Supreme. It's awfully good. Wall Street hasn't figured out how to ruin that one yet.

HEADLINE: It's Raining Earnings Reports

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
A BIG increase, of a sort, is scheduled this week in corporate earnings. The number of statements issued will grow significantly, though not necessarily the profits reported in them.
 With a sparse economic calendar and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision lurking a week away, the avalanche of earnings reports may be foremost on traders' minds. Among the stalwarts of corporate America that are to announce results this week are American Express, Merck, AT&T, DuPont, Boeing and Microsoft. 
 ''We're going to have a continuous stream of earnings that people will be watching during the week,'' said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup Investment Research.
 Results announced so far have been better than expected for many companies, he noted. An important reason, though, is that expectations have fallen in recent weeks, as often happens before reports are issued.
 Chief financial officers and analysts seem to do a quarterly pas de deux that leads to a reduction in estimates. When numbers are announced that a few weeks earlier would have seemed ordinary, traders are impressed.
 After rising at double-digit annual percentage rates for most of the last five years, earnings for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are forecast by Thomson Financial to decline 0.4 percent for the third quarter, dragged down in part by banks taking steep write-offs for bad loans. 
 Expectations of a Fed rate cut have also diminished, Mr. Levkovich said. Around a month ago, futures contracts suggested that traders put the chance of a cut in the federal funds rate at 90 percent. Late last week, it was a tossup.
 ''Expectations have come down a lot'' for a cut next week, he said, but traders anticipate a cut later in the year if the Fed does not move at this meeting. Either way, he said, the consensus outlook is for ''one more and done.''
 Wall Street considers the Fed's response to the summer credit crisis to have been ''broadly successful but not fully successful,'' he said, explaining the market's call for one further rate cut. ''It seems we're past the worst but not out of the woods yet.''
 DATA WATCH This week's installment of woeful news from the housing market is scheduled as a two-parter. On Wednesday, sales of existing homes for September will be reported; a Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts that they will have declined to an annual rate of 5.25 million units from 5.5 million in August. A drop is expected the next day in sales of new homes for September, to an annual rate of 770,000, from 795,000.

HEADLINE: Court Elbows Village In Favor of Religious Rights

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MAMARONECK, N.Y.
 It all began with an Indian who wanted to eat peyote.
 His name was Alfred Smith. He belonged to the Klamath tribe in Oregon and was a member of the North American Church, whose sacramental rites included ingesting peyote buds.
 On March 2, 1984, when he told his boss at the alcohol and drug treatment center where he worked that he would be attending a church meeting the following day, he was told that if he used peyote there he would be fired. He did, and he was. 
 It's a circuitous road from there to a federal appeals court ruling last week that the village of Mamaroneck had improperly denied an application by the Westchester Day School, an Orthodox Jewish school, for a new $12 million classroom building. 
 Peyote or no peyote, land-use planning and zoning board decisions aren't made for thrilling public debate -- unless it's your backyard that's involved. But the path from the North American Church to the Orthodox day school does have an Alice in Wonderland quality. It has brought the federal government someplace it has almost never been -- the realm of local land use, planning and zoning decisions. 
 And if what has happened is at times a result of the law of unintended consequences, there is also a lesson in the power of religion in American life, this time as played out in the deceptively soporific-sounding Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000.
 ''Every member of Congress wants to stand close to God, and this was a chance for them to do it,'' said Ross Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University, whose book ''Strangers on a Hill'' examined the evolution of the law. 
 But back to Mr. Smith. When he was denied unemployment benefits, he sued. The case went to the United States Supreme Court, which issued a ruling in 1990 that rocked religious and civil liberties groups. 
 Not too surprisingly, it rejected the claim that the total ban on peyote use violated Mr. Smith's free exercise of religion. Far more important, it discounted earlier rulings saying that states had to be able to prove ''a compelling state interest'' for any actions that infringed on religious practice.
 Religious groups were outraged, saying the ruling stripped away crucial protections. In response, in 1993 Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. (Who could vote against a law with a name like that?) The Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional in 1996. After a few false starts, Congress in 2000 passed a retooled version, commonly known as Rluipa (pronounced ar-LOO-pah), which said governments could not impose any land use regulations that placed a substantial burden on religious activity unless there was a ''compelling governmental interest.''
 The idea, at least in part, was to protect both Christian megachurches facing neighborhood opposition and smaller mosques or Orthodox synagogues.
 In the Westchester case, the zoning board cited neighborhood concerns about traffic and the impact on a quiet neighborhood. But the school was consistently upheld on the facts of the case by the district court and the appeals court, which said the village's decision was based only on ''intense and unrelenting pressure'' from politically connected nearby residents. 
 ''I think the conduct of the zoning board exemplified to a 'T' why Rluipa is such an important statute,'' said Stanley Bernstein, one of the lawyers for the school and its executive vice president. ''If we could be harassed like this, imagine what could happen to other institutions that are newer, younger, not hidden away on 26 bucolic acres.''
 But the law, while enacted as a shield to protect hallowed American rights of religious freedom, can also be a sword, critics say, wielded against the hallowed American rights of local control and homeownership. Consider, for example, the bitter dispute over a proposed rabbinical college that could bring some 4,500 people to an area now zoned for single-family homes in Pomona in Rockland County. As in dozens of other Rluipa disputes, the community not only faces an enormously high bar for rejecting the project, it has to pay all the legal costs if it loses. 
 ''It's an issue Congress never even thought about during its enactment,'' said Marci Hamilton, one of the lawyers representing Pomona. ''All the input was from religious groups. None of it was about its impact on homeowners, and homeowners are one of the largest constituencies in the country.''
 Absent an unlikely radical tweaking by Congress, the law seems headed for the increasingly conservative Supreme Court, where justices will be pulled in two ways. Federalism will cast doubts about federal law trumping local land use regulations, and respect for religion will remind them why the law was passed in the first place.
 That said, in American life it's hard to bet against religion. ''Chances are if you had any efforts to modify it, you'd have parades of monsignors, ministers and rabbis trooping up to Capitol Hill,'' said Professor Baker. ''Elected officials want to do what's popular. No one wants to antagonize religious groups.''

 CORRECTION:
The Our Towns column on Sunday, about the legal precedents behind a recent federal appeals court ruling that the village of Mamaroneck, N.Y., had improperly denied an application by a religious school for a new building, misstated part of the name of a church attended by Alfred Smith, a Klamath Indian who sued after he was fired for using peyote as part of a sacramental rite. It is the Native American Church, not the North American Church. The article also misstated the year that the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which Congress passed after the court rejected Mr. Smith's religious freedom claim. It was 1997, not 1996.

HEADLINE: Paying for Improvements

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
QMy building in Manhattan is being converted to a condominium and is undergoing some major improvements, including a new lobby and new windows, radiators, electrical system and air-conditioners and sleeves. 
 My husband and I are elderly, our apartment is rent-stabilized, and we plan to remain as rental tenants. What concerns us is whether these capital improvements can be added to our rent. 
 A ''The letter writer's concerns are both genuine and legitimate,'' said Ronald A. Sher, a White Plains co-op lawyer. As she suspects, the cost of major capital improvements can be added to the base rent, provided the landlord complies with the rules and submits an application for an increase within two years to the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal. 
 The owner's application must be in accordance with the division's Useful Life Schedule for major capital improvements -- M.C.I., in the division's parlance. For example, the useful life of aluminum windows is 35 years; for air-conditioners and sleeves, 10 years; and electrical rewiring, 25 years.
 Under the rent rules, the cost of the improvement is spread out over the useful life and then applied proportionately to each apartment in the building, usually on a per-room basis. The increase is permanent.
 But there are some factors that may work in the letter writer's favor. Mr. Sher said that an M.C.I. rent adjustment can be offset or eliminated if the tenant qualifies for a Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption, known as Scrie. 
 To qualify, the head of the household must be 62 or older, and the total household income cannot exceed $27,000 after taxes. (Information is available at www.nyc.gov/html/dfta/html/scrie/scrie.shtml or by calling 311.)
 In addition, Mr. Sher said, in New York City a rent increase in any one year may not exceed 6 percent of the current rent. (Outside the city, the increase may not exceed 15 percent of the rent.) Increases above the cap can be carried forward to future years.
 Security Camera
 Seems to Be Prying
 QI live in a high-rise condo. Some teenagers from my building threw eggs at an apartment in the neighboring building, which has now installed a camera that seems to point at apartments in our building. Do we have any recourse? 
 A ''A condominium board may take reasonable actions to protect its property,'' said Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is a vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. At the same time, he said, using a security camera to peer into apartments in a neighboring building would most likely be illegal and could provide grounds for a lawsuit against the building with the camera. 
 ''It would be in the best interests of both buildings to allow a representative of the letter writer's building to view the videotapes from the camera to assure the residents that the camera is being used in a legitimate manner,'' Mr. Weinstein said. ''I would recommend a friendly approach from the letter writer's managing agent to the neighboring building's agent to resolve the problem.'' JAY ROMANO 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 28, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An answer in the Q&A column last Sunday, about buildingwide major capital improvements in multifamily residences in New York City, described incorrectly the method for calculating the monthly rent increases for rent-regulated apartments. The cost of the improvement is divided by 84, and that result is then divided by the total number of rooms in the building. To arrive at the monthly increase for each apartment, that sum is then multiplied by the number of rooms in the apartment. The rent-increase calculations are not based upon the Useful Life Schedule for a specific improvement.

HEADLINE: Gold and Stocks Have Been Holding Hands. Why?

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE bull market in stocks is more than five years old. Surprisingly, the bull market in gold has been running even longer. 
 A new study shows just how unusual it is for these two types of asset classes to perform this well together for this long. Entitled ''Analysis of the Investment Potential and Inflation-Hedging Ability of Precious Metals,'' the study has been circulating as an academic working paper since the summer. Its authors are James Ross McCown, an associate professor of economics at Oklahoma City University, and John R. Zimmerman, who recently received a bachelor's degree in finance from that institution. A version is at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1002966.
 The researchers examined the relationship between gold and the stock market from 1970 through the end of 2006. That starting point was chosen because it wasn't until the late 1960s that gold's price began to fluctuate freely, Professor McCown said in an interview. The study found that, on average, gold and stocks have moved in opposite directions since that point. In other words, what historically has been good for gold has not usually been good for stocks, and vice versa. 
 The researchers gained insight into the cause of this relationship by analyzing the role of inflation. They found that the price of gold tended to rise and fall with changes in investors' collective expectations about inflation. In contrast, stocks tended to have just the opposite relationship to inflation, performing poorly when inflation expectations were rising. (They measured this expected inflation rate by comparing the yields on Treasury notes and bonds with those of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, of comparable maturities. Because TIPS weren't created until 1997, this portion of the researchers' analysis focused on just the years since their debut.) 
 These findings, of course, add to the mystery of the strong recent performances of both stocks and gold, since the correlations that emerged from the study were strongly significant, statistically speaking. Nevertheless, inflationary expectations have actually declined in recent years: Based on the yield difference between the 10-year Treasury note and the 10-year TIPS, expected inflation has declined from 2.56 percent a year at the beginning of 2005 to 2.35 percent now. Using the historical precedents, a forecaster in early 2005 would have expected such a decline in expected inflation to produce a rally for stocks and a decline for gold.
 Professor McCown acknowledges that you may be tempted to conclude that one group or the other -- stock or gold investors -- is simply getting it wrong. Inflation may well be about to accelerate, for example, in which case the gold market is correctly anticipating the future, while stock and bond investors are deluding themselves. By the same token, if inflation is not about to heat up, gold investors are all excited about nothing.
 But the professor says it's unhelpful to take either of these roads. He believes that inflation is not heating up, but that the bull market in gold is based on factors that have played only a minor role until now. Foremost among them, he suspects, is the influence of newfound wealth in parts of the world where there is a strong predisposition to owning gold, like India and some countries in the Middle East.
 He responded in particular to a current argument of many gold investors -- that gold prices are climbing because inflation is higher than it appears. They contend that the Consumer Price Index is a flawed barometer that understates inflation's true magnitude. This doesn't show up in the yield difference between Treasury notes and TIPS, they say, because the C.P.I. is the basis for TIPS' inflation protection. 
 Professor McCown doesn't buy this argument. The C.P.I. may very well be understating inflation, but his research focused on changes in the inflation rate rather than its absolute level. So, for the argument to have even a chance of holding water, gold enthusiasts would have to explain how the C.P.I.'s growth rate could go down over long periods, even while the genuine inflation rate actually increased. He says he has a hard time giving much credence to this argument.
 In short, increases in expected inflation are not the cause of gold's strength, Professor McCown said, pointing instead to rising incomes in developing countries. But he said that this factor, and any other recent causes of gold's surge, are unlikely to affect its price forever. The long-term relationships between gold, stocks and inflation haven't been severed, he said. Over the long haul, he concludes, inflation -- or the lack thereof -- is likely to move gold and stocks in different directions.

HEADLINE: TIGHTER BORDER DELAYS RE-ENTRY BY U.S. CITIZENS

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

DATELINE: EL PASO 

 BODY:
United States border agents have stepped up scrutiny of Americans returning home from Mexico, slowing commerce and creating delays at border crossings not seen since the months after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 The increased enforcement is in part a dress rehearsal for new rules, scheduled to take effect in January, that will require Americans to show a passport or other proof of citizenship to enter the United States. The requirements were approved by Congress as part of antiterrorism legislation in 2004.
 Border officials said agents along the southern border were asking more returning United States citizens to show a photo identity document. At the same time, agents are increasing the frequency of what they call queries, where they check a traveler's information against law enforcement, immigration and antiterror databases. 
 The new policy is a big shift after decades when Americans arrived at land crossings, declared they were citizens and were waved through. Since the authorities began ramping up enforcement in August, wait times at border stations in Texas have often stretched to two hours or more, discouraging visitors and shoppers and upsetting business. 
 The delays could remain a fact of life across the southern border for the next few years, border officials said, at least until new security technology and expanded entry stations are installed and until Americans get used to being checked and questioned like foreigners. Last year 234 million travelers entered the United States through land border crossings from Mexico. 
 W. Ralph Basham, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, the agency that manages the borders, said longer waits had resulted from added security measures at border stations that in many cases were aging, outmoded and facing surging traffic. Saying the new document checks were a ''security imperative,'' Mr. Basham called on border cities, which own many of the crossing bridges, to invest in expanding the entry points. 
 In the meantime, Mr. Basham said, ''A safer border is well worth the wait.''
 Wait times of up to three hours have also been reported over the past few months at crossings from eastern Canada. Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, who held a series of town meetings with border officials about the lines, said low staffing at border stations was the primary cause there. 
 The longer lines along the Mexico border have been especially unsettling here in El Paso, a humming border city long comfortable in its marriage to Ciudad Juarez, the bigger and rowdier Mexican metropolis on the other bank of the Rio Grande. Lines of cars and pedestrians at sunrise on the four border bridges here are a routine for tens of thousands of people, including many United States citizens, coming from Mexico on their way to school, work and shopping. 
 ''International bridge wait times continue to escalate, causing frustration and concern in my district and across the nation,'' wrote El Paso's congressman, Representative Silvestre Reyes, a Democrat, in a letter this month to the House Committee on Homeland Security in which he called for a hearing on the matter. 
 One crosser who said she had struggled with the lines was Wilda Laboy, a 37-year-old American citizen who works in Juarez but is studying for her high school equivalency in El Paso. 
 ''I arrive late, and they don't let me in,'' said Ms. Laboy as she waited to be checked through the Paso del Norte bridge crossing here. ''I miss classes.'' 
 Many families that straddle the border are feeling the strain. Border trade groups say the long lines caught them by surprise and are disrupting economic ties vital to both sides of the border. 
 ''We are Americans who live at the border, with our economy and livelihood that depend on moving efficiently back and forth,'' said Maria Luisa O'Connell, president of the Border Trade Alliance, which represents businesses all along the border with Mexico. ''Now suddenly we have measures that make it less efficient but don't make us any safer.''
 Richard Cortez, the mayor of McAllen, another Texas border town that saw long lines this summer, said the waits had slowed some of the 45,000 trailer trucks that passed the border there each month. 
 ''There's a misconception that border communities care only about ourselves and our own local businesses,'' Mr. Cortez said. ''Our border crossings affect trade across the United States.'' 
 Of $332 billion in trade last year between the United States and Mexico, this country's third-largest trading partner, more than 80 percent of it moved across the border by truck. 
 Starting Jan. 31, American citizens returning home by land will have to present either a passport, or a citizenship document like a birth certificate together with a government-issued identity card with a photograph. The requirement is the next phase of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, which Congress adopted in a 2004 bill that enacted recommendations of the Sept. 11 commission. It is intended to improve antiterror intelligence by gathering a record of everyone entering the United States.
 So far the new inspections are not systematic enough to yield measurable results. 
 The passport requirement has been in effect since January for most citizens returning to the United States by air, and it had a rocky debut because many Americans without passports rushed to apply for one. Passport processing backlogs overwhelmed the State Department, which was forced to relax the requirement during the months of June, July, August and September. That experience has created anxiety among many people who cross at land stations as they anticipate the next phase.
 Also in August, border officials said, the Department of Homeland Security issued a directive designed to unify inspection procedures for all the border agencies under its umbrella. It set an eventual goal, with no fixed deadline, for agents to conduct a database query for every person crossing the border. 
 As a result, queries by agents of both American and foreign border crossers increased. At many older border stations, including El Paso, agents have to enter some queries manually, taking minutes that mount up to hours when thousands of cars and people are waiting in line. 
 Luis Garcia, the El Paso field director for Customs and Border Protection, said the new policy demanded a change of culture. 
 ''These two communities are very interlinked, not only by trade and commerce, but by family, religion, education,'' Mr. Garcia said, standing at the base of the Paso del Norte border bridge as pedestrians streamed by, heading for downtown El Paso. ''When a person leaves El Paso to go to Juarez, it's like going across the street. They don't consider it leaving the country,'' he said. 
 On an average day, some 21,000 pedestrians cross from Juarez on the Paso del Norte bridge, one of El Paso's four entryways. 
 As the lines into El Paso swelled in mid-August, Mr. Garcia said, he issued a memorandum directing his agents to gauge vehicle lines in deciding how many travelers to query. If lines were over an hour, agents should run a query only for the driver, unless something aroused their suspicions.
 But Mr. Garcia said he did not have great flexibility to speed the lines. ''One thing I can tell you up front, as director in El Paso, I will not compromise security for facilitation,'' he said. 
 Border groups say they support tougher security measures but want the border authorities to back them up with increased staff levels and technology to avoid slowing commerce. 
 Money for the Border Patrol, which scouts the border between entry points, increased by 70 percent since 2005, to $3 billion. By contrast, financing for border station agents, who processed nearly 300 million travelers entering the country legally by land last year, rose by 30 percent since 2005, to $2.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Farewell, 157 Tickets to Middle Class

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
E-mail: jersey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Bayonne
 THE meeting was called for 7 in the morning, right at the start of the day shift at AGC Chemicals Americas, and when everybody at the sprawling plant filed into the warehouse they heard the news that nobody expected -- that the future they all were counting on was gone.
 Gone: 157 jobs with mortgage-paying wages. Gone: a plant that has been a fixture for more than 40 years amid the tank farms and pipelines, the smokestacks and steel girders, the railroad tracks and lumbering trucks of Constable Hook, the storied industrial peninsula where John D. Rockefeller's giant Standard Oil refinery once reigned. Gone: one more manufacturer from a state that does much more of its work in offices than factories these days. 
 And gone: a workplace where fathers worked alongside sons and brothers alongside brothers for decades, just minutes away from their homes, in jobs they expected to retire from.
 ''You could hear a dime drop, absolute silence,'' said one longtime worker who, like several others, requested anonymity when discussing the closure, because the company had asked employees not to talk to reporters. ''It's like a funeral, no exaggeration. Every day, every department, the same way. It's somber just talking about it -- 'What are you going to do?' 'I don't know, what are you going to do?' ''
 New Jersey has been bleeding manufacturing jobs for decades -- from a peak of 892,500 in 1969 to 317,900 now -- but the decline in many industries was gradual enough that workers could spot the end looming in the distance. At AGC, it was swift and unexpected, the dagger of global competition.
 ''The company made every effort trying to make the business survive, but when you're in a single-product business, it's hard,'' another longtime worker said, citing the millions spent in recent years on an expansion project that still isn't finished. Then he slipped reluctantly into the past tense. ''It was a really nice place to work.''
 The product is something that you don't buy in a store but that you encounter without knowing every day: chemicals known as fluoropolymers, which are used in everything from brake pads to electrical cables to frying pans. And fluoropolymers, it turns out, can be manufactured much more cheaply in China and Russia, where wages are low and environmental regulations lax. Company officials didn't respond to requests for comment, but a prepared statement cited ''poor market conditions and changing market structure.'' AGC is a subsidiary of Asahi Glass Group of Japan. 
 ''It's gone from being a premium chemical to a commodity, and on that basis, even though AGC spent a significant amount of money upgrading the facility, they were unable to compete,'' said Michael O'Connor, executive director of the Bayonne Economic Development Corporation. ''It was definitely a shock.''
 Sanford R. Oxfeld -- a Newark labor lawyer who has represented the union at the plant, the independent Bayonne Chemical Workers Union, for more than 25 years -- was expecting to begin negotiations on a new contract soon for the 89 members, but instead has been working on the severance package. ''This is heartbreaking,'' said Mr. Oxfeld, who also represents scores of other unions. ''This is my favorite client. They're the way unions were, the way I think unions should be. They weren't interested in endorsing anybody for president. They wanted to make a good living and aspire to the middle class.''
 And that's where their jobs put them, with a wage scale that topped out at $28 an hour, and plentiful overtime available. Many managers at the company are union members who worked their way up.
 ''You definitely got treated well,'' said another worker, who also veered uncertainly between past and present. ''It's a very, very friendly place. It really was a great atmosphere.''
 The AGC plant sits within view of Route 440, adjacent to a redevelopment site where, as part of Bayonne's continuing transformation of its industrial waterfront, construction is scheduled to begin soon on a 400,000-square-foot big-box shopping center. About a third of the 30-acre site belonged to AGC, land the company wasn't using but was initially reluctant to sell.
 ''We move from a production society to a consumption society,'' said Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The transformation of the land, he said, is ''a good icon of it.'' 
 The names of the stores expected to open at the shopping center are scheduled to be announced this fall. ''Instead of having really nicely paid manufacturing jobs,'' Mr. Oxfeld said, ''there's now going to be a bunch of strip malls, and you're going to have people getting paid one-third the salary these guys are getting paid.'' 
 The plant is still running around the clock, as it always has, turning out chemicals whose price has been undercut by other plants far from Bayonne. The shutdown is planned for Dec. 31, when the chill that has only now entered the air surely will have deepened.
 ''There's not much left, especially in New Jersey,'' another worker said. ''These jobs that you could support an entire family on, they're just disappearing. It's a different world now.''

HEADLINE: Criminal Element

BYLINE: By JASCHA HOFFMAN. 
Jascha Hoffman is on the staff of The New York Review of Books.

 BODY:
Has the Clean Air Act done more to fight crime than any other policy in American history? That is the claim of a new environmental theory of criminal behavior. 
 In the early 1990s, a surge in the number of teenagers threatened a crime wave of unprecedented proportions. But to the surprise of some experts, crime fell steadily instead. Many explanations have been offered in hindsight, including economic growth, the expansion of police forces, the rise of prison populations and the end of the crack epidemic. But no one knows exactly why crime declined so steeply. 
 The answer, according to Jessica Wolpaw Reyes, an economist at Amherst College, lies in the cleanup of a toxic chemical that affected nearly everyone in the United States for most of the last century. After moving out of an old townhouse in Boston when her first child was born in 2000, Reyes started looking into the effects of lead poisoning. She learned that even low levels of lead can cause brain damage that makes children less intelligent and, in some cases, more impulsive and aggressive. She also discovered that the main source of lead in the air and water had not been paint but rather leaded gasoline -- until it was phased out in the 1970s and '80s by the Clean Air Act, which took blood levels of lead for all Americans down to a fraction of what they had been. ''Putting the two together,'' she says, ''it seemed that this big change in people's exposure to lead might have led to some big changes in behavior.''
 Reyes found that the rise and fall of lead-exposure rates seemed to match the arc of violent crime, but with a 20-year lag -- just long enough for children exposed to the highest levels of lead in 1973 to reach their most violence-prone years in the early '90s, when crime rates hit their peak.
 Such a correlation does not prove that lead had any effect on crime levels. But in an article published this month in the B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis and Policy, Reyes uses small variations in the lead content of gasoline from state to state to strengthen her argument. If other possible sources of crime like beer consumption and unemployment had remained constant, she estimates, the switch to unleaded gas alone would have caused the rate of violent crime to fall by more than half over the 1990s.
 If lead poisoning is a factor in the development of criminal behavior, then countries that didn't switch to unleaded fuel until the 1980s, like Britain and Australia, should soon see a dip in crime as the last lead-damaged children outgrow their most violent years. According to a comparison of nine countries published this year by Rick Nevin in the journal Environmental Research, crime rates around the world are just starting to respond to the removal of lead from gasoline and paint. ''It really does sound like a bad science-fiction plot,'' says Nevin, a senior adviser to the National Center for Healthy Housing. ''The idea that a society could have systematically poisoned its youngest children with the same neurotoxins in two different ways over the same century is almost impossible to believe.''
 The magnitude of these claims has been met with a fair amount of skepticism. Jeffrey Miron, a Harvard economist, wonders how lead could have had such a strong effect on violent crime while, according to Reyes, it showed almost no effect on property crimes like theft. He also doubts that the hypothesis could explain the plunge in the U.S. murder rate from the 1930s through the 1950s. ''I certainly think it's a reasonable exercise,'' Miron says. ''We just have to be appropriately suspicious of how much you can actually show.''
 The theory will be put to the test as children grow up in Indonesia, Venezuela and sub-Saharan Africa, where leaded gasoline has just recently been phased out. Meanwhile, the list of countries that still use lead in gas -- Afghanistan, Serbia and Iraq, as well as much of North Africa and Central Asia -- does not rule out a connection with violence.
 No matter how suggestive the economists' data, it takes a doctor to show that some of the people most damaged by lead are out there breaking the law. Herbert Needleman, the University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist and pediatrician whose work helped persuade the government to ban lead in the 1970s, recently studied a sample of juvenile delinquents in Pittsburgh; the group had significantly more lead in their bones than their peers. And lead may not be the only source of damage. The National Children's Study will soon begin to track more than 100,000 children to determine the effects of exposure to common pesticides, among other chemicals.

HEADLINE: The Future Is Drying Up

BYLINE: By JOE GERTNER. 
Jon Gertner is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Scientists sometimes refer to the effect a hotter world will have on this country's fresh water as the other water problem, because global warming more commonly evokes the specter of rising oceans submerging our great coastal cities. By comparison, the steady decrease in mountain snowpack -- the loss of the deep accumulation of high-altitude winter snow that melts each spring to provide the American West with most of its water -- seems to be a more modest worry. But not all researchers agree with this ranking of dangers. Last May, for instance, Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate and the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, one of the United States government's pre-eminent research facilities, remarked that diminished supplies of fresh water might prove a far more serious problem than slowly rising seas. When I met with Chu last summer in Berkeley, the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, which provides most of the water for Northern California, was at its lowest level in 20 years. Chu noted that even the most optimistic climate models for the second half of this century suggest that 30 to 70 percent of the snowpack will disappear. ''There's a two-thirds chance there will be a disaster,'' Chu said, ''and that's in the best scenario.'' 
 In the Southwest this past summer, the outlook was equally sobering. A catastrophic reduction in the flow of the Colorado River -- which mostly consists of snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains -- has always served as a kind of thought experiment for water engineers, a risk situation from the outer edge of their practical imaginations. Some 30 million people depend on that water. A greatly reduced river would wreak chaos in seven states: Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and California. An almost unfathomable legal morass might well result, with farmers suing the federal government; cities suing cities; states suing states; Indian nations suing state officials; and foreign nations (by treaty, Mexico has a small claim on the river) bringing international law to bear on the United States government. In addition, a lesser Colorado River would almost certainly lead to a considerable amount of economic havoc, as the future water supplies for the West's industries, agriculture and growing municipalities are threatened. As one prominent Western water official described the possible future to me, if some of the Southwest's largest reservoirs empty out, the region would experience an apocalypse, ''an Armageddon.''
 One day last June, an environmental engineer named Bradley Udall appeared before a Senate subcommittee that was seeking to understand how severe the country's fresh-water problems might become in an era of global warming. As far as Washington hearings go, the testimony was an obscure affair, which was perhaps fitting: Udall is the head of an obscure organization, the Western Water Assessment. The bureau is located in the Boulder, Colo., offices of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, the government agency that collects obscure data about the sky and seas. Still, Udall has a name that commands some attention, at least within the Beltway. His father was Morris Udall, the congressman and onetime presidential candidate, and his uncle was Stewart Udall, the secretary of the interior under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. Bradley Udall's great-great-grandfather, John D. Lee, moreover, was the founder of Lee's Ferry, a flyspeck spot in northern Arizona that means nothing to most Americans but holds near-mythic status to those who work with water for a living. Near Lee's Ferry is where the annual flow of the Colorado River is measured in order to divvy up its water among the seven states that depend on it. To many politicians, economists and climatologists, there are few things more important than what has happened at Lee's Ferry in the past, just as there are few things more important than what will happen at Lee's Ferry in the future.
 The importance of the water there was essentially what Udall came to talk about. A report by the National Academies on the Colorado River basin had recently concluded that the combination of limited Colorado River water supplies, increasing demands, warmer temperatures and the prospect of recurrent droughts ''point to a future in which the potential for conflict'' among those who use the river will be ever-present. Over the past few decades, the driest states in the United States have become some of our fastest-growing; meanwhile, an ongoing drought has brought the flow of the Colorado to its lowest levels since measurements at Lee's Ferry began 85 years ago. At the Senate hearing, Udall stated that the Colorado River basin is already two degrees warmer than it was in 1976 and that it is foolhardy to imagine that the next 50 years will resemble the last 50. Lake Mead, the enormous reservoir in Arizona and Nevada that supplies nearly all the water for Las Vegas, is half-empty, and statistical models indicate that it will never be full again. ''As we move forward,'' Udall told his audience, ''all water-management actions based on 'normal' as defined by the 20th century will increasingly turn out to be bad bets.''
 A few weeks after his testimony, I flew to Boulder to meet with Udall, and we spent a day driving switchback roads high in the Rockies in his old Subaru. It had been a wet season on the east slope of the Rockies, but the farther west we went, the drier it became. Udall wanted to show me some of the local reservoirs and water systems that were built over the past century, so I could get a sense of their complexity as well as their vulnerability. As he put it, he wants to connect the disparate members of the water economy in a way that has never really been done before, so that utility executives, scientists, environmentalists, business leaders, farmers and politicians can begin discussing how to cope with the inevitable shortages of fresh water. In the American West, whose huge economy and political power derive from the ability of 20th-century engineers to conquer rivers like the Colorado and establish a reliable water supply, the prospect that there will be less water in the future, rather than the same amount, is unnerving. ''We have a very short period of time here to get people educated on what this means,'' Udall told me as we drove through the mountains. ''Then once that occurs, perhaps we can start talking about how do we deal with it.''
 Udall suggested that I meet a water manager named Peter Binney, who works for Aurora, Colo., a city -- the 60th-largest in the United States -- that sprawls over an enormous swath of flat, postagricultural land south of the Denver airport. It may be difficult for residents of the East Coast to understand the political celebrity of some Western water managers, but in a place like Aurora, where water, not available land, limits economic growth, Binney has enormous responsibilities. In effect, the city's viability depends on his wherewithal to conjure new sources of water or increase the output of old ones. As Binney told me when we first spoke, ''We have to find a new way of meeting the needs of all this population that's turning up and still satisfy all of our recreational and environmental demands.'' Aurora has a population of 310,000 now, Binney said, but that figure is projected to surpass 500,000 by 2035.
 I asked if he had enough water for that many people. ''Oh, no,'' he replied. He seemed surprised that someone could even presume that he might. In fact, he explained, his job is to figure out how to find more water in a region where every drop is already spoken for and at a moment when there is little possibility that any more will ever be discovered.
 Binney and I got together outside Dillon, a village in the Colorado Rockies 75 miles from Aurora and just a few miles west of the Continental Divide. We met in a small parking lot beside Dillon Reservoir, which sits at the bottom of a bowl of snow-capped mountains. Binney, a thickset 54-year-old with dark red hair and a fair complexion, had driven up in a large S.U.V. He still carries a strong accent from his native New Zealand, and in conversation he comes across as less a utility manager than a polymath with the combined savvy of an engineer, an economist and a politician. As we moved to a picnic table, Binney told me that we were looking at Denver's water, not Aurora's, and that it would eventually travel 70 miles through tunnels under the mountains to Denver's taps. He admitted that he would love to have this water, which is pure snowmelt. To people in his job, snowmelt is the best source of water because it requires little chemical treatment to bring it up to federal drinking standards. But this water wasn't available. Denver got here before him. And in Colorado, like most Western states, the rights to water follow a bloodline back to whoever got to it first.
 One way to view the history of the American West is as a series of important moments in exploration or migration; another is to consider it, as Binney does, in terms of its water. In the 20th century, for example, all of our great dams and reservoirs were built -- ''heroic man-over-nature'' achievements, in Binney's words, that control floods, store water for droughts, generate vast amounts of hydroelectric power and enable agriculture to flourish in a region where the low annual rainfall otherwise makes it difficult. And in constructing projects like the Glen Canyon Dam -- which backs up water to create Lake Powell, the vast reservoir in Arizona and Utah that feeds Lake Mead -- the builders went beyond the needs of the moment. ''They gave us about 40 to 50 years of excess capacity,'' Binney says. ''Now we've gotten to the end of that era.'' At this point, every available gallon of the Colorado River has been appropriated by farmers, industries and municipalities. And yet, he pointed out, the region's population is expected to keep booming. California's Department of Finance recently predicted that there will be 60 million Californians by midcentury, up from 36 million today. ''In Colorado, we're sitting at a little under five million people now, on our way to eight million people,'' Binney said. Western settlers, who apportioned the region's water long ago, never could have foreseen the thirst of its cities. Nor, he said, could they have anticipated our environmental mandates to keep water ''in stream'' for the benefit of fish and wildlife, as well as for rafters and kayakers.
 The West's predicament, though, isn't just a matter of limited capacity, bigger populations and environmental regulations. It's also a distributional one. Seventy-five years ago, cities like Denver made claims on -- and from the state of Colorado received rights to -- water in the mountains; those cities in turn built reservoirs for their water. As a result, older cities have access to more surface water (that is, water that comes from rivers and streams) than newer cities like Aurora, which have been forced to purchase existing water rights from farmers and mining companies. Towns that rely on groundwater (water pumped from deep underground) face an even bigger disadvantage. Water tables all over the United States have been dropping, sometimes drastically, from overuse. In the Denver area, some cities that use only groundwater will almost certainly exhaust their accessible supplies by 2050.
 The biggest issue is that agriculture consumes most of the water, as much as 90 percent of it, in a state like Colorado. ''The West has gone from a fur-trapping, to a mining, to an agricultural, to a manufacturing, to an urban-centric economy,'' Binney explained. As the region evolved, however, its water ownership for the most part did not. ''There's no magical locked box of water that we can turn to,'' Binney says of cities like Aurora, ''so it's going to have to come from an existing use.'' Because the supply of water in the West can't really change, water managers spend their time looking for ways to adjust its allocation in their favor.
 Binney knew all this back in 2002, when he took the job in Aurora after a long career at an engineering firm. Over the course of a century, the city had established a reasonable water supply. About a quarter of its water is piped in from the Colorado River basin about 70 miles away; another quarter is taken from reservoirs in the Arkansas River basin far to the south. The rest comes from the South Platte, a lazy, meandering river that runs north through Aurora on its way toward Nebraska. Binney says he believes that a city like his needs at least five years of water in storage in case of drought; his first year there turned out to be one of the worst years for water managers in recorded history, and the town's reservoirs dropped to 26 percent of capacity, meaning Aurora had at most nine months of reserves and could not endure another dry spring. During the summer and fall, Binney focused on both supply and demand. He negotiated with neighboring towns to buy water and accelerated a program to pay local farmers to fallow their fields so the city could lease their water rights. Meanwhile, the town asked residents to limit their showers and had water cops enforce new rules against lawn sprinklers. (''It's interesting how many people were watering lawns in the middle of the night,'' Binney said.)
 Water use in the United States varies widely by region, influenced by climate, neighborhood density and landscaping, among other things. In the West, Los Angelenos use about 125 gallons per person per day in their homes, compared with 114 for Tucson residents. Binney's customers generally use about 160 gallons per person per day. ''In the depths of the drought,'' he said, ''we got down to about 123 gallons.''
 Part of the cruelty of a Western drought is that a water manager never knows if it will last 1 year or 10. In 2002, Binney was at the earliest stages of what has since become a nearly continuous dry spell. Though he couldn't see that at the time, he realized Aurora faced a permanent state of emergency if it didn't boost its water supplies. But how? One option was to try to buy water rights in the mountains (most likely from farmers who were looking to quit agriculture), then build a new reservoir and a long supply line to Aurora. Obvious hurdles included environmental and political resistance, as well as an engineering difficulty: water is heavy, far heavier than oil, and incompressible; a system to move it long distances (especially if it involves tunneling through mountains or pumping water over them) can cost billions. Binney figured that without the help of the federal government, which has largely gotten out of the Western dam-and-reservoir-building business, Aurora would be unwise to pursue such a project. Even if the money could be raised, building a system would take decades. Aurora needed a solution within five years.
 Another practice, sometimes used in Europe, is to drill wells alongside a river and pull river water up though them, using the gravel of the riverbank as a natural filter -- sort of like digging a hole in the sand near the ocean's edge as it fills from below. Half of Aurora's water rights were on the South Platte already; the city also pours its treated wastewater back into the river, as do other cities in the Denver metro area. This gives the South Platte a steady, dependable flow. Binney and the township reasoned that they could conceivably, and legally, go some 20 or 30 miles downstream on the South Platte, buy agricultural land near the river, install wells there and retrieve their wastewater. Thus they could create a system whereby Aurora would use South Platte water; send it to a treatment plant that would discharge it back into the river; go downstream to recapture water from the same river; then pump it back to the city for purification and further use. The process would repeat, ad infinitum. Aurora would use its share of South Platte water ''to extinction,'' in the argot of water managers. A drop of the South Platte used by an Aurora resident would find its way back to the city's taps as a half-drop in 45 to 60 days, a quarter-drop 45 to 60 days after that and so on. For every drop the town used from the South Platte, over time it would almost -- as all the fractional drops added up -- get another.
 Many towns have a supply that includes previously treated water. The water from the Mississippi River, for instance, is reused many times by municipalities as it flows southward. But as far as Binney knew, no municipality in the United States had built the kind of closed loop that Aurora envisioned. Water from wells in the South Platte would taste different, because of its mineral and organic content, so Binney's engineers would have to make it mimic mountain snowmelt. More delicate challenges involved selling local taxpayers on authorizing a project, marketed to them as ''Prairie Waters,'' that would capitalize on their own wastewater. The system, which meant building a 34-mile-long pipeline from the downstream South Platte riverbanks to a treatment facility in Aurora, would cost three-quarters of a billion dollars, making it one of the most expensive municipal infrastructure projects in the country.
 When Binney and I chatted at the reservoir outside Dillon, he had already finished discussions with Moody's and Fitch, the bond-rating agencies whose evaluations would help the town finance the project. Groundbreaking, which would be the next occasion we would see each other, was still a month away. ''What we're doing now is trading high levels of treatment and purification for building tunnels and chasing whatever remaining snowmelt there is in the hills, which I think isn't a wise investment for the city,'' he told me. ''I would expect that what we're going to do is the blueprint for a lot of cities in California, Arizona, Nevada -- even the Carolinas and the Gulf states. They're all going to be doing this in the future.''
 Water managers in the West tend to think in terms of ''acre-feet.'' One acre-foot, equal to about 326,000 gallons, is enough to serve two typical Colorado families for one year. When measurements of the Colorado River began near Lee's Ferry in the early 1920s, the region happened to be in the midst of an extremely wet series of years, and the river was famously misjudged to have an average flow of 17 million acre-feet per year -- when in fact its average flow would often prove to be significantly less. Part of the legacy of that misjudgment is that the seven states that divided the water in the 1920s entered into a legal partnership that created unrealistic expectations about the river's capacity. But there is another, lesser-known legacy too. As the 20th century progressed, many water managers came to believe that the 1950s, which included the most severe drought years since measurement of the river began, were the marker for a worst-case situation.
 But recent studies of tree rings, in which academics drill core samples from the oldest Ponderosa pines or Douglas firs they can find in order to determine moisture levels hundreds of years ago, indicate that the dry times of the 1950s were mild and brief compared with other historical droughts. The latest research effort, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in late May, identified the existence of an epochal Southwestern megadrought that, if it recurred, would prove calamitous.
 When Binney and I met at Dillon Reservoir, he brought graphs of Colorado River flows that go back nearly a thousand years. ''There was this one in the 1150s,'' he said, tracing a jagged line downward with his finger. ''They think that's when the Anasazi Indians were forced out. We see drought cycles here that can go up to 60 years of below-average precipitation.'' What that would mean today, he said, is that states would have to make a sudden choice between agriculture and people, which would lead to bruising political debates and an unavoidable blow to the former. Binney says that as much as he believes that some farmers' water is ultimately destined for the cities anyway, a big jolt like this would be tragic. ''You hope you never get to that point,'' he told me, ''where you force those kinds of discussions, because they will change for hundreds of years the way that people live in the Western U.S. If you have to switch off agriculture, it's not like you can get back into it readily. It took decades for the agricultural industry to establish itself. It may never come back.''
 An even darker possibility is that a Western drought caused by climatic variation and a drought caused by global warming could arrive at the same time. Or perhaps they already have. This coming spring, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will issue a report identifying areas of the world most at risk of droughts and floods as the earth warms. Fresh-water shortages are already a global concern, especially in China, India and Africa. But the I.P.C.C., which along with Al Gore received the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize earlier this month for its work on global-warming issues, will note that many problem zones are located within the United States, including California (where the Sierra Nevada snowpack is threatened) and the Colorado River basin. These assessments follow on the heels of a number of recent studies that analyze mountain snowpack and future Colorado River flows. Almost without exception, recent climate models envision reductions that range from the modest to the catastrophic by the second half of this century. One study in particular, by Martin Hoerling and Jon Eischeid, suggests the region is already ''past peak water,'' a milestone that means the river's water supply will now forever trend downward.
 Climatologists seem to agree that global warming means the earth will, on average, get wetter. According to Richard Seager, a scientist at Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory who published a study on the Southwest last spring, more rain and snow will fall in those regions closer to the poles and more precipitation is likely to fall during sporadic, intense storms rather than from smaller, more frequent storms. But many subtropical regions closer to the equator will dry out. The models analyzed by Seager, which focus on regional climate rather than Colorado River flows, show that the Southwest will ultimately be subject to significant atmospheric and weather alterations. More alarming, perhaps, is that the models do not only concern the coming decades; they also address the present. ''You know, it's like, O.K., there's trouble in the future, but how near in the future does it set in?'' he told me. ''In this case, it appears that it's happening right now.'' When I asked if the drought in his models would be permanent, he pondered the question for a moment, then replied: ''You can't call it a drought anymore, because it's going over to a drier climate. No one says the Sahara is in drought.''
 Climate models tend to be more accurate at predicting temperature than precipitation. Still, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that ''something is happening,'' as Peter Binney gently puts it. Everyone I spoke with in the West has noticed -- less snow, earlier spring melts, warmer nights. Los Angeles this year went 150 days without a measurable rainfall. One afternoon in Boulder, I spent some time with Roger Pulwarty, a highly regarded climatologist at the National Oceanographic Atmospheric Administration. Pulwarty, who has spent the past few years assessing adaptive solutions to a long drought, has a light sense of humor and an air of optimism about him, but he acknowledged that the big picture is worrisome. Even if the precipitation in the West does not decrease, higher temperatures by themselves create huge complications. Snowmelt runoff decreases. The immense reservoirs lose far more water to evaporation. Meanwhile, demand increases because crops are thirstier. Yet importing water from other river basins becomes more difficult, because those basins may face shortages, too.
 ''You don't need to know all the numbers of the future exactly,'' Pulwarty told me over lunch in a local Vietnamese restaurant. ''You just need to know that we're drying. And so the argument over whether it's 15 percent drier or 20 percent drier? It's irrelevant. Because in the long run, that decrease, accumulated over time, is going to dry out the system.'' Pulwarty asked if I knew the projections for what it would take to refill Lake Powell, which is at about 50 percent of capacity. Twenty years of average flow on the Colorado River, he told me. ''Good luck,'' he said. ''Even in normal conditions we don't get 20 years of average flow. People are calling for more storage on the system, but if you can't fill the reservoirs you have, I don't know how more storage, or more dams, is going to help you. One has to ask if the normal strategies that we have are actually viable anymore.''
 Pulwarty is convinced that the economic impacts could be profound. The worst outcome, he suggested, would be mass migrations out of the region, along with bitter interstate court battles over the dwindling water supplies. But well before that, if too much water is siphoned from agriculture, farm towns and ranch towns will wither. Meanwhile, Colorado's largest industry, tourism, might collapse if river flows became a trickle during summertime. Already, warmer temperatures have brought on an outbreak of pine beetles that are destroying pine forests; Pulwarty wonders how many tourists will want to visit a state full of dead trees. ''A crisis is an interesting thing,'' he said. In his view, a crisis is a point in a story, a moment in a narrative, that presents an opportunity for characters to think their way through a problem. A catastrophe, on the other hand, is something different: it is one of several possible outcomes that follow from a crisis. ''We're at the point of crisis on the Colorado,'' Pulwarty concluded. ''And it's at this point that we decide, O.K., which way are we going to go?''
 It is all but imposible to look into the future of the Western states without calling on Pat Mulroy, the head of the Southern Nevada Water Authority. Mulroy has no real counterpart on the East Coast; her nearest analog might be Robert Moses, the notorious New York City planner who built massive infrastructure projects and who almost always found a way around institutional obstructions and financing constraints. She is arguably the most influential and outspoken water manager in the country -- a ''woman without fear,'' as Pulwarty describes her. Pulwarty and Peter Binney respect her willingness to challenge historical water-sharing agreements that, in Mulroy's view, no longer suit the modern West (meaning they don't suit Las Vegas). According to Binney, however, Nevada's scant resources give Mulroy little choice. She has to keep her city from drying out. That makes hers the most difficult job in the water business, he told me.
 Las Vegas is almost certainly more vulnerable to water shortages than any metro area in the country. Partly that's a result of the city's explosive growth. But the state of Nevada has the historical misfortune of receiving a smaller share of Colorado River water (300,000 acre-feet annually) than the other six states with which it signed a water-sharing compact in the 1920s. That modest share, stored in Lake Mead along with water destined for Southern California, Arizona and northern Mexico, now means everything to Las Vegas. I traveled to Lake Mead on a 99-degree day last June. The narrow, 110-mile-long lake, which at full capacity holds 28 million acre-feet of water (making it the largest reservoir in the United States), was at 49 percent of capacity. When riding into the valley and glimpsing it from afar -- an astonishing slash of blue in the desert -- my guide for the day, Bronson Mack of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, remarked that he had never seen it so low. The white bathtub ring on the sides of the canyon that marks the level of full capacity was visible about 100 feet above the water. ''I have a photograph of my mother on her honeymoon, standing in front of the lake,'' Mack, a Las Vegas native, said. That was in 1970. ''It was almost that low, but not quite.''
 Over the past year, it has become conceivable that the lake could eventually drop below the level of the water authority's intake pipes, the straws that suck the water out for the Las Vegas Valley. The authority recently hired an engineering firm to drill through several miles of rock and create a deeper intake pipe near the bottom of the lake. To say the project is being fast-tracked is an understatement. The day after visiting Lake Mead, I met with Mulroy in her Las Vegas office. ''We have everything in line to get it running by 2012,'' she said of the new intake. But she added that she is looking to cut as much time off construction as possible. Building the new intake is a race against the clock, or rather a race against a lake that keeps going down, down, down.
 Mulroy is not gambling the entire future of Las Vegas on this project. One catchphrase of the water trade is that water flows uphill toward money, which is another way of saying that a city with ample funds can, at least theoretically, augment its supplies indefinitely. In a tight water market like that of the West, this isn't an absolute truth, but in many instances money can move rivers. The trade-off is that new water tends to be of lower quality (requiring more expensive purification) or far away (requiring more expensive transport). Thanks to Las Vegas's growth -- the metro area is now at 1.8 million people -- cost is currently no object. The city's cash reserves have made it possible for Mulroy to pay Arizona $330 million for water she can use in emergencies and to plan a controversial multibillion-dollar pipeline to east-central Nevada, where the water authority has identified groundwater it wants to extract and transport. Wealth allows for the additional possibility of a sophisticated trading scheme whereby Las Vegas might pay for a desalination plant on the Pacific Coast that would transform seawater into potable water for use in California and Mexico. In exchange, Nevada could get a portion of their Colorado River water in Lake Mead.
 So money does make a kind of sustainability possible for Las Vegas. On the other hand, buying water is quite unlike buying anything else. At the moment, water doesn't really function like a private good; its value, which Peter Binney calls ''infinite,'' is often only vaguely related to its price, which can vary from 50 cents an acre-foot (what Mulroy pays to take water from Lake Mead) to $12,000 an acre-foot (the most Binney has paid farmers in Colorado for their rights). Moreover, water is so necessary to human life, and hence so heavily subsidized and regulated, that it can't really be bought and sold freely across state lines. (Enron tried to start a water market called Azurix in the late 1990s, only to see it fail spectacularly.) The more successful water markets have instead been local, like one in the late 1980s in California, where farmers agreed to reduce their water use and sell the savings to a state water bank. Mulroy and Binney each told me they think a true free-market water exchange would create too many winners and losers. ''What you would have is affluent communities being able to buy the lifeblood right out from under those that are less well heeled,'' Mulroy said. More practical, in her mind, would be a regional market that gives states, cities and farmers greater freedom to strike mutually beneficial agreements, but with protections so that municipalities aren't pitted against one another.
 More-efficient water markets might ease shortages, but they can't replace a big city's principal source. What if, I asked Mulroy, Lake Mead drained nearly to the bottom? Even if drought conditions ease over the next year or two, several people I spoke with think the odds are greater that Lake Powell, the 27-million-acre-foot reservoir that supplies Lake Mead, will drop to unusable levels before it ever fills again. Mulroy didn't immediately dismiss the possibility; she is certain that the reduced circumstances of the two big Western reservoirs are tied to global warming and that Las Vegas is this country's first victim of climate change. An empty Lake Mead, she began, would mean there is nothing in Lake Powell.
 ''It's well outside probabilities,'' she said -- but it could happen. ''In that case, it's not just a Las Vegas problem. You have three entire states wiped out: Arizona, California and Nevada. Because you can't replace those volumes with desalted ocean water.'' What seems more likely, she said, is that the legal framework governing the Colorado River would preclude such a dire turn of events. Recently, the states that use the Colorado reached a tentative agreement that guarantees Lake Mead will remain partly full under current conditions, even if upstream users have to cut back their withdrawals as a result. The deal supplements a more fundamental understanding that dates to the 1920s. If the river is failing to carry a certain, guaranteed volume of water to Lee's Ferry, which is just below Lake Powell, the river's lower-basin states (Nevada, Arizona and California) can legally force the upper-basin states (Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and Utah) to reduce or stop their water withdrawals. This contingency, known as a ''compact call,'' sets the lower-basin states against the upper, but it has never occurred; it is deeply feared by many water managers, because it would ravage the fragile relationship among states and almost certainly lead to a scrum of lawsuits. Yet, last year water managers in Colorado began meeting for the first time to discuss the possibility. In our conversations, Mulroy denied that there would be a compact call, but she pointed out that Las Vegas's groundwater and desalination plans were going ahead anyway for precautionary reasons.
 I asked if limiting the growth of the Las Vegas metro area wouldn't help. Mulroy bristled. ''This country is going to have 100 million additional people in it in the next 25 to 30 years,'' she replied. ''Tell me where they're supposed to go. Seriously. Every community says, 'Not here,' 'No growth here,' 'There's too many people here already.' For a large urban area that is the core economic hub of any particular area, to even attempt to throw up walls? I'm not sure it can be done.'' Besides, she added, the problem isn't growth alone: ''We have an exploding human population, and we have a shrinking clean-water supply. Those are on colliding paths. This is not just a Las Vegas issue. This is a microcosm of a much larger issue.'' Americans, she went on to say, are the most voracious users of natural resources in the world. Maybe we need to talk about that as well. ''The people who move to the West today need to realize they're moving into a desert,'' Mulroy said. ''If they want to live in a desert, they have to adapt to a desert lifestyle.'' That means a shift from the mindset of the 1930s, when the federal government encouraged people to settle in the West, plant water-intensive crops and make it look like the East Coast. It means landscapes of parched dirt. It means mesquite bushes and palo verde trees for vegetation. It means recycled water. It means gravel lawns. It is the West's new deal, she seemed to be saying, and I got the feeling that for Mulroy it means that every blade of grass in her state would soon be gone.
 The first impulse when confronted with the West's water problems may be to wonder how, as scarcity becomes more acute, the region will engineer its way back to health. What can be built, what can technology accomplish, to ease any shortages? Yet this is almost certainly the wrong way to think about the situation. To be sure, construction projects like a pipeline from east-central Nevada could help Las Vegas. But the larger difficulty facing Pat Mulroy and Peter Binney, as they describe it, is re-engineering the culture and conventions of the West before it becomes too late. Whether or not there is enough water in the region for, say, the next 30 or 50 years isn't necessarily a question with a yes-or-no answer. The water managers I spoke with believe the total volume of available water could be great enough to sustain the cities, many farms and perhaps the natural flow of the area's rivers. But it's not unreasonable to assume that if things continue as they have -- with so much water going to agriculture; with conservation only beginning to take hold among residents, industry and farmers; with supplies diminishing slowly but steadily as the Earth warms; with the population growing faster than anywhere else in the United States; and with some of our most economically vital states constricted by antique water agreements -- the region will become a topography of crisis and perhaps catastrophe. This is an old prophecy, dating back more than a century to one of the original American explorers of the West, John Wesley Powell, who doubted the territory could support large populations and intense development. (Powell presciently argued that river basins, not arbitrary mapmakers, should determine the boundaries of the Western states, in order to avoid inevitable conflicts over water.) An earlier explorer, J. C. Ives, visited the present location of Hoover Dam, between Arizona and Nevada, in 1857. The desiccated landscape was ''valueless,'' Ives reported. ''There is nothing there to do but leave.''
 Roger Pulwarty, for his part, rejects the notion of environmental determinism. Nature, in other words, isn't inexorably pushing the region into a grim, suffering century. Things can be done. Redoubling efforts to prevent further climate change, Pulwarty says, is one place to start; another is getting the states that share the Colorado River to reach cooperative arrangements, as they have begun to discuss, for coping with long-term droughts. Other parts of the solution are less obvious. To Peter Gleick, head of the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit based in Oakland, Calif., that focuses on global water issues, whether we can adapt to a drier future depends on whether we can rethink the functions, and value, of fresh water. Can we can do the same things using less of it? How we use our water, Gleick believes, is considerably more complex than it appears. First of all, there are consumptive and nonconsumptive uses of water. Consumptive use, roughly speaking, refers to water taken from a reservoir that cannot be recovered. ''It's embedded in a product like a liter of Coca-Cola, or it's contaminated so badly we can't reuse it,'' Gleick says. In agriculture, the vast majority of water use is also consumptive, because it evaporates or transpires from crops into the atmosphere. Evaporated water may fall as rain 1,000 miles away -- that's how Earth's water cycle works -- but it is gone locally. A similar consumptive process characterizes the water we put on our lawns or gardens: it mostly disappears. Meanwhile, most of the water used by metropolitan areas is nonconsumptive. It goes down the drain and empties into nearby rivers, like Colorado's South Platte, as treated wastewater.
 Gleick calls the Colorado River ''the most complicated water system in the world,'' and he isn't convinced it will be easy, or practical, to change the laws that govern its usage. ''But I think it's less hard to change how we use water,'' he says. He accepts that climate change is confronting the West with serious problems. (He was also one of the country's first scientists, in the mid-1980s, to point out that reductions in mountain snowpack could present huge challenges.) He makes a persuasive case, however, that there are immense opportunities -- even in cities like Las Vegas, which has made strides in conservation -- to reduce both consumptive and nonconsumptive demand for water. These include installing more low-flow home appliances and adopting more efficient irrigation methods. And they include economic tools too: for example, many municipalities have reduced consumption by making water more expensive (the more you use, the higher your per-gallon rate). The United States uses less water than it did 25 years ago, Gleick points out: ''We haven't even paid too much attention to it, and we've accomplished this.'' To go further, he says he believes we could alter not only demand but also supply. ''Treated wastewater isn't a liability, it's an asset,'' he says. We don't need potable water to flush our toilets or water our lawns. ''One might say that's a ridiculous use of potable water. In fact, I might say that. But that's the way we've set it up. And that's going to change, that's got to change, in this century.''
 Among Colorado's water managers, Peter Binney's Prairie Waters project is considered both innovative and important not on account of its technology but because it seems to mark a new era of finding water sources in the drying West. It also proves that the next generation's water will not come cheap, or come easy. In late July, I went to Aurora to meet up again with Binney. It was the groundbreaking day for Prairie Waters, which had been on the local television news: Binney and several other officials grinned for the cameras and signed a section of six-foot steel pipe, the same kind that would transport water from the South Platte wells to the Aurora treatment facility. That evening, Binney and I had dinner together at a steakhouse in an Aurora shopping mall. When he remarked that we may have exceeded what he calls the ''carrying capacity'' of the West, I asked him whether our desert civilizations could last. Binney seemed dubious. ''Not the way we've got it set up,'' he said. ''We've decoupled land use from water use. Water is the limiting resource in the West. I think we need to match them back together again.'' There was a decent amount of water out there, he went on to explain, but it was a false presumption that it could sustain all the farms, all the cities, all the rivers. Something will have to give. It was also wrong to assume, he said, that cities could continue to grow without experiencing something akin to a religious awakening about the scarcity of water. Soon, he predicted, we would talk about our ''water footprint'' just as we now talk about our carbon footprint.
 Indeed, any conversations about the one will in short order expand to include the other, Binney went on to say. Many water managers have known this for a while. The two problems -- water and energy -- are so intimately linked as to make it exceedingly difficult to tackle one without the other. It isn't just the matter of growing corn for ethanol, which is already straining water supplies. The less water in our rivers, for instance, the less hydropower our dams produce. The further the water tables sink, the more power it takes to pump water up. The more we depend on coal and nuclear power plants, which require huge amounts of water for cooling, the larger the burden we place on supplies. 
 Meanwhile, it is a perverse side effect of global warming that we may have to emit large volumes of carbon dioxide to obtain the clean water that is becoming scarcer because of the carbon dioxide we've already put into the atmosphere. A dry region that turns to desalination, for example, would need vast amounts of energy (and money) to purify its water. While wind-powered desalination could perhaps meet this challenge -- such a plant was recently built outside Perth, Australia -- it isn't clear that coastal residents in, say, California would welcome such projects. Unclear, too, is how dumping the brine that is a by-product of the process back into the ocean would affect ecosystems.
 Similar energy challenges face other plans. In past years, various schemes have arisen to move water from Canada or the Great Lakes to arid parts of the United States. Beyond the environmental implications and construction costs (probably hundreds of billions of dollars), such continental-scale plumbing would require stupendous amounts of electricity. And yet, fears that such plans will resurface in a drier, more populous world are partly behind current efforts by the Great Lakes states to certify a pact that protects their fresh water from outside exploitation.
 Just pumping water from the Prairie Waters site to Aurora will cost a small fortune. Binney told me this the day after the groundbreaking, as we drove north from Aurora to the site. Along the 45-minute journey, Binney narrated where his pipeline would go -- along the edge of the highway here, over in that field there and so on. Eventually we turned off the highway and onto a small country road, and Binney slowed down so I could take in the surroundings. ''Here's where you see it all coming together and all of it coming into conflict,'' he told me. To him, it was a perfect tableau of the West in the 21st century. There was a housing development on one side of the road and fields of irrigated crops on the other. Farther ahead was a gravel pit, a remnant of the old Colorado mineral-extraction economy.
 He drove on, and soon we turned onto a dirt road that bisected some open fields. We rumbled along for a quarter mile or so, spewing dust and passing over the South Platte in the process. Binney parked by a wire fence near a sign marking it as Aurora property. We got out of the truck, hopped over a locked gate and walked into a farm field.
 For miles along the highway, we passed barren acreage that formerly grew winter wheat but was now slated for new houses. The land we stood on once grew corn, but tangles of weeds covered it now. As we walked, Binney explained that the collection wells on the South Platte would soon be dug a few hundred yards away; that water would be pumped into collection basins on this field, where sand and gravel would purify it further. Then it would be pumped back to the chemical treatment plants in Aurora before being piped to residents. ''We're standing 34 miles from there,'' Binney said.
 It was a location as ordinary as I could have imagined, an empty place, far from anything, and yet Binney saw it as something else. Earlier, when we crossed over the gravel banks of the South Platte, I found the river disappointing: broad and shallow, dun-colored and slow-moving, its unimpressive flow somehow incorporating water Aurora had already used upstream. James Michener, in writing about this region years ago, was dead-on in calling it ''a sad, bewildered nothing of a river.'' Still, the South Platte was dependable. It was also Aurora's lifeline, buying the city 20 or 30 years of time. ''What I really like about it,'' Binney said, smiling as we walked from the field back to his truck, ''is that it's wet.''

AS people often say when they are about to offend every aesthete within earshot, I'm no art critic. 
 But here goes: Mona Lisa was no Monica Bellucci. Even so, you would never fiddle with the Mona Lisa's looks, never send her out for a whiter smile and some dermabrasion.
 It's the same with the Subaru Impreza WRX. With apologies to its zealous owners -- their vision was apparently too clouded by speed to notice -- the original WRX was one of the homeliest cars around, a budget crackerbox in a high-performance Halloween costume. Yet people adored the overachieving underdog. 
 Even before its 2002 arrival in the United States, enthusiasts were familiar with the WRX and its abilities. It had become an icon of the video game universe and a champion in world rally racing before it was finally introduced here, a decade after it went on sale abroad. Being unattainable seemed to have only increased America's desire for the WRX. 
 At the time there was nothing quite like it -- a high-strung factory-built Japanese tuner car, an under-$25,000 sedan sprung from the bargain basement that could hang with European sport sedans that were double its price. 
 The 2008 WRX adheres to Subaru's established formula, taking the bare-bones Impreza compact and adding chunky plastic armor, a stout suspension and a turbocharged engine that is 54 horsepower more muscular than the base Impreza's 170-horse power plant. 
 Like its closest competitor, the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution that went on sale here in 2003, the WRX wore its boxy bulldog style proudly, especially when it was let loose in the rain, dirt or snow. Together, the WRX and the Lancer Evolution created a new and somewhat exotic niche of import performance cars, an expression of power entirely different from American V-8 muscle.
 Still, the Subie's jolie laide charm was lost on many grown-ups, including my wife, who insisted that any man over 35 who drove a WRX or the equally adolescent Mitsubishi should receive a penalty flag as an ineligible bachelor. 
 The redesign of the WRX is clearly aimed at expanding its appeal. But the loyalists are not happy, blogging that this WRX, whether the sedan body or a new five-door hatchback, is ugly. 
 Coming from WRX fans, that's a bit like Chef Boyardee griping about the food in Tuscany. 
 After a week with the hatchback, which steps in for the previous wagon, I could not bring myself to speak the U-word. Instead, I think what's behind some fans' allergic response is that the WRX no longer looks anything like a WRX, or much like a Subaru. 
 Worse, the 2008 Evo, a more expensive car that will go on sale in January, seems to be Mitsubishi's best styling effort yet.
 The Subaru's personality has undergone therapy as well; once again, its family may not fully recognize the patient. While the WRX's turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder has the same 224 horsepower and 226 pound-feet of torque as the '07 model, it reaches the torque peak 800 r.p.m. sooner, and the thrust from the turbocharger has been smoothed to make it less jumpy. The E.P.A. rates the fuel economy at 19 miles a gallon in town and 24 highway, measured by the '08 test standards.
 The new WRX is roomier and quieter inside than the car it replaces. A new double wishbone rear suspension, more compact than the struts it replaces, results in more usable trunk space, and in the hatchback, provides a lower, more spacious cargo floor. The sturdier chassis, and a switch to doors with frames surrounding the window glass, make the car quieter; slamming the trunk or doors no longer sends shock waves through the body. 
 The WRX also adds features you expect in a class of high-performance compacts: side and curtain air bags, stability control, automatic climate control. For models with the manual transmission, a hill-holder automatically keeps the car in place on slopes.Where the previous WRX interior was a tub of utilitarian plastic, this one is more hospitable. Firm, heated sport seats are covered in a handsome woven fabric. 
 Subaru has also sanded away the rougher edges of performance. It's another decision that may not sit well with everyone; the previous WRX was a bit of a hooligan, but its rude-boy style was what people loved about it.
 The car is just as quick as before, with Subaru citing 5.9 seconds from 0 to 60 m.p.h., within sight of Porsche Boxster and Nissan 350Z, cars that cost more. A wheelbase lengthened by 3.7 inches helps the WRX ride more smoothly.
 And while the more-compliant suspension produces more body lean in turns, the car is still a game handler, and less prone to skittering over rough pavement. 
 So while the Subaru feels tamed, it hasn't lost its singing-in-the-rain dance steps, something it demonstrated on an overcast day on the cliff-hugging roads near West Point, N.Y. As rain began washing over the concrete, the Subaru dismissed other cars as orange cones on a slalom course. Even heavy bursts of acceleration in the wet failed to break the tires loose.
 The action of the manual shifter is acceptable, but the throws are too long. The pressing issue -- literally -- is the clutch: its effort is mystifyingly stiff for a four-cylinder compact. A four-speed automatic is optional.
 Styling arguments aside, the WRX remains fun to drive and decently priced at $25,495 to start; mine, with satellite radio and G.P.S. navigation, was $29,833. 
 By widening the WRX's appeal, it seems clear that Subaru is nudging its original following toward the pricier version: a new WRX STi that goes on sale next year with estimates of 305 horsepower and a $33,000 base price. 
 INSIDE TRACK Well, it's got a great personality.

HEADLINE: What Is Ailing Black America?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Tough, Sad and Smart,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Oct. 16):
 Mr. Herbert says a joint venture by Bill Cosby and Dr. Alvin Poussaint ''is nothing less than an effort to save the soul of black America.'' In fact, it is a tired recycling of an argument that reaches back to Daniel Patrick Moynihan's ''Negro Family'' and runs through the pledge last year by Bruce S. Gordon, then the president of the N.A.A.C.P., to end ''victimlike thinking'' by African-Americans.
 In casting victimhood as ''the enemy,'' we mistake a condition for a state of mind (that dreaded ''victim mentality'') and end up blaming the victim. Would Mr. Cosby and Dr. Poussaint have us believe that it is not structured inequality and racism that leave droves jobless, but rather a matter of self-esteem and individual character? 
 While Mr. Moynihan pathologized the urban poor, he still sought national action. In our neoliberal era of personal responsibility and workfare, we leave victims to battle their victimization on their own. 
 What black men and women need are jobs, not another pep talk. This applies to disconnected youth, who are out of school and out of work, and, sadly, out of favor among policy makers as well.

 To the Editor:
 While I applaud Bob Herbert's willingness to speak about absent black fathers and personal responsibility, I think there is something else that's being missed. We are letting the mothers off the hook too easily.
 What I see in my generation (I'm 36) are women who wear single motherhood as a badge of honor and take the ''I don't need a man to have a baby'' attitude. Perhaps their fathers were absent and so this is closer to their experience. But although they may not need a man, these children need fathers.
 Unfortunately, the system makes it easier for these women to get help when the father is absent. So if we are going to have a discussion about personal responsibility, we have to talk about the role of mothers and how our society's good intentions have exacerbated this sad state of affairs.
 Angela DiCamillo New York, Oct. 16, 2007
 To the Editor:
 One reason there are so many absent fathers and single-mother households is that the welfare system still refuses to provide needed financial support for two-parent households. In order to feed the children, an unemployed father often has to abandon the family.
 Until our government starts to put its money where its mouth is regarding family values and the importance of a two-parent household, nothing is going to change.
 It's all fine to tell fathers to be there for their children. But it doesn't mean anything unless there is a push for legislation to help set the stage to make that even a possibility. 
 Leslye Janusz Auburn, Calif., Oct. 16, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 It is surprising to me that in the discussion of black fathers and children, there is no reference to the disappearance of decent working-class jobs in America. 
 As a teenager in the early 70s, I would often visit friends in Compton, Calif. At that time, the black fathers in Compton worked in factory jobs -- Bethlehem Steel or Goodrich Tires. Compton was a black suburban town with two-parent families, nice lawns and fathers fixing their cars on the weekend.
 Now, the factory jobs are gone, and Compton is drug-infested. It may be useful to say ''get a good education and there's an engineering job waiting for you in Silicon Valley,'' but that socio-intellectual distance is enormous. To address the problems of the inner city, some kind of viable economic structure needs to exist to help fathers act like fathers. 
 Eric Lindemann Boulder, Colo., Oct. 16, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert, in his discussion of the work of Bill Cosby and Dr. Alvin Poussaint, says ''the most important step toward ending the tragic cycles of violence and poverty among African-Americans'' is ''reconnecting black fathers to their children.'' 
 So the answer is that black fathers should shape up? This position shows a profound lack of understanding of the day-to-day forces that impinge on black men, resulting in circumstances and vulnerabilities that all but destroy their abilities to overcome. It reinforces the American mantra that the fault lies not in the stars. 
 This rampant individualism, as reflected in American social policies through the years, accounts in great measure for the devastating social problems with which all of us are afflicted.

BYLINE: By MAURA EGAN

 BODY:
Perhaps it's today's Babylonian climate -- impending environmental catastrophe; an unending battle in Iraq; drug-addled, pole-dancing pop tarts -- that has fashion designers and nabobs of the night looking back to another turbulent time: 1920s Berlin. From the ashes of World War I, which left Germany an economic and political mess, rose the Weimar Republic, in all its artistic, intellectual and debauched glory. It was a ''decade when everything appeared to have become unhinged,'' Ian Buruma writes in the catalog for ''Glitter and Doom: German Portraits From the 1920s,'' last winter's exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Painters, intellectuals, prostitutes and gender-bucking entertainers led the show in this erotic metropolis. Life was a cabaret -- a titillating theater of ideas, sex and song, all in a cigarette haze. 
 Fashion is its own theater, and cabaret took center stage on the fall runways. While L'Wren Scott raided Marlene Dietrich's closet, showing sharp-tailored suits and slouchy men's trousers -- ''a girl should always have a corset in her closet,'' says the designer -- Dolce & Gabbana added a little S-M, strapping models down with patent leather belts, their eyes hidden behind black masks. Otto Dix could have painted the louche ladies at John Galliano with their rouged cheeks, blood-red lips and smoky eyes. Not to mention the chorus line of feathers, hats and lacquered Sally Bowles-style pageboys that traipsed down the runway. 
 So where to take in the torch-song chanteuse, the chair-straddling ecdysiast, the ladies of the night dressed up in drag? Eighty years later, Berlin, which Netley Lucas described as ''the most lurid'' of cities in her 1927 book, ''Ladies of the Underworld,'' is at it again with the ever-popular KitKatClub, a vice-friendly spot where Kate Moss once showed up in her best fetish wear. In New York, the German diva Ute Lemper brings her sultry songbook of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht to the Neue Galerie this November. 
 For more degenerate art and artifice, the Box on the Lower East Side serves up enough naughty fare -- led by M.C. Raven O, a modern-day Joel Grey -- to frighten the neighbors who have threatened to shutter it. ''This place makes people feel liberated at a time when we are back to 1950s political correctness,'' says the Box's co-owner Simon Hammerstein, who takes a stand against the city's current buttoned-up no-smoking, no-trans-fat mood. Political correctness hasn't deterred Spiegelworld, either, a cabaret theater that is bringing its risque show ''Absinthe'' to Miami this December. ''It's just sexy entertainment,'' says one of the Spiegelworld performers, Julie Atlas Muz, who does a topless number in a very large bubble. ''It's a lot better than watching porn by yourself.''

HEADLINE: Famous Mayor Under Fire in Virginia

BYLINE: By LISA A. BACON

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va., Oct. 20 

 BODY:
When L. Douglas Wilder left the Virginia Executive Mansion in 1994 after serving as the country's first elected black governor, talk of a possible run for the White House floated briefly in national political circles. The bid never materialized. Instead, Mr. Wilder worked in the private sector for years and in 2002 began to explore running for mayor of Richmond. He won in 2004 after capturing 80 percent of the vote in a four-way race. 
 But now some former supporters who fought to change the city charter to get Mr. Wilder into office and lobbied the Legislature to expand his powers are asking the courts to place limits on him. They say that he has gone too far, and that he is trying to run the city single-handedly, firing department heads, upbraiding public officials and starting secret investigations. 
 In his most controversial move, Mr. Wilder last month ordered the offices of the school board moved out of City Hall in the middle of the night. On Sept. 22, accompanied by the police, 150 movers from three companies dismantled the offices on the top six floors of City Hall and moved their contents into vans. 
 The order came two months after the City Council passed an ordinance allowing the school administration to remain in City Hall for five more years. Mr. Wilder wanted the board to move out to make room for the city economic development department.
 The eviction was stopped abruptly after school board members rushed downtown to halt the move. Just after midnight on Sept. 22, a Circuit Court judge issued a temporary restraining order and told the movers to put everything back. 
 Estimates of the cost of the aborted move range from $300,000 to more than $1 million.
 Mr. Wilder, 77, is unapologetic, insisting that the ultimate authority lies with him. ''If I don't have the authority to do it, I don't need the job,'' he said. ''I didn't run for this job to be run around by City Council to tell me what to do. They fired the city manager. They can't fire me.'' 
 But he has lost much of his support.
 ''People had tremendous hopes for this mayor,'' said Councilman Chris A. Hilbert, who supported Mr. Wilder in his mayoral run and in broadening his powers. ''This is someone of a tremendous stature, a national figure. He has squandered his mandate on petty infighting that doesn't amount to anything. He is interested in consolidating power for its own sake. There doesn't even seem to be an agenda.''
 Controversy began shortly after Mr. Wilder's election when, a month before being sworn into office, he ordered the firing of the police chief. And Mr. Wilder, a native of Richmond, had been in office barely six weeks when he ordered the removal of metal detectors from City Hall as a cost-cutting measure. At the same time, he established a detail of 8 to 10 police officers to serve as his personal bodyguards.
 This year, Mr. Wilder fired more than a dozen long-term city employees on the grounds that they had not been hired properly. They were allowed to reapply for their jobs. One refused. The rest reapplied and have returned. 
 Since Mr. Wilder became mayor in 2005, the city's murder rate is down and economic development is up. But critics say his drive to expand his power has overshadowed his efforts to clean up the city he once called a ''cesspool of corruption.''
 ''Mr. Wilder has the skills to do things no one else could do,'' said Councilwoman Katherine C. Graziano, who voted for Mr. Wilder and contributed to his campaign. But Ms. Graziano no longer counts herself as a Wilder supporter, citing ''the mayor's disregard for the law, his lack of communication with and disrespect for Council.'' 
 There are those, however, who defend Mr. Wilder.
 ''The school board is playing the victim when in fact they're not,'' said Reginald Malone, who retired from the board in 2004 to run for City Council. Mr. Wilder supported Mr. Malone in his unsuccessful run.
 ''Mr. Wilder gave them plenty of time to move,'' Mr. Malone said. ''Instead, they went behind his back to City Council for help. The mayor got two-timed. If this had been 10 or 20 years ago, nobody would've been able to do Mr. Wilder this way. I support him fervently, whether he's right or wrong.'' 
 Mr. Wilder said he was willing to compromise.
 ''I've spoken with Council,'' he said. ''I told them, 'Come together with what you think is reasonable. Let's talk.' There could be some agreement. I've always been open to that.''
 Some say there is an element of revenge to the mayor's clash with the school board. 
 ''It began when we refused to cede to him the power to hire and fire the superintendent of schools,'' said Carol Wolf, a school board member who described her experiences with Mr. Wilder as ''one unrelenting psychodrama of nonstop negativity.'' 
 ''He wants all the power, all the time,'' Ms. Wolf said.
 A court hearing is scheduled for Monday. The City Council is seeking to join the school board in a lawsuit to block the school board eviction permanently. Mr. Wilder is asking the judge to dismiss the suit.
 Mr. Wilder said he was eager to settle the question of who runs Richmond.
 ''If I have the authority, I need to know that, and if I don't, I need to know that,'' he said. ''I will continue to assume that I do, but I will abide by all lawful decisions.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 9, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 21 about the growing number of critics of L. Douglas Wilder, the mayor of Richmond, referred imprecisely to Mr. Wilder's former presidential aspirations and misstated his age. Although Mr. Wilder was briefly a candidate for president in 1991, there was no serious talk in 1994 about his running again. The mayor is 76, not 77.

HEADLINE: In Search Of Wireless Wiggle Room

BYLINE: By JUDITH CHEVALIER. 
Judith Chevalier is a professor of economics and finance at the Yale School of Management.

 BODY:
I RECENTLY watched a YouTube clip of a young man removing the memory chip from his iPhone with his teeth, in an attempt to ''unlock'' the device for use on a network other than the AT&T system for which the phone was exclusively sold. His gyrations were a particularly vivid reminder of the limits imposed on cellphones by the companies that run national wireless networks in the United States. 
 But there are signs that the existing order in the wireless world may finally be changing. 
 This month, despite the opposition of companies like Verizon, the Federal Communications Commission reiterated that its coming auction of wireless spectrum would include rules intended to give consumers more choices in the phones they can use. These ''open access'' auction rules have already received considerable attention, but the commission also faces other decisions that will significantly affect the availability and the price of wireless service. 
 For decades, the F.C.C. has allocated almost all the prime frequencies available for communication for the exclusive use of licensees and since the 1990s, it has emphasized auctions for allocating that spectrum. Economists mostly applauded the move to the auction system, because it subjected prospective licenses to a market test: the F.C.C. no longer had to try to divine who would make the most productive use of the spectrum; the companies that were willing to pay the most at auction would win. 
 Not all of the spectrum is auctioned, however. Some of it is left ''unlicensed'' -- meaning that no one has exclusive rights to it. Baby monitors, garage door openers and Wi-Fi all work on unlicensed parts of the spectrum, in a kind of free-for-all. As technology improves to prevent these devices from stumbling over one another's signals, the argument for leaving part of the spectrum unlicensed grows stronger as well. 
 In the past, when the F.C.C. auctioned spectrum for cellular service, it allowed the winners to determine the equipment and applications that would run on their networks. That created the current status quo, in which a vast majority of American consumers buy a handset from a wireless service provider. 
 The open-access rules, which will apply to about one-third of the spectrum being sold at the auction, represent a significant departure from past practice. They require the winners to let consumers use any tested, safe and compatible device or application on its network. Entrepreneurs could sell handsets with capabilities that are unavailable -- or unavailable at affordable prices -- from current carriers. As long as a manufacturer offered a product compatible with a network, the consumer could use that product -- without needing to take measures like unlocking it with his teeth. 
 The spectrum in the coming auction is low frequency, which means that a signal using it could travel long distances and penetrate walls, making it very appealing for a national wireless network. Because the signal travels well, for example, fewer towers would be needed. Thus, it is possible that a new network could emerge from the auction to compete with the four existing national carriers.
 Although the open-access rules could lead to innovation in devices and applications, they might not do much to increase competition among carriers. Preventing an influx of additional competition would be valuable for the big existing carriers, so they may bid aggressively enough that no new carriers will win significant licenses at the auction. 
 Both Google and Frontline Wireless -- a start-up whose vice chairman is Reed E. Hundt, a former F.C.C. chairman -- lobbied the commission to effectively force new entry into the market by imposing added restrictions on auction winners. They argued that winners should be forced to resell use of the spectrum at wholesale rates, a provision the F.C.C. did not adopt. The idea was that this spectrum could support multiple services, creating competition and driving down prices. 
 Having missed the opportunity to include these provisions in the coming auction, the F.C.C. will have another chance this year to create cheaper wireless broadband services. Google and other technology companies, including Dell, Philips and Microsoft, are part of a group called the White Space Coalition that is asking the F.C.C. to open up the empty space between assigned TV channels to unlicensed users and devices.
 The idea would work like this: In many areas, not all broadcast channels are in use. The unused channels are ''white spaces'' of high-quality spectrum that could be made available to local Internet service providers. Unlike the much higher frequency of Wi-Fi, television broadcast frequencies can travel for miles and penetrate walls, providing a much broader range for Internet service. Because the unused channels vary across the country, the group proposes that consumers be able to buy generic devices, like PC cards for Wi-Fi, that would search for open frequencies and connect to a service. 
 Big cities tend to have many TV stations. That means there would be more white-space opportunity in rural areas, which also tend to be underserved by wired broadband services. If the plan worked, rural America could be dotted with high-speed wireless Internet service providers -- like having a Starbucks on every corner, minus the coffee. 
 The catch? Television broadcasters argue that these services would interfere with digital television reception. The National Association of Broadcasters has run TV spots depicting doomsday -- an increasingly irritated woman banging on her TV because, ''if Microsoft and other high-tech companies have their way, your TV could freeze up and become unwatchable.''
 Interference with broadcast television wouldn't affect the more than 80 percent of television-viewing households who don't watch over-the-air TV anyway. And it wouldn't be a problem if the white-space gadgets work as intended, avoiding frequencies where there is any conflict. Unfortunately, that is not a given: a Microsoft device failed F.C.C. engineering tests earlier this year. 
 The F.C.C. has shown some bravery in maintaining the open-access auction rules, despite efforts to dismantle them. Now the commission needs to deal with the arguments of the broadcasters. 
 While there is certainly a risk that white-space Internet devices could interfere with some television signals, the potential for cheap, accessible wireless broadband is too great to pass up.

HEADLINE: Studio$

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
STUDIO apartments used to be the wallflowers at New York City's real estate party, but not anymore. 
 In new developments, the $1 million studio has become almost commonplace. One studio at the Plaza recently sold for $2,002,550, and several others there have sold for just under $2 million.
 To justify these high prices, studios in many of these new condos have grown in size, and in some cases are nearly twice as big as the more traditional 450-square-foot box. These bigger, more expensive spaces tend to appeal to buyers of pieds-a-terre and investors, not to the typical first-time home buyer.
 In yet another sign of how strong the studio market has gotten, the price per square foot for studios in some Manhattan neighborhoods is now higher than that for one-bedrooms. Studios in the financial district, for example, are selling for $1,012 a square foot, compared with $948 a square foot for one-bedrooms, according to data from Radar Logic, a real estate data analysis company. 
 ''The studio market has been so strong that it sort of counters the underlying axiom of real estate in New York that there's a premium placed on larger spaces and that one plus one equals two and a half,'' said Jonathan Miller, an executive vice president and the director of research for Radar Logic.
 Now, zero -- zero bedrooms, that is -- can be worth more than one. And brokers agree that studios at all prices, from the more affordable ones in older buildings that are tailored for young professionals making their first purchases to the supersized ones in new condos, are in demand right now and are often selling faster than larger apartments.
 Brokers say that the market for studios is as strong as it is because the supply simply has not kept up with demand. The number of studios in existing co-ops and condos has diminished over time, as more people have bought neighboring apartments to expand their own spaces. New construction, meanwhile, has not introduced many new studios into the market in recent years, because developers have been so focused on building larger, ''family size'' apartments. So when studios come on the market, they tend not to linger.
 But this was not always the case. Studios are known to be one of the most volatile parts of the New York real estate market and developers generally believe that they would be one of the most vulnerable sectors if the market went into a slump. ''In a really hot market, they will be overvalued on a per-square-foot basis,'' said Adam Rose, president of Rose Associates, which develops and manages apartment buildings across the city. ''But in a soft market, they're worthless, because everyone who can afford it will shift to a one-bedroom.''
 In the early 1990s, when the market was still drifting in a recession, ''we couldn't give away studios for $75,000 and less,'' he said, ''but today, those same apartments are selling for $600,000.''
 But Mr. Rose and others who have watched the studio's reputation evolve over time agreed that the days when buyers feared studios were a bad risk are becoming an increasingly distant memory.
 At Fifth on the Park, a 160-apartment condo being built on the edge of Mount Morris Park in Harlem, 9 of the building's 10 studios sold in the first 5 months. ''The studios sold much quicker than the larger apartments, probably because they're more reasonably priced,'' said Carol Griffin, president of the Griffin Real Estate Group, which is handling the marketing. ''But that wouldn't always have been the case. This market wasn't interested in studios before.''
 Francesca Cha, who recently signed a contract for a 600-square-foot studio in the building, priced at $450,000, said she hadn't been sure what she would be able to afford when she decided earlier this year that it was time to move out of the Harlem apartment that she now shares with her mother and two younger siblings.
 Ms. Cha, 34, a manager at a J. Crew store in Midtown, said she saw plenty of studios in co-op buildings in the area that were priced at $350,000 or less, but she ruled them out because they all needed renovation, something she didn't want to take on. 
 After seven months of searching, she concluded she wanted to live in a new building, but until she came across Fifth on the Park, she found very few that had studios.
 ''Even though I won't be able to move in for another year, I'm happy I waited,'' she said. ''The building has a lot to offer -- just having a full-time doorman is huge.'' Like most new construction in the area, the building has a gym, roof deck and garage.
 But while new studios in Harlem may still be affordable for young buyers, most of what's being built elsewhere in Manhattan may not be. Many of the studios under construction have asking prices of $750,000 or more. A 698-square-foot studio in the William Beaver House, a 47-story tower under construction, recently sold for $1.37 million.
 Despite the prices, there seems to be no shortage of buyers. 
 Dae-Hoon Kim, a 29-year-old lawyer and film student at New York University, just bought a 680-square-foot studio at the Plaza for $1.4 million, and his mother bought a 900-square-foot studio there for $1.96 million. They both bought their apartments as investments and plan to rent them out, but only after living in them for at least a few months themselves. ''I would love to be a filmmaker,'' he said. ''Having a place at the Plaza, maybe I could live there for a couple months and pretend to be one of the great artists that lived there.''
 In addition to having the kind of living space that rivals that of most one-bedrooms and some two-bedrooms in the city, both apartments have large foyers, full-size kitchens, washers and dryers, and walk-in closets. ''It's more expensive than a one-bedroom in most other places,'' Mr. Kim said. ''But it's the Plaza Hotel, and the price per square foot was a pretty decent deal, especially considering the name and the location.''
 The two apartments cost about $2,000 a square foot, he said, while apartments they saw at the Time Warner Center, at the other end of Central Park South, would have cost much more.
 Most studios, of course, cost a fraction of what the Kims paid for theirs. The average price for studios in condos is $644,360, and the average price for studios in co-ops is $354,057, according to a market report released by Prudential Douglas Elliman earlier this month. Since studios are generally still the most affordable apartments around, they remain the entry-level purchase for first-time buyers trying to get a toehold in the New York market.
 Mo Shah just bought a studio in the West Village for about $500,000, and he sees it as a steppingstone to something bigger. ''It's a studio, so I don't want to live there that long, but for a few years at least,'' said Mr. Shah, a 29-year-old foreign-exchange analyst who moonlights as a music editor for Ego, a magazine for the South Asian diaspora.
 After scanning hundreds of listings downtown, where he had his heart set on living, he said, ''I was starting to think that I was going to compromise and maybe it wouldn't be in my ideal neighborhood, but then I think I just got lucky and found this -- it's not a huge space, but it's for me.''
 But by studio standards, Mr. Shah's apartment is actually on the large side. It totals about 550 square feet.
 Joe O'Brien lives in a typical prewar studio on West 57th Street that has only about 300 square feet. When Mr. O'Brien moved in last year after living in a one-bedroom rental, he had to pare down his belongings. He now owns one set of sheets, one suitcase and two pots, and he used to have many more of each.
 ''The lifestyle in a studio is definitely different,'' he said. ''It forces me to be well organized, and it makes me second-guess every purchase, so I'm not nearly as extravagant as I used to be.''
 For Carla Melman, though, the need for a larger space ultimately trumped her initial wish to buy a studio somewhere downtown. She saw and rejected more than 100 apartments south of 23rd Street because they were either too expensive or too small or in terrible shape. ''They were places where I knew I couldn't survive if I had to be home sick for two days,'' she said.
 When her broker showed her a 600-square-foot alcove studio with a 400-square-foot patio on East 77th Street, she put aside her downtown dream without a second thought. ''Downtown is cool, but I was an idiot for not considering other areas,'' said Ms. Melman, a 31-year-old Wall Street equities trader.
 She moved into the apartment, which cost her about $400,000, late last year and has put in a fair amount of work, including new counters and tile in the kitchen. 
 Her broker, Susan Orbach Scott, an agent at Bellmarc Realty, said the same space would probably sell for $500,000 now.
 While the supply of studios has been on the decline, that trend may soon shift. Developers of new buildings have traditionally shunned studios because they cost nearly as much to build as one-bedrooms but sell for significantly less. They all but stopped building studios in the last few years in favor of two- and three-bedrooms, meeting a demand for larger spaces. 
 But many developers are now deciding to build more studios in future projects.
 ''We're definitely trending toward building more studios, because there's such demand for them and the price per square foot has gone up,'' said Shaun Osher, chief executive of CORE Group Marketing, which is involved in more than a dozen new developments across the city. 
 At the Jasper, a 20-story office building in Murray Hill that is being converted to condos, 3 of the 80 apartments will be studios, with prices starting at $890,000. ''It will still be a rare commodity,'' Mr. Osher said, ''but a year or two ago, you would have found buildings with no studios at all.''
 Developers of more moderately priced projects are starting to build more studios, too. ''They see that there's a need for smaller spaces, and they also want to hedge their bets a little bit and diversify their product,'' said Stephen Kliegerman, executive director for development marketing at Halstead Property.
 Instead of building another three-bedroom, they might build a two-bedroom with a studio right next to it. A buyer who wants extra space can buy the two apartments and combine them, but studio buyers can also find their way into the condo market.
 At 505 West 47th Street, which will not be completed until early 2009, nearly a quarter of the building's 111 apartments will be studios. They will range from 400 to 450 square feet at prices starting at $399,000. 
 ''People think we're kind of crazy to go at such a low price,'' said Mati Weiderpass, a principal in the project. ''But we wanted the average young professional to be able to afford to live in this building, and it'll also work for pied-a-terre buyers who want to be able to go to the theater and walk home.''

HEADLINE: The State's Big Push to Be Hollywood East

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE STUART

 BODY:
HARTFORD 
 CONNECTICUT has lured a steady stream of filmmakers since it began offering lucrative tax credits last year. Now it has chosen its next project: keep the cameras rolling, and the revenue rolling in, by providing producers with trained, skilled technicians who live and work in the state. 
 The House speaker, James A. Amann, a Democrat of Milford, announced this month the formation of a panel of college professors, film executives, lawmakers and tradespeople that will examine ways to meet the demands of the state's growing movie and television industry. 
 The veteran Hollywood producer Howard Baldwin, who co-produced ''Ray'' and is a member of the panel, praised the tax credit, which gives qualifying production companies 30 percent back on costs, but added that ''what keeps them here are the crews.'' 
 Mr. Baldwin, who has a studio in New London and a house in East Lyme, said that while Connecticut was a great place to live and work, producers have to factor in the high cost of housing and feeding experienced film crews. 
 Mark Whittaker, a member of Teamsters Local 191, said the tax credit program allowed him and other union members to work in their home state. This summer, Mr. Whittaker drove John Travolta around Redding as he filmed Disney's ''Old Dogs.'' Mr. Whittaker said 75 Connecticut residents in his union made $3.5 million over the last 12 to 18 months working on films. ''Connecticut can and will be a major player in this industry,'' he said. 
 To help the state get there, universities and colleges throughout Connecticut are considering changes to their theatrical and communication programs to cater to the film industry. 
 Gary English, head of the dramatic arts department at the University of Connecticut, said that every student who graduates with a bachelor's degree in fine arts moves to New York or California to pursue a career. He said if the state's colleges made more of a commitment to film studies and production, the students might be more willing to stay in Connecticut. 
 ''We want a permanent industry over the next 20 to 30 years, which is possible if we begin to train a workforce here,'' said Kevin Segalla, who founded the Connecticut Film Center to take advantage of the tax credit program.
 The center has worked on several movies so far, helping producers and directors on everything from scouting locations to navigating the tax-credit application process. Last week, it opened a 120,000-square-foot production studio in Norwalk. ''We saw an opportunity to grow a new industry in the state, and we jumped on it,'' Mr. Segalla said.
 Since the state began offering tax credits in July 2006, the film industry has sunk more than $480 million into the state's economy and applied for more than $144 million in tax credits, according to the Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism. 
 Over the next 100 days, Mr. Amann's panel will examine what the industry needs to call the state home and help identify the ancillary effects of the industry on the state's economy. 
 State Representative Carlo Leone, a Democrat of Stamford, said the panel would consider as much information as possible, including the tax returns of businesses benefiting from the presence of the production crews and any data the State Department of Labor can provide on, for example, the number of jobs the tax program has helped create. 
 Mr. Leone said preliminary figures showed that since July 2006, $336 million had been pumped into the state's economy -- a good indication that people in the industry are interested in Connecticut.
 So far this year, 11 films or television shows have been produced in Connecticut, with 3 more now in production. In 2006, there were just four films and one cable-television mini-series, ESPN'S ''Bronx Is Burning.'' Before the tax program, movie productions brought in $1 million to Connecticut. 
 Mr. Amann offered some anecdotal information about what the film boom has meant to the state. He said that while Al Pacino was in Milford shooting ''Righteous Kill'' last month, the owner of Al Dente's Italian restaurant delivered food to the set every day, and when Uma Thurman was in New Haven last year shooting ''In Bloom,'' a dry cleaner did $9,000 in business in a week. 
 ''That's business he never expected,'' Mr. Amann said.

WEIMAR GERMANY 
 Promise and Tragedy. 
 By Eric D. Weitz. 
 Illustrated. 425 pp. Princeton University Press. $29.95. 
 Democracy is a fragile flower, as we learn again and again. Among the many failed democracies of the past century, few held more promise than Germany's Weimar Republic, and none collapsed into greater horror. Its story can be told in two ways: as a drama of decadent excess and tragic flaws, or as an elegy recalling noble promises betrayed by treacherous enemies. Eric D. Weitz's ''Weimar Germany: Promise and Tragedy'' falls squarely into the second category. 
 Weitz, a professor of history at the University of Minnesota, praises the republic's achievements and condemns its murderers: the right-wing businessmen, army officers and civil servants who handed the country over to the Nazis. Together, the respectable and the radical right nourished the toxic lie that Germany lost World War I because it was ''stabbed in the back'' by leftist democrats. Still, the Weimar of this book is not a prelude to Hitler, who barely puts in an appearance. 
 Weitz dispatches the political and economic history of the republic briefly and conventionally, describing its birth amid the trauma of German defeat; the incomplete revolution that created a model democracy but left it to be administered and defended by its enemies; the frightening 1923 hyperinflation that shattered middle-class trust in the government; and the fragile stability that lasted until the United States stock market crash of 1929 triggered the cancellation of American loans, a financial crisis, mass unemployment and dictatorship. 
 The republic's mistake, Weitz argues, was its failure to dispatch its conservative enemies at the beginning. This is a disquieting view because it can lead to the conclusion that the moderation of the German socialists was a mistake, whereas the brutality of the Russian Bolsheviks demonstrated what successful leftists had to do to prevail over their opponents. Weitz, it should be said, does not make this claim. Indeed, he dismisses conservative attempts to blame German Communists for Weimar's demise.
 Among the republic's political and economic achievements were an eight-hour day, unemployment insurance and firm constitutional guarantees of liberty. More famous and controversial was Weimar culture, and Weitz devotes much of his book to some favored highlights. 
 The rapid industrialization and urbanization of perhaps the world's most culturally and scientifically literate society was followed by the blossoming of liberty after the horrors of war. All this gave Weimar a sense of both possibility and crisis, spurring great minds to extraordinary creativity, whether in traditional forms -- Thomas Mann's novel ''The Magic Mountain'' and Martin Heidegger's philosophy -- or in new genres shaped by modern technology and politics -- the architecture of Bruno Taut and Erich Mendelsohn, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's photography, Hannah Hoch's photomontages, Brecht and Weill's revolutionary operas. 
 In his engaging readings of these works, Weitz forgoes abstruse analysis. Instead, he presents them as fresh attempts to make sense of a world in which reliable beliefs about authority and order, class and gender, wealth and poverty, no longer held.
 His most innovative chapter is an imaginary walk through Berlin, observing the daily lives of the city's different classes. Weitz's prose does not sparkle: ''The city authorities noted that the bread was almost unpalatable'' is not the most vivid way of conveying an image of starving children during the war. And Weitz lacks an eye for the telling quotation and a firm grasp of the city's geography. But in his stroll around Weimar's capital he does pull readers into the everyday activities of shop owners and hawkers, patrons of cafes and nightclubs, factory and office workers, prostitutes and beggars, and he is good at showing the impact on daily existence of such new technologies as electric lights and automobiles, subways and central heating.
 Better than most histories, the book connects culture, politics and city life. Modern architecture, for example, is presented as a response to the poor housing conditions of workers, while innovative artistic uses of light and sound are described as expressions of the new urban cacophony. This gives the book a greater breadth than its model, Peter Gay's more elegantly written ''Weimar Culture'' (1968). 
 Afascinating chapter on Weimar's various manifestos of physical beauty and sexual pleasure argues that ''the sex reformers played a central role in making Germany in the Weimar period a more modern, open and humane society,'' especially for women. Although Weitz enumerates conservative misgivings, especially from the churches, he equates fears of debauchery with opposition to democracy. Yet new freedoms could frighten even those who welcomed them. With his belief that ''Weimar did not just collapse; it was killed off,'' he plays down the self-destructive passions unleashed by democracy. People repelled by sexual freedom or by the brutal candor of Expressionist art were not necessarily Nazis, but they were ripe for the picking.
 Despite the book's subtitle, the tragedy of Weimar is not Weitz's story. Instead he invites us to appreciate some of the era's most exhilarating attempts to master the flux of modernity. In the end, Weitz favors the inspiration of Weimar over its drama.

HEADLINE: Classic Ghost Story Keeps Viewers Guessing

BYLINE: By SYLVIANE GOLD

 BODY:
A rich, supercilious mystery man. A spooky old house. Two beautiful but enigmatic children. An innocent, friendless young governess. And plenty of eerie apparitions. What better time than the run-up to Halloween to revive Henry James's classic ghost story, ''The Turn of the Screw,'' and let the shivers fall where they may?
 At the Westport Country Playhouse, they've decided to go with Jeffrey Hatcher's 1996 adaptation, which recasts the novella for two actors and one set. So this ''Turn of the Screw'' is not just timely, it's economical, too -- especially since Mr. Hatcher follows the book's lead in never actually presenting the ghosts. Like James, he leaves it to the audience to decide whether the ectoplasmic visitors actually exist or whether they are the creations of the governess's overheated imagination. 
 This question -- whose answer hardly matters, if you ask me -- has been bandied about since 1898, when ''The Turn of the Screw'' was published, to rapturous if puzzled reviews. James wrote it hoping for a hit, and he gave it many of the trappings of the gothic fiction so popular in his day. In James's variation on the theme, a wealthy, rather odd Londoner hires a naive young woman to care for the orphaned niece and nephew he has no interest in. He has parked them at Bly, his remote country estate, and puts the governess in charge. In no uncertain terms, he instructs her not to bother him with any problems she may encounter. With a setup like that, is there any chance weird things won't be happening when she gets to Bly?
 She arrives to find a sympathetic housekeeper, Mrs. Grose, who warns her to lock her door at night, and the niece, Flora. Those familiar with the book -- or the opera or the movie adaptations or the other stage versions -- will be surprised that in Mr. Hatcher's script, Flora has been traumatized into silence. It's a clever way to put three characters on stage with only two actors: Speechless, Flora can remain invisible to the audience, along with the palatial old manse, the shimmering lake, the distant tower, and that ornery pair of ghosts, the late valet, Peter Quint, and the late governess, Miss Jessel.
 They are not playful, like Casper, or sexy, like Patrick Swayze's Sam. They are the very essence of evil, returned to Bly, the governess fears, to defile the children in some way. Miles, the nephew, may already be tainted. Mrs. Grose takes a boys-will-be-boys attitude, but Miles has been sent home from school for some unspecified ''corruption.''
 What, exactly, does it all amount to? Here's James, quoted in the program: ''It is all obscure and imperfect, the picture, the story, but there is a suggestion of strangely gruesome effect in it.''
 Indeed. Suffice it to say that Charlotte Parry is a sweetly sympathetic governess whose flashes of fire never seem unwarranted or hysterical. Tom Beckett, playing everyone else, doesn't always manage the transitions as well as he might: the narrator and the uncle are fully persuasive; Mrs. Grose, perhaps for obvious reasons, is not. But Mr. Beckett's Miles is about as creepy as a 10-year-old can be. Creepier, even.
 Loy Arcenas designed the spare set and also directed. Aided by the shadowy, suggestive lighting of Robert Wierzel and the period costumes of Candice Donnelly, Mr. Arcenas gets the play efficiently to its cryptic conclusion, fully following the instructions that Mr. Hatcher lays out for directors in the preface to the printed text of his play: ''Give the people something to argue about on the way home.''
 ''The Turn of the Screw,'' Jeffrey Hatcher's adaptation of the Henry James story, is at the Westport Country Playhouse, 25 Powers Court, through Saturday. Information at (203) 227-4177 or www.westportplayhouse.org.

HEADLINE: No Room for Homeless Families

 BODY:
New York has taken an especially harsh turn in its homeless policy: it is now refusing emergency overnight shelter to certain families who have no place else to go. The city says some were abusing the system. Even if that is true, the remedy punishes too many families in desperate need and the city should discontinue it immediately. 
 Under a previous policy, the city granted emergency, one-night shelter to families who were turned down for longer-term benefits -- usually because the city believed they could stay with a friend or relative -- as long as they presented themselves at the processing office after 5 p.m. 
 No longer. The city has decided that too many families were abusing the system by showing up on consecutive nights. Such families are now on their own, but so are those with legitimate needs for shelter.
 In the first week of enforcement this month, eight families were turned away. Several took refuge on the floor of St. Ann's Episcopal Church, located near the city's emergency assistance office in the South Bronx, and one family spent a night in a hospital emergency room. Considering the scope of the problem of homeless families -- some 9,500, an all-time high, use the shelter system every night -- there is reason to believe that more families will be left in the cold as overnight emergency refuge is routinely refused.
 Emergency accommodations were granted about 75 times a month in 2006, then jumped last summer to nearly 800 a month. The spike should not have shocked city officials, especially in light of figures showing New York housing costs in the same period rising more than in any other major city in the nation. The city's response was aimed at stopping freeloaders. But it doesn't address the larger problem, and we really wonder how many families out there are willing to endure a hellish nightly ritual, with parents and children towing possessions and waiting to be bused to a temporary bed for a few short hours of rest. Further, as the number of homeless families has soared, the administration has not budged on the one strategy that showed success in the past: giving homeless families federal Section 8 housing. Mr. Bloomberg abandoned the practice three years ago.
 The Department of Homeless Services claims some success in getting about 80 homeless families and individuals a week into apartments and out of the shelter system. It might help if the department did not have such stringent time limits and attached fewer strings. Families must show economic improvement during the first year of rental assistance if they are to be considered for a second year. Even with a lot of hard work and luck, that's an unreachable goal for many people. 
 As for the new policy on emergency shelter, there may well be families with suitable alternatives, but in a city with a housing squeeze, that number is dwindling, and the administration should recognize that.
 The Bloomberg administration deserves credit for trying new approaches to a thorny problem. But it is wrong to apply a simple solution to a complex situation; these troubled families often reflect a nightmare of lost jobs, illnesses and bad breaks.
 For these people, the city should have a change of heart, and let them sleep easier, if only for one night.

HEADLINE: For the Return Trip, a Dose of Irish Heritage

BYLINE: By JULI S. CHARKES

 BODY:
Yonkers 
 WRINKLING her freckled nose in concentration, Brianna Kelly fixed her blue eyes on her instructor and considered the question before her.
 ''Cen aois thu?'' her teacher, Ailbhe Ni Ghearbhuigh, asked in Gaelic as she leaned in with an encouraging lift of her eyebrows.
 The translation: ''How old are you?'' 
 ''Ta me ocht bliana d'aois,'' the 8-year-old Brianna said in a tentative whisper before breaking into a wide grin as her teacher smiled and nodded in approval.
 Thousands of miles from Ireland, at the Aisling Irish Community Center on McLean Avenue in Yonkers, American-born children are nurturing a piece of their heritage: learning Irish dance, listening to Irish music and practicing the Irish language. The goal, the center's organizers say, is not only to familiarize youngsters with their ancestral background, but to address a trend among Irish immigrants: More are returning home, and when they do, their American-born children need to assimilate into an educational system where the Gaelic language is mandatory in public elementary schools.
 ''I know she has fun here, but it is a relief to know that these classes will help her on a practical level,'' said Philomena B. Kelly, Brianna's mother, adding that she and her husband, natives of County Louth, plan to move from Tuckahoe back to Ireland in the next two years, this time to County Monaghan.
 Keeping up with language and arts requirements can put a child at a distinct advantage, said Thomas W. Ihde, director of the City University of New York's Institute for Irish-American Studies at Lehman College in the Bronx, which provides classes in Irish language and culture and helps place instructors at Irish institutes in Manhattan, New Jersey and Westchester. 
 Most Irish have at least a rudimentary knowledge of their native language, but in recent years, ''interest in the Irish language has become stronger than ever,'' the Irish-born Dr. Ihde said, pointing to cultural trends like the growth of ''Gaelscoileanna,'' schools where the entire curriculum is taught in Gaelic, as well as the popularity of an all-Irish-language television channel, TG4. ''There is a sort of cultural revival of the Irish language right now.''
 That revival is, in part, a reaction to the flow of immigrants from other countries flocking to benefit from Ireland's booming economy. The trend has reached communities like the one around McLean Avenue that were popular destinations for thousands of Irish immigrants, legal and otherwise, in the 1980s and '90s. 
 ''There are now more Irish returning home than leaving,'' said Deirdre Cullen, senior statistician with the Irish Census, in a telephone interview from Dublin. Based on figures from the 2006 census, Ms. Cullen said there were approximately 50,000 more immigrants entering Ireland than leaving, almost double from the 2002 figures, which had approximately 26,000 more entering than leaving.
 In Yonkers, there were nearly 3,000 Irish-born residents in 2000, but their numbers had fallen to an estimated 2,000 in 2006, according to United States census figures compiled by the sociology department at Queens College.
 ''There has definitely been a shift in terms of families going back,'' said Orla Kelleher, executive director of the Aisling Center. Although she declined to provide a breakdown of attendees for a recent Saturday language session -- still spare, but expected to grow to the dozen or so children she said attended in years past -- parents of two of the four students in attendance said they were planning to move back to Ireland.
 Aisling offers Irish dance and music classes during weekday afternoons. The Irish language course, which costs $100 for an eight-week session, is held Saturday mornings and is based on the same curriculum utilized in the Irish public school system.
 Language, music and arts are interwoven through all the classes to help reinforce learning. While Ms. Ghearbhuigh, who is volunteering at Aisling, was helping the small group of children navigate their way through the first day of language classes, there was a larger crowd of nine youngsters downstairs clad in ''Ghillies'' and bubble socks warming up as their Irish step-dance instructor, Deirdre T. O'Mara, counted in Gaelic. ''Aon Do, Tri, Ceathair, Cuig, Se ... '' 
 Ms. Deirdre repeated. ''Who can count with me?''
 Not all attendees on a recent Saturday morning intend to move to Ireland. Stephen O. Kerrigan, of South Salem, enrolled his daughter, Fiona, 7, in the Gaelic class so she would have an understanding of where her grandparents came from. ''These classes provide a cultural connection, regardless of direct lineage,'' he said. 
 In addition, Mr. Kerrigan said, knowing Gaelic helps his daughter in competitive Irish dance.
 The best cultural intentions are not always met with enthusiasm, however. Ms. Kelly, for example, said that her 17-year-old daughter, Christina, born and raised in the United States, plans to attend college here. By contrast, her younger sister, Brianna, nodded and giggled when asked whether she looked forward to wearing a uniform and being with other Irish schoolgirls.
 That, of course, is the point of the Gaelic lessons. Orla Clancy, 12, moved to Loughrea, in County Galway, with her family last summer, after living in Westchester for 11 years. In a telephone interview from Ireland, her mother, Mary Clancy, a former executive at PepsiCo, credited Orla's easy assimilation into the public school system with the language and dance classes she took at Aisling. 
 ''Having done Irish in New York at the weekends made the transition so much easier,'' she said. ''The foundation she received proved itself true.''

HEADLINE: After 50 Years, Still No Time for Cheap Sentiment

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
MOST directors do not go on to make one of their best films after receiving their lifetime achievement Oscars. But then, most directors do not have the near-legendary stamina and efficiency of Sidney Lumet, who accepted his honorary Academy Award two years ago, turned 83 in June and now has made 44 features in 50 years. (By his standards he has slowed down a little. For the first 40 years of his career he was averaging one movie a year.) 
 Mr. Lumet's first feature, ''12 Angry Men'' (1957), earned him an Oscar nomination for directing. His latest, a bracingly bleak crime melodrama called ''Before the Devil Knows You're Dead'' (set to open Friday), has been upstaging filmmakers less than half his age on the festival circuit this fall. 
 In the years between, his remarkably varied resume has matched quantity with quality and eluded easy classification. While slipping from one genre to another he has remained very much a New York filmmaker, not just in his preferred locations but also in his politics, his temperament and his work ethic. 
 This is a natural moment for retrospection, given Mr. Lumet's age, the robustness of his latest film and the enduring relevance of his sizable body of work. Lumetian descendants abound on television (any number of procedural dramas) and at the multiplex (''Michael Clayton,'' to name just one current movie). He recently participated in onstage conversations at film festivals in New York, Toronto and Deauville, France, and he is the subject of a tribute by the Museum of the Moving Image at TheTimesCenter in Manhattan on Thursday. 
 But while he's visibly pleased by the attention, he prefers to leave the reminiscing to others. ''I'm sick of hearing myself talk,'' he said in a recent interview in his office on the Upper West Side. ''I don't know if people believe me, but I never rewatch my own movies.''
 Such modesty is in keeping with Mr. Lumet's directorial personality. While his best films are by no means devoid of character -- they often have a jabbing vigor, a convincing sense of messy urban life -- there remains in his work a cumulative humility, a tacit insistence that style should emerge organically from narrative, and that the best technique is invisible. ''I hate any style if you can spot it,'' he said, adding that in most of his films, ''I don't think there's a visual style, because I try very hard to find the visual style that story needs.'' 
 If Mr. Lumet has a specialty, it is in depicting the workings of social institutions. He has made richly textured portraits of police culture and corruption (''Serpico,'' 1973; ''Prince of the City,'' 1981; ''Q&A,'' 1990) and a series of gripping courtroom dramas, from ''12 Angry Men'' to ''The Verdict'' (1982) to more recent work like ''100 Centre Street'' (a 2001 TV series) and ''Find Me Guilty'' (2006). 
 Although he is a decade or two older than the major figures of the New Hollywood, he is often associated with that mythologized period, thanks to the consensus classics ''Dog Day Afternoon'' (1975) and ''Network'' (1976). But his career is also full of rewarding tangents and byways, from the early theatrical adaptations (''The Fugitive Kind,'' 1959; ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' 1962) to the Reagan-era expressions of leftist frustration (''Daniel,'' 1983; ''Running on Empty,'' 1988). 
 One thing that has stayed consistent is Mr. Lumet's unsentimental streak, which has perhaps never been given fuller voice than in his new film. ''Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,'' no one's idea of a gentle autumnal reverie, is an old man's film only in the sense that its maker is in effortless control of his craft and attacking the material with no inhibitions or apologies. 
 The movie complicates familiar noir dynamics by confining them to a domestic sphere. Two brothers -- one a drug-addicted, status-obsessed executive (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the other a down-and-out divorced father (Ethan Hawke) -- hatch a scheme as outlandish as it is desperate. Envisioning a victimless crime, they decide to hold up their parents' strip-mall jewelry store, a plan that inevitably unravels, propelling the film into the realm of Oedipal tragedy. 
 Working from a script by Kelly Masterson, a first-time screenwriter, Mr. Lumet was careful to adhere to the rules of melodrama. ''In a well-written drama the story comes out of the characters, and in a well-written melodrama, the characters come out of the story,'' he said. ''The first obligation is to the story. It's something I warned the actors about. I said, 'Listen, I may need to ask you for a climax here that you may not feel, because the nature of the plot demands it.''' 
 Mr. Lumet said he revised the script. It was his idea to make the protagonists brothers, and he also added an opening scene, a sexually candid hotel-room idyll with Mr. Hoffman and Marisa Tomei that haunts the rest of the film. At a New York Film Festival press conference last month Mr. Lumet said he'd had no contact with the screenwriter and referred -- incorrectly -- to Kelly Masterson as a woman. Mr. Masterson later sent him a note, Mr. Lumet said, pointing out that they met during the shoot. 
 ''I sent back a conciliatory note,'' he said. ''I told him I wouldn't remember if my mother was on the set. When I'm working, I'm there.'' 
 Unusually for a Lumet film ''Before the Devil'' darts back and forth in time to highlight the points of view of different characters. But true to form for Mr. Lumet it is also full of indelible, vanity-free performances and, perhaps not coincidentally, populated with theater actors, from Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Hawke (whom Mr. Lumet knew primarily from their stage roles) to Michael Shannon and Brian F. O'Byrne (doing razor-sharp character-actor work) to the veterans Albert Finney and Rosemary Harris (who play the parents). 
 Mr. Lumet's track record with actors speaks for itself. He has guided 17 performers (including Al Pacino, Katharine Hepburn, Paul Newman, Faye Dunaway and Ingrid Bergman) to Oscars or nominations. He was himself a child actor in the New York Yiddish theater and later a member of the fabled Group Theater. Most of the actors he has worked with, he said, ''feel like they're in sympathetic hands but without being indulged.''
 He makes a point of not getting too personal. ''Elia Kazan used to really try to get inside the head and psyche of everybody he worked with,'' he said. ''I'm the exact opposite school. I don't like to get involved.'' He added, ''And I try not to work with lunatics.'' 
 Mr. Lumet, who said he does not believe that overfamiliarity with the material can dampen an actor's instincts, always insists on a rigorous rehearsal period (four weeks on the new film). 
 ''The rehearsal for this film was far more intense than the shoot,'' Mr. Hawke said in a recent telephone interview. ''Sidney knows how to create an environment where acting can thrive.'' 
 Still, Mr. Lumet's reputation as an ''actor's director,'' though accurate, has made it easy to overlook the subtle classicism and throwback efficiency of his technique, which he outlined in his congenial, common-sensical 1995 book, ''Making Movies,'' a memoir in the pragmatic guise of an instructional text. During rehearsals he is not merely fine-tuning the performances but also working out the cinematography.
 As Peter Bogdanovich notes in ''Who the Devil Made It,'' his book of interviews with directors, Mr. Lumet is the rare filmmaker who, to use the industry jargon, ''cuts in the camera'': he knows how a sequence will be edited before he arrives on the set. Consequently he shoots fewer takes than the average director and is known for coming in under budget and ahead of schedule. 
 ''I'd never seen anything like it,'' Mr. Hawke said of Mr. Lumet's speed and economy. ''I sometimes felt like there was another crew on the other side of the city doing the same script, and we were racing them. I did two takes on some of the biggest scenes in the movie.'' 
 For Mr. Lumet the emphasis on preparation and the constant forward motion come from the mind-set of theater and live television (he directed numerous episodes for CBS in the early 1950s). ''It's the idea that there's always next week, we're always concentrated on the one coming up,'' he said. 
 His attentions already have shifted to his 45th film, called ''Getting Out,'' from his original screenplay, which he hopes to start shooting in January. (''It's based on something I read in the paper 30 years ago,'' he said, declining to elaborate.)
 Mr. Lumet's aversion to nostalgia is apparent whatever the topic of conversation. He refuses to be wistful about the changing city that he has so vividly captured on film. ''If you can't get that block with cobblestones on Greene Street, I'll bet I can find it in Red Hook,'' he said. 
 There is also his wholehearted embrace of digital video. He discovered the high-definition format while working on ''100 Centre Street'' and has used it on two features. ''In five more years there won't be film,'' he said. ''And I'm fine with that.'' He loves the ''naturalism'' of video and the ease of using multiple cameras (a liberation for the actors). What's more, he said, ''any style you can get in film you can get in video now.'' 
 While Mr. Lumet is in a position to take the long view, he refuses to do so. For this consummate workaholic, the only moment that matters is the present. ''People say the '70s were a golden age for movies or the '50s were a golden age for television,'' he said. ''I'm happy to know I was part of them, but I didn't know those periods were golden.''

Don't Raise Taxes. Instead, Set Priorities.
 To the Editor:
 ''Still a Bad Idea'' (editorial, Oct. 14) sharply criticizes a Republican proposal to require a supermajority to raise taxes or create new taxes. You allude to the need to raise more revenue, and imply that increasing taxes might be required in the future. 
 The fact is that New Jersey taxpayers simply cannot afford higher taxes. If some project (like repairing bridges) is truly worthy, why can't we prioritize our spending and cut less worthy programs to provide the needed financing? 
 New Jersey just cannot afford everything! 
 Joseph A. Iwanski Red Bank
 To the Editor:
 I agree that it is shortsighted for New Jersey Republicans to use the proposal of a supermajority requirement for taxation during the campaign season. 
 As any astute watcher of the news knows, things can change quickly, needs change, and it is important to have the flexibility to meet those future needs, particularly if it involves using whatever fiscal measures the government can to best deal with the problem. 
 Voters know a campaign scheme when they see one. Perhaps Republicans should deal with more substantive public policy issues from now until Election Day. 
 Steven M. Clayton Ocean
 The writer is a Democratic committeeman in Monmouth County.
 To the Editor:
 I strongly disagree with your pro-tax-and-spend position. Over the last 15 years, members of the New Jersey Legislature, both Democrats and Republicans, have been fiscally irresponsible. While New Jersey's economy was growing, they saw fit to outspend that growth and failed to balance the budget. 
 I, for one, am fully supportive of any initiative that will bring the New Jersey government to its knees! Maybe by that time the Legislature will wake up and address New Jersey's fiscal problems in a responsible manner. 
 Until that time, the crushing debt should keep our legislative members in line.

 For a Renewed Paterson, Put Kids Before Contracts
 To the Editor: 
 Peter A. Tirri, president of the Paterson teachers' union, did not once talk in his Oct. 7 letter about the children of Paterson and their needs. 
 As a community leader, I am concerned that the power of the educational establishment appears to be trumping an effective commitment to improving the quality of education for our children. 
 For once, Paterson has a superintendent who represents the community and is committed to the welfare of our children. Dr. Michael E. Glascoe not only talks about our children and their future, he also diligently works to create the opportunities they need to succeed. 
 It is disturbing that we cannot seem to count on our political or union leadership to partner with us. Where we see children's futures, they see contracts. Our children are being used as pawns. 
 If Paterson is to renew itself and its educational system, this must stop. That is why we are organizing, to speak truth to power. 
 (Rev.) David B. Wolf Paterson
 The writer is president of St. Paul's Community Development Corporation.
 Where Is the Plan for Affordable Housing?
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Paralysis on Affordable Housing'' (editorial, Sept. 30): 
 Building homes that workers can afford is key to reviving New Jersey's economy. But Gov. Jon S. Corzine's delivery has, so far, fallen short of his promise to build or preserve 100,000 homes affordable to lower-income residents over 10 years. We were told we'd see a plan to achieve that goal by the end of 2006. Now 2007 is nearly over, and there's still no plan. 
 As we and other housing advocates have told the governor and his staff, there are numerous no-cost and low-cost actions they could take today to boost production and preservation of affordable housing. 
 We are hopeful the situation will improve now that Joseph V. Doria Jr. is the new commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs. But meeting the state's affordable housing needs will also require the governor's leadership to ensure it is a priority across all departments.

SUPERCAPITALISM 
 The Transformation of Business, Democracy, and Everyday Life. 
 By Robert Reich. 
 272 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25. 
 When news first leaked out that presidents of some elite universities were being paid more than a million dollars a year, many people accused university boards of having lost their moral compass. Was it an outrage, as these critics believed, for nonprofit organizations to compensate their executives so handsomely? 
 The trustees who recruited David J. Skorton as Cornell's 12th president last year knew that his most important responsibility would be to head the university's recently announced $4 billion capital campaign. The trustees identified several candidates they felt would succeed in reaching that goal. But none could have handled the task nearly as well as Skorton, they eventually decided, and, having seen him in that role during the past year, I find it easy to agree. Skorton, a man of great warmth and charm, is a distinguished research cardiologist and an accomplished jazz musician. He is also extremely funny. Alumni adore him, and if his compellingly articulated vision of the university's future persuades them to donate only 3 percent more than the next-best candidate would have, he will have boosted the university's endowment by more than $100 million. 
 I don't know how much Cornell pays Skorton. But I do know that leaders of his stature are in short supply. Because every university wants a Skorton, it is quixotic to imagine he could have been hired on the cheap. 
 The supply of moral outrage is limited. When we aim it at the wrong targets, we squander a valuable resource. In ''Supercapitalism,'' Robert B. Reich argues that the current political debate in the United States is drowning in misdirected moral outrage. We cannot hope to solve our problems, he says, without first understanding the forces that have caused them. 
 Reich, a public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and formerly President Clinton's secretary of labor, is quick to concede that rising inequality, environmental degradation and a dysfunctional health care system are problems worth worrying about. But he argues that social critics are wrong to attribute them to increased greed and corruption. Today's corporate and political leaders are no different, he says, from their earlier counterparts. What has changed is that new technology has made the economic environment dramatically more competitive. 
 As Adam Smith first described clearly, individuals who pursue only their own narrow interests in a competitive system often inadvertently create widespread social gains. But not always. Unlike many of his modern disciples, Smith was keenly aware of the invisible hand's limitations. Individual and social interests often diverge, he realized, and in such cases, greater competition makes matters worse. If a firm can cut costs by removing the filter from its smokestack, for example, it will feel greater pressure to do so when competition intensifies. 
 If our social ills are indeed rooted in increased competition, our only recourse, Reich argues, is to change the rules. Denouncing greed is simply wasted energy. If we want less inequality, we must make taxes more progressive. If we want cleaner air and water, we must adopt more stringent environmental laws. 
 Reich's narrative begins with his account of the ''not quite golden age'' -- roughly, the three decades following World War II -- in which limited competition enabled large companies to earn high profits. High profits, in turn, enabled unions to bargain for high wages and benefits. Legislators, who were less influenced by corporate cash in those days, passed laws in the public interest.
 Things changed when the Internet and other new communications and transportation technologies enabled the economy's most able producers to extend their reach. Many established firms were swept away. 
 At about the same time, financial deregulation increased the influence of capital markets on corporate behavior. Wall Street's message to chief executives was ''Slash your payrolls or we'll buy your company and hire someone who will.''
 Reich notes that consumers and investors have profited handsomely from these developments. Wal-Mart may offer its employees low wages and benefits and squeeze its suppliers to do likewise. But it also offers extremely low prices. Investment managers may pressure corporations to lay workers off, but they also generate robust returns for their clients.
 As citizens, however, we have fared less well. Competition has driven salaries of the best performers in every sector to unparalleled heights, while the incomes of all others have stagnated. Today's more competitive environment has also made it harder for us to insulate ourselves from risks, especially those related to health and employment security. Some 47 million Americans now lack health insurance, up seven million since 2000.
 Why hasn't government stepped in? Again, Reich fingers greater competition as the culprit. Once some companies discovered they could gain an edge by influencing government decisions in their favor, rivals had little choice but to join the fray. And once some candidates began altering their votes to attract contributions, others faced strong pressure to follow suit. Reich documents in lurid detail the explosive growth of corporate lobbying expenditures and campaign contributions since the 1970s.
 Can other institutions assume government's abandoned role? Reich thinks not. Reliance on voluntary ''corporate social responsibility,'' he argues persuasively, is a pale substitute for effective laws against corporate misconduct. The only remedy, he concludes, is to purge corporate cash from the political system. This, of course, will be a tall order. 
 But because attempts to buy influence are often mutually offsetting, there is hope. Microsoft lobbies Congress to inhibit Google, only to prompt costly retaliation from Google. One legislator sells his vote, only to see rivals promise even greater favors. Because the process resembles a wasteful military arms race, astute political leaders ought to be able to persuade warring factions to sign an arms-control agreement. 
 Reich probably doesn't expect any such agreement in the waning months of the Bush administration. But today's presidential candidates should study his message carefully. ''Keeping supercapitalism from spilling over into democracy,'' he writes, ''is the only constructive agenda for change.'' All else is ''frolic and detour.'' 
 ''Supercapitalism'' is a grand debunking of the conventional wisdom in the style of John Kenneth Galbraith. Like Galbraith, Reich will draw fire from economists for some of the details of his argument. I think he misses the mark, for example, in saying that economies of scale are less important than in the 1950s. Now, as then, giving consumers more product variety means smaller production runs with higher unit costs. And because wealthier customers demand greater variety, production runs are indeed often smaller than before. But firms can still cut their unit costs by expanding their markets, just as in the 1950s, and heightened competition creates more pressure than ever to do so. 
 For present purposes, nothing of importance hinges on that point. Indeed, the main thrust of Reich's argument is right on target. Those who seize their opportunities in highly competitive environments tend to survive and prosper. ''To confuse greed with opportunity,'' he writes, ''is to confound desire with availability.''
 It's often useful to get angry when things aren't going well. But moral outrage is counterproductive unless directed at the right targets. By focusing our attention on those who continue to block effective campaign finance reform, Reich shows that he can spot a worthy target when he sees one.

HEADLINE: Don't Get Mad. Get to Work.

 BODY:
New York's legislators are expected to make a rare appearance in the state Capitol this week. What they will actually accomplish given the constant feuding between Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Republicans who run the State Senate is anybody's guess. Talk to either side and the usual hot air turns to steam. Truth is, though, most New Yorkers no longer give a hoot about this spat. What they really want to know is whether Albany cares a hoot about them. So here are a few assignments for lawmakers when they return, ever so briefly, to address the state's business. 
 For starters, the Assembly should stop holding up the entire garbage disposal plan for New York City because a few members don't want a marine transfer station on Gansevoort pier in Manhattan. The three people standing in the way are Deborah Glick, Richard Gottfried and Linda Rosenthal, all Assembly members from Manhattan.
 It is time for this threesome to move out of the way and for Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, to make certain that other neighborhoods do not suffer because of them. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker, and other city officials made it clear last week that there is plenty of support for the proposal, which would distribute a necessary burden throughout the city and simply asks Manhattan neighborhoods to do their share. Three Assembly members should not be able to kill it.
 The Republicans, meanwhile, seem determined to slow Mr. Spitzer's efforts to reform Albany's anachronistic ways of doing business. The Senate's refusal to approve 87 of the governor's appointments has been particularly unhelpful. A few of these appointees, like the state's economic development commissioner, have been trying to do their jobs despite having to pencil in the word ''acting'' on their business cards. Others, like the trustees of the state university system, have not been able to pick a new chancellor because the Senate has been too petulant to give Mr. Spitzer even a few new faces on the university board.
 O.K. The Democratic governor is irritating and overly combative. O.K. The Republicans in the State Senate are vengeful and overly combative. How many New Yorkers really care? It is time to sit down like adults, and bring in a marriage counselor if necessary. It is time to start passing laws that will promote economic development, give judges a pay raise, and clean up the special-interest money gathered and spent in New York State political campaigns. 
 New York's lawmakers need to stop huffing and puffing and start putting their house in order instead.

HEADLINE: Washington Feels Hollywood's Heat

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON 
 ON an 80-degree morning in mid-October, Senator Barbara Boxer huddled in a windowless conference room in her Capitol Hill office to hear from a group of fashionably dressed Southern California women whose sun-streaked blond hair and unseasonable tans belied a less-than-sunny mission: to push the government to address global warming.
 ''We represent the entertainment community,'' said Kelly Chapman Meyer, whose husband, Ron, is the president of Universal Studios Group. ''We use our resources and our connections to push for environmental issues.''
 ''We want a climate bill that's not going to die,'' said Colleen Bell, a philanthropist and writer whose husband, Bradley, is the executive producer and head writer of the soap opera ''The Bold and the Beautiful.'' 
 Ms. Meyer told Ms. Boxer, a Democrat who is one of her home senators, that warmer weather has intensified climate-related problems in the lapping waves near her house in Malibu. ''I'm a surfer,'' she said. ''The algae bloom is insane.''
 Ms. Boxer said she was working to push climate legislation through the Senate, adding that she also worried about global warming. ''We can see it happening, we can feel it happening,'' she said. ''The fashion industry is so upset because they can't sell their cashmere sweaters.''
 When you are the wife of a movie mogul, you can do more than simply complain about the unusual weather that is wreaking havoc with your favorite surf break. Equipped with a Hollywood aura and impeccable social connections -- not to mention sheaves of data-filled talking points -- you can count on at least 20 minutes' worth of respectful attention in Washington, with legislators willing to throw open their doors for activists who share the last names of some deep-pocketed donors. 
 Which is why a team of eco-wives from the entertainment industry descended on Washington last week, hoping to ride a bit of the momentum from Al Gore's Nobel Peace Prize in a city that can be unusually receptive to Hollywood celebrity, even if it has been deadlocked over environmental legislation this year. 
 The five women -- members of the Leadership Council, which was founded seven years ago by Laurie David, the soon-to-be-ex-wife of Larry David, and Elizabeth Wiatt, whose husband, Jim, is the chief executive of the William Morris Agency -- raced through private meetings with 11 senators and representatives in 29 hours. They argued that the eerily muggy autumn should inspire more than chit-chat in the elevators of Capitol Hill. ''These people have stacks of paper on their desk this thick,'' Ms. Meyer said of the lawmakers, holding her palm at eye level. ''The point is to make sure that we get our agenda at the top of the pile.''
 With their connections and fund-raising abilities, they have a better chance than the average constituent. The fresh-faced, athletic Ms. Meyer is an ardent skier who grew up in Colorado. She is a chairwoman of the 29-member Leadership Council (formerly the Action Forum), an all-star team of greens working the moneyed hillsides of Los Angeles County, from Beverly Hills to Malibu. 
 Besides Ms. Meyer and Ms. Bell, the team included Dayna Kalins Bochco, the president of Steven Bochco Productions (her husband, Steven, is a creator of ''NYPD Blue''), Gwen McCaw (her husband, John, is a telecommunications billionaire), and Linda Stewart, who runs a branding and advertising firm called Cucoloris. (Ms. David was home tending to other matters.)
 Glamour does have the power to open doors in Washington, said T. R. Goldman, a senior editor at Roll Call, who oversees lobbying coverage on Capitol Hill.
 ''Washington has a bit of an insecurity complex when it comes to dealing with Hollywood,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''When confronted by the might of Hollywood, these people listen.'' 
 But some observers roll their eyes when Hollywood tries to muscle its way through Congress. Kenneth P. Green, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said the women are ''entitled to their opinion, but they're laymen, essentially.'' Hollywood, he said, lives far away ''from the economic lives of normal people who don't have drivers and don't get flown on Learjets.'' Would the media, he added, ''be covering it if a group of plumbers came to town?''
 Starting with a 9 a.m. meeting on Wednesday with Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, the women met with 10 congressional Democrats -- including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- and one Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine. They urged quick passage of a bill banning the export of mercury to developing nations, then moved onto the big issue, global warming, arguing for increased fuel efficiency for vehicles and stronger renewable energy provisions in energy bills that are before both houses. 
 On Wednesday morning, Ms. Meyer and Ms. McCaw, a former model, discussed how they would handle being young grandmothers when the children from their husbands' prior marriages had children of their own.
 ''You'll be the hot grandma, I'll be the kind-of-hot grandma,'' Ms. Meyer said.
 An hour later, they were meeting in the Hart Senate Office Building with Michael Morgan, a staff member in the office of Senator Benjamin Cardin, Democrat of Maryland. There, the women made a data-intensive plea for legislation to prevent the American export of mercury to India and China.
 Mr. Morgan listened, looking professorial, then promised to help push a Senate bill. 
 ''We're looking forward to making progress on global warming,'' Mr. Morgan said. ''It's the climate for it -- no pun intended.''
 AROUND 1 p.m., the women settled in for a lunch appetizer of tuna tartare at Charlie Palmer Steak, an upscale restaurant a short cab ride from the Capitol.
 They acknowledged the negative stereotypes applied to upscale Hollywood greens, but said they could live with the sniping. 
 For instance, last year, Ms. Bell opened the Holmby Hills house she shares with her husband and their four children to an ''eco-salon'' attended by John Cusack, Kelly Lynch and Kirsten Dunst.
 Ms. Stewart, for her part, recalls nudging Cameron Diaz toward buying a hybrid, now the car of choice for all the women on the team. 
 ''I pimped my Prius!'' Ms. Bochco added. ''It's got waves on the side, pinstripes and chrome rims that look like cabochon sapphires.''
 Ms. Meyer helped build a showcase house out of sustainable materials called project7ten in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Venice, though the Meyers do not live in it.
 ''You have to understand,'' Ms. Stewart said, ''They live in the most beautiful house in the world.'' 
 And they are fully aware of the stereotype of the Learjet liberal, which is one reason the women said they flew commercially to Washington.
 Ms. McCaw, whose husband owned a jet when they married in 1998, agreed it was a difficult issue. ''If they had airplanes that were solar-powered, we'd fly them,'' she said. Until then, she said they buy carbon offsets.
 After lunch, it was Ms. Meyer's turn to live up to this standard. She had to race to New York to attend a cancer benefit with Brooke Shields that evening. So she eschewed a proper lunch for breadsticks and, she joked, ''a pound of butter.'' 
 Hustling toward a taxi, she smiled wearily and murmured, ''It's not easy being green.''

HEADLINE: Soft Spot for the South Bronx

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD

 BODY:
Henry Lajara is mapping out where to install a rain barrel in his manicured South Bronx backyard, to show his neighbors how they can channel storm water to feed their gardens and keep runoff from flushing sewage into the Bronx River.
 Lenard Ramsook, 20, glides down that river in a wooden boat, teaching local high school students how to row. He shows them the ospreys and leaping fish that share the estuary with concrete plants and expressway bridges, making the point that environmentalism is not just for the rich. 
 Across the South Bronx, residents are beginning cooperatives to create jobs and tend to their communities' social needs and physical health. One will recycle demolition debris. Another sells fruit and vegetables. A third will provide child care for working families. 
 Behind all these projects is a man who has called President Bush ''the devil,'' embraced Iran's firebrand leader as a fellow crusader against ''the U.S. empire,'' and vowed to help the poor and disenfranchised everywhere, even -- or, perhaps, especially -- in the world's most powerful country. 
 That man, Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, began his love affair with the Bronx during a visit in 2005. Since then, he and his socialist government have funneled millions of dollars of aid to the South Bronx, home to New York's poorest Congressional district, through Citgo Petroleum, the American subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company.
 It is an unlikely flow of largess, from an oil-rich South American country where much of the population lives in poverty to one of the neediest pockets in the seat of American capitalism. 
 Citgo started its outreach in 2005 with a 40 percent discount on heating oil for poor households and expanded it in August to finance social and economic development. The company has committed to donating $3.6 million over the next three years to nine Bronx initiatives that would use the money to create jobs, foster community empowerment and clean up the urban environment.
 The program has made Mr. Chavez the talk of the South Bronx.
 ''He came in here and took over -- like a Spanish Napoleon!'' Lucy Martinez said. 
 Ms. Martinez, 57, said Mr. Chavez has helped the needy residents she meets while working the front desk at Nos Quedamos, a nonprofit community development corporation. But she knows, too, that his philanthropy has chafed some American politicians. 
 Patrice White-McGleese, 37, an employment counselor who saved $160 to $300 a month during the past two winters through the discounted oil program, said she knows why Mr. Chavez's actions have rankled.
 ''It's a sore point because it took what most people would consider a third world nation to help the U.S.,'' she said. ''Which is kind of a slap in the face because we're supposed to be one of the superpowers; why can't we help our own?''
 Some people in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, have the same question for their own government, said Leopoldo Lopez, mayor of the downtown district of Chacao and a leader of the Venezuelan opposition.
 ''Why is the government giving away money to the richest city in the world?'' he asked.
 Mr. Lopez said Mr. Chavez should first tend to the needs of Venezuelans who lack shelter, sewage and drinking water. 
 He said Mr. Chavez was giving the money to the Bronx to win support around the world while distracting attention from his moves to crack down on the opposition at home. 
 So the program has made Bronx residents, who are trying to solve the most local of problems, party to a global dispute. They are caught between Mr. Chavez, who markets his populist platform as a counterweight to the worldwide influence of the United States, and the Bush administration, which contends that Mr. Chavez's stress on racial and economic equality masks a dictatorship-in-the-making. 
 Mr. Chavez began clashing with Venezuela's corporate leaders and the United States shortly after being elected in 1998. In 2002, military officers staged a coup to oust him. The Bush administration quickly recognized the new government. But Mr. Chavez returned to office days later after a wave of street protests, and he accused the United States of aiding the coup.
 He turned his attentions to the Bronx in the fall of 2005, when he visited South Bronx community organizers with Representative Jose E. Serrano, the Democrat who represents the district. Those meetings led to the discounted heating oil program. 
 By the winter of 2006-7, the program had doubled to deliver 100 million gallons to 1.2 million people from Alaska to Vermont. Citgo said it expected to supply 110 million gallons this winter. 
 Some recipients bridled in September 2006, when Mr. Chavez stepped up to a United Nations podium -- one that President Bush had used the day before -- and declared that he smelled traces of ''the devil.''
 ''It smells of sulfur still today,'' Mr. Chavez added.
 Said Mr. Serrano: ''Was it tacky? Yes.'' But, he said, Mr. Chavez was just being emotional.
 Meanwhile, Citgo and Venezuelan officials made follow-up visits to the Bronx. During one of them, Mrs. White-McGleese said she wanted to thank Venezuelans for their generosity. Within weeks, in April 2006, she and 62 people who had received the discounted oil were on a plane to Caracas as Mr. Chavez's guests. 
 A band met them at the airport. They watched an African-Venezuelan dance performance. And they visited Mr. Chavez at Miraflores Palace, the president's official residence. A few of the American guests -- including Pamela Babb, a vice president of the Mount Hope Housing Company, a nonprofit group that provides low-income housing in the Bronx -- appeared on Mr. Chavez's weekly television show.
 ''It was pomp and circumstance,'' said Ms. Babb, 47.
 She said she remained suspicious of Mr. Chavez's efforts to expand his presidential powers. (''I question that,'' she said.) And a Mount Hope tenant, Lenice Footman, noticed children playing in garbage on Caracas's streets and came away ''grateful for what we have.'' 
 But many of them were impressed when a Philadelphia woman told Mr. Chavez of the lack of jobs and services in her neighborhood and the Venezuelan leader declared it was time to aid development in poor United States communities. 
 ''And all these ministers started writing things down,'' Ms. Babb said. ''It shows you what happens when a visionary person starts to do something. And I was there.''
 Ms. Babb said Citgo officials visit the Bronx more often than the other corporate donors she works with. They have asked community groups what kinds of grants they need, awarding one to Mount Hope for a child care cooperative. And they celebrated with the locals in Hunts Point Riverside Park over Venezuelan food -- arepas and carne mechada -- and Latin American music. 
 The Citgo donations are a tiny percentage of its annual budget. It does not have to disclose financial statements because it is not a publicly traded company. Citgo, which sold 25.1 billion gallons of petroleum products last year, estimates that last winter's oil program cost it $80 million, according to a Citgo document provided by Bernardo Alvarez Herrera, the Venezuelan ambassador to the United States.
 That is about the same amount that Exxon Mobil -- the largest publicly traded oil company, with roughly 10 times the revenue of Citgo -- reported spending on philanthropy in the United States in 2006.
 ''We are not trying to impose,'' Mr. Alvarez said, ''or to intervene in the politics here.''
 United States petroleum industry officials are not happy, however, with Citgo's program.
 It is ''designedto embarrass us,'' Larry Goldstein, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, an industry-supported analysis group in New York, said when it was launched in 2005.
 ''It's not designed to help poor people,'' he said. ''Chavez is astute, clever, with a major political agenda, largely to get under our skin, and he does that everywhere and anywhere he can.''
 On the ground, Citgo's money seems to come without strings -- or even much branding. 
 At Rocking the Boat, the Bronx River education program, Mr. Ramsook, who left behind a fisherman's life when he moved to the Bronx from Trinidad, said he could not place Mr. Chavez's name. ''It sounds familiar,'' he said. He was more enthusiastic about taking seniors from Bronx Guild High School on the water to learn the history of the river.
 ''There's no sharks, right?'' asked Shawnisha Roebuck, 19, as she settled into the stern. On shore, an iron claw lifted metal scraps from one pile to another. But on the river, gulls stalked the banks, and the movements of small fish made the water flicker. An osprey plunged to the water, but came up empty. 
 Citgo's $210,000, three-year grant has allowed the group to expand the high school program and hold free Saturday rowing lessons that have drawn 500 people since August. 
 A $230,000 grant is helping Youth Ministries for Peace and Justice build rain barrels, plant rooftop vegetation and reshape gutters to feed sidewalk trees. And the South Bronx Food Co-operative will use its $49,000 to open a storefront to sell affordable produce. 
 Anna Vincenty of Nos Quedamos, who is working on a program to improve the diets of elderly residents, said she takes Mr. Chavez's good will, like she does with all politicians, with a grain of salt. 
 ''He says he wants to help people over here,'' she said. Yet her Venezuelan friends have told her that ''some of the people over there are afraid of him.''
 On the other hand, she said, in the United States, ''one of the most generous countries in the whole world,'' pervasive inequality is on display. 
 But no matter what one thinks of Mr. Chavez, she said: ''If your child is cold and hungry and someone offers to help, do you care if it's Moe or Larry or Curly? I don't think so.''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 27, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about environmental and economic development projects in the South Bronx financed by Citgo Petroleum, the American subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, gave an incorrect amount in some editions for discounted heating oil delivered to Americans last winter, and the amount it expects to deliver this winter. It delivered 100 million gallons, not 100,000, last winter, and plans to deliver 110 million gallons, not 110,000, this winter. Picture captions in one edition misidentified a man shown watering a rooftop garden in the South Bronx and standing with other members of a community group that received financing from Citgo Petroleum. He is Stephen Oliveira, not Henry Lajara.
Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about environmental and economic development projects in the South Bronx financed by Citgo Petroleum, the American subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, included an outdated name and location in some editions for an industry-supported analysis group that criticized the program in 2005. Then known as the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation and located in New York, it is now the Energy Policy Research Foundation, located in Washington.

HEADLINE: With Gusto, Spitzer's Back On the Attack

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
Drawing on the words of theologians, Gov. Eliot Spitzer two months ago promised a new humility, acknowledging that his administration's thirst for battle had led to mistakes.
 Mr. Spitzer, stung by a report that found his aides had used the State Police to tarnish a political rival, said he would continue to debate his foes, but with respect. He would pursue an ambitious agenda, but do so with ''constant soul-searching.''
 But humble pie just does not suit this governor. 
 With his job approval at its lowest point since he arrived in Albany -- 41 percent, according to a recent Siena College poll -- Mr. Spitzer has shifted his tone once again, taking the offensive and pouncing on opponents. 
 ''Zealiot,'' as one online commentator has dubbed him, is back.
 ''My slogan last year was 'Bring some passion back to Albany,' and I believed it then and I believe it now,'' Mr. Spitzer said in an interview on Wednesday at his Manhattan office. ''I'm not going to shy away from going at it with all the gusto possible, whether it's the D.M.V. issue, or health care or economic development, changing the way business is done.
 ''That's what people want from me,'' he said. ''That's why they sent me there.''
 Two weeks ago, with scant consultation with other Democrats or the Legislature, Mr. Spitzer announced that the state would allow illegal immigrants to apply for driver's licenses. 
 The plan set off widespread opposition; 72 percent of New Yorkers are against the policy, according to a Siena poll. Critics have branded the governor ''Illegal Eliot'' and called him ''weak-kneed'' and ''treacherous.''
 The attacks have clearly rekindled Mr. Spitzer's fighting spirit. But the driver's license issue has surprised many Democratic lawmakers, even those sympathetic to the governor, and made them uneasy. They fear that his aggressive push may damage the party's prospects in 2008. 
 ''We've been to hell,'' said Assemblyman J. Gary Pretlow, a Westchester Democrat, talking about life with the governor. ''Are we coming back?''
 In interviews, the governor and his advisers suggested that there is little to be gained in remaining apologetic, and now see an opportunity to reinforce Mr. Spitzer's campaign pledge to upend the way business has been done in Albany. The core of Mr. Spitzer's appeal, which led to a landslide victory, was his tough-guy demeanor, they said.
 ''The public got what the public should have anticipated, knowing that I was going to push very hard, there would be pushback,'' Mr. Spitzer said. 
 Concerning the fight over driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, he said: ''Now we're back in the world which I do relish, which is having good debates about policy, and you win some, you lose some. I don't expect to win every one of these debates, but we're going to push the agenda.'' 
 The governor rejects the criticism from Democrats who say he should have worked harder to sell the driver's license plan to the public, rather than simply imposing it.
 ''Contentious issues never appear to have a good time to be rolled out,'' Mr. Spitzer said.
 Fellow Democrats were elated when Mr. Spitzer won, but they have wearied of saying that he needs to play nice in the political sandbox. Some also worry that his staff has too many former prosecutors and that the governor has been unwilling to fire members of his inner circle. Certainly, the governor's first 10 months have not lacked for drama.
 Early on, he enraged the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, by poaching a Republican senator, Michael A. L. Balboni, for his cabinet, and then campaigning for the Democratic candidate in a special election to replace him -- a breach of Albany protocol. 
 Mr. Spitzer angered Assembly Democrats with his blistering criticism after they picked one of their own, Thomas P. DiNapoli, as comptroller to replace Alan G. Hevesi, who resigned. And in a much-recounted January phone call with the Assembly Republican leader James N. Tedisco, the governor referred to himself as ''a [expletive] steamroller.'' 
 Mr. Bruno and Mr. Spitzer have had numerous run-ins. Those tensions exploded in July when Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo released a report saying that the governor's staff had improperly used the State Police to gather information about Mr. Bruno's use of state aircraft. More recently, P. David Soares, the Albany County district attorney, rejected the notion that Mr. Spitzer's office had plotted against Mr. Bruno. 
 The two men no longer speak.
 ''Bruno thinks he's been a disaster as a governor, and I don't think that's a secret,'' said Mr. Bruno's spokesman, John E. McArdle. ''The people who voted for him have real buyer's remorse.''
 Some of the governor's allies now worry that little will get done in Albany until the election in November 2008. A special session next week will offer a test of whether the governor and lawmakers can reach consensus on issues they have been negotiating for months, from campaign finance reform to pay raises for judges and legislators. 
 Asked about his priorities during the interview on Wednesday, the governor said his top agenda item was simply to get the Senate Republicans to approve the scores of administration appointments they had held up for months. 
 ''We need people confirmed,'' he said. ''That's just a matter of keeping the government running.''
 Mr. Spitzer is actively working to win back the Senate next fall for the first time in four decades. Many Democrats fear that his war with Mr. Bruno, who is facing a federal investigation into his outside business interests, will stall Mr. Spitzer's agenda for his first two years in office. 
 ''I really don't know what his strategy is,'' Mr. Pretlow said. ''There's nothing wrong with standing on principle, but when you have to come to consensus with other individuals of various ilks, you have to back down a bit.''
 Rory I. Lancman, a Democratic assemblyman from Queens, said the governor ''can do a better job of making his case against the policies that the Senate Republicans support without demonizing individual Republican senators.''
 Like other legislators, he was not pleased this month when Mr. Spitzer called Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ''factually wrong, legally wrong, morally wrong, ethically wrong'' for opposing the driver's license policy.
 ''I want to see him make the closing arguments I know he's capable of making as a lawyer, on the merits,'' he said.
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester, said, ''There's a great deal of mystification out there from people sympathetic with where he wants to take the state.
 ''The mystification is about the tactics and tone, and I think it started on the comptroller stuff,'' he said. ''It just hasn't stopped.''
 The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, the Legislature's top Democrat, has been conducting what he calls ''shuttle diplomacy'' between the Bruno and Spitzer camps for months.
 The speaker said he had told the governor, ''In the end, the public is going to applaud results, not rhetoric, and they are not going to accept bickering as a reason for the failure to achieve.''
 Mr. Silver said he had stopped trying to get Mr. Bruno and Mr. Spitzer to talk to each another.
 ''I think it's fruitless,'' he said. ''There's too much mistrust between them.''
 Asked in the interview if he liked Mr. Bruno, the governor paused, then said: ''I've always tried to create the notion that, hey, we gotta get along. You know,at this point I guess I wouldn't answer the question directly.''

HEADLINE: The Pakistan Quandary U.S. Policy Makers Wonder About Limits Of Musharraf's Power, and Their Influence

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and DAVID ROHDE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 -- The scenes of carnage in Pakistan this week conjured what one senior administration official on Friday called ''the nightmare scenario'' for President Bush's last 15 months in office: Political meltdown in the one country where Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and nuclear weapons are all in play. 
 White House officials insisted in interviews that they had confidence that their longtime ally, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president, would maintain enough influence to keep the country stable as he edged toward a power-sharing agreement with his main rival, Benazir Bhutto.
 But other current and former officials cautioned that six years after the United States forced General Musharraf to choose sides in the days after the Sept. 11 attacks, American leverage over Pakistan is now limited. And General Musharraf is weakened. 
 His effort at conciliation in Pakistan's tribal areas, where Al Qaeda and the Taliban plot and train, proved a failure. His efforts to take them on militarily have so far proved ineffective and politically costly. Almost every major terror attack since 9/11 has been traced back to Pakistani territory, leading many who work in intelligence to believe that Pakistan, not Iraq, is the place Mr. Bush should consider the ''central front'' in the battle against terrorism. It was also the source of the greatest leakage of nuclear arms technology in modern times. 
 After years of compromises and trade-offs, there are questions inside and outside the administration about whether Mr. Bush has invested too heavily in a single Pakistani leader, an over-reliance that may have prevented the United States from examining other long-term strategies.
 ''It never stitched together,'' said Daniel Markey, a State Department official who dealt with Pakistan until he left government earlier this year. ''At every step, there was more risk aversion -- because of the risk of rocking the boat seemed so high -- than there was a real strategic vision.'' 
 Even some senior administration officials said privately, echoing views in some recent intelligence assessments, that American influence over events in Pakistan may be ebbing fast. 
 Some officials worry aloud that a year of unrest, violence and political intrigue in Pakistan may undercut Mr. Bush's last chance to root out Osama bin Laden from the lawless territory where Al Qaeda has regrouped. Likewise, they fear, the unrest could cripple a renewed administration effort to turn around the war against Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan. 
 If serious divisions emerge in Pakistan's army, they could also threaten the security of Pakistan's potent nuclear arsenal, something that Bush administration officials worry about far more than they let on publicly. 
 Over the past year, the Musharraf government has quietly sent officials to Washington to assure Bush administration officials that even if the general were ousted or assassinated, the mechanisms for controlling both weapons and nuclear technology -- safeguards that Pakistan acknowledges it has put together with aid from other countries -- are now unbreakable. And his designated successor, the newly appointed vice chief of the Pakistani Army, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, is widely seen as a pro-American moderate. 
 Several officials who have left the administration say they are less than sanguine about the prospect that Pakistan's troubles will just settle down.
 ''We have to remember that the U.S. doesn't have very much capability to affect internal developments'' in Pakistan, said Robert D. Blackwill, the former American ambassador to India and a senior official in the National Security Council during Mr. Bush's first term. 
 ''What I am struck by are the trends we see today: the North-West Province is ungovernable and a sanctuary for terrorists,'' he said. ''The politics are fractured and deeply unstable, Musharraf is weaker, and the army is uncertain which way it will go.''
 This summer, White House officials were clearly worried that General Musharraf would adopt extreme measures to maintain power. In early August, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called General Musharraf twice in one day -- once at 2 a.m. in Islamabad -- to persuade him not to declare martial law. 
 A steady parade of American officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Ms. Rice's deputy, John D. Negroponte, have been sent to Pakistan to persuade General Musharraf to make good on his pledge to give up his role as army chief, which now appears likely assuming the country's Supreme Court validates his victory in a presidential election held Oct. 6. 
 A senior administration official, who could not speak for attribution because of the delicacy of the issues, argued in an interview on Friday that these steps had worked. Instability and political deadlock in Islamabad ''is certainly one scenario, but hardly the only one,'' he said. 
 After trying for a year, and failing, to let tribal leaders deal with Al Qaeda and to negotiate with Islamist forces, the official contended, General Musharraf ''learned you can't appease these people, and they have to go after them. So there is room to be hopeful.''
 But critics of the American policy say both General Musharraf and the Bush administration were slow to sense the gathering of new threats. A frequently cited example was the administration's delay in responding to evidence starting in 2004 that Al Qaeda and the Taliban were creating a new sanctuary in the tribal areas, on the Afghan border. At the time, Mr. Bush and General Musharraf were publicly declaring that Al Qaeda's ranks had been greatly weakened, and that the Taliban was a spent force. 
 Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador to Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005, began warning senior administration officials that Pakistan had become the new sanctuary in 2004, according to a senior administration official. But some administration officials warned against placing too much pressure on General Musharraf. 
 Part of the problem of fashioning a forceful policy, critics like Mr. Markey say, was that the American approach to Pakistan was never sewn together as a whole. ''You had different parts of the U.S. government dealing with different problems,'' said Mr. Markey, now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
 The military and intelligence agencies focused on the hunt for Mr. bin Laden and his top associates. The C.I.A. was responsible for making sure that the nuclear black market set up by Abdul Qadeer Khan, a man revered in Pakistan for helping make it a nuclear power, had been dismantled. 
 Meanwhile, the State Department was responsible for coaxing General Musharraf toward democracy, and starting up a $750 million program to bring schools and economic development to the areas where Al Qaeda and the Taliban have thrived.
 Then there was the administration's focus on General Musharraf, who many in the administration still view as the only moderate military leader who can control the country's army. As long as the army remains united, most American officials say they believe the nuclear arsenal will remain under strict control.
 But some experts say the focus on General Musharraf is a mistake. They argue that Pakistan's army is overwhelmingly moderate and will remain so, even without General Musharraf. ''I think our policy has been too much built around one person -- and that is Musharraf,'' said Teresita C. Schaffer, a Pakistan expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''The result was that we were seen more as Musharraf's friends than Pakistan's friends.''
 That has been particularly true in the protracted battle against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the rugged territory where Mr. bin Laden is believed to be operating. A succession of American efforts to locate him have failed. While Mr. Bush only mentions Mr. bin Laden episodically, killing or capturing the man behind the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks is considered a major goal among officials seeking to create for Mr. Bush a legacy beyond Iraq.
 But Pakistanis have never been as enthusiastic about that battle, and the Pakistani Army has suffered hundred of deaths there; a recent return to the region resulted in 250 dead and another 250 taken hostage. ''It's embarrassing to them,'' a senior administration official says. 
 Local Pakistani officials have said that General Musharraf has been so focused on maintaining power that he has failed to mount a coherent strategy in the tribal areas. They say that the political infighting and paralysis in the government are allowing the militants to thrive. 
 Today, despite the administration's heavy reliance on General Musharraf, the tribal areas are a base for a revitalized Qaeda, which has created a new command structure and is again planning international attacks, according to a National Intelligence Estimate issued in August, parts of which the administration published in an unclassified form. 
 The 2005 London subway bombings, the 2006 plot to blow up British airliners and a recent plot to set off explosives in Germany have all been traced back to the region. But General Musharraf continues to limit American operations there. 
 ''We can conduct some covert operations, but there is a huge premium on not being seen in the area,'' a senior administration official said. ''And I don't think that is going to change for the rest of the Bush presidency. You can imagine the frustration level.''

HEADLINE: Sorting Out Pakistan's Many Struggles

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, DAVID ROHDE, BILL MARSH and RENEE RIGDON

 BODY:
Although created as a homeland for Muslims when it was separated from mostly Hindu India at the breakup of the British Raj in 1947, Pakistan from the beginning has been plagued by chaos and violence. It is not so much a nation-state as an unwieldy collection of competing ethnic groups, tribes, castes and interests.
 Indeed, the return of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto last week to join an uneasy coalition with the selfappointed president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, was a product of a struggle between civilian and military authority that has defined the country's politics. Her father, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, was ousted in a military coup in 1977 and hung by Gen. Muhammad Zia ul-Haq two years later. 
 Last week, Ms. Bhutto herself suggested that the bomb blasts that ripped through a delirious crowd in Karachi and nearly succeeded in killing her had their roots in the long, intertwined relationship of fundamentalist Islamic groups with the army's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency.
 The agency funneled money to Afghan mujahedeen when they fought the Soviets. It has supported Islamic separatists in Kashmir. And it helped create the Taliban. And while the United States regards General Musharraf as a crucial ally in the war on terrorism, recent intelligence estimates say that Al Qaeda has been able to regroup in the tribal areas along the Afghan border. Concerns about the terrorist camps and the country's stability are heightened by the fact that Pakistan has nuclear weapons.
 Those conflicts have played out against Pakistan's other regional, ethnic and class divisions. Each of the four main ethnic groups -- Punjabi, Sindi, Baluch and Pashtun -- has its own interests. Pakistan's Muslims are overwhelmingly Sunnis. But there are also Shiites, who are frequently attacked by Sunni fundamentalists who consider them heretics.
 Although there is a growing middle class in the cities -- these Pakistanis formed the backbone of demonstrations against General Musharraf for firing the chief judge of the Supreme Court last spring -- a great many of Pakistan's 165 million people are desperately poor. (Its total population is bigger than Russia's.) With the central government weak and often corrupt, much of the real power has been held by the army and a class of hugely wealthy feudal landholders, who include Ms. Bhutto herself. 
 Punjab: The Center of Power
 Home to about half of Pakistanis, as well as Lahore, the country's thriving second city and its cultural heart. Punjabis dominate the federal machinery and the army, much to the unhappiness of Pakistan's other ethnic groups, all minorities.
 Lahore sits not far from the Indian border (the only land bridge across the border is a 30-minute drive away) and is poised to benefit from the gradual opening of trade between the two rivals. Like all of Pakistan's major cities, it is booming, with an independent news media and an elite and highly educated upper class.
 A growing urban middle class has prospered under General Musharraf. Rural Punjab, by contrast, is largely poor and agricultural. Southern Punjab produces most of the country's economically critical cotton crop.
 There, especially, feudal arrangements persist. Even in this most fertile part of the country, arable land and water for irrigation are inadequate.
 WHAT THEY SEEK
 Punjabis are accustomed to being the public face of Pakistan. They feel the rivalry with India especially strongly. The urban elites are impatient for democracy and unhappy with the United States after its invasion of Iraq. General Musharraf, once popular in Punjab, is no more, adding to anti- American feeling. Water is a source of great tension between provinces -- the agricultural sector has its eye on water from the frontier provinces. Much of the country's water now comes from the disputed territory of Kashmir, adding to conflict with India.
 Sindh: In Punjab's Shadow
 Largely rural and agricultural, Sindh is Ms. Bhutto's power base. The farm areas are dominated by wealthy feudal families -- like the Bhuttos -- who employ impoverished local Sindhis to work the land.
 But Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and main port, is a polyglot megalopolis dominated by a different group known as mohajirs -- Muslims, many of them civil servants, who fled from India during the fighting over the 1947 partition. (Islamabad, the capital, was built from scratch to house the government.)
 There have long been violent clashes between the Mohajir National Movement (MQM in the Urdu language) and rival parties, including Ms. Bhutto's. The MQM is allied with General Musharraf and has a reputation for thuggish politics. It was the main instigator of deadly rioting in May after General Musharraf's dismissal of the Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikar Mohammed Chaudhry.
 As in many corners of Pakistan, a local liberation movement percolates, this one Sindhi.
 WHAT THEY SEEK 
 Sindhis chafe at the Punjabi-dominated central government and army, believing that their province is shortchanged in respect and government largess. The province is largely dry, water is inadequate and energy and education needs are not fully met -- as in the rest of the country.
 Borderland: The Wild, Wild West
 Rugged, mountainous, this is the land of the Pashtun, where the government's writ does not run.
 Fierce mountain tribesmen, the Pashtun straddle the Durand Line, the border the British drew in 1893 between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In practice, the line is nonexistent -- impossible to seal and riddled with smugglers' trails.
 The Pashtun live by a strict code called Pushtunwali which requires them to protect their guests (like Osama bin Laden) and fight foreign invaders.
 The North-West Frontier Province and two of the seven Federally Administered Tribal Areas known as North Waziristan and South Waziristan have become havens for a regrouping Al Qaeda and other foreign fighters, including Uzbeks. There has been heavy fighting recently, but much of the territory is lost to the government. Tribesmen captured some 250 Pakistani soldiers and are still holding them.
 WHAT THEY SEEK
 To be left alone.
 Baluchistan: Restive, Remote
 A large, sparsely settled and natural-gasrich region with a clan-based population of ethnic Baluchis and Pashtuns. It is badly lacking in water and good roads.
 Baluchistan borders Afghanistan and Iran and has extensive smuggling, mostly of heroin, with both countries. Its main city, Quetta, has become a refuge for Taliban fighters and the site of a command council, or shura, that directs attacks in southern Afghanistan.
 WHAT THEY SEEK
 Baluchi grievances are largely economic: they want higher royalties for their natural gas and a larger share of government resources. ''They have a welldeveloped sense of grievance and a culture that reinforces it,'' said Teresita C. Schaffer of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The province, she said, is more or less in a perpetual state of rebellion.

HEADLINE: Growing Older Oct. 14-20

 BODY:
THE NEWS The nation's first baby boomer, a retired teacher from New Jersey, filed for Social Security benefits, with an estimated 78 million to follow.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Kathleen Casey-Kirschling, born one second after midnight on Jan. 1, 1946, will be eligible when she turns 62 next year. ''I think I'm just lucky to be at the top of the boom,'' she said. No kidding. The number of beneficiaries will nearly double by 2040, the government says, while the work force that supports Social Security will grow by only about 16 percent. 
THE NEWS The nation's 50 million Social Security recipients will receive a 2.3 percent cost-of-living increase in their monthly checks beginning in January.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Don't get too excited. The increase works out to $24 a month per retiree. The Associated Press reported that the increase is the smallest in four years, though many prices are rising more quickly this year than last year. So what gives? Energy prices were down between July and September, the period the government uses to calculate the annual adjustment.
 THE NEWS Scientists reported progress in developing a blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's disease.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The progressive, degenerative brain disease is now diagnosed using a battery of mental and other tests, with the final determination made by a doctor. Treatments for the disease are not very effective now. But a simple blood test that could pick up the disease early would become important when drugs are developed to slow or halt its progress. About four million Americans have the disease.
 THE NEWS A 90-year-old economist became the oldest person to be awarded a Nobel Prize in the 106-year history of the awards. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Leonid Hurwicz, a professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota, shared the prize with two other Americans for creating and developing a sophisticated explanation of the interaction among individuals, markets and institutions. ''I didn't expect the recognition would come because people who were familiar with my work were slowly dying off,'' he said.
 THE NEWSLed Zeppelin, the legendary rock band that disbanded in 1980, has finally agreed to offer its catalog to digital music fans.
 BEHIND THE NEWS It may have been a long time since Led Zeppelin rocked and rolled, but the band remains one of the most-played acts on rock radio. Led Zeppelin also is set to release a two-disc greatest hits collection and has struck a $60 million deal to extend its ties to its music publisher for 10 years. Should make for a tidy retirement; the band's youngest member is 59.

HEADLINE: Divide And Conquer: Meet the Lottery Titans

BYLINE: By RON STODGHILL and RON NIXON

DATELINE: Louisville, Ky. 

 BODY:
 ENVELOPED in neon lights, murmuring crowds and the tinny melody of computerized games, a convention center showroom here bears the trappings of a Las Vegas casino. But the players, mostly state employees sporting suits and name tags, haven't come to this annual expo to gamble. Instead, they are sampling the wares of one of government's biggest cash cows: lotteries, which rang up about $202 billion in sales last year in the United States and overseas.
 Amid sales pitches and glad-handing, there's also no mistaking which two companies dominate the landscape of government-backed gambling. Commanding the showroom's entrance, with a booth mocked up as a convenience store featuring a Mega Bucks ticket dispenser, is the Scientific Games Corporation. Dominating the center of the hall, beneath a twirling orange and blue globe, is Gtech Holdings, its vaunted sales team strolling through a labyrinth of gleaming lottery terminals. 
 ''You can pretty much look at the size of the booths as a guide to which companies have the most muscle in the industry,'' says David Gale, executive director of the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, a sponsor of the event, called World Meet. ''As you can see, nobody even comes close to Gtech and Scientific Games.'' 
 Over the last three decades, Gtech and Scientific Games have jointly generated several billion dollars in revenue as vendors to lotteries -- a business that flourishes at the crossroads of capitalism and public policy. In the process, the companies have steadily -- and often controversially -- evolved from minor suppliers into an influential oligopoly with a hammerlock on lottery operations. 
 Every business has its titans, of course. But according to analysts, lottery officials and public documents, Gtech and Scientific Games have done more than just ride the gambling boom -- they have strong-armed their way to the top of a publicly sponsored industry that they now dominate. And with the domestic lottery market plateauing, both companies are focused on securing new footholds overseas.
 Gtech, in particular, has been heavy-handed at times. According to court papers and regulatory filings, the company's representatives have drawn persistent allegations of bribing their way into contracts. Gtech officials acknowledge questionable practices by some employees, but say the problems are a thing of the past. 
 With lotteries now struggling to resuscitate lagging ticket sales, the rise of Gtech and Scientific Games also illustrates some of the risks inherent when any industry depends heavily on one or two suppliers for products, innovation and vision.
 Through buyouts and mergers with rivals, mixed with a heavy dose of political muscle, the companies have neatly divided the lottery market. Gtech is involved with making, selling and operating online lottery systems while Scientific Games specializes in devising and producing instant lottery tickets, or scratch-offs. Although Gtech and Scientific Games overlap in some areas, both companies, according to a review of state contracts, have cemented roles as one-stop shops that offer lotteries a menu of gambling products, marketing, training, telemarketing and other services.
 Gtech, for instance, has 26 of the 42 available state contracts to operate the computer systems that run games like Pick 6 and Powerball. Scientific Games has contracts to print scratch-off tickets in 34 of the 42 states. Current contracts have positioned both companies to make at least $5 billion in combined revenue over the next 5 to 10 years.
 ''The vendors wield a tremendous amount of influence over the lotteries,'' says Michael Jones, a former director of the Illinois Lottery, who now heads a marketing research firm in Chicago that works with state lotteries. ''Not a decision is made that they don't have some say in.''
 For their parts, officials at Gtech and Scientific Games say that as primary vendors to lotteries, much of their influence derives from their role in helping to build state lotteries from scratch. In turn, the lotteries have become one of the largest, most profitable segments of the entertainment industry. 
 The companies also contend that their influence is not about political connections but is attributable instead to industry consolidation -- a trend that has enabled a relatively small number of highly regulated enterprises to operate efficiently and profitably. 
 The companies concede that lottery vendors angle fiercely to win contracts. But, says A. Lorne Weil, the chairman and chief executive of Scientific Games, ''the activity of heavily lobbying states or foreign countries to enact legislation to bring lotteries into being -- that is not at all directed by us.'' He says, however, that ''we have done some of that in the past.'' 
 W. Bruce Turner, the chief executive of Gtech, puts it another way. ''Gtech has played a key role in fostering the success enjoyed by lotteries today,'' he says. ''We have grown to be the world's leading solutions provider to the lottery industry because we focus on creating the greatest value for our customers, which results in higher returns to the good causes they support.''
 TO protect and expand their turf, Gtech and Scientific Games have tightly woven their interests into the nation's political fabric. Through the years, both companies have spent millions of dollars lobbying legislators and bankrolling lottery referendum proposals that have led to the establishment of lotteries. For example, Scientific Games spent about $1 million in 1984 supporting Proposition 37, which authorized the creation of a state lottery in California. 
 Often, the companies have also helped draft the very language used in lottery legislation. Some rivals complain that Gtech and Scientific Games have leveraged their political ties not only to win lottery bids, but also to ensure that contracts themselves are written in ways that discourage competition. 
 Thomas Little, chief executive of Intralot USA, a division of Intralot, a Greek gambling company, says his company's recent interest in securing the New Jersey lottery contract was undermined because the state required that bidders already have several existing United States contracts. ''Whoever wrote the proposal had to know that we could not respond because we only had one state at the time,'' says Mr. Little, who once worked for Scientific Games.
 Gtech, Scientific Games and New Jersey officials all say that the state alone crafted the language in the proposal. But jockeying for New Jersey lottery contracts has even pitted Gtech and Scientific Games against each other. Scientific Games recently protested Gtech's winning bid to run the lottery there after state officials learned that Gtech used the same lobbying and public relations firm as the lottery itself. 
 Scientific Games said the arrangement explained why Gtech was awarded the contract. Gtech officials have denied any conflict of interest, contending that they won the New Jersey contract based on merit, despite the fact that the state would have to pay Gtech $31.7 million more than Scientific Games for its services.
 A New Jersey official testified last year during a special hearing about the contract that the MWW Group, the lobbying and public relations firm shared by Gtech and the New Jersey lottery, may have discussed strategies with Gtech that helped it secure the lottery contract. 
 The state is about to rebid the contract to stem criticisms about an appearance of a conflict of interest. MWW officials say their work for Gtech was separate from their work for the state and did not compromise the bidding process. Even so, some New Jersey officials remain concerned about the process.
 ''There was the perception that the bid was not conducted with the highest degree of propriety,'' says Thomas Vincz, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of the Treasury. 
 State Senator Ellen Karcher, a Democrat from Monmouth, views the dispute as emblematic of how private enterprise tries to exploit relationships with government officials to commandeer the procurement process -- causing taxpayers to foot overly expensive bills to run the lotteries. 
 ''This is a clear picture of how insiders are able to craft laws and bids in ways to help other insiders,'' she says. ''In the end, the taxpayers lose, the players lose, and ultimately the kids whose education is supposed to be funded by these lotteries lose.''
 Last year, Gtech and Scientific Games took in nearly $2 billion in combined revenue. By devising games, printing tickets, training retailers and processing winning tickets, the companies receive up to a nickel for every lottery dollar wagered in the United States. (Americans spent about $60 billion on lottery tickets last year, including sales at video lottery terminals.) 
 HISTORICALLY an underground operation run by mobsters and known as ''the numbers,'' the informal street game has been transformed into a lucrative, state-sponsored corporate enterprise -- largely through the efforts of Gtech and Scientific Games, analysts say.
 Scientific Games was founded in 1973, and Gtech opened its doors eight years later, at a time when state lotteries were still in their infancy. Only 13 states had lotteries, which were generally operated as small back-office operations and run by political appointees who usually had experience in law enforcement. 
 Gtech was guided by one of the company's three co-founders, Guy Snowden, a blustery former I.B.M. engineer, who had talked the Bass brothers of Texas and the investor Richard Rainwater into bankrolling a business devoted to winning state lottery contracts and operating them for a hefty commission. Mr. Snowden's pitch to state lotteries was simple: Gtech could start up lotteries faster and operate them more efficiently and with a higher level of security than state agencies could. Within a decade, Gtech had won nearly half of the nation's online lottery contracts. 
 Scientific Games was created through the merger of two companies -- Autotote Systems, which started out manufacturing wagering equipment for racetracks, and Scientific Games, which introduced the first secure instant-lottery ticket in 1974. Autotote acquired Scientific Games in 2000, keeping Scientific Games as the name of the merged company. Over the years, Scientific Games has solidified its position in the instant-ticket market through other acquisitions.
 By the mid-1990s, Gtech and Scientific Games had combined technological innovation with hard-minded business practices to further dominate the lottery business. The companies' clout was also amassed through political contributions, as well as by hiring former public officials and lobbyists who aggressively advanced their interests in state legislatures, people in the industry say. 
 According to data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics, a nonprofit organization that tracks political contributions, Gtech and Scientific Games made more than $1.2 million in campaign contributions to state governors, legislators and political parties from 1999 to 2006. Both companies have retained lobbyists in all of the states in which they operate, according to state lobbying records. In California alone, the two companies together paid $1.1 million to lobbyists last year for a range of legislative measures.
 INDUSTRY analysts say that over the years, both companies have also plowed several million more dollars into political initiatives that helped pass lottery bills. Scientific Games alone helped draft legislation or finance initiatives that led to the creation of lotteries in California, Arizona, North Carolina, South Carolina, Colorado and Oregon, according to published reports and interviews with former legislators and staff members. 
 ''Without Scientific Games' involvement and contributing over $1 million to get the referendum for a lottery on the ballot, I doubt California would even have a lottery,'' said Tim Hodson, a former legislative staff member and now the executive director of the Center for California Studies at California State University, Sacramento.
 Jerry Kopel, a former legislator in Colorado who worked on the bill authorizing lotteries there in the early 1980s, said Scientific Games played an instrumental role in having the lottery passed in his state. ''They contributed $90,000 of the $95,000 used by supporters of the push for a change in the state Constitution to allow the lottery,'' said Mr. Kopel, whose committee evaluated the company before the lottery was introduced. 
 Scientific Games was then hired to help the state craft the lottery contract and was the only bidder when the contract came on the market, Mr. Kopel said. Officials at Scientific Games declined to comment on the matter, saying that it happened before the merger with Autotote and that the company's managers at the time have since left. Scientific Games is currently the primary vendor for the Colorado lottery. 
 Critics have often contended that buying influence among state policy makers has long been the modus operandi for Gtech and Scientific Games. Although Gtech itself has never been charged with wrongdoing, employees and consultants have. In 1997, the company's national sales director was convicted in federal court of receiving kickbacks in a scheme used to pay off consultants and lobbyists who helped Gtech secure contracts. Since then, law enforcement authorities have scrutinized lottery vendors more closely.
 Officials at Gtech and Scientific Games say that accusations of influence-peddling are relics of their past, stemming from a time when each of them was racing to gain a foothold in the fledgling lottery business or to persuade public officials to start lotteries. These days, with lotteries in most states and almost no other competitors, there is less pressure to gain inside access to state legislators and lottery directors, the companies say. 
 ''Today, the numbers in the industry champion themselves,'' says Mr. Turner, Gtech's chief executive. ''We spend less money in governmental relations than we have in our entire history. It's just not necessary anymore.''
 Yet Gtech's lottery push overseas is raising many of the same questions about business ethics that have haunted the company in the United States. According to regulatory filings, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating accusations by Brazilian government officials in 2004 that two Gtech employees offered bribes to one of the country's lottery officials to win contracts in 1997 and 2000. The accusations led Brazilian authorities to file a civil suit against Gtech, contending that the company illegally obtained the contracts. 
 A Gtech spokesman says the company's internal investigation found that rather than offering bribes, Gtech's employees were the victims of attempted extortion by Brazilian officials. ''We were the target of a very sophisticated extortion scheme launched by high-level individuals as well as the ruling political party,'' says Bob Vincent, the Gtech spokesman.
 The S.E.C. declined to comment on the investigation. 
 Texas authorities, in a regulatory examination last year of Gtech's business practices, raised concerns about possible bribes and other possible improprieties involving the company's activities in Brazil, Poland, the Czech Republic and Trinidad and Tobago, describing Gtech's ''operating style'' as ''very aggressive.'' The report cites Mr. Turner of Gtech as acknowledging that in making questionable payments in Brazil, the company's employees may have ''flown dangerously close to the sun.''
 Gtech dismissed the significance of the Texas report. ''As scathing as the report is, it didn't affect anything,'' Mr. Vincent says. Of the problems in Brazil, he says that ''even though our compliance system worked, our people probably should have been more circumspect about some of the meetings they had.''
 Recent questions have surfaced about Scientific Games' practices as well. For example, a former lobbyist in North Carolina, Kevin Geddings, was sentenced to four years in prison this year for hiding a financial relationship he had with Scientific Games in the years before he became a member of the state's lottery commission in 2005. 
 Court records show that Mr. Geddings, while lobbying for Scientific Games, ran an aggressive campaign to not only start a lottery in North Carolina, but also to ensure that Scientific Games ran it there as well. The company paid Mr. Geddings more than $250,000 for his lobbying work, according to court papers.
 Mr. Geddings performed similar work introducing a lottery in South Carolina. According to court records, in 2000, the same year that South Carolina residents voted overwhelmingly for the lottery, Mr. Geddings consulted for a group called the South Carolina Lottery for Better Schools Coalition. It was a nonprofit advocacy group paid by Scientific Games to build public support for a lottery, and Mr. Geddings's public relations firm provided office space for the group. The vendor hired to run the lottery was Scientific Games.
 Mr. Weil, the chief executive of Scientific Games, characterizes Mr. Geddings's case as an ethical aberration in a generally stand-up industry. ''Every once in a while, unfortunately, you have a situation where somebody who's employed gets a little overzealous,'' he says. ''But I think it is such a minuscule percentage of the people that are involved in the industry and such a minuscule fraction of the total activity going on. It's unfortunate that that's really the only part of it that the public sees.''
 EARLIER this year, Gtech was the host of an industry conference at a plush resort on Amelia Island in Florida, under the banner ''Imagine the Future.'' Luring hundreds of lottery directors from the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa, Gtech offered a future for lotteries that extends far beyond the ticket counters of American convenience stores. On a stage festooned with flags from around the world, the company dazzled its audience with a battery of interpreters who translated its presentations from English into five other languages.
 All of that was in keeping with Gtech's own international aspirations. Last year, Lottomatica, an Italian conglomerate that operates the Italian National Lottery and is among the largest gambling companies in the world, acquired Gtech. With 6,300 employees and a geographic footprint in 60 countries, the merged company now controls 63 percent of the world's online lottery business. 
 ''The future of the lotteries in the U.S. is a question of public policy,'' says Mr. Turner of Gtech. ''The final new frontier for us is in emerging markets such as Southeast Asia, China and Russia.'' By taking more of Gtech's products abroad, Mr. Turner projects that over the next five years, nearly half of its sales will come from overseas, compared with 35 percent today.
 Scientific Games, meanwhile, has made its own international push. The company has spent nearly $200 million over the last three years acquiring companies that have increased its presence overseas. It now has about 5,500 employees and operates in about 60 countries. Currently, about 40 to 45 percent of Scientific Games' revenue comes from overseas, the company's fastest-growing segment. 
 The global focus of Gtech and Scientific Games is partly a result of slackening demand at home. American consumers, after more than three decades of buying Lotto, Powerball and scratch-off tickets at record levels, are gradually cooling to lotteries, as a result of the aging of lotteries' core customer base, the proliferation of casinos and the emergence of online gambling. 
 In 2007, despite offering an average of 30 to 40 games in most states, overall sales at lotteries rose just 2 percent from the previous year. Some two dozen states reported declines in tickets sales, compared with the previous year, according to La Fleur's, a lottery market research firm.
 INSTANT tickets, historically the most popular lottery games, have hit a wall as well. Sales have flattened for Keno, generally such a solid revenue generator that critics have derisively labeled this rapid-fire game as ''video crack.'' 
 Some industry analysts blame a lack of new products that appeal to younger gamblers for the downturn. Today's basic menu of games, they say, tends to be the same as what Gtech and Scientific Games offered two decades ago: scratch-off tickets dressed up with licensing deals with sports teams, board games and television programs.
 ''You don't have that much innovation as far as games and marketing goes because two companies dominate the field,'' said William Eadington, a professor of gambling studies at the University of Nevada, Reno. ''Lotteries are going to continue to be stagnant unless something drastic is done.''
 Officials at Gtech and Scientific Games concede that product innovation has come slowly, but contend that this is largely because of the strict regulatory environment in which they operate. For example, both vendors would like to sell their products via the Internet, which is legal in several European countries but prohibited by federal statutes in the United States. They also say that pricing pressure from lottery officials has given them less money to innovate.
 Even with some of these problems, few who study gambling expect the influence of lottery vendors to wane.
 ''Gtech and Scientific Games have been very successful at running the states' lottery games,'' says Charles Clotfelter, an economics professor at Duke University and an expert on lotteries. ''But there should be no ambiguity to their goals; they might exist in the realm of public policy, but their interest is to make money for shareholders.''

 BODY:
Don't Raise Taxes. Instead, Set Priorities.
 To the Editor:
 ''Still a Bad Idea'' (editorial, Oct. 14) sharply criticizes a Republican proposal to require a supermajority to raise taxes or create new taxes. You allude to the need to raise more revenue, and imply that increasing taxes might be required in the future. 
 The fact is that New Jersey taxpayers simply cannot afford higher taxes. If some project (like repairing bridges) is truly worthy, why can't we prioritize our spending and cut less worthy programs to provide the needed financing?
 New Jersey just cannot afford everything! 
 Joseph A. Iwanski Red Bank
 To the Editor:
 I agree that it is shortsighted for New Jersey Republicans to use the proposal of a supermajority requirement for taxation during the campaign season. 
 As any astute watcher of the news knows, things can change quickly, needs change, and it is important to have the flexibility to meet those future needs, particularly if it involves using whatever fiscal measures the government can to best deal with the problem. 
 Voters know a campaign scheme when they see one. Perhaps Republicans should deal with more substantive public policy issues from now until Election Day. 
 Steven M. Clayton Ocean
 The writer is a Democratic committeeman in Monmouth County.
 To the Editor:
 I strongly disagree with your pro-tax-and-spend position. Over the last 15 years, members of the New Jersey Legislature, both Democrats and Republicans, have been fiscally irresponsible. While New Jersey's economy was growing, they saw fit to outspend that growth and failed to balance the budget. 
 I, for one, am fully supportive of any initiative that will bring the New Jersey government to its knees! Maybe by that time the Legislature will wake up and address New Jersey's fiscal problems in a responsible manner. 
 Until that time, the crushing debt should keep our legislative members in line.

HEADLINE: Growing Older Oct. 14-20

 BODY:
THE NEWS The nation's first baby boomer, a retired teacher from New Jersey, filed for Social Security benefits, with an estimated 78 million to follow.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Kathleen Casey-Kirschling, born one second after midnight on Jan. 1, 1946, will be eligible when she turns 62 next year. ''I think I'm just lucky to be at the top of the boom,'' she said. No kidding. The number of beneficiaries will nearly double by 2040, the government says, while the work force that supports Social Security will grow by only about 16 percent. 
THE NEWS The nation's 50 million Social Security recipients will receive a 2.3 percent cost-of-living increase in their monthly checks beginning in January.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Don't get too excited. The increase works out to $24 a month per retiree. The Associated Press reported that the increase is the smallest in four years, though many prices are rising more quickly this year than last year. So what gives? Energy prices were down between July and September, the period the government uses to calculate the annual adjustment.
 THE NEWS Scientists reported progress in developing a blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's disease.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The progressive, degenerative brain disease is now diagnosed using a battery of mental and other tests, with the final determination made by a doctor. Treatments for the disease are not very effective now. But a simple blood test that could pick up the disease early would become important when drugs are developed to slow or halt its progress. About four million Americans have the disease.
 THE NEWS A 90-year-old economist became the oldest person to be awarded a Nobel Prize in the 106-year history of the awards. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Leonid Hurwicz, a professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota, shared the prize with two other Americans for creating and developing a sophisticated explanation of the interaction among individuals, markets and institutions. ''I didn't expect the recognition would come because people who were familiar with my work were slowly dying off,'' he said.
 THE NEWSLed Zeppelin, the legendary rock band that disbanded in 1980, has finally agreed to offer its catalog to digital music fans.
 BEHIND THE NEWS It may have been a long time since Led Zeppelin rocked and rolled, but the band remains one of the most-played acts on rock radio. Led Zeppelin also is set to release a two-disc greatest hits collection and has struck a $60 million deal to extend its ties to its music publisher for 10 years. Should make for a tidy retirement; the band's youngest member is 59.

HEADLINE: Don't Get Mad. Get to Work.

 BODY:
New York's legislators are expected to make a rare appearance in the state Capitol this week. What they will actually accomplish given the constant feuding between Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Republicans who run the State Senate is anybody's guess. Talk to either side and the usual hot air turns to steam. Truth is, though, most New Yorkers no longer give a hoot about this spat. What they really want to know is whether Albany gives a hoot about them. So here are a few assignments for lawmakers when they return, ever so briefly, to address the state's business. 
 For starters, the Assembly should stop holding up the entire garbage disposal plan for New York City because a few members don't want a marine transfer station on Gansevoort pier in Manhattan. The three people standing in the way are Deborah Glick, Richard Gottfried and Linda Rosenthal, all Assembly members from Manhattan.
 It is time for this threesome to move out of the way and for Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, to make certain that other neighborhoods do not suffer because of them. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker, and other city officials made it clear last week that there is plenty of support for the proposal, which would distribute a necessary burden throughout the city and simply asks Manhattan neighborhoods to do their share. Three Assembly members should not be able to kill it.
 The Republicans, meanwhile, seem determined to slow Mr. Spitzer's efforts to reform Albany's anachronistic ways of doing business. The Senate's refusal to approve 87 of the governor's appointments has been particularly unhelpful. A few of these appointees, like the state's economic development commissioner, have been trying to do their jobs despite having to pencil in the word ''acting'' on their business cards. Others, like the trustees of the state university system, have not been able to pick a new chancellor because the Senate has been too petulant to give Mr. Spitzer even a few new faces on the university board.
 O.K. The Democratic governor is irritating and overly combative. O.K. The Republicans in the State Senate are vengeful and overly combative. How many New Yorkers really care? It is time to sit down like adults, and bring in a marriage counselor if necessary. It is time to start passing laws that will promote economic development, give judges a pay raise, and clean up the special-interest money gathered and spent in New York State political campaigns. 
 New York's lawmakers need to stop huffing and puffing and start putting their house in order instead.

ECONOMIC INDICATORS Housing and earnings will be the big topics this week. The price of oil could climb above $100 a barrel, and the markets could continue to be volatile. 
 Existing-home sales for September will be reported on Wednesday and new-home sales for September on Thursday.
 Other reports will include durable goods for September (Wednesday) and the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index (Friday).
 The Joint Economic Committee will release a report on Thursday estimating the broader impact of the subprime mortgage crisis on family wealth, property values and tax revenues.
 COMPANY REPORTS Some big home builders will report earnings, including Centex (Monday) and Pulte Homes and the Ryland Group (Wednesday).
 Other earnings reports: American Express, Apple, Halliburton, Hasbro, Kimberly-Clark, Merck, Schering-Plough and Texas Instruments (Monday); AK Steel, Akzo Nobel, Amazon.com, AT&T, Biogen Idec, BP, DuPont, JetBlue, Lexmark, Lockheed Martin, UAL, United Parcel Service and Whirlpool (Tuesday); American Electric Power, Amgen, Anheuser-Busch, Boeing, ConocoPhillips, Corning, General Dynamics, GlaxoSmithKline, Merrill Lynch, Northrop Grumman, Tribune and VMware (Wednesday); Aetna, Belo, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Comcast, Dow Chemical, E. W. Scripps, Eastman Chemical, Hyundai Motor, ImClone, Microsoft, Motorola, Raytheon, Royal Dutch Shell, Sony, Thomson, US Airways and Wendy's (Thursday); and Countrywide, Sprint Nextel and Volkswagen (Friday). 
 REVIEW OF 'VW LAW' The European Court of Justice is widely expected to overturn the decades-old ''VW law'' on Tuesday. The German law caps a shareholder's voting rights in a company at 20 percent, regardless of the number of shares held, and requires 80 percent for ''important decisions.'' It also gives Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen is based, a controlling minority stake in the automaker.
 ET CETERAWal-Mart will have its annual meeting with analysts on Tuesday and Wednesday; Google will have its analysts' day on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: A New Daily Starts in Spain, Aiming for the Young, Left-Leaning Reader

BYLINE: By VICTORIA BURNETT

DATELINE: MADRID, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Starting a newspaper in a mature economy these days may seem an act of folly. But the publishers and editors of Publico, which hit the newsstands last month, are convinced they can defy the ravages of new technology and free papers.
 Publico, a small, full-color daily that costs 0.50 euro, hopes to turn what its editors view as the enduring failings of the Spanish newspaper market to its advantage: there is little in the way of a popular press, and nothing directed at young, left-leaning readers. 
 With a bold front that features a single headline and a cover price half that of its rivals, Publico said it hoped to draw readers aged 25 to 45, said Ignacio Escolar, the newspaper's editor.
 ''The Spanish newspaper market has been a failure over the past century,'' Mr. Escolar, 31, said during a visit to the modern offices that house the newspaper's 120 editorial workers, most in their 30s.
 After the transition to democracy that followed the death of Francisco Franco in 1975, he said, ''we set up a press that was highly politicized.''
 The paper, which has been printing 250,000 copies daily since it was introduced on Sept. 26, has no editorials, no coverage of bullfights, no death notices and no advertisements for prostitutes, all staples of mainstream Spanish newspapers. At 64 pages, it is slimmer than its rivals, which often run a hefty 90 pages.
 On the surface, readership figures support Publico's view that there is a gap in the market and suggest that the Spanish newspaper industry is not caught in the fast decline of many markets in Europe and the United States.
 Newspaper sales have fallen much more slowly in Spain than elsewhere in Europe, where they have been hit hard by the explosion of the Internet and mobile communications, and by competition from free papers.
 Spain, which has enjoyed a decade-long economic boom and has one of the fastest-growing immigrant populations in Europe, was one of the few European countries where newspaper sales rose from 1996 to 2005. Sales have fallen about 2 percent over the past two years, according to the Association of Spanish Newspaper Editors. Broadband penetration, while growing fast, is still low in Spain at 15 of every 100 households, about half that of leaders like Denmark and the Netherlands.
 Free papers, rather than stealing market share in Spain, have been converting nonreaders into readers, filling a gap left by the lack of Spanish tabloids. Circulation of free papers has shot from one million to about five million in the last five years, according to the World Association of Newspapers.
 This is partly because newspaper readership in Spain -- a country of conversationalists who crowd sidewalk cafes and village squares -- is among the lowest in Europe. The country's three main national newspapers, El Pais, ABC and El Mundo, do not sell a million copies among them.
 Figures from the World Association of Newspapers show that about four million newspapers were sold each day last year in Spain, which has a population of about 40 million, compared with nearly double that number in France, where the population is about 60 million. Publico hopes to attract the population served by the free papers.
 ''Freesheets have encouraged a lot of people to read every day, and we believe they are potential buyers of a second paper,'' said Jaume Roures, one of Publico's main backers and an executive of Mediapro, a powerful media company based in Barcelona. Mr. Roures said that Publico aimed to break even in five years, but declined to say how much had been invested in the paper so far.
 Publico is also pitched against El Pais, the best-selling liberal daily in Spain. It will fuel the rivalry between Mediapro, where Publico's three main backers are executives, and Grupo Prisa, the biggest Spanish media company and owner of El Pais. Mediapro and Prisa are locked in a bitter dispute over rights to broadcast Spanish soccer, and each has accused the other of receiving special treatment from allies in the ruling Socialist Party.
 El Pais, a sober, entrenched newspaper, sells about 430,000 copies a day but lost about 5 percent of its sales last year. It introduced a revamped issue on Sunday intended to appeal more to younger readers.
 Juan Luis Cebrian, chief executive of Grupo Prisa, said ahead of the reintroduction that the paper aimed to become an internationally read Spanish-language title, integrate its Web and print editions and have a ''less establishment, more colorful'' look.
 ''El Pais was the newspaper of the transition, and young readers feel the transition is over and want something that reflects modern reality,'' Mr. Cebrian said by telephone.

HEADLINE: Dispute on F.D.R. Drive Ends With a Killing in East Harlem

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK; Mathew R. Warren contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A case of road rage between two drivers on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive ended in gunfire early yesterday after both exited in East Harlem, and one man was killed, the police said. 
 The shooting occurred shortly before 6 a.m., less than an hour after a fatal motorcycle accident on the drive at 117th Street, and officials said drivers were forced to exit onto local streets because of the police activity. 
 Relatives identified the shooting victim as Jayson Tirado, 25. The police said he and two passengers were headed south on the F.D.R. Drive in a purple Honda Civic when they became involved in a dispute with a man driving a yellow Nissan Xterra.
 The police said it was unclear what led to the dispute, how it played out on the drive, or whether Mr. Tirado and the other driver knew each other.
 Both cars pulled off the drive at 116th Street, investigators said, drove west to First Avenue and then north to 117th Street. At that point, the Nissan's driver fired a gun, striking Mr. Tirado, the police said. Neither of Mr. Tirado's passengers was injured, and no one in the Honda returned fire, the police said.
 Mr. Tirado managed to continue driving north on First Avenue for three blocks. The Honda was found stopped in the intersection, as if Mr. Tirado were about to turn east on 120th Street, investigators said. It was unclear how many shots had been fired, but bullet holes were visible in one of the Honda's rear passenger windows and its rear bumper.
 The man in the Nissan fled, and no arrests had been made as of late yesterday, the police said. One of the passengers in Mr. Tirado's car was interviewed by detectives; the other was intoxicated and was not immediately questioned, investigators said. An autopsy will be conducted on Mr. Tirado's body.
 Mr. Tirado lived in the Jacob Riis Houses, a large public housing complex off the F.D.R. Drive on the Lower East Side, with his companion and a young daughter, according to relatives. They said Mr. Tirado was unemployed, and they did not know why he was out early yesterday.
 ''Jayson was a very calm kid,'' said Ricardo Ramos, an uncle of Mr. Tirado's. ''His thing was with cars and taking care of his daughter. It's a shame that now the poor girl is without a father.''
 Raul Arcelay, a cousin, said Mr. Tirado ''was going about life like everybody else, trying to survive, and I guess he got mixed up with the wrong people and ended the way he did today.''
 The police said a 27-year-old man, whom they declined to identify late yesterday, died in the motorcycle accident, which occurred about 5 a.m.
 They said he was speeding south on the drive, and hit a light pole when he attempted to switch lanes at 117th Street. No other vehicles were involved.

HEADLINE: Inch by Inch, Great Lakes Shrink, And Cargo Carriers Face Losses

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

DATELINE: OSWEGO, N.Y. 

 BODY:
From his office at the port here, Jonathan Daniels stared at a watermark etched on the rocks that hug one of the commercial piers -- a thick dark line several inches above the surface of Lake Ontario -- and wondered how much lower the water would dip.
 ''What we need is some rain,'' said Mr. Daniels, director of the Port of Oswego Authority, one of a dozen public port agencies on the United States side of the Great Lakes. ''The more we lose water, the less cargo the ships that travel in the Great Lakes can carry, and each time that happens, shipping companies lose money,'' he said. ''Ultimately, it's people like you and I who are going to pay the price.''
 Water levels in the Great Lakes are falling; Lake Ontario, for example, is about seven inches below where it was a year ago. And for every inch of water that the lakes lose, the ships that ferry bulk materials across them must lighten their loads by 270 tons -- or 540,000 pounds -- or risk running aground, according to the Lake Carriers' Association, a trade group for United States-flag cargo companies. 
 As a result, more ships are needed, adding millions of dollars to shipping companies' operating costs, experts in maritime commerce estimate. 
 ''When a ship leaves a dock, and it's not filled to capacity, it's the same as a plane leaving an airport with empty seats: It cuts into their earning capacity,'' said Richard D. Stewart, a co-director of the Transportation and Logistics Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Superior.
 ''Because it's mostly raw materials we're talking about, the average consumer may see an increase in pennies in the price they pay for, say, a new car or washing machine,'' Dr. Stewart said. For major manufacturers or firms managing big projects, however, the increase in transportation costs ''is much more significant,'' he said. 
 The port of Oswego receives scraps of aluminum from Canada, which are rolled into sheets at a local plant and sent to car manufacturers; soy beans for a bio-diesel plant in nearby Fulton; and parts for windmills that are used to generate power on a farm south of Canandaigua Lake, near Rochester, said L. Michael Treadwell, director of Operation Oswego County, a nonprofit economic development agency. The windmill parts arrive from Brazil and Indonesia, in ships that enter Lake Ontario through the St. Lawrence Seaway, which connects the lake to the Atlantic Ocean.
 The port also handles soy beans grown in central New York and sent to the Middle East, and it receives potash, a mineral used in fertilizer, and road salt, which are distributed by truck and rail to companies across the Eastern United States.
 The water levels in all five Great Lakes -- Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario -- are below long-term averages and are likely to stay that way until at least March, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. (The same is true at Lake St. Clair, which straddles the border between the state of Michigan and the province of Ontario and is between Lake Huron and Lake Erie; it is not considered one of the Great Lakes, although it is part of the Great Lakes system.) 
 Most environmental researchers say that low precipitation, mild winters and high evaporation, due largely to a lack of heavy ice covers to shield cold lake waters from the warmer air above, are depleting the lakes. The Great Lakes follow a natural cycle, their levels rising in the spring, peaking in the summer and reaching a low in the winter, as the evaporation rate rises. 
 In the past two years, evaporation has been higher than average, and not enough rain and snow have fallen in the upper lakes -- Superior, Michigan and Huron -- which supply water to the lower lakes, to restore the system to its normal levels, said Keith Kompoltowicz, a meteorologist at the Corps of Engineers' office in Detroit, which monitors water levels in the lakes. ''Mother Nature is largely the driving force on what the water levels are, and it plays a large role in what we project water levels to be,'' Mr. Kompoltowicz said. 
 The International Joint Commission, which advises the United States and Canada on water resources, is conducting a $17 million, five-year study to determine whether the shrinking of the Great Lakes is related to the seasonal rise-and-fall cycles or is a result of climate change, said Greg McGillis, a spokesman for the commission. A final report is expected in March 2012. 
 Lake Ontario's water level can be regulated through releases from a dam on the United States-Canada border, which allowed the lake to maintain its normal levels until May, Mr. McGillis said. Then a drought hit, and the releases became less generous, said Robert O'Gorman, supervisor of the United States Geological Survey field station here. The drought and the lower inflows from the upper lakes, diminished Lake Ontario's water level, he said. 
 Lake Ontario stood at 244.1 feet as of Wednesday -- 3 inches below where it was at the beginning of the month, 5 inches below last month's average and about a foot below last year's average. The water, however, is still about 2 feet above the lake's low of 242.19 feet, registered in 1934, according to the Corps of Engineers. 
 The picture is just as serious in the upper Great Lakes and is particularly grave in Lake Superior, where water levels have hovered below average since 1998 and, based on provisional data, set record lows in August and September. It is the longest stretch of below-average readings at Lake Superior since the Corps of Engineers started tracking the Great Lakes' levels in 1918.
 On average, 240 million tons of cargo travel across the Great Lakes every year. The United States fleet circulating in the Great Lakes has 63 ships, which have lost a total of 8,000 tons of cargo capacity for every inch of water the lakes have fallen below normal this year, said James H. I. Weakley, president of the carriers' association. Those 8,000 tons, he said, correspond to enough iron ore to produce 6,000 cars, or enough coal to provide electricity to the Detroit area for three hours, or enough stone to build 24 houses.
 Mark W. Barker, president of Interlake Steamship Company, said the nine ships his company operated made about 50 trips a year across the Great Lakes, and the larger ones have transported 1,800 tons less per trip this year compared with last year -- the equivalent of losing an entire ship's capacity over the length of a season.
 ''We get paid by the ton, so we're losing a lot of revenue per trip, and we're just going to have to reclaim that loss by increasing our rates,'' said Mr. Barker, whose family has owned the company since 1987. ''It's either doing that or risk the business.''
 The Great Lakes region is home to about 70 percent of the steel industry in North America and about half of the heavy manufacturing in the United States, Mr. Weakley said.
 Here in Oswego, a city of 18,000 residents that is 40 miles north of Syracuse, the port has acquired renewed significance in the past two years, largely because of a budding renewable energy sector that depends in part on lake shipments. The area's economy has struggled since the decline of its agricultural-based industries, like brewing, began in the 1970s. 
 Mr. Daniels, the port director, said that water transportation was still one of the most efficient alternatives for companies that rely on bulk cargo, and that Oswego was banking ''on the water coming back to the lakes.'' 
 ''If the low levels in the Great Lakes are a result of global warming, I don't know,'' he said. ''What I know is that we can't control nature. All we can do is hope for rain.''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 24, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about falling water levels in the Great Lakes reversed the relative temperatures of the water and the air in winter, a differential that causes evaporation. Environmental researchers say evaporation in the Great Lakes is higher than normal because, lacking heavy ice cover during the recent mild winters, the warmer lake water is not protected from the colder air above -- not the other way around.

HEADLINE: With Wall Street Slowing, Uncertainty Descends

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Now that the biggest firms on Wall Street, widely regarded as the economic engines of New York City, have begun to sputter, economists and city officials are beginning to fear that the city's run of steady growth will stall.
 One big bank after another has announced shrinking profits, job cuts or both. And the gloomy reports are dashing hopes that large year-end bonus checks for investment bankers and traders would continue to fuel the local economy. 
 The latest psychic blow came on Thursday when the chief executive of Bank of America hinted that his company might reverse the expansion of its investment banking operations after suffering big trading losses in the last three months. That warning seemed particularly ominous because the bank, based in North Carolina, is building a $1 billion office tower on 42nd Street to herald its arrival as an important player in the financial capital of the country. 
 With the tally of casualties from the turmoil in the financial markets mounting, analysts are rethinking their predictions of a gradual cooling of the local economy. 
 The city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., had been forecasting a general slowdown this year after three years of steady growth. But now Frank Braconi, the chief economist in the comptroller's office, says he is not yet sure whether the troubles in the financial markets will turn into ''something worse than we were predicting.''
 The comptroller's office is not forecasting a local recession in the next several months, but the odds that one will occur are rising, Mr. Braconi said. A national recession would almost certainly drag the local economy down with it, he said.
 ''There's a very high likelihood that, yes, several years of very healthy and well-balanced economic growth in the city are probably behind us,'' Mr. Braconi said. 
 After a few lucrative years and a surge in hiring, investment banks and financial firms that underwrite and trade bonds backed by mortgage debt are now feeling repercussions as homeowners around the country default on risky mortgages in record numbers. Several investment banks, including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase, have already eliminated a total of more than 1,000 jobs this year, and analysts who track the industry are expecting more cuts.
 All told, financial services firms based in New York have announced job cuts of 42,404 this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a job-placement consulting firm in Chicago. More than half came in one reorganization at Citigroup, whose employees are scattered around the world, but most of the others have been in and around New York. Those cutbacks are especially threatening to the local economy because pay on Wall Street is so high that the industry accounts for one of every five dollars of income in the region. Economists estimate that each new job on Wall Street leads to at least 1.3 other jobs, so for every three investment bankers laid off, four other workers are in jeopardy.
 But those effects do not show up immediately in government statistics on employment and unemployment because laid-off investment bankers do not usually rush to collect benefits, economists said.
 Indeed, the latest report from the State Department of Labor showed that the city's unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent in September from 5.7 percent in August. And tax collections on income and sales in the city grew at an impressive pace through the end of summer.
 But some economists do not expect those trends to hold. Moody's Economy.com nearly halved its estimate of how many jobs the region would add by June to 9,500, from 18,700.
 ''I'm not so sure I'm ready to say that the city's going to fall into recession, but there's a risk that the New York City area could be one of the weakest in the nation in the second half,'' said Steven Cochrane, a senior managing director at Economy.com. ''In a sense, New York is catching up.'' 
 Mr. Cochrane said the weakening of the housing market in the suburbs and the prospect of much smaller bonuses on Wall Street prompted the recent revision to his company's midyear forecast. He attributed much of the surprisingly relentless demand for deluxe apartments in Manhattan to the spending of bonuses for 2006 that were paid out this year. ''I don't expect that bonuses in the first quarter are going to be anything compared to what we saw in the first quarter of '07,'' Mr. Cochrane said.
 Beyond the question of year-end bonus payouts, Mr. Braconi said, ''You're looking at a much more temperate pace of growth in the best case for the next couple of years.''
 Although the number of jobs lost in financial services nationally this year has been unusually high, New York's share is ''not huge'' so far, Mr. Braconi said. 
 The job losses have been dispersed because the home-lending industry is not concentrated in one place, as is the investment banking industry in Manhattan. Now, the question is whether the investment banks will be able to contain the damage without more severe cost-cutting.
 ''It's likely we're not out of the woods yet on the bursting of this credit bubble,'' said John A. Challenger, the chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ''My sense is that it's not fully worked its way out of the system.''
 The cutbacks have come just as Wall Street was completing a long rebound from the slump that followed the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. After peaking at about 195,000 jobs in 2000, employment on Wall Street declined by about 17 percent, or one of every six jobs, by 2003, said James Brown, an analyst with the State Department of Labor. But since then, a steady expansion brought that number back above 190,000 by late summer.
 He said that not all previous downturns on Wall Street had had broad and lasting effects on the local economy. 
 ''It's not entirely clear which type of Wall Street slowdown we're having,'' Mr. Brown said.
 Within a few months, he said, it should become clearer how widespread its effects will be. Until then, he said, ''You can't assume we're going to stop growing completely because Wall Street's turning down.''

HEADLINE: Meet Your Neighbors, But Just Not in Person

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
FACEBOOK and MySpace struck a chord with people who want to socialize from a distance. But will people use social networks to actually meet their neighbors?
 That's the hope of at least one new company, LifeAt.com, which is putting a local spin on the social networking model. The company creates password-protected Web sites for apartment buildings and housing developments, allowing residents to post pictures and profiles of themselves, share information about favorite local eateries and gripe about slow elevators and peeling paint. 
 ''I like the idea a lot,'' said Charlene Li, an analyst with Forrester Research, a consulting firm. ''Living in the same building means you tend to share the same socioeconomic background and interests, and giving people information on things like where to eat and where to shop makes it very, very relevant.'' 
 Ms. Li said her only reservations about the idea are that its appeal may be limited to big cities, and that LifeAt could be hard-pressed to generate many local advertising sales on its own, as most local businesses are not accustomed to buying online ads. Rather, she said, it would probably have to distribute ads for companies like Google and share commissions.
 Matthew Goldstein, LifeAt's chief operating officer, said the company is only now completing its advertising strategy. For now, the company, based in Brooklyn, is surviving on the roughly $6,000 it receives from each building that signs up for the service. It does not charge the buildings yearly fees. 
 More than 335 buildings have joined since LifeAt began in March. About 600 more buildings are scheduled to introduce LifeAt Web sites by year's end. The company does not currently share ad revenues with the buildings, but Mr. Goldstein said that could change.
 Among buildings with LifeAt Web sites, Mr. Goldstein said, residents of 64 percent of the units have created personal pages. Property managers, who give residents login and password information, also use the sites to post news about maintenance work and vacancies.
 The profile pages created by residents are similar to those on other online social networks. Users post descriptions and pictures of themselves on personal pages, along with pictures of their friends in the building. In the Marketplace section, users can post free classified ads for old furniture, appliances andbaby-sitting services, and rate local eateries and businesses.
 Several months ago, Tara Brooke, a childbirth counselor who lives in a 300-unit apartment building in Lower Manhattan, posted an ad for her service, Power of Birth, on the building's LifeAt Web site. She received so many responses that she opened an office in SoHo and hired more workers. ''The ad was a lot more personal because it's where you live,'' Ms. Brooke said.
 The personal connections made through the site have been more superficial, Ms. Brooke said, although she acknowledged that it has helped her become friendly with more neighbors. ''I'm not single, but if I was, I'd definitely be on there looking for a date,'' she said. ''It has that MySpace feel to it, but it's much more intimate because you actually know these people are within reach.''
 LifeAt is not the first to try this approach, but it appears to be the first to generate much money from it. Since late 2004, MeetTheNeighbors.org, a for-profit company based in Manhattan, has operated a social networking service for apartment dwellers.
 That site, which is free, has about 15,000 users, and last year began serving residents of Boston, London and Dublin. Jared Nissim, the company's founder, runs the site as a sidelight to his primary business, the Lunch Club, which helps strangers meet.
 Mr. Nissim said some buildings have considerably more active Web sites than others, thanks mostly to the efforts of volunteers in the building who are responsible for managing the content of the site. ''It may be one of the flaws of our system that it relies on one primary contact to get the ball rolling,'' he said.
 By contrast, each building on the LifeAt service is overseen by a company representative, who spends a few days logging neighborhood services and restaurants into the site before it makes it debut. Everything but the forum postings are screened for inappropriate content by LifeAt employees.
 As with any online forum, those on LifeAt can devolve into rant sessions, which is why some property managers asked Mr. Goldstein to discontinue that part of the service for their sites. ''But one developer heard the residents were just putting up a Yahoo blog behind his back instead, so they decided to keep it open so they could be proactive about things,'' Mr. Goldstein said.
 Alan D. Lev, president of the Belgravia Group, a residential development company based in Chicago, recently introduced its first LifeAt site for a 400-unit condominium on North Lake Shore Drive, in Chicago. Mr. Lev said the service is well-suited to the people in their mid-20s who live in the building.
 ''I think it's very important for them to be able to go on there and be able to interact amongst the residents, and see all the restaurants and places to go,'' Mr. Lev said. ''And it allows them to converse with the management company more easily, so there's no pent-up anger about what might be going on with the building.''
 Others have experimented with social networking Web sites aimed at city residents without intending to make money. I-Neighbors.org is a site set up by Keith N. Hampton, a sociologist at Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, to study the role that Web sites can play in strengthening offline social ties.
 Mr. Hampton said that I-Neighbors continues to grow, with 45,000 people now using the free service. He said, however, that people in apartment buildings generally do not pursue social connections with their neighbors. 
 ''They're younger people who move more, have no children and they're early in their careers,'' he said. ''They tend to be less interested in the people who live around them, and more interested in their own social networks.''
 The one exception to that, Mr. Hampton said, is New York, ''where availability of housing makes people live in apartment buildings who may otherwise not.''
 ''That said, it sounds like LifeAt is having some nice success,'' Mr. Hampton said. ''But in terms of having an impact on the communication among residents and their ability to build new social ties, the apartment building model will have limited success.''

HEADLINE: Ain't That America

 BODY:
Think of America's greatest historical shames. Most have involved the singling out of groups of people for abuse. Name a distinguishing feature -- skin color, religion, nationality, language -- and it's likely that people here have suffered unjustly for it, either through the freelance hatred of citizens or as a matter of official government policy. 
 We are heading down this road again. The country needs to have a working immigration policy, one that corresponds to economic realities and is based on good sense and fairness. But it doesn't. It has federal inertia and a rising immigrant tide, and a national mood of frustration and anxiety that is slipping, as it has so many times before, into hatred and fear. Hostility for illegal immigrants falls disproportionately on an entire population of people, documented or not, who speak Spanish and are working-class or poor. By blinding the country to solutions, it has harmed us all. 
 The evidence can be seen in any state or town that has passed constitutionally dubious laws to deny undocumented immigrants the basics of living, like housing or the right to gather or to seek work. It's in hot lines for citizens to turn in neighbors. It's on talk radio and blogs. It's on the campaign trail, where candidates are pressed to disown moderate positions. And it can be heard nearly every night on CNN, in the nativist drumming of Lou Dobbs, for whom immigration is an obsessive cause.
 In New York, Gov. Eliot Spitzer has proposed allowing illegal immigrants to earn driver's licenses. It is a good, practical idea, designed to replace anonymous drivers with registered competent ones. In show after show, Mr. Dobbs has trained his biggest guns on Mr. Spitzer, branding him with puerile epithets like ''spoiled, rich-kid brat'' and depicting his policy as some sort of sanctuary program for the 9/11 hijackers. Someday there may be a calm debate, in Albany and nationally, about immigrant drivers. But with Mr. Dobbs at the megaphone, for now there is only histrionics and outrage.
 Let's concede an indisputable point: people should not be in the country illegally. But forget about the border for a moment -- let's talk about the 12 million who are already here. What should be done about them?
 A. Deport them all.
 B. Find out who they are. Distinguish between criminals and people who just want to work. Get them on the books. Make them pay what they owe -- not just the income, Social Security, sales and property taxes they already pay, but all their taxes, and a fine. Get a smooth legal flow of immigrants going, and then concentrate on catching and deporting bad people.
 C. Catch the few you can, and harass and frighten the rest. Treat the entire group as a de facto class of criminals, and disrupt or shout down anyone or any plan seen as abetting their evildoing.
 Forget A. Congress tried a version of B, but it was flattened by outrage. 
 And so here we are at C. It's a policy that can't work; it's too small-bore, too petty, too narrow. And all the while it's not working, it can only lead to the festering of hate. Americans are a practical and generous people, with a tolerant streak a mile wide. But there is a combustible strain of nativism in this country, and it takes only a handful of match tossers to ignite it. 
 The new demagogues are united in their zeal to uproot the illegal population. They do not discriminate between criminals and the much larger group of ambitious strivers. They champion misguided policies, like a mythically airtight border fence and a reckless campaign of home invasions. And they summon the worst of America's past by treating a hidden group of vulnerable people as an enemy to be hated and vanquished, not as part of a problem to be managed.

HEADLINE: Polish Premier Is Routed In Record Vote, Polls Show

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

DATELINE: WARSAW, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
Voters appeared to have ousted the prime minister, one half of Poland's wonder-twin team, in parliamentary elections on Sunday. The challenger, Donald Tusk, declared victory for his pro-business party, Civic Platform.
 The prime minister, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, conceded defeat as two major exit polls showed his Law and Justice Party trailing Civic Platform by double-digit margins. His brother, Lech, will remain president and retain veto power over the presumptive new government's legislation.
 Official results are not expected until Tuesday. They could determine whether Civic Platform achieves an outright majority or, as is more likely, needs to form a coalition with the centrist Polish Peasants Party. Though the results were still unofficial, Mr. Kaczynski congratulated his opponent after what appeared to be a significant defeat. 
 ''It was a battle,'' Mr. Tusk told supporters gathered here Sunday night. ''We won it. But tomorrow we need to get down to work.'' 
 Surveys showed that this election had the highest rate of voter participation since the fall of Communism in 1989. Some polling stations ran out of ballots, which kept several open up to three hours later than scheduled.
 Leaders across Europe were likely to be relieved at the ascension of Civic Platform, a pro-Europe party. Under the Kaczynskis, Poland has earned a reputation as a consensus-breaking troublemaker.
 On the other hand, the Kaczynskis have been the staunchest of allies of the United States. Mr. Tusk said during the campaign that he would have driven a harder bargain over support of plans to place missile interceptors on Polish soil and that, if elected, he would try to bring home the 900 Polish troops in Iraq.
 With 38 million residents, Poland is the largest former communist country in the European Union. Civic Platform stands for tax cuts and the continued liberalization of the economy through privatization.
 Law and Justice appeared to be a formidable opponent, especially given the support of the influential Catholic radio station, Radio Maryja, which experts here said could alone deliver around 1.5 million votes for the party, just over half the 2.9 million that Civic Platform managed when it was narrowly defeated by Law and Justice in elections two years ago.
 But turnout was abysmal in that election, barely 40 percent. A survey by the PBS public opinion institute put participation Sunday at 55.3 percent. ''It's much higher than we all expected,'' said Lena Kolarska-Bobinska, director of the Institute of Public Affairs, an independent research organization in Warsaw, attributing the surge to surprisingly high youth participation. ''This is a generation revolution.'' 
 Paulina Gdula, out for a walk with her fiance in Garwolin, a small town 40 miles east of Warsaw, after voting in her first election, said, ''Young people should have some influence over what is happening in this country.''
 On a bright cold autumn Sunday in Poland, three generations of the Rekawek family set out for their polling place in the village of Michalowka, just outside Garwolin.
 ''They wanted to do a lot for the country, but other parties didn't let them,'' said the mayor, Krystyna Rekawek, referring to the Kaczynskis. ''They did not have enough time to do what they wanted,'' she added, because elections were called two years early after the Kaczynskis' governing coalition fell apart this summer. 
 A Law and Justice victory would have meant ''no change, just quarreling and fighting all over again,'' said her son, Tomasz Rekawek.
 In Garwolin's town square, an older man responded to questions about the election by raising a fist and shouting, ''Ducks,'' a local nickname for the twins.
 ''I prefer my ducks boiled in a pot,'' said a friend sitting beside him.

HEADLINE: Concern Over Quality Isn't Limited to China

 BODY:
These interviews were conducted with some respondents to The New York Times/CBS News Poll who said they would be willing to be called back in order to elaborate on their answers to the poll questionnaire.
 Janice Campbell, 69 Lyons, Ind. Retired elementary school teacher I buy products from China but I don't buy the toys. Those are the products that have been recalled lately. The toys are probably all right if the kids are past the putting things in your mouth stage. Unless it comes off on their hands and gets into their bodies that way, it's probably not much of a concern. I wouldn't like my 3-year-old grandson to have his trains taken away. But China should change their manufacturing process because the U.S. won't buy any more of their goods if they don't. I generally buy just clothes and maybe kitchen utensils. I do notice when you buy clothing, the buttons are barely hanging on, but I think for the money you pay, the quality is good. Prices have been going up recently, but my income doesn't go up accordingly because I'm on Social Security. But I think it would be nice if more of these products were made in the U.S. We need more jobs for America. We're in a county in Indiana that has a really high unemployment rate. 
 Brian Pawlak, 54 Phillipsburg, N.J. Unemployed office worker Given the recent recalls of pet food and toys with lead paint, I'm not sure what China is doing about quality control. You wonder how effective their quality control is and how much of this stuff is in the pipeline, so you just sit back and wait a little bit. When you go to the local shop here, you see the house brand of apple juice concentrate is from China. Canned mushrooms are from China. Sauces, noodles, little things. When you read the news reports, you wonder how effective their quality control is. I remember in the old days, everything said ''passed by law of the health department.'' Someone was sampling the stuff and checking it. Right now, I'm holding off on food made in China. And once you start thinking about that, you begin to wonder how effective all those tools that have the Sears label, the Craftsmen tools, are. You check them and they come from China. You wonder how effectively they're being inspected. But you assume that if the tools are produced for a higher quality label, they're being inspected and checked for safety. About eight years ago, I bought a drill press. I decided to buy American, so I bought the Craftsman label and when I got it home I saw on the box it was made in China. 
 Audra Straight, 27 Malvern, Ark. Restaurant worker I still buy toys from China. I don't think they're as bad as they are made out to be. All the products I've gotten from there are fine. I've got six boys, from 8 to 2, and they like things like game toys and Power Rangers toys. My kids don't stick stuff in their mouths. If they did, I might think it was dangerous. I'm pregnant again, hopefully this time with a girl.
 Dorothy Peppers, 65 Odessa, Mo. Coffee shop cashier I don't think products from China are any more dangerous than products imported to the U.S. from other countries. I don't think our standards are high enough for the things brought into this country. Maybe Chinese imports are dangerous, but I think items made in Taiwan or any other places are probably equally as dangerous. But American quality on the whole has gone down, too. Back when I was younger, a TV lasted a long time and you could always replace a tube. Now, if the TV goes out, it's just as cheap to buy a new one. We're living in a throwaway society. We no longer make things to last. I do most of my shopping in Wal-Mart. If an item I want is made in China and I don't see one made in the U.S., I will buy the one made in China. Where the item is made is not as important as whether it will last and what features it has. If I buy electronics, I do pay attention because I want to know I can get parts. If I buy a lawn mower made in China, I'm probably not going to be able to get blades or oil filters. 
 Matt Kitzke, 27 Rhinelander, Wis. Delivery service worker I heard the company, I think it was Mattel, that had the recall said the Chinese weren't fully responsible for that paint problem. The paint was put on in China, but it was made somewhere else. The reports were saying China was fully responsible, but it was one of those products that was sent to all different countries for parts. I think we should try to have some good standards and do research on those things, but maybe if they can track things better it would be good for us. I don't think we can just blame China. I buy toys for my 5 1/2month-old son from China, but that's where most of the toys are made. It would probably be better if they were American-made because it would give us jobs here. As far as small electronics go, I don't mind buying from China and Korea because they are big on electronics over there. And the stuff is pretty well made. But with cars and things that cost a lot, I prefer to buy American-made. 
 Paul Huff, 40 Brookston, Ind. Police officer I think the U.S. as a whole imports millions of items from China, and the recall of some of the toys represents a very small percentage. The recall has been talked about in the media, but that doesn't mean all items from China are bad or all toys are bad. When you buy things from China, they don't always seem to have the same quality of workmanship or craftsmanship that you expect from other countries or those made in America. I think they do need to inform the public that there's a danger, but at the same time, people don't need to panic just because there's been a recall on some of the toys. My kids are 8, 6, and 4, and I don't think we've bought any toys recently, but Christmas is coming up and we'll be mindful of where products are made and check if this was something that's been recalled. But I assume by the time we're ready to buy stuff for Christmas, all the affected toys should have been recalled. As a parent, you hope there are agencies out there that look at things and try to determine if they're safe. 
 Lillie Ward, 50 Wilmington, N.C. Retail saleswoman I'm real careful about what I do buy and that's from anywhere, not just China. I try to make sure it's always the best, and if I'm not comfortable with it, I'm not getting it, I don't care where it's made. You have to be very diligent as a parent and as an adult. We have things that are messed up here, too, so it's not that theirs are any worse than ours. It just depends on how much care is put into a product, and some companies put in more care than others. So I'm just very careful over what I get no matter where it's from. My son is 7 and he is extremely computer literate. Mostly what he likes are computer-related toys. He's not into the trucks and the cars, so a lot of the stuff I get for him are computer-oriented games. He's not into toys that might be dangerous.

HEADLINE: Joint Chiefs Chairman Looks Beyond Current Wars

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
The new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff plans to press Congress and the public to sustain the current high levels of military spending -- even after the Iraq war -- arguing for money to repair and replace worn-out weapons and to restore American ground forces he described as ''breakable,'' though not yet broken.
 The new chairman, Adm. Mike Mullen, expressed deep concerns that the long counterinsurgency missions in Iraq and Afghanistan have so consumed the military that the Army and Marine Corps may be unprepared for a high-intensity war against a major adversary. 
 He rejected the counsel of those who might urge immediate attacks inside Iran to destroy nuclear installations or to stop the flow of explosives that end up as powerful roadside bombs in Iraq or Afghanistan, killing American troops.
 With America at war in two Muslim countries, he said, attacking a third Islamic nation in the region ''has extraordinary challenges and risks associated with it.'' The military option, he said, should be a last resort.
 But Admiral Mullen warned any nation, including Iran, not to ''mistake restraint for lack of commitment or lack of concern or lack of capability.'' He described the Air Force and Navy as America's ''strategic reserve,'' ready to carry out a full range of combat operations beyond Iraq and Afghanistan.
 In his first interview since becoming chairman, Admiral Mullen sat in his Pentagon office on Friday and described his three immediate priorities: 
 Develop a military strategy for the Middle East, beyond Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Accelerate efforts to ''reconstitute, reset, revitalize'' the armed forces, which he said meant replacing combat equipment and tending to the needs of those in uniform, in particular soldiers and marines and their families.
 Refocus the military's attention beyond the current wars to prepare for other challenges, especially along the Pacific Rim and in Africa.
 Those efforts will require a considerable commitment of money, and Pentagon officials are quietly acknowledging that Congress and the public may have little appetite after Iraq for sustaining the high levels of military spending carried out since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 But Admiral Mullen said that an important part of his job would be making the case for maintaining those large military budgets.
 ''I think as a country we're just going to have to devote more resources to national security in the world that we're living in right now,'' he said. ''And I don't do that lightly.'' 
 ''I recognize that the budget is higher now than it's ever been,'' he added, referring to the combined total of the basic annual Defense Department budget and the special supplemental budgets to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Military spending is hovering around 4 percent of gross domestic product, ''and I would see that in the future as an absolute floor,'' Admiral Mullen said.
 According to statistics supplied by the Office of Management and Budget, military spending was sustained at 5 percent or more of gross domestic product from the mid-1970s, rising above 6 percent in the final years of the cold war. In 1993, after the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the Persian Gulf war, it dropped below 4 percent, declined to 3 percent by the late 1990s, and only climbed above 4 percent again in 2003.
 Weighing into a Washington debate assessing the current capability of insurgents in Iraq who align themselves with Al Qaeda, and fighters loyal to the Taliban in Afghanistan, Admiral Mullen described both organizations as severely wounded but still very lethal. 
 The admiral, who previously was chief of naval operations, visited troops in Iraq and Afghanistan immediately after becoming chairman three weeks ago, and said he returned pleased with progress on security.
 One of the few Vietnam War veterans remaining in the most senior officer corps, Admiral Mullen expressed worries that the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan had undermined the military's ability to fight big wars -- and distracted the armed forces from preparing to face other threats.
 ''Because we have had such an intense focus on the Middle East and Iraq and Afghanistan, there is risk associated with those other parts of the world,'' Admiral Mullen said.
 Current combat efforts are so heavily focused on counterinsurgency missions that the Army and Marine Corps ''haven't been training in or focusing on this wider spectrum of requirements should we need to be called to do something else,'' Admiral Mullen said.
 ''And so we've got to make sure that we can train to, equip to and be ready for just a broader spectrum of missions,'' he added.
 He pushed back against those who are calling for military action against Iran's nuclear program, saying that diplomatic and economic pressure must take precedence. 
 The threat to American and allied troops from high-powered explosives from Iran, he said, should be countered by halting their flow into Iraq or Afghanistan across the borders, and with attacks on those bomb-making and bomb-planting cells inside Iraq or Afghanistan.
 ''That said, that doesn't get at the source of it,'' he acknowledged. Asked whether the American military should aim at sites inside Iran if intelligence indicated that such interdiction could halt the flow of those bombs, he said ''the risks could be very, very high.''
 ''We're in a conflict in two countries out there right now,'' he added. ''We have to be incredibly thoughtful about the potential of in fact getting into a conflict with a third country in that part of the world.''
 After meeting with soldiers and marines in Iraq and Afghanistan in recent weeks, Admiral Mullen said: ''They're tired. They've been doing unbelievably great work for our country. And we need to make sure we take care of them and their families.''
 Assessing the impact of long, repeated deployments for the ground forces in Iran and Afghanistan, he said, ''The ground forces are not broken, but they are breakable.''

HEADLINE: Tables Turned: Poor Countries Wag Fingers At Rich Ones

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
The semiannual meetings of the world's top finance and banking officials are predictable in one sense: Europeans and Americans often use them to lecture leaders of poor countries about the need to modernize their capital markets, promote transparency and adhere to sound investment standards.
 What a difference a subprime mortgage crisis can make. Now developing countries are lecturing the West.
 With hundreds of officials and experts convening over the weekend in the nation's capital, the theme this year was not fear of protesters, but of the global impact of the troubles in the American housing sector, with many delegates faulting lax regulations and sleepy overseers in Europe and the United States.
 ''Allow me to point out the irony of this situation,'' Guido Mantega, the Brazilian finance minister, told reporters, contending that the ''countries that were references of good governance, of standards and codes for the financial systems'' were now the same countries where financial problems were threatening to wreck global prosperity. 
 In an interview, Trevor A. Manuel, the finance minister of South Africa, said: ''If one looks at the impact of the subprime crisis in the U.S., the losers are poor citizens who tend to be black and Hispanic. But it is also the large banks with an international profile in Europe and the United States that have taken a beating.''
 He added, ''It is clear that there was regulatory and supervisory failure.''
 The finance ministers and central bank governors from around the world spent the weekend discussing the market turbulence brought on by the credit crisis, declaring in a statement that they would continue to ''analyze the nature of the disturbances and consider lessons to be learned and actions needed.''
 But for many, the lessons were already clear. They said that Western regulators had ignored warning signs, Western banks had used exotic off-the-books ''conduits'' to buy and sell dubious mortgage products, Western rating agencies had gone along for the ride -- and now the whole world was suffering from Western excesses.
 Usually these meetings echo the old debates of what used to be called the north-south dialogue, in which the prosperous countries come to the rescue of the struggling poor countries. A few hundred protesters in Washington this weekend shouted slogans about exploitation by the wealthy. Along with protesters, of course, were closed streets, police barricades and limousines idling at many downtown hotels. 
 There was also new finger-pointing, and perhaps schadenfreude, discernible in the statement of the G-24 group of poor countries led by finance ministers of Argentina, Syria and Congo, who noted that ''developing countries are a new driving force as well as a stabilizing factor in the world economy.''
 Like the other ministers from what used to be called the third world, they cited the advanced countries' regulations and lack of transparency as causes for the mess. These countries are united in demanding more weight for themselves on the board of directors of the I.M.F. and the World Bank.
 In response to all this lecturing, the United States Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and his top aides fanned out at meeting after meeting to assure the finance ministers that although the impact of the market turmoil has yet to be fully understood or felt, there was no need to panic because the fundamentals of the American economy are sound.
 ''We recognize that there are some issues in the system that need to be addressed,'' said Clay Lowery, an assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs, cautioning against quick remedies that might be counterproductive. ''We want to make sure that there isn't a rush to judgment.''
 Robert K. Steel, a Treasury under secretary for domestic finance, told audiences how Treasury had worked with banks to create a new superfund aimed at loosening the credit markets. 
 ''The technical organization of this solution is complex,'' he told the Institute for International Finance, a global association of banks, insurance companies and other institutions. ''Initial progress is being made by the lead banks and participation is expected to broaden in the weeks ahead.''
 But many listeners were doubtful. Mr. Manuel, the South African finance minister, noted that the new fund had already gotten a skeptical response in speeches this weekend by Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, and Michel Camdessus, former head of the International Monetary Fund.
 Josef Ackermann, chairman of Deutsche Bank, also expressed skepticism in an interview. ''It would be premature to make a firm judgment, as not all details have been made known to us,'' he said, speaking for the board of the Institute for International Finance.
 Mr. Paulson and Mr. Steel told audiences that the United States had already set up advisory panels on auditing and regulations in the financial services industry. But their emphasis was on the industry itself setting up new codes of ''best practices,'' and not on government regulations.
 ''We're making progress, and working our way through the turmoil of capital markets,'' Mr. Paulson said after meeting with the finance ministers of Europe, Canada and Japan. ''We've got a ways to go. But we can all come together and say how we can learn from some of the mistakes and make some corrections.''
 The developing countries were not alone in giving a cold reception to the idea of voluntary action. Many European delegates were skeptical of the Bush administration's tack on the issue, which parallels its call for voluntary measures to regulate hedge funds and ''sovereign wealth funds,'' the government funds run by China, Russia and oil exporting countries that have begun to invest heavily in the West.
 ''We can't say this crisis was totally unexpected, but we didn't anticipate how this turmoil would happen, or when or how,'' Joaquin Almunia, the European commissioner for economic and monetary policy, said in an interview. ''We may need to adopt some new regulations, but right now our emphasis is on diagnosing the problem.''
 Much of the anger among developing countries was focused on the International Monetary Fund, which along with the World Bank was the host of the Washington meetings.
 The fund, which makes emergency loans to bail out countries threatened with insolvency, is widely detested in the developing world because of its stringent austerity programs imposed as a price for its bailouts. 
 Asian and Latin American countries rescued in the 1990s, many of them now healthy because of their exports, have paid off their loans to the fund but are still smarting from the lectures they got and the tax increases they were forced to adopt.
 The G-24 developing countries offered a stinging rebuke to the fund, lecturing it for in effect dropping the ball while banks in the West invested recklessly in subprime mortgages using lending facilities that were off their balance sheets.
 Fund officials were also defensive on that unusual rebuke. Rodrigo de Rato, the outgoing managing director of the fund, and a former finance minister of Spain, said it was unfair to castigate his organization for laxity. 
 Pulling out a paper issued by the fund last April, he said it proved ''we were already clearly stating our concerns'' about the situation. Indeed, the paper did warn that ''the subprime segment of the U.S. housing market is showing signs of credit quality deterioration'' and that the problem could ''deepen and spread to other markets.''

HEADLINE: An Epic Landlord-Tenant Fight, Crossing Years and Continents

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ; Yasuko Kamiizumi contributed reporting from Tokyo.

 BODY:
For nearly a quarter century, since Ronald Reagan was in the Oval Office, Lascelle Wright, 49, and his neighbors have been locked in a dispute with their landlord.
 Even by the standards of New York City, where such disputes are blood sport, their face-off has become a long, strange war of attrition.
 Mr. Wright is one of seven holdout tenants, most of them poor, elderly and in ill health. They want to remain in the Windermere, an echoing, ruined beauty of a building that was designated a city landmark in 2005. The alternative, they say, is the street.
 Mr. Wright's rent is $100 a month, but the landlord has provided no mailing address for his checks, so Mr. Wright has not paid even that. 
 A grand apartment house in the Romanesque Revival style, the Windermere is an eight-story building at West 57th Street and Ninth Avenue. It was famed in its late-19th-century heyday for its marble fireplaces, its uniformed ''hall boys'' and the latest in technological wonders, the hydraulic elevator and the telephone.
 Today, however, the Windermere is covered in graffiti, its bright red brick a sickly gray covered in scaffolding. The landlord, Masako Yamagata, wants Mr. Wright and his neighbors to vacate the building, which is a prime piece of Manhattan real estate. 
 The tenants contend that the landlord has let the Windermere go to seed. They say he has turned a blind eye to mice, roaches, water from the ceilings, shattered windows, hallways cold enough in winter to fog the tenants' breath, and pigeons in all seasons flying and defecating indoors.
 Nearly 7,000 miles away in Tokyo is Mr. Yamagata. The head of the Toa Construction Company, he is 89 years old and hospitalized.
 Last week, Mr. Yamagata did not respond to a list of questions. A woman who described herself as an employee supplied his age and the status of his health and said she would notify Mr. Yamagata of the inquiry. But she added, ''I cannot tell you when he will or if he will answer at all.'' 
 Last year, one of many housing activists who have tried to help the holdout tenants, Roseanne Haggerty, was finally granted a meeting with Mr. Yamagata in Tokyo after six years of entreaties.
 She described him as white-haired and charming, if enigmatic. In a wood-paneled office that reminded Ms. Haggerty of an American recreation room from the 1970s, Mr. Yamagata had many American souvenirs, including a small Statue of Liberty and an ashtray with a New York logo.
 In an informal gesture, he rolled up the sleeves of his white business shirt and showed Ms. Haggerty small scars on his arms from kidney dialysis. He could no longer visit New York because of his illness, he told her.
 Ms. Haggerty is the president of Common Ground, an advocacy group for the homeless that tried to buy the Windermere in the 1990s. In the nearly hourlong meeting, Mr. Yamagata, speaking through an interpreter, said he was frustrated with the holdout tenants. He said he had ambitious plans for the Windermere but could not ''act on them because the tenants won't move,'' Ms. Haggerty recalled. 
 In 2001, Toa Construction put the Windermere on the market, reportedly for $35 million, but apparently found no bidders. Ms. Haggerty asked him if he would ever sell and Mr. Yamagata replied no, several times.
 Last month, the clash between Mr. Yamagata and the tenants took a decisive turn following a routine inspection by the Fire Department.
 The city closed the Windermere until repairs, including the restoration of electricity, could be completed to make it safe for the tenants to live there. 
 The Red Cross arranged for the tenants to stay in a nearby hotel; they later were transferred to a single-room-occupancy hotel, in accommodations paid for by the city. 
 Today, the tenants are scheduled to appear in housing court on a motion to hold Mr. Yamagata and Toa in contempt for failing to repair the Windermere. Mr. Yamagata or his legal representative did not appear in court last month.
 For now, Mr. Wright and his fellow tenants are unable to return to their apartments in the Windermere and are uncomfortable in their small rooms at the Hotel Yale on West 97th Street, their temporary housing. The city pays $45 a night for each of the three single men and $55 a night for each of the two couples.
 Bennett Baumer, a tenant organizer with Housing Conservation Coordinators, a nonprofit group that provides legal and other aid for the tenants, describes the holdout tenants as retired and unemployed. 
 One resident has a history of mental illness. In 2006, an appeals court denied Toa Construction's plan to evict him despite the tenant's contention that he preferred sleeping on park benches.
 Dennis Neville, another holdout tenant, is voluble although he cannot talk, because of throat cancer. In a long e-mail message, he described conditions in the Windermere before the tenants were evacuated.
 ''Prior to the vacate order'' on Sept. 19, Mr. Neville wrote, ''we were without electricity for a week, because they didn't pay the bill.'' 
 Gale A. Brewer, the local city councilwoman, worked ''very hard to finally get it turned back on, and it was,'' he wrote.
 Mr. Neville added that the Fire Department was justified in closing the building. 
 ''The sprinklers weren't working, the powers that be weren't doing anything,'' Mr. Neville wrote, adding that the vacant apartments were full of refuse that had not been carted away.
 The Windermere's decline has been long and slow. Built in 1881, it is older than but not as famous as the Chelsea Hotel on West 23rd Street (1883) or the Dakota on West 72nd Street (1884). 
 In the beginning, the Windermere had 39 large apartments, some with as many as six bedrooms. Today, the number of units has quadrupled, with 156 apartments carved out of the old ones.
 Through the mid-20th century, the Windermere's residents became more working-class, with stenographers, dressmakers, waiters and plumbers being typical tenants.
 By the late 1960s, at a time when the neighborhood was widely known as Hell's Kitchen, the tenants included artists, actors and musicians, but also drug users and prostitutes.
 When Mr. Wright became a tenant in 1980, the Windermere was about half full, with about 80 families, he recalled. 
 By 1982, a previous landlord was offering incentives of up to $5,000 an apartment to vacate the building. Many left. By 1986, when Mr. Yamagata's Toa Construction bought the building, Mr. Wright counted only a dozen or so families remaining, most protected from eviction under the city's housing laws. 
 For the next two decades, the tenants and their advocates, in and out of housing court, attempted to resolve the standoff. 
 On Sept. 19, the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, using reports from fire inspectors, cited Toa for 209 violations, including fire safety problems like exposed wiring, ''the accumulation of refuse and/or rubbish'' and ''no electrical supply entire building.''
 At the contempt hearing today, Mr. Yamagata could agree to the repairs. 
 If he does not, the city could perform the repairs and send him the bill. 
 Or some form of long-term alternative housing might be sought for the tenants until the building is habitable, according to Housing Conservation Coordinators.
 Mr. Wright said he remained calm throughout the fight. 
 ''I don't curse, I don't yell,'' he said.
 ''The landlord is waiting for us to die,'' he said. ''But I'm 49, and he's, what, almost 90?''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 26, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about a long-running landlord-tenant dispute at the Windermere, a landmark building on the West Side of Manhattan that has fallen into disrepair, misspelled the given name of a housing activist who has tried to help the tenants. She is Rosanne Haggerty, not Roseanne.

HEADLINE: IRAQ AND TURKEY SEE TENSIONS RISE AFTER AN AMBUSH

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Reporting was contributed by Sebnem Arsu in Istanbul; Alissa J. Rubin, Qais Mizher and Khalid al-Ansary in Baghdad; an Iraqi employee of The New York Times in Sulaimaniya; and Sheryl Gay Stolberg in Washington.

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
A brazen ambush by Kurdish militants that left at least 12 Turkish soldiers dead touched off a major escalation in Turkey-Iraq tensions on Sunday, bringing fears that Turkey would retaliate immediately by sending troops across the border into Iraq. But Turkey's prime minister said he delayed a decision, after Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice personally intervened.
 The ambush by a large group of Kurdish militants about three miles from the border with Iraq early on Sunday was seen as a direct provocation on the part of the militants, who have increasingly staged raids into Turkey from hide-outs in the mountains of northern Iraq.
 It was the most serious attack in recent memory by the militants, separatist fighters of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K., and came only four days after the Turkish Parliament formally approved contingency plans for military retaliation across the border. 
 The Turkish military struck back inside Turkey, killing as many as 32 Kurdish militants, a government spokesman said. But the Kurdish ambush still drew strong public outrage here, and its brazenness could effectively force the government to make good on its warning to send forces into northern Iraq.
 Such action by Turkey, a NATO ally, would be extremely embarrassing for the United States, which has military control over the territory that the Turks are threatening to invade. Moreover, a Turkish advance into northern Iraq would instantly bring fresh troubles to a country where the United States is preoccupied with the war. And it would complicate stability in the broader region, which is generally antagonistic to American policy. Iran made remarks criticizing American policy on Sunday. Syria did the same four days before. 
 Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, convened an emergency security meeting with Turkey's top officials on Sunday night, in Ankara, Turkey's capital, to discuss an appropriate response. 
 Ms. Rice called him shortly before the meeting began, Mr. Erdogan said on national television. 
 ''She expressed their seriousness in this matter by not only saying that they assessed the issue in a highly sensitive way,'' Mr. Erdogan said of his conversation with Ms. Rice, ''but also, beyond emphasizing our righteousness, she said, 'allow us a few days.'''
 There was no immediate comment from Ms. Rice about the exchange, but earlier in the day the Bush administration strongly condemned the Kurdish ambush. Sean McCormack, a State Department spokesman, did not return telephone messages for comment on Sunday night.
 For their part, Iraq officials offered a mixed response. While denouncing the Kurdish ambush and expressing the wish for good relations with Turkey, they rejected Turkish demands that militant leaders be captured and handed over to Turkey. ''We are looking for peace, not war, and to solve problems peacefully,'' said Jalal Talabani, Iraq's president. But Mr. Talabani, who is himself a Kurd, added tartly, ''We will not hand any Kurdish man to Turkey, even a Kurdish cat.''
 The confrontation over P.K.K. activities in northern Iraq has brought Turkish-American relations to their lowest point in years. Turkey says the United States should do more to help fight the Kurdish group, which has killed nearly 40 Turkish soldiers in recent weeks in cross-border raids. 
 Protesters marched in several cities, including Samsun on the Black Sea and Istanbul. In central Turkey, they broke windows in offices of the main Kurdish political party. ''With this incident, the arrow left the bow,'' Armagan Kuloglu, a retired Turkish major general, said in a telephone interview. ''No room is left for the government to hesitate, postpone or fail to launch a cross-border operation.'' 
 In another attack, apparently by Kurdish militants, a minibus in a Turkish wedding convoy struck a bomb, wounding 17 civilians, according to the state-run Anatolian News Agency.
 Mr. Erdogan used diplomatic language to say that a final decision about retaliation had not yet been made. He said Turkey would wait until all ''military requirements'' had been met. ''The government will use this authority when the military requirements exist,'' he said. ''When requirements do not exist, such a step cannot be taken on emotional ground, because some people request or wish for it.'' 
 He said he expected the United States to take ''swift steps'' against the militants.
 Turkey has worked hard to avoid military action, said a Western official, because it knows that an offensive would damage relations with the United States as well as Turkey's bid to join the European Union, a goal Mr. Erdogan's government has aggressively pressed.
 ''We don't want to go into northern Iraq -- it's a mess,'' said Suat Kinikli, a lawmaker from Mr. Erdogan's party and a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. ''We are a country negotiating with the European Union.''
 But the Sunday ambush on Turkish troops was carried out by a much larger force than the P.K.K. typically uses, the Western official said, and appeared aimed at drawing Turkey into conflict.
 ''I think we've passed the threshold,'' Mr. Kinikli said. ''It looks like for two days or three days there will be a holding off and a waiting period. Unless the U.S. comes up with something magic in the next few days, which is highly unlikely, we'll probably go in.''
 Turkey's defense minister, Vecdi Gonul, speaking to reporters in Kiev after talks with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, played down plans for swift military action against the Kurdish militants. ''We have plans to cross the border, however, not immediately,'' Turkey's Anatolian agency quoted Mr. Gonul as saying.
 The United States has pressed Iraqi officials to take the problem seriously in recent months. Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq visited Turkey in August, and the two countries concluded a security agreement in September, though the regional Kurdish government repudiated it.
 But Turkish officials said Sunday that rhetoric would no longer help. ''Statements on terror will not satisfy us,'' Cemil Cicek, a government spokesman, said in a televised news conference. ''In terms of statements, there has been nothing left unspoken. We expected and will expect firm steps from our counterparts. At this point, there is no importance of anything said by anyone.''
 The White House said, ''Attacks from Iraqi territory need to be dealt with swiftly by the Iraqi government and the Kurdish regional authorities.''
 The American ambassador in Turkey, Ross Wilson, said, ''I have been shocked by the news reports today.'' 
 After a meeting with Massoud Barzani, leader of the regional Kurdish government, President Talabani called on the P.K.K. to lay down its arms and leave, a command that brought a skeptical response from Mr. Erdogan.
 ''These assessments of Talabani do not personally satisfy me,'' he said. ''It is beautiful to say such words. The expressions are beautiful. But we would like to see what its outcome is going to be.''
 At the same time, Mr. Talabani seemed to shrug off Turkish requests that the Iraqis hand over P.K.K. leaders hiding in northern Iraq.
 ''The leaders of P.K.K. do exist in Kurdistan's rugged mountains, but the Turkish Army with all its power could not stem or arrest them, so how can we?'' he saidafter the meeting which took place in Sulaimaniya in northern Iraq. ''Handing over P.K.K. leaders to Turkey is a dream that will never be realized.''
 Iraq's foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, said in an interview that there were a number of steps Iraq could take short of military action against the P.K.K. militants, including disrupting their activities, intercepting shipments of weapons and denying them supplies of food. 
 ''Yes, there are responsibilities on our side,'' he said. ''Turkey has some legitimate security concerns over the P.K.K. So come let's sit down and talk with the United States.''
 Details of the attack, which took place near the village of Daglica, were still unclear. Turkey's private NTV television reported that the Turkish soldiers died when the Kurds blew up a bridge as a military convoy was passing, but the government did not confirm that account. The Kurds said on a Web site that they had captured eight soldiers, but that could not be verified. 
 The military said only that the attack took place ''in three locations'' shortly after midnight, and listed the names of 12 soldiers who had been killed. It said in a statement that it had continued to monitor the area where the P.K.K. fled, and that it had been firing at 63 ''possible targets.'' 
 ''Possible repercussion of such an operation on our relations with the U.S., or the European Union, or economy are now of secondary importance behind our national security and well-being,'' Mr. Kuloglu said.
 Voters Back Turkish Changes
 ANKARA, Turkey, Oct. 21 (Reuters) -- Voters on Sunday resoundingly approved a referendum on constitutional changes that include elections of future presidents by the people instead of Parliament.
 Preliminary results showed 69 percent of voters approved the referendum proposed by Mr. Erdogan's governing party.
 .
 The vote will not affect the status of President Abdullah Gul, elected by parliament for a seven-year term in August. His successor will be elected by the people in 2014.

HEADLINE: Chavez's Plan for Development Bank Moves Ahead

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Simon Romero contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela.

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
The idea by Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's president, to create a Bank of the South to finance regional development projects is moving forward, aided by the tacit approval of Brazil, which has South America's largest economy.
 But doubts persist about the need for such a bank, which many economists and analysts continue to see as a political move by Mr. Chavez to try to spread his influence and carry out his crusade against Washington-based multilateral institutions like the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
 Seven South American countries are expected to inaugurate the new bank at a ceremony on Nov. 3 in Caracas, Venezuela's capital, where it will be based. At a meeting here earlier this month the countries -- Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela -- signed off on the idea of creating an institution with up to $7 billion in initial capital, paving the way for the bank to begin operating as early as 2008. 
 An eighth country, Colombia, said earlier this month that it wanted to be included as well. Colombia's president, Alvaro Uribe, said his country would join the new bank as long as it was an ''expression of solidarity and brotherhood,'' and not a rejection of the international lending institutions. 
 The Bank of the South will be organized to promote investment in infrastructure and could help stimulate greater regional trade and integration. Mr. Chavez says he sees it as an alternative financing institution to the World Bank, the I.D.B. and the International Monetary Fund, all of which have significant Washington involvement. 
 ''The idea is to rely on a development agency for us, led by us,'' Rodrigo Cabezas, Venezuela's finance minister, said earlier this month.
 The bank's formation comes at a time when South America is awash in development money, both public and private, and when most of the continent's economies have increased their credit ratings to levels that make the cost of borrowing cheaper than during the past two decades. That is one reason that Chile, which has the continent's best credit rating, has not signed onto the project.
 ''The macroeconomic picture in Latin America is as good as it has ever been,'' Luis Alberto Moreno, the president of the I.D.B., said in an interview last week. Still, he said: ''There is plenty of room for everybody. The challenges of development in Latin America are very big.''
 Brazil has sent mixed messages about its support for the institution. It declined to give its support until clarifying that the bank's role would be limited to aiding investment in the region, and would not create an emergency fund to bail out countries in economic crisis as the I.M.F. does, which Mr. Chavez had set as an initial goal.
 ''Brazil has shown less interest because it has the greatest credit capacity,'' said Guido Mantega, the country's finance minister. But, he said, ''we continue to support the project because it will benefit our commercial partners and Brazilian businesses.''
 In an interview last month, Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, dismissed concerns that Venezuela would try to exert more control over the bank. ''It is small-minded to think that one bank created with the multilateral representation of many countries would be at the service of one person or one country,'' Mr. da Silva said. ''It's not that simple.''
 But some analysts say that despite Brazil's grudging support, the bank's potential for politicization is a concern. ''Brazil wants to avoid showing that it is somehow part of a Chavez-led institution that is making loans for projects that are being judged more for their political ideology than for their economic viability,'' said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington that focuses on Latin America.
 Brazil's own development bank, the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social, has become a force, lending $34 billion in the past year for Brazilian projects. Before last week's annual meetings in Washington of the World Bank and the I.M.F., Luciano Coutinho, the president of the Brazilian bank, said he would propose creating a fund through his bank whose purpose would seem to duplicate the mission of the Bank of the South.
 The fund, Mr. Coutinho said, would finance integration projects in Brazil and South America with the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
 Several issues remain unresolved about how the Bank of the South would function, including how much capital each country would commit, what its lending conditions would be and whether the members would have equal voting rights. 
 Mr. Mantega, Brazil's finance minister, said it was still unclear whether Brazil and Venezuela would enter the bank with higher capital levels. Brazil appeared to make a major concession last week, however, when Mr. Mantega said each country would have voting rights in the bank's administrative council.
 Meanwhile, development banks already based in the region, like the Corporacion Andina de Fomento in Caracas, are waiting to see how an institution more closely aligned with Mr. Chavez's political objectives will compete in granting loans. 
 The new bank could struggle to be competitive with the I.D.B., especially, which has investment grade status in the international markets due to the participation of the United States and other developed nations, and therefore obtains resources at relatively low cost. None of the future partners of the Bank of the South borrow on terms readily available to rich, industrialized nations. If the bank is able to obtain resources in the international capital markets, it is likely to be at higher costs than those paid by Brazil or Colombia, economists say.
 Still, efforts by leaders in the region to remain on good terms with Mr. Chavez appear to be outweighing uncertainty about the new institution. Countries like Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, after all, are profiting as never before from exporting food and consumer goods to Venezuela, where domestic producers have been stymied by price controls and uncertainty over Mr. Chavez's economic policies.

HEADLINE: A Dearth of Taxes

 BODY:
President Bush considers himself a champion tax cutter, but all the leading Republican presidential candidates are eager to outdo him. Their zeal is misguided. This country's meager tax take puts its economic prospects at risk and leaves the government ill equipped to face the challenges from globalization. 
 According to a report from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank run by the industrialized countries, the taxes collected last year by federal, state and local governments in the United States amounted to 28.2 percent of gross domestic product. That rate was one of the lowest among wealthy countries -- about five percentage points of G.D.P. lower than Canada's, and more than eight points lower than New Zealand's. And Danes, Germans and Slovaks paid more in taxes, as a share of their economies.
 Politicians on the right have continuously paraded the specter of statism to rally voters' support for tax cuts, mainly for the rich. But the meager tax take leaves the United States ill prepared to compete. From universal health insurance to decent unemployment insurance, other rich nations provide their citizens benefits that the United States government simply cannot afford. 
 The consequences include some 47 million Americans without health insurance and companies like General Motors being dragged to the brink by the cost of providing workers and pensioners with medical care. 
 President Bush and his tax-averse friends extol the fact that the tax haul has risen over the past two years as evidence of the wisdom of his tax cuts. But if anything, the numbers underscore the economy's weaknesses -- mainly its growing inequality. 
 Indeed, the growth in tax revenue since 2004 is due mostly to the spectacular increase in corporate profits, which have grown at the expense of workers' wages. Moreover, it's proving ephemeral. As economic growth has decelerated, corporate profits are losing steam and the growth of tax revenue has begun to slow. This pretty much guarantees that the revenue will prove too low to face the challenges ahead.

HEADLINE: Yankees Face One Quandary After Another

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The lineup is set: Joe Girardi today, Don Mattingly tomorrow, Tony Pena on Wednesday.
 That is the order in which Brian Cashman, general manager of the Yankees, and his aides will interview candidates who are on their initial list to fill the hottest managerial seat in recent years.
 The embers from the Joe Torre conflagration will still be smoldering when Girardi, Mattingly and Pena travel to Tampa, Fla., and take the first steps in the Yankees' plan to replace Torre, the manager who directed the team to 12 postseason appearances in his 12-year tenure. He faltered by not getting beyond the first round the last three years with the richest managerial contract ($19.2 million) in baseball history. 
 The Yankees will very likely add other candidates to their list, but Mattingly and Girardi are considered the leading ones. Mattingly has been viewed as George Steinbrenner's favorite for the job, and his desire should carry the most weight, unless Cashman and others of influence think differently and persuade him on their choice.
 Steinbrenner's sons, Hank and Hal, and front-office executives will enter the consideration as a second phase, and ultimately they and Cashman will make a recommendation to Steinbrenner.
 But the selection of a new manager is not the only immediate task facing the Yankees. They have until 10 days after the end of the World Series to reach an agreement with Alex Rodriguez on a contract extension that would keep him from opting out of the last three years of his contract and becoming a free agent.
 The Rodriguez dance has already begun. The Yankees and Scott Boras, his agent, have been circling each other carefully, looking for soft spots on which they may be able to capitalize.
 Boras did a flurry of weekend interviews in which he raised issues that he said could influence his client's opt-out decision, particularly who the manager will be, as if A-Rod and Torre had a terrific relationship. Remember, it was Torre who embarrassed Rodriguez by batting him eighth in Game 4 of the division series last year, without telling him ahead of time.
 With his cautionary comments, Boras was doing what Boras does best. He was attempting to raise the Yankees' anxiety about retaining Rodriguez and driving up the price to retain him.
 As their part of the dance, the Yankees have iterated and reiterated that if Rodriguez exercises the opt-out clause, they will not negotiate with him as a free agent.
 Some people, perhaps even Boras, are skeptical of that position. But the Yankees have a sound economic reason for taking that position. If Rodriguez remains with the Yankees, the Texas Rangers, from whom the Yankees obtained him, will pay $30 million of the $91 million Rodriguez is owed for the last three years of the original contract.
 If he were to opt out, that contract would be voided, and the Yankees would have to pay all of the money they negotiate with him. 
 The way the dance has begun, it appears that the Yankees and Boras will tread carefully for the next two and a half weeks, waiting for the other to blink. 
 ''We'll do what we think is appropriate and live with his decision,'' Cashman said yesterday. ''If he opts out, it's a statement that this isn't the place he wants to be.''
 If Rodriguez opts out, would the Yankees go back on their word and still try to sign him? ''This is my 10th year as general manager,'' Cashman said. ''I try not to put myself in position to look foolish.''
 What is unknown is whether there are teams that would pursue Rodriguez as a free agent. Baseball people are divided on that subject. Some say no team besides the Yankees would pay $30 million or more a year for 5 to 10 years. Others speculate that the Cubs, the Angels, the Dodgers, the Red Sox and the Giants would. 
 The Cubs' ownership, however, isn't settled. Arte Moreno, the Angels' owner, is thought unlikely to pay the price. The Dodgers, hurting somewhat from the Angels' marketing invasion of their territory, may get involved only if the Angels do.
 The Red Sox may because they have only one year left of Manny Ramirez's $20-million-a-year contract. And the Giants, who would be a surprise contender, no longer have Barry Bonds's contract to pay and need a big hitter and a gate attraction. The Giants have a load of debt and need to sustain the flow of people into their park. 
 Potential bidders should keep one fact in mind: in Rodriguez's 13 years in the major leagues, no team he has played for has played in the World Series, let alone won the World Series.

HEADLINE: Cheney, Like President, Has a Warning for Iran

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: LANDSDOWNE, Va., Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney issued a pointed warning to Iran on Sunday, calling the government in Tehran ''a growing obstacle to peace in the Middle East'' and promising ''serious consequences'' if the government there does not abandon its nuclear program.
 The remarks, just days after President Bush suggested that a nuclear-armed Iran could lead to ''World War III,'' amounted to Part II of a one-two punch from the administration at a moment when it is trying to persuade its allies in Europe to impose stiffer sanctions on Tehran. Those efforts grew more complicated on Saturday when Iran's chief nuclear negotiator resigned on the eve of crucial talks with Europe. 
 ''The Iranian regime needs to know that if it stays on its present course, the international community is prepared to impose serious consequences,'' Mr. Cheney said, without specifying what those might be. ''The United States joins other nations in sending a clear message: We will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.''
 Mr. Cheney delivered his warnings during a wide-ranging foreign policy speech to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a research organization. During the 35-minute talk, he also took aim at Syria, accusing Damascus of using ''bribery and intimidation'' to influence the coming elections in Lebanon, and he presented the case for the administration's muscular approach to investigating suspected terrorists.
 But Mr. Cheney reserved his harshest language for Iran. Calling it ''the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism,'' he said, ''our country, and the entire international community, cannot stand by as a terror-supporting state fulfills its most aggressive ambitions.''
 That language is not radically different from what Mr. Cheney has used in the past. But people at the conference said that, placed in the context of Mr. Bush's remarks, it represented a significant step toward increasing pressure on Iran. The speech seemed to lay the groundwork for the threat of military action -- either because the administration actually intends to use force or because it wants to use the threat of force to prod Europe into action.
 ''This week we heard a significant ratcheting up of the rhetoric,'' said Dennis Ross, who served as a Middle East envoy for President Clinton and the first President Bush and is now a scholar at the Washington Institute. Repeating Mr. Cheney's remark about serious consequences, he said those were ''strong words'' with ''serious implications.''
 Mr. Bush has repeatedly said the administration would not ''tolerate'' a nuclear-armed Iran. But during a news conference on Wednesday, the president went further, saying of Iran: ''If you're interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon.'' 
 That distinction -- having the knowledge to make a nuclear weapon, as opposed to actually having a weapon -- is one the administration has not made in the past. David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute who moderated a panel discussion before and after Mr. Cheney's speech, said the vice president also seemed to draw a new red line when, instead of saying it is ''not acceptable'' for Iran to have a nuclear weapon, he said the world ''will not allow'' it.
 ''The first is a condition,'' Mr. Makovsky said. ''The second is a commitment.''
 In an interview on Friday, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, made it clear that he thought immediate attacks inside Iran would be a bad idea, while warning Tehran not to ''mistake restraint for lack of commitment or lack of concern or lack of capability.'' 
 The United Nations Security Council has already imposed sanctions on Iran and called on the government in Tehran to abandon its program to enrich uranium, and Iran has defied those sanctions. Now the United States is beginning to examine even tougher economic penalties, including a far broader cutoff of bank lending and technology to Iran than in the past.
 Since 2005, Iran has taken a two-pronged approach toward the West, allowing its chief negotiator, Ali Larijani, to engage in talks with Europe and the International Atomic Energy Agency while the country's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, says there is no room to negotiate. Mr. Larijani has been viewed as more moderate than Mr. Ahmadinejad. Mr. Larijani resigned Saturday and is being replaced by more of a hard-liner.
 The Bush administration, for its part, seems to be making an appeal directly to the Iranian people in the hope that they will rise up against the Ahmadinejad government. The White House wants to avoid any perception that it would use military force to bring about a change in government but has made clear that it would be only too happy if the Iranians brought it about themselves.
 Mr. Bush said Wednesday that he intended to continue to pursue a policy of isolating Iran with the hope that ''at some point in time, somebody else shows up and says it's not worth the isolation.'' 
 Mr. Cheney echoed that theme. ''The spirit of freedom is stirring in Iran,'' he said, adding, ''America looks forward to the day when Iranians reclaim their destiny, the day that our two countries, as free and democratic nations, can be the closest of friends.''

HEADLINE: The French Way, and Ours: Let Us Compare

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Roger Cohen ('' 'The American' in France,'' column, Oct. 18) extols President Nicolas Sarkozy and Finance Minister Christine Lagarde's plan to stimulate the French economy and reduce unemployment by eliminating or reducing many worker benefits. 
 What Mr. Cohen doesn't mention is that the new French government's ultimate goal is to emulate the United States' relatively laissez-faire economy. The result would be to transform France's far more equitable economy into one resembling our increasingly inequitable new ''gilded age.''
 No wonder French workers are unhappy. Do they want to see the wages of 90 percent of their citizens stagnate while 10 percent reap huge income increases like the ones we have seen over the last 30 years? Peter Schanck
 Santa Fe, N.M., Oct. 18, 2007
 To the Editor:
 It isn't enough that Americans are now routinely working 14-hour days, that no one cooks a real dinner anymore, that kids and parents stand around eating takeout in the kitchen at 10 p.m., that dinnertime conversation is dead, that the two-week family vacation is a thing of the past? Now we have to do this to the French? 
 If they have spent any time thinking at all, they'll conclude that a life of ever more fancy gadgets and bigger houses to clean but no leisure time is a poor exchange. We could learn a few things from them. Vive le 35-hour workweek!

 To the Editor: 
 Roger Cohen's column called to mind my recent visit to Paris. All those young people engaged in animated conversations at the cafes, reading or smooching in the Luxembourg Gardens during broad daylight. 
 Why weren't they in their offices or working on their laptops or BlackBerries? Such a waste of time and energy when they could have been closing in on the deal. 
 Now with a weak dollar, perhaps a week in New York will help them see what they're really missing.

HEADLINE: College Costs Outpace Inflation Rate

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Tuition and fees at public and private universities have risen this year at more than double the rate of inflation, with prices increasing faster at public institutions, the College Board said in reports released yesterday. 
 These increases in the cost of higher education continue to drive up the amount that students and families borrow, with the fastest growth in private loans, the reports found. 
 Tuition and other costs, not including room and board, rose on average to $6,185 at public four-year colleges this year, up 6.6 percent from last year, while tuition at private colleges hit $23,712, an increase of 6.3 percent. At public two-year institutions, average tuition and fees rose 4.2 percent to $2,361. 
 Last year, tuition and fees at public institutions rose 5.7 percent; at private ones, 6.3 percent and at public two-year institutions, 3.8 percent.
 ''The average price of college is continuing to rise more rapidly than the consumer price index, more rapidly than prices in the economy,'' Sandy Baum, a co-author of the report who is a senior policy analyst for the College Board and a professor at Skidmore College, told reporters at a news conference yesterday.
 Ms. Baum added that the prices ''are probably higher than most of us want.''
 Those price increases reflect increases in the sticker price that colleges advertise, though, Ms. Baum said, the average student does not pay that full amount. At public universities, the average student gets about $3,600 in grants and tax benefits, lowering the actual cost to around $2,600. At private institutions, aid totals about $9,300, bringing the cost to $14,400.
 But even the net price, after taking into account grants and other forms of aid, is rising more quickly than prices of other goods and than family incomes. In recent years, consumer prices have risen less than 3 percent a year, while net tuition at public colleges has risen by 8.8 percent and at private ones, 6.7 percent.
 The changes in tuition at public institutions closely track changes in financing they receive from state governments and other public sources, the report found. When state and local support for public colleges declined over the last seven years, tuition and fees rose more quickly, and as state support has grown of late, the pace of increases fell, it said.
 ''We hope that state governments -- which really set tuition prices at most public colleges and universities -- will do their part to reinvest in higher education,'' David Ward, president of the American Council on Education, said in a statement released by the College Board.
 Private loans, those not guaranteed by the federal government, continued to be the fastest-growing form of borrowing, totaling more than $17 billion in the 2006-7 academic year. In the same period, students and their families borrowed $59.6 billion in federally guaranteed loans.
 The report also included data on loans by full-time students at for-profit institutions, finding that in 2003-4, they took out an average of $6,750 in loans, approaching the $7,320 borrowed by students at private colleges and exceeding the $5,390 borrowed by those at public four-year institutions and $3,180 at public two-year ones.
 ''College officials tell us not to worry because there's plenty of financial aid,'' said Robert Shireman, executive director of the Project on Student Debt, a nonprofit organization financed largely by the Pew Charitable Trusts. ''But that aid is clearly not going where it's needed, because student debt is up by an even greater margin than tuition -- an 8 percent increase from 2005 to 2006, by our accounting.''
 The report prompted Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, to pledge to try to ''rein in'' tuition increases. Mr. Miller added, ''Making college more affordable and accessible for all qualified students is a top priority.''
 Last year the average Pell grant, the federal government's grant to the neediest students, declined for the second year in a row, after taking into account the effects of inflation. Ms. Baum, the economist, said she expected that decline to stop because Congress recently enacted increases in the maximum amount of the grant, which held constant at $4,050 for four years but will rise to $5,400 over the next five years.
 The College Board's study drew on responses from 2,976 institutions to questionnaires sent out last October, as well as government agencies and organizations like the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
 According to the study, the cost of room and board has also continued to rise and at many public colleges dwarfs actual tuition. At four-year public institutions, tuition, room and board on average now total $13,589; at private colleges, $32,307. 
 Ms. Baum emphasized that while the College Board reports provided information on the general cost of higher education, costs varied around the country as well as at different kinds of colleges.
 ''The average numbers don't tell the story for any individual student,'' Ms. Baum said.

HEADLINE: Afghan Security Concerns Rise With Strife, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
In a 12-month period during which the Taliban insurgency spread in Afghanistan and violence rose in the country's major cities, Afghans grew increasingly concerned about security and more people came to regard it as the most serious issue facing the nation, according to the results of a poll set for release on Tuesday. 
 About a third of the poll's respondents said security issues, including terrorism and violence, were the single biggest problem in Afghanistan, a significant increase from a similar poll last year, in which only 22 percent gave top priority to security concerns. 
 ''Insecurity is the main reason for the people to believe that the country is headed in the wrong direction,'' the authors of the poll wrote. ''In the eyes of men and women of Afghanistan, the security situation in the country has deteriorated.''
 But the survey, financed by the United States, found that, over all, Afghans have about the same view of their country's path as they did last year. 
 Forty-two percent of respondents said the country was moving in the right direction, compared with 44 percent last year, according to the Asia Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, which conducted both surveys. With a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points, the change is not considered significant.
 Twenty-four percent said the country was headed in the wrong direction this year, compared with 21 percent in 2006. 
 The poll was financed by the United States Agency for International Development and conducted by a team of Afghans, who interviewed more than 6,200 people in June in rural and urban areas in all of Afghanistan's provinces. The main goal was to gauge public sentiments on social and political issues, ''in a country that is undergoing rapid changes,'' the authors said. 
 In addition to security issues, respondents listed unemployment, the poor economy and corruption as major concerns.
 A majority of those interviewed -- 57 percent -- said national corruption had worsened in the past year, but fewer than half said it had worsened at the provincial and local levels. Nevertheless, 60 percent said corruption remained a major problem at the provincial level.
 The poll said development-related issues remained the biggest local problems, with respondents citing, in order of importance, electricity, unemployment, water, education and roads. 
 The only exception to those priorities was in the southwestern provinces, where the Taliban insurgency has been most active and security was regarded as the biggest local problem. 
 Of those who said Afghanistan was headed in the right direction, 39 percent said reconstruction was the biggest factor and 34 percent cited good security. 
 About 25 percent of those surveyed said the government was doing a ''very good'' job and 55 percent said it was doing a ''somewhat good'' job.
 The survey also found evidence to suggest that the ideas of political tolerance and freedom of expression were not yet firmly rooted in Afghan society. A large proportion of respondents said Afghans did not feel free to express their political opinions in the area where they live, and 69 percent agreed it was not acceptable to speak critically about the government in public. 
 The survey showed confidence in some national institutions, including the security forces, the news media, tribal and provincial councils, aid groups and some government entities. But fewer than half of the respondents expressed confidence in the government's justice system, political parties and local militias.
 The poll showed mixed feelings about the empowerment of women. About 53 percent of the respondents said they ''strongly agreed'' that women should have equal rights, while 32 percent ''somewhat agreed.''
 A majority of men and women agreed that women should be allowed to work outside the home, but a majority of men and women also agreed that women should wear a burqa in public. 
 Respondents expressed respect for religion. About 66 percent said they believed democracy could be Islamic, while 29 percent said democracy challenged Islamic values.

HEADLINE: City Cabdrivers Strike Again, But Protest Gets Little Notice

BYLINE: By ELIAS E. LOPEZ; Diane Cardwell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A one-day strike called by the New York Taxi Workers Alliance had little effect on the daily commute yesterday, according to city officials, commuters and drivers.
 At a news conference yesterday afternoon in Downtown Brooklyn, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the strike, which began at 5 a.m. and was to end today at 5 a.m., had ''no appreciable impact'' on transportation in the city.
 That seemed to be the case at some of the major traffic arteries of Manhattan, where the flow of yellow cabs seemed unchanged. 
 ''If there's a taxi strike going on, it certainly doesn't look like it,'' said a man handing out free newspapers near Pennsylvania Station, as dozens of taxis lined up to pick up fares in front of Madison Square Garden.
 The taxi strike, the second in less than two months, was called by the alliance, which says it represents 10,000 cabdrivers, to protest a city plan requiring taxicabs to install global positioning systems and credit- and debit-card readers.
 The group says the new equipment will mean an extra cost for drivers: 5 percent in fees on credit-card transactions.
 Yesterday, city officials put in effect a contingency plan that consisted of a zone-based fare structure and allowed drivers to pick up multiple fares. Trips inside one zone cost a flat fee of $10 per rider; an extra $5 was charged for additional zones. Tolls were included in the price of the trips.
 Outside the headquarters of the Taxi and Limousine Commission in Lower Manhattan, Bhairavi Desai, the alliance's executive director, addressed those protesting the commission's decision to move ahead with the technological requirements. The commission regulates more than 13,000 medallion taxicabs.
 After the demonstration, Ms. Desai said the strike did have an effect at the airports.
 ''If the impact was minimal, why did the city implement a contingency plan?'' she asked.
 But then she offered explanations about why many cabdrivers had decided not to participate in the strike. ''It was too much economic pressure for a lot of drivers,'' she said. ''Also because they feel there's nothing they can do. It's a feeling that comes with the T.L.C. having absolute power.''
 Lack of participation also diminished the impact of the previous strike , on Sept. 5 and 6.
 But back then the presence of cabs on the streets shrank enough to make would-be passengers spend more time with their hands in the air and to stretch five-minute waits for a cab at the airport to half an hour at some terminals.
 That did not appear to be the case yesterday.
 In Midtown, a couple stepped out of a taxi after a ride from La Guardia Airport.
 ''We had no trouble getting a ride,'' said Brittney Bone of Alabama. ''He actually sought us out.''
 One driver, Jose Laguardia, 65, said, ''It's too late to protest now.
 ''Technology is a necessity,'' Mr. Laguardia said. ''There's nothing we can do at this point but keep working, keep driving.''
 Ms. Desai said the alliance planned to continue to work with drivers who object to the requirements. ''We plan to consolidate our organizing goals and regroup,'' she said. ''We want to give drivers more time to gain economic strength for when we decide to strike again.''

HEADLINE: Montana and Kansas Take On Big Coal

 BODY:
On Saturday, The Times's business section featured two reports from unexpected parts of the country that should cheer the bipartisan coalition in the Senate that wants to move ahead quickly on legislation limiting emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas. The reports provide further evidence, if any were needed, that Congress should not listen to the coal industry's siren call for special treatment. 
 One report, from Montana, described an increasingly vocal movement opposed to new coal-fired power plants on the Great Plains. The movement includes not only the usual suspects in the environmental community but also conservative and largely Republican ranchers worried about the impact of global warming on their water supply. 
 In addition, The Times reported that a state regulator in Kansas had denied a permit for a large coal-fired power plant because of the global warming gases it would emit. As far as anyone knows, that's the first time that a power plant has been blocked for that reason alone.
 Now it's Washington's turn. A Senate subcommittee will soon take up a very promising global warming bill written by Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and John Warner of Virginia -- the first step in what could be an arduous legislative journey. The bill would place a mandatory, declining cap on emissions from the electric power, manufacturing and transportation sectors of the economy. It aims to cut total emissions to 63 percent below 2005 levels by 2050, less than many scientists say is necessary but still very ambitious. 
 The coal industry will try very hard to weaken the bill, and it has assembled a large war chest for that purpose. Coal accounts for just over half the electricity generated in America and 30 percent of its carbon dioxide emissions. Unless ways can be found to replace coal as an energy source or to capture its emissions, the global warming game is essentially lost. More than 120 new coal-fired power plants are on the drawing boards in this country. Of those, only a small percent are likely to be equipped with technologies that could reduce emissions. 
 The Lieberman-Warner bill makes it clear that coal-fired power plants, new or old, will be forced to meet stiff new emissions targets just like everyone else. Dirty plants, in short, will pay heavily, as they should. That is the only way to encourage the utilities to find cleaner ways of burning coal and, even better, alternative energy sources. 
 Until the United States takes the lead, other big emitters -- starting with China, which is building the equivalent of one large coal-fired plant every week -- will feel no pressure to act.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths LOMBARD, RICHARD S.

 BODY:
 LOMBARD--Richard S. 
 , former general counsel of Exxon Corporation from 1973 to 1993, died at his home in Tucson, Arizona, on October 18, at age 79. A leader of the New York and national bars, he helped to shape the practice of law in the United States and abroad. Born in 1928 in the Canal Zone, Panama, he attended public schools in the Canal Zone, graduated from Harvard College in 1949 after one year's service in the Army Air Corps, and graduated from the Harvard Law School in 1952. He was an associate with the New York firm of Haight, Gardner, Poor, and Havens, from 1952 to 1955. He began work as a lawyer for Exxon's predecessor, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, in 1955, spending ten years in the law department of its Venezuelan subsidiary, Creole Petroleum, and eight years in the law departments of Exxon divisions in New York and Texas before becoming Exxon's general counsel in 1973 (vice president from 1980 to 1993). His career with Exxon, in 1973 the largest oil company and largest publicly traded corporation in the world, spanned a period of expansion in worldwide demand for oil and a major restructuring of the oil business. During the seventies, he coordinated Exxon's legal response to the Middle East oil crisis, including the nationalizations of the Iraqi, Libyan, Saudi Arabian, and Venezuelan oil industries between 1972 and 1976, an oil embargo by Arab members of OPEC, and the oil crisis following the Iranian revolution in 1979. Exxon's and other companies' success in using arbitration and negotiation to win compensation for their nationalized assets helped popularize the use of private international arbitration, now the standard mechanism for private international dispute resolution. 
During the eighties, he coordinated Exxon's response to increased litigation by expanding the size of Exxon's law department and handling much of the company's legal business inhouse, a model later followed by corporate law departments nationwide. From 1989 until 1993, he coordinated Exxon's legal response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. After his retirement from Exxon in 1993, he was of counsel to the Dallas firm of Baker and Botts until 1996, and served as an arbitrator in domestic and international business disputes until 2002. He influenced the profession as a leader of various organizations, as a former chairman of the boards of trustees of the American Arbitration Association and the Parker School of International and Comparative Law at Columbia University, and as a cofounder in the eighties, along with Cyrus Vance and others, of Volunteers of Legal Services (VOLS), to coordinate the provision of volunteer legal work during a time of cutbacks in federal funding for legal services for the poor. He was a former trustee of the Southwestern Legal Foundation (now the Center for International and American Law) at Southern Methodist University, former member of the advisory board at the Columbia University Center for Law and Economic Studies, and former trustee of the Practicing Law Institute, among other groups. He is the author of one book, ''American Venezuelan Private International Law: A Bilateral Study'' (New York, 1965) He is survived by his beloved wife of 55 years, Arlene Olson Lombard of Tucson, Arizona, his son James, also of Tucson, his daughter Anne, of Aliso Viejo, California, four grandchildren, and his sister, Elaine Newland of Bluffton, South Carolina. A memorial service will be held October 26, 1pm, at St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal Church in Tucson, Arizona Donations in lieu of flowers may be sent to the Primavera Foundation, 702 S. 6th Ave., Tucson, Arizona 85701.

HEADLINE: Panel Urges Global Shift On Sources Of Energy

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Energy experts convened by the world's scientific academies yesterday urged nations to shift swiftly away from coal and other fuels that are the main source of climate-warming greenhouse gases and to provide new energy options for the two billion people who still mostly cook in the dark on wood or dung fires. 
 In a report commissioned by the governments of China and Brazil, the 15 experts called for, at a minimum, a doubling of both public and private energy research budgets and a firm -- and rising -- price on emissions of greenhouse gases to encourage a shift in investments toward cleaner or more efficient technologies. 
 The report, ''Lighting the Way -- Toward a Sustainable Energy Future,'' was posted online at www.interacademycouncil.net by the InterAcademy Council, a group representing the world's 150 scientific and engineering academies.
 Bruce M. Alberts, a former president of the United States National Academy of Sciences and a co-chairman of the InterAcademy Council, said the independent academies would now press the case for their proposals with their respective governments. 
 The 200-page report includes a host of recommendations for long-term research efforts, economic policies and initiatives in the private sector. Three points that it stressed as needing immediate attention from the world's major countries were: 
 Increase the efficiency of fossil fuel use, in part by charging for carbon dioxide and other smokestack and tailpipe emissions that contribute to warming. Such fees would promote shifts away from heavily polluting energy options like inefficient power plants, the report said. 
 Accelerate the development and testing of techniques to cheaply capture and store the billions of tons of carbon dioxide generated by burning coal and other fossil fuels. The panel said this was particularly important given that coal is expected to remain a dominant energy source for decades to come.
 Do more to refine and deploy systems to get energy from the sun and other renewable sources.
 The report also called on the United Nations to undertake an objective and open examination of the issues surrounding nuclear power, from questions about security to waste disposal. 
 The report stressed the ''moral, social and economic imperative'' of providing power to the world's poorest people. 
 At all levels, the current path of energy development around the world is not sustainable, said Steven Chu, the co-chairman of the committee that produced the report and the Nobel laureate in physics who directs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
 Dr. Chu said that big gains in the efficiency of energy use were possible right now, but he also stressed the need for a sustained, ambitious research effort. 
 ''Sustainable energy is the equivalent of the U.S. moon shot,'' Dr. Chu said. ''If you look at the funding in the United States during Kennedy's era and followed by Lyndon Johnson, what the United States invested in the Apollo program, money of that magnitude, I am confident, would reveal a lot of breakthroughs in energy technologies, efficiency technologies and new forms of energy.''

HEADLINE: Bill Allowing Mortgage Lawsuits Expected to Stir Fierce Opposition

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
House Democrats introduced legislation on Monday that would for the first time let homeowners sue Wall Street firms for relief from mortgages that the borrowers never had a realistic chance of repaying.
 The measure, which is expected to generate intense opposition from the financial services industry, addresses some of the problems tied to the transformation of the mortgage lending industry from an often local business into a trillion-dollar global market for investors in search of higher returns.
 The bill is part of a broader measure intended to restrict what lawmakers and consumer advocates consider deceptive and improper lending practices, many of which were common among the millions of soured subprime mortgages to people with low incomes or poor credit histories. 
 Critics warn that the bill could chill and perhaps freeze a huge source of capital that has helped push homeownership in the United States to its highest level. 
 The legislation, introduced by Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, would require any mortgage lender to verify that the borrower has a ''reasonable ability to repay'' based on documented income, credit history and debt level. 
 ''The people who package mortgages and sell them into the secondary market were a major cause of the single biggest world financial crisis since the Asian crisis'' of 1997-8, Mr. Frank said, ''and it's unthinkable that we would leave that undisturbed.'' 
 The congressman said that he expected his committee to debate and approve the measure next week, and that House leaders hope to bring it up on the floor in three or four weeks. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the banking committee there, has outlined a separate bill against predatory lending.
 This would be the closest that Congress has ever come to legislating on the suitability of particular mortgages and blocking loans it deems too risky.
 More than two million people took out subprime loans in the last two years that offered relatively low initial rates but are to jump sharply when the introductory periods expire. Analysts predict that at least a quarter of these people may default and lose their homes.
 Under the House bill, people who can show that they never had a reasonable ability to repay the loans would still have to pay for their homes, but would have new statutory power to demand better deals from the lenders. They could demand that their original mortgage lender offer a better loan. Or they could demand relief from the Wall Street firm that bought the mortgage and resold it to investors.
 The measure would also restrict several practices that industry critics have long said were deceptive and amounted to ''predatory lending.'' It would prohibit incentives to brokers for steering borrowers to more expensive mortgages. It would sharply restrict prepayment penalties -- something common with subprime loans, which effectively lock borrowers into the loans. 
 Mr. Frank said the criteria for loans that had no realistic chance of being repaid would include those with monthly payments equal to more than half a person's income. Lenders who offer loans that do not require the borrower to document his or her income or financial circumstances would also risk challenges.
 The basic approach to defining unpayable loans is similar to the guidance that federal bank regulators have long given to loan underwriters at banks.
 But about half of all recent mortgages in recent years -- and the vast majority of subprime loans -- were made by lenders and brokers who fall outside the federal banking system. Many of these are regulated by states, but the rules vary widely and some have almost no restrictions on the tactics that a lender can employ.
 Under the new bill, states would be required to set standards for mortgage brokers and lending. States that do not develop a standard would be subject to relatively strict federal standards, to be developed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, that would require mortgage brokers to act ''solely in the best interest'' of the consumer.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes to Stop Spitzer Plan to Give Illegal Immigrants Driver's Licenses

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
Spurred by overwhelming public opposition to Gov. Eliot Spitzer's decision to allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, the State Senate yesterday passed legislation that would overturn the policy. 
 The 39-19 vote, which passed with the support of all the Republican senators present as well as several key Democrats, capped a debate laden with accusations of racism and demagoguery and warnings about terrorism and voter fraud. The vote also followed a raucous protest outside the Capitol, during which some opponents of the plan called for the governor to be recalled or impeached.
 The clashes over the driver's license policy overshadowed nearly all other business on Monday, and further dimmed the prospect for passage of major legislation that the governor and the Legislature have been negotiating for months, such as campaign finance reform and a property tax rebate for elderly homeowners. 
 The Senate bill is among a range of legislative and legal maneuvers Republicans are mustering to overturn Mr. Spitzer's plan, which was issued by the State Department of Motor Vehicles in September. Assembly Republicans said they would try to attach a similar measure to unrelated legislation likely to reach the floor of their chamber during Tuesday's Assembly session.
 Their chances of ultimately prevailing on the measure may be slight, given that Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, supports Mr. Spitzer's policy and has nearly untrammeled control over the flow of legislation in his chamber. 
 But Republicans are eager for even a procedural vote to put Democrats on the record on the issue. Some Democrats have expressed uneasiness with the governor's plan and what they view as his failure to sell it to the public.
 But when Mr. Spitzer emerged from a closed-door meeting with Senate Democrats on Monday afternoon, he showed little appearance of reconsidering his decision. He continued to argue that the new policy would improve public safety by shrinking the ranks of uninsured drivers and that his opponents had refused to face up to the practical realities of illegal immigration.
 ''It's always good to have the conversation about why I believe what we've done is correct and appropriate and important,'' Mr. Spitzer said, adding that he thought ''some of the rhetoric that has been imposed and brought into this issue has been not only overheated but I would say counterproductive.''
 Mr. Spitzer added another high-profile supporter for his efforts on Monday, announcing that William J. Bratton, the former New York City police commissioner and current Los Angeles police commissioner, backed the new licensing policy. 
 The licensing clash did not prevent all legislative business from getting done. The Senate approved nearly two dozen of Mr. Spitzer's remaining nominees to state jobs by 8:30 p.m., and a Senate spokesman said the chamber expected to approve the dozens of other outstanding nominations by night's end, removing one major conflict between the governor and Senate Republicans. 
 Mr. Spitzer and Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, have not spoken personally in months. Relations between the two are evidently so soured that at a news conference on Monday, Mr. Bruno sharply criticized Mr. Silver, his Assembly counterpart, for telling reporters last week that he had tried to engage in some shuttle diplomacy between the governor and the senator.
 ''Silver has not been a go-between,'' Mr. Bruno said when asked about Mr. Silver's comments. ''If he has, he's a dismal failure. All he is doing is feathering his own nest, making excuses for his own inactivity.'' 
 Not surprisingly, both the governor and Senate Republicans blamed each other for the lack of progress on other issues, including legislation that had been agreed upon near the end of the regular session in June. 
 Mr. Bruno said, ''I've been around this business 31 years. I am puzzled by the way the people handle themselves -- this executive and all the people around themselves.'' He added that the administration had reneged on an early deal to provide property tax rebates to the elderly.
 But Mr. Spitzer denied that the furor over his license policy had stalled the rest of his agenda.
 ''Just the opposite -- we are moving,'' the governor said, adding later that ''things are moving ahead in a spectacular manner. We couldn't be happier.'' 
 Mr. Spitzer pointed to trips he had made to Buffalo, Rochester, and other upstate cities in recent weeks to announce major economic development deals, which he called ''the most important piece of my agenda over the last nine months, which is upstate economic revitalization.'' 
 About 100 opponents of Mr. Spitzer's policy met in a rally on the Capitol steps at noon, where tempers ran high. James N. Tedisco, the Assembly's minority leader, and others spoke, and protesters waved signs with slogans like ''Ill-egal is a sickness'' and ''No licenses for illegals;'' some shouted for Mr. Spitzer to be recalled or impeached.
 Frank J. Merola, the Rensselaer County clerk and one of the most vocal local officials to oppose Mr. Spitzer's policy, appeared at the rally and later filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court challenging the administration. Under state law, several dozen other county clerks act as agents of the D.M.V. and must process driver's licenses on behalf of the state. 
 Mr. Merola and a number of other clerks, most of them, like Mr. Merola, Republicans, have said they will not obey the new policy, though state rules do not give them any discretion on the matter. Mr. Merola said that he had not consulted the county counsel about his plans to ignore the new licensing regulations. 
 ''I don't want him to tell me that I shouldn't be doing it, because I'm the one who's going to be in that office and I'm not going to do it,'' Mr. Merola said. ''It's easier if I don't ask.''

HEADLINE: Boras Wants Yankees To Explain Their Plans

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
The search for a new manager is taking up most of the Yankees' time this week, with Joe Girardi meeting with team officials yesterday in Tampa, Fla., Don Mattingly on deck for today and Tony Pena set for tomorrow.
 Looming, though, is a high-stakes showdown between the richest team in baseball and the best player in the game. The Yankees will soon confront Alex Rodriguez's agent, Scott Boras, and the overriding issue is which side will back down first. 
 Neither side accepts the other's premise. Boras does not seem to believe that the Yankees will remove themselves from negotiations if Rodriguez opts out of his contract and becomes a free agent. The Yankees are highly dubious that Boras can find a more lucrative contract than the one they plan to offer.
 ''Great decisions render artificial dynamics meaningless,'' Boras said yesterday. It was an artful way of saying that he did not consider the Yankees' deadline for signing Rodriguez to be legitimate.
 The Yankees have insisted for months that their deadline to re-sign Rodriguez is his opt-out date, 10 days after the end of the World Series. If he becomes a free agent, his existing contract disappears, and the Yankees lose a $30 million subsidy from the Texas Rangers that covers part of his salaries from 2008-10.
 The Yankees' strategy is obvious: bring back Rodriguez while saving $30 million. Boras, however, said the Yankees should never have expected to have that money, since they knew all along that Rodriguez could -- and probably would -- become a free agent this winter.
 ''The only reason the $30 million was offered was it was assumed that if Alex was hurt or he malperformed, that he would be at a high value to a team without producing, and Texas took on some of that risk,'' Boras said. ''The obvious bottom line is he's performed as well, if not better, than expected.''
 The Yankees do not argue that point, and they say they are committed to rewarding Rodriguez if the dollars are reasonable (less than $33 million a season, for example) and they can continue to use the Rangers' money to defray some of the cost.
 In any case, Boras said, he is not interested in talking finances yet. He said he expected to sit down soon with the Yankees' hierarchy -- George Steinbrenner's sons, Hank and Hal; the team president, Randy Levine; and General Manager Brian Cashman -- to discuss the direction of the team as Steinbrenner, the principal owner, recedes.
 Eventually, the Yankees hope to deal directly with Rodriguez, but he will not be there for the initial meetings, which Boras said would be in Tampa or in Southern California, where he lives. 
 ''We're looking at the organization as a whole, because there have been a number of changes,'' Boras said. ''I've told them we want to have these discussions before we discuss economics.''
 The Yankees will accommodate Boras, but they also know what Rodriguez said during the season: ''I want to stay in New York, no matter what,'' on April 23. The team suspects that Boras's endgame may be to simply get the most money he can from the Yankees, since that is where Rodriguez wants to be.
 Rodriguez's feelings could have changed after another year without making the World Series. He has never played in one and takes heavy criticism for his annual postseason struggle. Boras pointed out that the Yankees were relying on young pitching and did not know if Andy Pettitte would decide to come back.
 ''It is very important to Alex to have an opportunity to win the World Series,'' Boras said.
 Technically, Boras cannot know what other teams would bid for Rodriguez in free agency. But he has often gotten much more than predicted for his free agents, especially for Kevin Brown in 1998, Rodriguez two years later and Barry Zito last winter.
 That history may motivate the Yankees to overwhelm Rodriguez, but despite the presence of wealthy West Coast teams that need offense -- the Angels and the Giants, especially -- they do not see a rival that could outbid them. 
 If Rodriguez opts out, there is always the chance that George Steinbrenner could overrule everyone and sign him. This would make Steinbrenner look like a hero to the Yankees fans who love Rodriguez, and make him seem firmly in control. 
 But the Yankees have finally acknowledged that Steinbrenner is slowing down, and he seems unlikely to overturn such a public stance. If the Yankees ended up signing Rodriguez as a free agent, after promising not to, it could harm their credibility and compromise future negotiations with other players and teams.
 The Yankees also hope to re-sign catcher Jorge Posada and closer Mariano Rivera, both potential free agents. Neither seems likely to leave, and Rivera told Sirius Satellite Radio yesterday that the departure of Joe Torre as manager would not affect his decision.
 The Yankees ''always give us the best everything, the best players, the best coaching staff,'' Rivera said. ''I don't think it has nothing to do with me, in terms of signing with the Yankees.''

HEADLINE: In Picking Annuities, It Pays to Do Your Homework

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
YOU'VE been diligent for years, socking away as much as you could in your 401(k), I.R.A. or other tax-deferred retirement account. So once you retire and it is time to begin living on your nest egg, how are you going to manage that money?
 Please do not say, ''Take the money and run.'' That poses a big risk; you might run out of money, a retiree's worst nightmare. Moreover, taxes would take a big bite if you took a lump sum from a retirement plan. 
 Better to keep the money tax deferred as long as possible. One way of doing so is to take the advice of the 800-pound gorilla in the television commercial to invest in an annuity, a tax-deferred investment contract sold by an insurance company that can guarantee income for life. Investments in annuities can be made by increments or a single payment. 
 People don't know how long they will live ''or whether they will run out of money,'' said Robyn Credico, national director of the defined contribution consulting group at Watson Wyatt, a global benefits consulting group in Arlington, Va. So an annuity is ''a protection against outliving your savings.'' 
 In addition, monthly payments from an annuity resemble a monthly paycheck and are much easier for most retirees to manage than a lump-sum distribution from a retirement plan. Some annuities from lower-tier companies, coupled with aggressive sales tactics, have made prospective buyers wary. The best protection is to deal with a top-rated insurance company and get professional advice.
 ''I would put part, not all of my retirement money, into annuities,'' partly variable, partly fixed, Ms. Credico said. Annuities are ''very complicated,'' she added, ''and that is the biggest caution,'' especially because the field is highly competitive, and insurance companies keep offering new products. It takes a lot of due diligence to make a selection. 
 She also said it was important to understand the implications of terminating a contract early if the company's credit rating is lowered. ''Penalties diminish over time, but to start with, they can be pretty significant,'' she added. 
 Ms. Credico is even encouraging corporate 401(k) plans to offer annuities as an investment choice. That means that the sponsor does the due diligence, and group rates are likely to be lower than those for individual contracts. 
 Jerome S. Golden, president of the income management strategies division of MassMutual, said that a ''winning strategy is buying in increments, or income laddering.'' That is parallel to bond laddering, he said. ''The advantage of buying over time is not taking a big income risk. Also, the older you are, the more income you get, so there is an advantage to laddering.'' 
 Mr. Golden added, ''A successful retirement means that your assets are going to last as long as you do.'' MassMutual's annuity products, which are invested in a variety of Oppenheimer funds, are intended to make sure that happens. A typical account, he said, is a $350,000 I.R.A. rollover. 
 Bret L. Benham, president and chief executive of the TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company, said that annuities were long-term vehicles. Ideally, people should have a 20-year horizon, he said, adding that retirement today can last a long time. A couple retiring at 65 can expect to live past 85, so ''five or six years is not enough time'' to build up an adequate annuity contract. Still, he added, ''it is never too late to start.'' 
 During retirement, he recommended, people should hold a combination of fixed annuities for paying predictable, regular living expenses, and variable annuities, which have a potential for growth. The underlying investments are essentially mutual funds. 
 At New York Life Insurance, John R. Meyer, senior vice president in charge of the individual annuity department, said that one benefit of a variable annuity is that ''You can sleep at night.'' 
 An important reason for that is the death benefit. Suppose your annuity is invested in stock and bond funds, and there is a bear market, he said. Your spouse or beneficiary ''at least gets back the premium'' paid for the annuity. 
 The long-term nature of annuity contracts is one reason for their complexity. People worry about how markets will perform over time, what effect inflation will have on their expenses, whether there will be a legacy should they die and how sound the insurance company will be in the long run. The industry, in turn, tries to develop products that address all these concerns. 
 Rob Grubka, head of the variable annuity product development team for the Lincoln Financial Group in Philadelphia, described his company's patented i4Life plan. ''We have tried to position ourselves to hedge against inflation,'' he said, and to put in features to protect clients from market volatility. ''Equity exposure over time has proven to be a good hedge against inflation.'' 
 The i4Life rider allows clients to have lifetime income with no upside limit if equities perform well, he said, as well as downside protection. Should the market fall, there is a floor for all payments after the first payment of 75 percent of the first payment. Payments can be either monthly or annual. 
 Lincoln offers a similar distribution rider, i4Life Advantage, on its employer-sponsored defined contribution plans, allowing participants to convert their retirement plan savings into lifetime income with an opportunity for growth. 
 The company gave this example: With a $100,000 account value, a 70-year-old person's first monthly check is $535. After that, no payment will be less than $401. If the market performs well, there is no upper end limit. I4Life also allows access to assets for additional withdrawals and a death benefit until age 85 or 15 years, if longer. 
 ''It gives some guarantees to account value and predictability,'' Mr. Grubka said. ''We feel very strongly about the importance of an adviser.'' He added that consequently Lincoln annuities were sold only through firms like Merrill Lynch, SmithBarney, Edward Jones and A. G. Edwards.
 Doug Wolff, vice president for business development at Security Benefit in Topeka, Kan., stressed the flexibility of variable annuities. Clients, he said, ''can move their money based on changes in their situation or the marketplace without a taxable event.'' He added, ''Even if risk tolerance has changed,'' contract holders can change their investments, just as they can in a 401(k) plan. 
 He described his company's SecureDesigns, which start with a basic variable annuity and allow clients to customize a contract by choosing numerous guarantees, including guaranteed income at withdrawal, stepped-up payments for beneficiaries, flexible withdrawal options and protection.
 ''Of course, each guarantee comes with an associated cost,'' he said, ''so it's important that consumers understand how, and if, the guarantee will benefit them and then weigh that benefit against the additional cost of the guarantees.'' 
 Certainly the insurance industry's efforts result in products that offer guarantees, flexibility and tax advantages that ordinary investment accounts do not. But will the insurers be there over time to honor their guarantees?
 ''I think overall the industry is very solid,'' Mr. Grubka said. ''We all have a huge vested interest in making sure we're around for the long term.'' 
 Annuity contracts are not insured by a government agency. But they offer more hope for retirement security than most accounts that are.

HEADLINE: A Place in the Sun (and Close to Campus)

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK

 BODY:
WHEN the nation's baby boomers began signing up for Social Security benefits this month, the news was full of lamentations about the stress the generation would put on the federal pension system over the next 20 years.
 That worry, however, turns into glowing optimism when you talk to officials of small college towns like Boulder, Colo., and Bloomington, Ind. That's because such towns -- are likely destinations for retiring boomers and their money.
 It's clear that the 76 million members of this generation are not going to be ordinary retirees. 
 Surveys by AARP and others have shown that they are much more willing to move to a new place late in life than their parents were. Famous for their self-indulgent tastes and meager savings, members of the baby boom generation are also expected to gravitate to places that are less stressful and less expensive than the cities where many have spent their working years. At the same time many will want to continue working in some fashion.
 As the AARP Magazine has pointed out, boomers are a demanding, some might say spoiled, generation. One of the magazine's surveys found that boomers sought places with a ''youthful vibe,'' great medical facilities, cultural and educational opportunities, and sophisticated restaurants -- not your conventional retirement community. 
 Because of their desire to keep working, if part time and on their own terms, boomers are also attracted to areas with strong economies. College towns, for example. 
 That fit is not lost on the towns, many of which are beginning or stepping up efforts to lure retirees. 
 One of the most successful is Oxford, Miss., home of the University of Mississippi. Recent retirees who have moved there and to other college towns illustrate the reason for their attraction.
 Since 1993, Oxford, a town of 18,000, and surrounding Lafayette County have attracted more than 600 retiree households, drawn mainly by the university and its 14,000 students. Christy Knapp, director of a retiree attraction program sponsored by the Oxford-Lafayette County Economic Development Foundation, said, ''Without the University of Mississippi, we would be just another lovely Southern town, and there are hundreds of those.''
 It also helps that the cost of living in Oxford is 15 percent below the national average, according to BestPlaces.net, a Web site that allows users to compare cities and towns around the country. The median price of a home is $222,500, compared with, say, San Francisco's $745,000. The state also does not tax income from Social Security or most pensions.
 Terry and Charlene Ott moved to Oxford in 2003 from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where they had been retired for four years. Mr. Ott, 66, is a former sales manager for Northwest Airlines; Mrs. Ott, 67, worked in sales and marketing for hotels.
 Though the house they built in Oxford is larger than the one they had in Fort Lauderdale, their annual property taxes dropped to $800 from $1,400. 
 The main draw, though, they said, was Ole Miss. The Otts each have part-time jobs at the university, where they help business-school students with career planning. 
 Mr. Ott, who writes two monthly columns for the local newspaper, The Oxford Eagle, took a journalism course at Ole Miss. Like many colleges and universities, the University of Mississippi gives a break to retirees, allowing them to take one free course a semester. It also offers noncredit continuing education classes.
 Mr. Ott cited the university's influence on the town. ''Our research indicated that college towns generally have an above-average standard of living and better health and medical care,'' he said. He also cited the attraction of college football and other sports.
 The Otts -- he was born in Elkhart, Ind., she in Buffalo -- said they had no trouble adjusting to Oxford. ''One of the reasons we fit in so well here is that 17 percent of the university's students are international,'' he said. ''Add the faculty, and you get an interesting population mix. But we have also made friends with people who were born and raised here. They have accepted us Yankees.''
 Another university town that is climbing in popularity among retirees is Manhattan, Kan., where the median price of a home is just under $175,000.
 Jeff Chapman, the chairman of Retire to the Flint Hills, part of the Manhattan Area Chamber of Commerce, said the town of 45,000, situated in the northeast part of the state, had attracted 50 to 100 retirees in the last five years. ''Kansas State University is a huge factor in our efforts,'' he said, ''because we initially targeted K-State alumni.''
 Don and Bea Rasmussen moved to Manhattan from Houston in June after receiving an information packet from Mr. Chapman's committee. Mr. Rasmussen, 66, a retired chemical engineer, graduated from Kansas State in 1958; the couple had been living in Houston since his retirement 10 years ago. 
 ''We wanted a slower pace,'' Mr. Rasmussen said. ''We wanted to get away from all that traffic and the increasing crime rate.''
 Some college towns do not have to try very hard to attract retirees. Durango, a mountain resort of 14,000 in the southwestern corner of Colorado and the home of Fort Lewis College, is a magnet because it has a reputation as a nice place to live, said 
 Katie Ogier, a real estate agent there. Durango is also more expensive than some towns: the median price of a house is just under $600,000.
 In 2005 Ron Martin, a finishing contractor in San Diego, bought a Durango town house for $300,000. He plans to move there next spring, when he is 51, for a combination of retirement and work, and until then is renting out the house. 
 While the area's beauty and recreational opportunities enticed him, he said there was another big factor.
 ''A town this small would be very incomplete if it didn't have something like a college,'' he said.

HEADLINE: For Love and a Little Money

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
BY the time Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr. retired from Cravath, Swain & Moore in 2002, he was financially set. He was already an author, he already had a distinguished track record in public service and philanthropy and, of course, he was the great-grandson of a toy magnate. 
 So when Fritz Schwarz -- the name he greatly prefers -- joined the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, he seriously considered volunteering his services. He decided against it, and negotiated a salary, albeit one below what a starting lawyer makes.
 He never got a raise, and last year, when the Brennan Center ran into a budget crunch, he gave up his pay. But in principle, if no longer in principal, he thinks the salary made sense. ''An organization and a person are simply more committed to each other when the person is paid,'' he said. 
 Clearly, Mr. Schwarz has bought into the concept of paid volunteerism. The phrase may sound oxymoronic, but an ever-growing number of retirees and nonprofit executives say it is an apt description of the way modern retirees view nonprofit work. And while no one has gathered statistics on the tendency, experts say there is a good chance that the automatic link between doing good and working for nothing has been permanently severed. 
 ''People used to say, 'Here I am, what do you need done?' '' said Deborah Russell, director of work-force issues for AARP. ''Today's retirees say, 'Here's what I do well, how can you use it, and what will you pay?' '' 
 Economists, behavioral scientists and gerontologists point to multiple reasons behind the switch. For some retirees, economics ranks high on the list. People expect to live for many decades beyond retirement. Many started their families late, which means they may be financially responsible for children as well as aging parents. They may not want to continue full-time work at high-pressure jobs, and for many, unpaid volunteerism is simply not practical. 
 ''This generation worries about standards of living and health insurance, so it wants to maintain some income even when it gives back to society,'' said Marc Freedman, the chief executive of Civic Ventures, a nonprofit group that specializes in geriatric issues. ''So it has located that intersection between the spirit of volunteerism and the pay of work.''
 But increasingly, even the wealthiest retirees insist on being paid for doing good. ''Even a small check is a symbol that what they are doing really makes a difference,'' said Ben Rosen, a management professor at the University of North Carolina's Kenan-Flagler Business School. Mr. Freedman thinks that is particularly true of women. ''Volunteer work used to be considered women's work, so it is not surprising that career women reject the concept,'' he said.
 Greg O'Neill, director of the National Academy on an Aging Society, suggests yet another reason: paid workers are less likely to be assigned to licking stamps or ladling soup. ''There's still a huge mismatch between what retirees can do and what organizations offer them,'' he said. Robert H. Frank, an economics professor at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University, notes that several decades ago, the Peace Corps began insisting that even very poor communities provide housing for volunteers. ''Until then, the local people reacted like, 'Oh, we got a freebie,' and paid no attention to the volunteers,'' he said. ''Savvy people have learned that they are used more intelligently when they are paid.''
 That learning is rooted in the modern-day corporate environment, others note. ''Modern organizations are leaner and more competitive than they used to be, and the idea that you get paid for performance, not just for showing up, has taken hold,'' said Michael W. Morris, a management professor at the Columbia Business School. 
 Many retirees have learned, to their irritation, that what they give free is discounted as fluff.
 Ten years ago, Fabianne Wolff Gershon, now a retired public relations executive, did a pro bono marketing plan for a local botanical garden. It was never carried out. ''I made a mental note: If they had paid for the report, they would have taken it seriously,'' Ms. Gershon said. 
 She now works three days a week, running a women's entrepreneurship program for FEGS (formerly known as the Federation Employment and Guidance Service).
 ''I make maybe 6 percent of what I made in my own business,'' Ms. Gershon said, but ''because they pay me, they listen to me and appreciate me.''
 Nonprofit executives say the reverse is also true: people who are paid work harder and seem more committed to their jobs. Thomas Scott, chief executive of the Lawrence County Community Action Partnership in New Castle, Pa., said he paid about $9.10 an hour to retirees who drive elderly and disabled people to doctor's appointments. ''Volunteerism works for a short project, but when you need people to show up consistently and on time, you're better off paying them,'' he said. 
 FEGS uses thousands of volunteers ''to enhance our programs but not to run them,'' said Gail A. Magaliff, its chief executive. Why not? ''You can ask an employee to stay until 9 p.m. to get something done,'' she said. ''It's harder to ask a volunteer.''
 Retirees say she is on to something. G. Jean Hoppert, a retired engineer, runs technical education programs in Las Vegas for the nonprofit group First. She works about 100 hours a month, for about $900. ''I'm donating most of that back to the program,'' Ms. Hoppert said. ''But I probably wouldn't have made as large a commitment as a volunteer.''
 This growing willingness to work hard for low pay has, perhaps inevitably, given rise to matchmaking services that place skilled retirees with a hankering to help in low-paying public service jobs. 
 ReServe, a New York City group, asks retirees to send resumes and specify interests -- health care, say, or domestic violence or animal rights. ReServe matches the retirees with part-time jobs that pay $10 an hour. No retiree works more than 15 hours a week, so they do not receive pensions or benefits. The nonprofit organizations can pay the participants or can pay ReServe $14 an hour and let ReServe handle the payroll. 
 In just two years of operation, ReServe has placed about 275 people with about 110 nonprofits. It has joint programs with AARP and recently won a contract to place people with city agencies.
 Claire Altman, ReServe's executive director, said that almost three-quarters of participants are college graduates, and about 42 percent have master's degrees. ''For most of them, it is not about the amount they are paid but the fact that they are paid,'' she said. 
 New York City's Department for the Aging has begun using ReServe volunteers and is helping to place them with other city agencies as well. ''The money helps lower-income adults, but it also forces the agencies to identify what skills they really need,'' said Edwin Mendez-Santiago, the agency's commissioner. 
 Mr. Freedman of Civic Ventures followed similar principles when he helped found Experience Corps in 1995 to place retirees in city elementary schools as mentors and tutors. Retirees work 15-hour weeks and earn $200 to $250 a month. Experience Corps tries to persuade schools to apply some of the money they raise from bake sales and such to the salaries. 
 ''The stipends are big enough to serve as a contract and to cover out-of-pocket costs,'' Mr. Freedman said. ''And when the schools chip in, it increases the likelihood that they will use those people well and in serious roles.'' 
 For retirees looking to explore new worlds, the services represent an easy, one-stop shop.
 Vivian Landa, a retired Wall Street administrator, had always been fascinated by the criminal justice system. So ReServe got her a job with Bronx Community Solutions, which does job counseling for nonviolent criminals. Shirley A. Jones also spent most of her career in administrative work, but she loved being with children. Experience Corps placed her in a job in Harlem, tutoring four children for 45 minutes a day. The monthly stipend ''comes in handy for car fare and lunch money,'' she said, but her main incentive ''is the confidence in those kids' eyes when they finish the program.''
 The groups also help retirees who want to stick with their former fields. A. Allan Korenberg, a retired education consultant, wanted to keep plying his trade, albeit at a more leisurely pace. ReServe placed him with Advocates for Children, a nonprofit group that has a grant from the Department of Probation to work with juvenile offenders. He works three days a week, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
 ''I'm doing serious paid work on a luxury schedule,'' he said. ''I have a time sheet, I have responsibilities, I feel there are consequences if I don't show up. I don't feel like a retiree who's killing time.''
 Even private-sector employers are learning to harness that kind of attitude to their own philanthropy. I.B.M., for one, just started a program to retrain some of its retirees to teach math and science in public schools. And the Senior Lawyers Committee of the New York City Bar Association has recommended to law firms that they pay retired partners a vastly reduced salary to handle the firm's pro bono obligations. ''It would give the retirees a sense of dignity, and it would dignify the pro bono job,'' said David N. Ellenhorn, chairman of the committee. 
 There is, of course, a potential downside to the trend. Once payment becomes the norm, fewer people are likely to volunteer their services free -- which could be a problem in a budget crisis. And for the retirees themselves, getting paid may detract from the psychological satisfaction of doing good. 
 ''So many studies show that external incentive systems take away from intrinsic enjoyment of an activity,'' Professor Morris of Columbia warned. ''Attaching payment to a job turns it into work.''
 Then again, for the baby boomers, a generation that works for love as well as money, that might not be a bad thing.

HEADLINE: Earnings Reports Give Markets a Respite

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Wayne Arnold contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Fears of a continued stock market decline were eased yesterday as the major American indexes stabilized after an early morning skid and posted modest gains on the first trading day after Friday's steep sell-off. 
 Investors were buoyed by an optimistic earnings report from Merck, the pharmaceutical giant, and a more favorable outlook in the technology sector.
Lingering worries over a tightening credit market, prompted by last week's poor corporate profit reports, were somewhat eased after a Federal Reserve governor, Randall S. Kroszner, indicated that the central bank would ''act as needed'' to maintain growth. Investors betting on the Fed's actions now expect an interest-rate cut at the Fed's meeting next week.
 The Dow Jones industrials closed up 44.95 points, or 0.3 percent, at 13,566.97, its first daily gain in over a week. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished at 1,506.33, up 0.4 percent, or 5.7 points, aided by technology stocks, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index closed up 1.1 percent, at 2,753.93. 
 ''It doesn't mean that we're out of the woods yet, as far as this daily drip of bad news on the credit front,'' said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford. ''But today we were given a reprieve with some very, very good earnings.''
 Merck posted a 62 percent increase in third-quarter profits, beating analysts' expectations. After the closing bell, Apple announced that its profits were up 67 percent in the last quarter, on strong iPod and iPhone sales.
 Crude oil prices dropped more than a dollar, offering some respite to investors weary of spiking energy costs. Light sweet crude, which flirted with the $90 mark last week, closed yesterday at $87.56 a barrel. And the ailing dollar, another problem area for investors, improved slightly against the euro. 
 The day's cheerful outcome did not seem likely in the morning. The Dow dropped over 100 points at the opening bell, reflecting similar declines in the Asian and European markets, but crawled back in morning trading and was in positive territory through most of the afternoon.
 Foreign stock markets ended the day down as they absorbed the news that sent the Dow to a loss of 2.6 percent on Friday, the 20th anniversary of the 1987 Black Monday crash. 
 Foreign investors worried that the housing slump and problems in the credit market would seriously slow fourth-quarter growth and crimp demand among American consumers for Asian exports.
 Gold prices, which have risen in recent weeks on fears of rising global inflation and a falling dollar, fell along with the prices of other commodities.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 5/32, to 102 21/32, to yield 4.41 percent, up 0.02 percentage point from Friday. 
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: The Price of a War, Unpaid at Home

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Party Here, Sacrifice Over There'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 20): Will Bardenwerper is correct that there is a disconnect between soldiers' lives in Iraq and the lives of the American public. The reasons are that this is the president's war, not America's, and it is being fought with a professional volunteer army aided by corporate mercenaries. 
 Americans simply do not think that this war is worth the sacrifice by soldiers or themselves. This is the downside of not having a draft; politicians are more willing to go to war, and there will be far less public outcry when they do. 
 Lies got us into this war, but truth is the only way out. Martin Ross
 Rockport, Mass., Oct. 20, 2007
 To the Editor:
 A member of my immediate family served for 14 months as a member of the Army Reserves in Iraq, and like Will Bardenwerper, I, too, have noticed that the American people seem not to value the sacrifice of our enlisted personnel. 
 It's an important observation: we don't value their sacrifice. Why? Because most of us realize that the suffering isn't for any purpose. The world is no calmer, the Iraqi people aren't better off for our presence, and our personal liberties continue to be gambled away by leaders who talk among themselves. So where can we locate any value in the sacrifice of our military personnel?
 Count me, too, among those who do not want the sacrifice of our soldiers. I want instead for our people -- indeed for all people everywhere -- to remain whole, at home, following as closely as possible their dreams of living rather than measuring the value of their dying.
 Laura Costas
 Silver Spring, Md., Oct. 20, 2007
 To the Editor:
 I'm a banker on Wall Street making what statistically is considered an impressive bonus (although I am truly middle class), and I strongly disagree with Will Bardenwerper's characterization that Americans like me have ''changed the channel.'' Americans have not changed the channel.
 I, for one, voted for a Democratic Congress to end the war, have written letters to Congress demanding action and a draft, participated in protests and written media outlets demanding more war coverage. Time and again, I have been ignored by our representatives, including feckless Democrats, while the media cover the celebrity scandal du jour and presidential candidates' fund-raising prowess rather than their positions.
 While Mr. Bardenwerper's comments about the draft are on target, the draft is a side issue. The real issue is the disparity between the vast majority of Americans who work for a living and the elite who are the primary beneficiaries of a leadership policy based on fear-mongering to justify gutting our Constitution, while giving away billions of taxpayer dollars to the well connected like Blackwater mercenaries.
 The results are self-evident from the economic scandals like the current mortgage crisis to the torture and death of thousands of people in a useless war. If Mr. Bardenwerper was a true believer in the ''war on terror,'' he has no one to blame but himself. Andrew Clipper
 Millburn, N.J., Oct. 20, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Will Bardenwerper's powerful arguments for considering a draft are appreciated. But he should be assured that his friends' carelessness is not entirely representative of the American public.
 Wall Streeters -- not all of them, but historically and as a group -- are driven by their individual profit motive rather than concern for others less advantaged than themselves. Those of us who have loved ones in the military are constantly concerned for their safety and the progress of the war. 
 And many of us who don't are thinking foremost of the troops when we attend antiwar events and press politicians to call for withdrawal. Amanda Bell
 Brooklyn, Oct. 20, 2007
 To the Editor:
 I, too, wonder why the leadership in this country pays only lip service to the sacrifices of those like Will Bardenwerper and why so little has been asked of us. Really, though, the answer is obvious: had we actually been asked to sacrifice, this war would have never been allowed to happen in the first place.

HEADLINE: Europe Tries To Attract Migrants It Prefers

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
 The European Union introduced a ''blue card'' plan on Tuesday aimed at attracting highly skilled immigrants like doctors, nurses and engineers, even as policy makers across the bloc grappled with how to keep out unskilled migrants. 
 Similar to the green card program for foreign workers in the United States, the European plan seeks to draw an additional 20 million workers from Asia, Africa and Latin America in the next two decades. Officials said they hoped that the proposal would reverse a trend in which skilled migrants from developing countries were choosing the United States over Europe.
 ''To maintain and improve economic growth in the E.U., it is essential for Europe to become a magnet for the highly skilled,'' said Franco Frattini, the union's justice and home affairs commissioner. ''Qualified and highly qualified migrants prefer the U.S.A., Canada and Australia.''
 He pointed to statistics showing that high-skilled foreign workers accounted for 0.9 percent of all workers in the European Union, compared with 9.9 percent in Australia, 7.3 percent in Canada and 3.5 percent in the United States. 
 The European Commission, the union's day-to-day executive arm, said skilled migrants were needed to help fill holes in the job market, in particular in information technology and science.
 Analysts said European countries were behind in attracting foreign talent, in part because salaries in fields like information and technology were dwarfed by those in the United States. But they also said that this had been offset by tougher American restrictions on special visas since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 The Europeans' new immigrant-friendly proposal, which requires the approval of member governments, comes as anti-immigrant sentiment pervades national debates about foreign migration. European officials said the proposal was likely to face resistance in countries like Germany that are already struggling with unemployment and integrating their own sizable numbers of immigrants.
 Several members, including Belgium, Britain, Italy and France, already have programs for companies seeking to employ skilled migrants, but these are often limited to specific fields or involve the transfer of senior executives within multinational corporations.
 European officials warned that the stigmatizing of immigrants threatened to keep away even skilled ones. Figures recently released by the European Commission showed that 85 percent of unskilled laborers from developing countries went to the European Union and only 5 percent to the United States, whereas 55 percent of skilled workers went to the United States and only 5 percent to Europe.
 If the blue card project is approved, it would grant high-skilled workers a renewable right to work and live anywhere in the European bloc, with permanent residence given automatically after five consecutive years. The proposal would also offer candidates a fast-track procedure to get work permits and make it easier for members of their families to join them.
 To assuage labor unions' concerns that the proposal could result in an influx of lower-wage workers, applicants would be required to show that they were taking up posts that could not be filled by European workers. They would also need a job contract of at least one year guaranteeing a salary of at least three times the minimum wage in the country concerned, plus health insurance.

HEADLINE: Lessons Thomas Still Could Learn

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Let's return now to the story of Thomas the Tank Engine and the lead paint.
 Back in June, the company that manufactures the toy trains based on Thomas books and videos announced that it had been making many of those trains with lead paint. Lead paint, if ingested, tends to cause brain damage. So the company -- the RC2 Corporation, which is based in Illinois and makes the trains in China -- asked parents to mail back the affected toys.
 But RC2 could hardly have done a worse job of handling the situation. First it asked its customers to pay the shipping costs of returning the toys. Meanwhile, executives at both RC2 and HIT Entertainment, which owns the Thomas brand, hid from public view. They never explained why their safety checks had failed -- or why they deserved to be trusted now. They still haven't. 
 ''They just really bungled this thing,'' D. J. Nordquist, a mother of three young children in Northern Virginia, told me. Ms. Nordquist had asked RC2 for a refund on her recalled trains, mostly on principle, she said, but also to cover the $39 she spent on lead tests for her children. RC2 refused. Instead, it sent her and other customers replacement trains, as well as an additional toy train as a bonus ''gift.'' 
 Now, here is where the story gets truly incredible. In September, RC2 recalled five more toys because of lead. One was a gray boxcar called the Toad vehicle. The Toad vehicle, it turned out, was one of the trains that RC2 had mailed out as a gift. That's right. To make up for putting lead in its toys, RC2 sent children ... a free lead-contaminated toy!
 This second Thomas recall went largely overlooked, though, because by September -- with Mattel recalling millions of toys -- lead paint seemed to be the norm for the toy industry. As Sean McGowan, a toy industry analyst, said in a front-page article in this newspaper, ''If I went down the shelves of Wal-Mart and tested everything, I'm going to find serious problems.'' 
 After reading that quote, a colleague and I decided to do exactly what Mr. McGowan suggested. We bought dozens of toys at Wal-Mart and a couple of other stores and took them to a laboratory for testing. The idea, simply, was to figure out how many other toys might be as dangerous as Thomas the Tank Engine.
 ''Red like a stop sign, yellow like a school bus,'' Martin Bennett, a retired compliance officer from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, was telling my colleague, Amy Schoenfeld, as they were walking down the aisle of a Wal-Mart on Long Island.
 We had asked Mr. Bennett to come along and point out toys that might be suspicious. Red and yellow were most likely to contain lead, he explained, perhaps because lead helps keep paint bright. He also pointed us toward toys made in China and other countries with weak safety rules, and he encouraged us to shop at lesser-known chains as well as Wal-Mart.
 To stack the deck, we did everything Mr. Bennett suggested. We wanted to maximize the chances that we would find toys with more lead paint than government standards permit -- more than 600 parts per million of lead -- just as the recalled Thomas trains and Mattel toys had. 
 We then drove our stash of about 50 toys to a laboratory in Enfield, Conn., run by Specialized Technology Resources. There, the lab's employees used a razor blade to scrape some paint off each toy, added a chemical solution and put the chip in a microwave oven. The resulting liquid was placed in a big machine called an atomic absorption spectrometer to analyze lead content. 
 Any guess as to how many of our toys contained more lead paint than the law allows?
 Zero.
 Only five items had any detectable lead: three necklaces from a vending machine at a Shop-Rite in Brooklyn (which had up to 27 parts per million) and two pieces of jewelry from a store called National Wholesale Liquidators (up to 49 parts). All of our Wal-Mart toys were lead-free.
 I see two big lessons from the experiment. The first is that making toys without lead is not difficult. Most of the toy industry is already doing it right. 
 If anything, the standard of 600 parts per million is too lax. Numerous studies have shown that even moderate lead levels in children's blood can do real damage -- an average loss of something like five I.Q. points for a child with the highest ''acceptable'' level. The American Academy of Pediatricssays the standard should be 40 parts per million. 
 ''No one has ever found any evidence of a threshold below which lead has no effect,'' Richard L. Canfield, a developmental psychologist at Cornell, said. ''There is no reason to have it in toys.''
 Fortunately, given the relatively limited scale of the problem, the solution doesn't need to involve some huge effort to stop lead toys at the border. Tougher standards, harsher penalties and more random testing should do the trick. That would put the responsibility on companies.
 Which brings us back to Thomas -- and the second moral of the story. The companies involved in the recent recalls aren't simply the unlucky ones that got caught. Either out of carelessness or a misplaced cost-cutting zeal, they are the ones that didn't make the effort to keep their toys safe.
 When Ms. Nordquist first had her toy-chewing, 17-month old daughter tested for lead this year, the results showed that she had more lead in her blood than any parent should want. When the girl was retested recently, months after the Thomas trains had been put out of her reach, the level had fallen significantly. Two tests prove nothing, Ms. Nordquist notes, but they are enough to make a mother angry.
 I called Curtis W. Stoelting, RC2's chief executive, and Peter J. Henseler, its president, to ask why parents should have faith that RC2's new safety measures would work better than its old ones. Neither executive called me back. Instead, representatives from two public relations agencies working for RC2 sent me a memo that almost hilariously avoided most of my questions.
 Ms. Nordquist had a similar experience. After mailing her recalled trains to RC2 and enclosing a letter requesting a refund, she received an e-mail message signed, ''Consumer Services.'' It didn't acknowledge her refund request but promised that replacement trains were on the way. The message also thanked her for the trust she had placed in Thomas.
 ''I guess you didn't bother to read the letter I enclosed,'' Ms. Nordquist wrote back. ''Any trust I had with your firm is gone. I do not want any replacements. I want a refund. You have endangered my children.''

HEADLINE: German Border Threat: Cheap Books

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
In a tiny booth at the book fair here, the German publisher Heinrich Berenberg, a gray, slender, cheerful man, was chatting with Thomas Geiger, a middle-aged colleague in sweater and jeans. Berenberg Verlag publishes literary memoirs and biographies, about seven or eight a year. It is a four-year-old firm. Mr. Geiger oversees programming for a society called the Literary Colloquium in Berlin. He was recalling his childhood in a West German industrial town.
 ''It was in the middle of nowhere, only 20,000 steel workers,'' he said, ''but we could order any book in Germany and have it within a day. The whole post-fascist idea was that we needed books, along with universities and schools, to fix society.''
 Petra Berenberg, Mr. Berenberg's wife, who was also there, nodded. ''I also grew up in a remote town,'' she said, ''and it was the same system that distributed drugs to pharmacies overnight. The books came with the drugs on the same trucks.'' 
 Drugs for the body. Books for the mind and soul. If you want proof that a cultural divide separates Europe and America, the book business is a place to start. In the United States chain stores have largely run neighborhood bookshops out of business. Here in Germany, there are big and small bookstores seemingly on every block. The German Book Association counts 4,208 bookstores among its members. It estimates that there are 14,000 German publishers. Last year 94,716 new titles were published in German. In the United States, with a population nearly four times bigger, there were 172,000 titles published in 2005. 
 Germany's book culture is sustained by an age-old practice requiring all bookstores, including German online booksellers, to sell books at fixed prices. Save for old, used or damaged books, discounting in Germany is illegal. All books must cost the same whether they're sold over the Internet or at Steinmetz, a shop in Offenbach that opened its doors in Goethe's day, or at a Hugendubel or a Thalia, the two big chains.
 What results has helped small, quality publishers like Berenberg. But it has also -- American consumers should take note -- caused book prices to drop. Last year, on average, book prices fell 0.5 percent. 
 Now this system is under threat from, of all people, the Swiss. Just across the border, the Swiss lately decided to permit the discounting of German books -- a move that some in the book trade here fear will eventually force Germany itself to follow suit, transforming a diverse and book-rich culture into an echo of big-chain America.
 If you're a skeptic, you might associate fixed pricing with a German impulse toward conformity and an aversion to traditional haggling cultures. A German will stare blankly at you if you even suggest such a thought. Instead they will stress the special place books have in society. 
 ''Germany has always considered itself a late nation, by which we mean that we came together late in history as a nation, and what has always brought us together is the concept of education,'' said Thomas Sparr, the Frankfurt publisher of Suhrkamp Verlag, a large and prestigious house. ''Books are inseparable from our self-identity.''
 Andreas Remmel, who with his 35-year-old twin brother, Paul, runs Bernstein-Verlag, in Bonn, a two-man, five-year-old operation that, as it happens, specializes in books about Goethe, explained, ''It goes back to Goethe.'' 
 ''With our system,'' Mr. Remmel said, '' small German booksellers can specialize and cater to neighborhood and certain communities, and they also have their own opinions about which books they want to sell, which gives us a chance to find a niche. Everything doesn't depend on the taste of a few buyers for the chain stores.''
 The fixed-price system is not unique to Germany. France had it, gave it up and reinstituted it after finding that discounting hurt small booksellers. But in the German-speaking book world, the system has long been a source of special pride until Switzerland jumped ship this spring.
 Despite vigorous lobbying from German and Swiss publishers and independent booksellers, the Swiss government sustained a ruling by the Swiss Competition Commission to overturn the fixed-price law and allow discounting there. 
 It's still early, but some Swiss prices have since gone up. Discounts for best sellers are forcing Swiss booksellers to raise the prices for other books.
 I called Rafael Corazza, director of the Competition Commission, to ask what he was thinking. ''It's not normal for one market to have special regulations,'' he explained. ''It was a cartel. The German and Swiss booksellers said it was for a good purpose -- they made a cultural argument, but we are an economic commission. They said the system fosters a broader, deeper market for books, that discounting will hurt the small booksellers who support the small publishers, and then you will have fewer books and more focus on best sellers.''
 Are they right? I asked.
 ''I'm not quite sure they're completely wrong,'' he said. ''Nobody knows for sure yet. But nobody can read one million titles, so the question is, is it better that more people read fewer books or that fewer people read a lot of different books?''
 Mr. Berenberg, on hearing of this remark, laughed. ''Without price maintenance, you have what you see in America and in England, namely the equivalent of the abolition of small and medium-size bookshops. We, as a small publisher, need them, because once they're gone, we're next.''
 It's what nearly everybody here told me. ''This is existential to us,'' said Arnulf Conradi, a retired publisher, who founded Berlin Verlag. 
 Peter Molder, a literary agent from Cologne, added: ''We're used to the government supporting cultural programs. In America, it's about private wealth. Here the question is what the public can do for culture.''
 Heike Fischer, a Cologne publisher, said: ''But it's also about the idea of equal protection. In this system everybody has the same chances, whether you're a small or big publisher or bookseller, or a consumer in Berlin or some small town.'' 
 French publishers offset Swiss discounting by charging Swiss booksellers more than French ones, a move that German publishers might emulate. 
 Meanwhile, opinion is divided about what the Swiss decision will mean in Germany. Michael Naumann, a longtime publisher and editor, now running for mayor of Hamburg, as Germany's culture minister some years back won a battle with the European Union to protect Germany's fixed-price system. He's not too worried, he said.
 ''The fixed book price has worked for more than a century and has provided us with the most competitive book industry, something the market ideologues don't quite understand,'' he said. 
 But Elisabeth Ruge sounds fearful. She runs Berlin Verlag, the German publisher of Richard Ford and of the English-language edition of the most recent ''Harry Potter,'' which has sold more than one million copies here. It's not just the Swiss market, she said, but especially the growth of the German chain stores that troubles her.
 ''Small literary bookshops here sell our books and other literary books,'' she explained. ''The chain stores don't even see our sales reps anymore.'' Her representatives visit 2,600 independent bookshops in Germany, three times every year. 
 ''If the chains don't see the reps, that means publishers don't have the means to talk about their books,'' she added. ''Look at what has happened in Britain with Waterstone's and W. H. Smith. They're nothing like what they used to be, in terms of quality, now that they've taken over the whole market.''
 ''Three-quarters of our list will never make money, but it's important to publish those books because we believe in them and because they create an atmosphere of quality,'' she said. ''People then trust us when we say a book is good.''
 That's what any American publisher would say, but here, Germans as a nation believe publishing quality books to be a cultural obligation. 
 I stopped at Marga Schoeller's shop in Berlin. Thomas Rodig, a tweedy, soft-spoken man, helps run it. The store was founded in 1929, then became the first bookstore to reopen in West Berlin after the war, the place where Auden, Beckett, Eliot, Mann and Hesse came to read and hang out. It's now a quiet rabbit warren, catering to loyal patrons in the neighborhood.
 ''I feel relatively calm for the simple reason that here almost everyone agrees,'' Mr. Rodig said. ''We want to make sure that a large number of books can be produced and distributed in Germany.''
 Why? I asked.
 For a second he seemed baffled that I would even ask the question. 
 ''Because we need them,'' he answered.

HEADLINE: 10 Web Sites That Avoid Hybrid Hype

BYLINE: By RAY WERT III. 
Ray Wert III is the senior editor of Jalopnik.com.

 BODY:
WITH all the myths, misperceptions and hype surrounding green automobiles, even the Web is filled with potholes of inaccuracy. These 10 sites will help fill your knowledge tank:
 TREEHUGGER.COM/CARS--TRANSPORTATION
 Treehugger is the green blog that contends it is the ''largest pure environmental site on the Web.'' The car section provides a sampling of the width and breadth of the green automotive landscape. It is great for quick sound bites to use at dinner parties, but not necessarily for people looking to take the deep dive into the intricacies of, say, the debate on urea-infused diesel fuel.
 PRIUSCHAT.COM 
 It would not be a green list without a site focused on the car that put hybrids on the map, the Prius. And like all fan forum sites, PriusChat provides an outlet for owners to gush their love for the little Toyota, as well as trade tips and share news on modifications, new models and mileage claims.
 PLUGINAMERICA.COM
 Plug In America is the resource for the Electric Auto Association, a coalition of Toyota RAV4 EV drivers and former lessees of Honda EV+, GM EV1 and Ford Th!nk City electric cars. The site is not just about news on plug-in cars, but it also helps as an organizing site for this advocacy group marching for more electric cars. It is for you if you are the type keen on going to Washington and chanting for plug-in power for the people.
 HYBRIDCARS.COM
 Part online community, part blog and part hybrid-market research organization, this independent site is the place to go to quickly access hybrid information regardless of brand or manufacturer.
 GREENCARCONGRESS.COM
 Although you will probably need to be a mix of book jockey and gearhead to be enthralled by topics like ''TiSi2 Semiconductors'' and ''Direct Hydrazine Fuel Cells,'' this is the top resource for any in-depth discussion on the minutiae of environmentally efficient automotive technologies. If your desire is to wow mechanical engineers with your understanding of green autos, this site is a must.
 GM-VOLT.COM
 The Chevrolet Volt, a planned mass-production plug-in hybrid, has developed an online-cult following despite being at least two and a half years from hitting Chevy's showroom floor. The Volt has spawned blogs, forums and news sites, while GM-Volt has been the top aggregation point for news and rumors. 
 FUELECONOMY.GOV
 You may own one of the most fuel-efficient vehicles on the market without knowing it. The easiest way to find out is to visit this site, run by the Environmental Protection Agency. With a tool allowing you to find out how many miles per gallon you are getting, you can then compare that with the numbers on every other car sold in the United States.
 EVWORLD.COM
 This site features international news on sustainable transportation. If you subscribe, you get access to the largest database of news articles, information on upcoming industry conferences and expos on green driving on the Internet. The site also has downloadable puzzles you can put together on your home computer.
 CLEANMPG.COM
 You're not truly driving efficiently until you're a ''hypermiler.'' That is the term used by the electronic denizens of CleanMPG to describe drivers striving to exceed their vehicles' E.P.A. fuel-economy rating. These hypermilers use techniques like reducing quick acceleration, driving slowly on highways and removing cargo and luggage racks on car roofs to decrease wind resistance. At CleanMPG, hypermilers share tips and tricks on how to maximize fuel efficiency no matter what technology is under the hood.
 AUTOBLOGGREEN.COM
 As the name implies, this site, owned by AOL, is a blog about the greening of autos. Unlike other sites that focus on articles relating to such cars, AutoblogGreen zeros in on general automotive articles with a green tint and breaking news about green automotive technology. It is a great site for auto enthusiasts who have a more casual bent toward environmentally efficient vehicles rather than an obsession about them.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Earnings Beat Expectations

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
United Parcel Service posted a better-than-expected profit yesterday, citing growth in its global business, supply chain and freight unit, as well as modest growth in its United States package business despite a sluggish economy. 
 Although U.P.S.'s results should continue to be driven by its international business and gains at the supply chain and freight unit, the chief financial officer, D. Scott Davis, warned in a statement that ''slowing retail sales will restrain U.S. domestic volume growth.'' Mr. Davis is scheduled to become the company's chief executive in January.
 But in an interview with Reuters, Mr. Davis said he expected United States economic growth to be a ''little better'' in 2008 than in 2007.
 Like its main rival, FedEx, U.P.S. is seen as a bellwether of United States economic health, based on the premise that package volumes rise in a more vibrant economy and fall when growth slows.
 U.P.S., the world's largest package-delivery company, reported third-quarter net income of $1.08 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with $1.04 billion, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Excluding a $46 million restructuring charge and related expenses for a supply-chain business in France, earnings per share for the quarter amounted to $1.05.
 Analysts on average had expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.02, according to Reuters Estimates.
 The company, based in Atlanta, reported third-quarter revenue of $12.21 billion, up from $11.66 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue for the quarter of $12.24 billion.
 ''The story at U.P.S. is steady as she goes, despite some choppy waters in the freight market,'' said Keith Schoonmaker, an analyst at Morningstar.
 Revenue at U.P.S.'s domestic package business rose 2 percent to $7.55 billion. U.P.S.'s international package business increased 12 percent, to $2.53 billion, and sales at the company's supply chain and freight unit rose 6 percent, to $2.13 billion.
 ''I am impressed at how U.P.S. has turned supply chain and freight into a profitable operation despite a depressed less-than-truckload market,'' Mr. Schoonmaker said.
 U.P.S. Freight is a less-than-truckload operator. Like the rest of the United States trucking market, less-than-truckload companies, which consolidate smaller loads into a single truck, have had weak freight volumes since the third quarter of 2006.
 Mr. Davis, the chief financial officer, said U.P.S. Freight's growth had come from taking less-than-truckload market share, which he said should continue for the next several years.
 U.P.S. expects full-year earnings per share of $4.13 to $4.19. Analysts had predicted full-year earnings per share of $4.15.
 U.P.S. shares were up 0.7 percent, or 55 cents, to $75.64.

HEADLINE: Report Finds State Farmworkers Unaware of Many Job Protections

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Farmworkers in the Hudson Valley toil long hours for little pay and are largely unaware of the few protections and services available to them, according to a report released yesterday by researchers at Adelphi University and Bard College. 
 The report, a portrait of the state's agricultural work force, claims to be the first such study in three decades. It describes a substantial shift in the racial and ethnic makeup of farmworkers in the Hudson Valley since the 1980s, from mostly black to predominantly Hispanic. 
 Of the 113 workers interviewed for the study, 90 percent were foreign-born and 78 percent were from Latin America, the report said. In addition, 71 percent were illegal immigrants, while 21 percent were in a federal guest worker program. 
 While the immigrant farmworkers who were interviewed were paid more than the minimum wage, they sent home, on average, $513 a month to family members in other countries, or about half the average monthly take-home pay, according to the report. 
 The annual income from Hudson Valley farm work reported by the workers averaged $6,643. Just over a third of the workers reported wages from other sources, bringing the average annual income to $8,078.
 ''This very low annual income places these farmworkers well below the official poverty line for the U.S.,'' the report said.
 The study, called ''The Hudson Valley Farmworker Report: Understanding the Needs and Aspirations of a Voiceless Population,'' was led by Margaret Gray, an assistant professor of political science at Adelphi. 
 The interviews were conducted in 2002 by Dr. Gray and students from the Bard College Migrant Labor Project.
 The report was delayed in part by a grower's complaint about Dr. Gray's research. Since her doctoral dissertation included some of the research material, the grower tried to block her doctorate as well, she said. 
 Dr. Gray said the 78-page report was inspired by continuing debate in Albany about the state's farmworker labor laws. She said farmworkers in the state and nation generally did not have as much legal protection as other workers. Most workers, whether illegal immigrants or citizens, are entitled to overtime pay, a day of rest and collective bargaining protections, whereas farmworkers are not, she said.
 ''The inclusion of farmworkers in New York's labor laws is necessary for all farmworkers, citizen or not,'' Dr. Gray said. ''Labor protections would offer workers more economic security and safe avenues to address their concerns. It is a travesty that they are denied the opportunities and protections that most nonagricultural U.S. workers enjoy.'' 
 Eighty percent of the farmworkers interviewed said their employers did not speak their language, and 56 percent said they were unaware of the laws that did relate to them, like the right to safe housing and transportation and protections against pesticides. 
 Dr. Gray said that she interviewed one worker in a new two-bedroom trailer he shared with two others, and that he said he would not change anything about the housing.
 When she turned off the tape recorder, she said, the worker confided that the trailer lacked beds and that they slept on the floor. ''Even when workers had poor housing, they didn't complain about it,'' Dr. Gray said. ''The vulnerability is further exacerbated because the workers fear deportation and job loss.''
 In accepting their working conditions, the workers compare themselves to their peers at home instead of to other American workers. In addition, most said they planned to return home some day, plans that can inhibit their ''desire to improve their situations in the U.S.,'' the report said. 
 The State Assembly has passed an omnibus bill to provide farmworkers with the same rights as most other workers, but it has remained in committee in the Senate.
 In recent years, farmworkers have taken steps to demand the same kind of benefits and protections that exist in other industries, like improved workers' compensation coverage and at least one day off a week. State and federal labor laws, dating back to the 1930s, have regularly omitted farmworkers from such guarantees, mostly because of lobbying by the agriculture industry. 
 Farmers argue that because of the number of job safety regulations, their workers actually have more legal protections than workers in other businesses. ''There are many laws,'' Dr. Gray said, ''but the fact that they don't have a right to overtime pay or a day of rest or collective bargaining is quite significant.''

HEADLINE: A Planned 'Airport Village' Near J.F.K. Finds a Cornerstone

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
When the transit hub in the Jamaica section of Queens was expanded in 2003 to enable passengers arriving by subway or train to get to Kennedy International Airport in eight minutes by light rail, community leaders hoped the glassy new AirTrain station would encourage additional development.
 In a sign that this dream was not far-fetched, the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation said last week that the South Korean developer of Techno-Mart, a shopping complex in Seoul that houses more than 2,000 electronics retailers, plans to build a 13-story $260 million wholesale merchandise mart on Sutphin Boulevard and 94th Avenue, cater-corner from the station.
 The 979,000-square-foot building will have 10 floors of showroom space to accommodate 500 businesses, 172,000 square feet of retail space and parking for 800 cars, said Paul Travis, a New York developer who is teaming with the Korean company, Prime Construction. It will be Prime's first foray into the United States.
 The project is the first to be announced since the area was rezoned last month to encourage development of a lively ''airport village.'' 
 The wholesale mart will replace the former Merkel meatpacking plant. Built in 1919, the plant once employed more than 500 people but was permanently shut in 1965 after the authorities seized 20 tons of tainted beef and horse meat.
 Though many, if not most, of the businesses in the new mart will be from Korea, the project is expected to generate hundreds of jobs, said F. Carlisle Towery, the president of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, a nonprofit group that has worked for four decades to stimulate investment in the area. ''It will be catalytic,'' he said.
 This is not the first time, however, that a wholesale Korean market has been planned for Queens. In 2004, a group of 53 Korean wholesalers from Midtown Manhattan was chosen from among 12 applicants as the developers for a 26-acre city-owned site in College Point that was once Flushing Airport.
 The wholesalers planned to provide a new home for about 180 businesses between 26th and 36th Streets, near Broadway. With the neighborhood becoming increasingly residential, these business owners, who import toys, bags, costume jewelry, souvenirs and other goods from Asian countries and sell them to retailers, had found themselves squeezed by escalating rents.
 But the proposal for an International Merchandise Mart drew heated opposition from many older residents of College Point, and eight months later, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg shelved the project. The wholesale group's leader, Jay Chung, the owner of Jay Joshua, a company on 27th Street between Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas, which carries a wide assortment of souvenir items, said the members had spent more than $1 million on the College Point plans.
 After the project collapsed, the city tried to help the Korean wholesalers find another site. For months, Mr. Chung negotiated with Mr. Travis and his partner, James Levin, who had acquired a long-term lease to the Merkel site. But eventually, members of Mr. Chung's group began drifting away and he gave up on the Jamaica site. ''We couldn't agree on a number of issues,'' Mr. Chung said.
 By then, executives of the Acreciti Development Group, the company that built and manages Seoul Plaza Shopping Mall in the Flushing section of Queens, had brought Mr. Travis and Mr. Levin together with Prime Construction. Prime is building a second Techno-Mart in southwest Seoul and is creating a Chinatown in Goyang City, a suburb. 
 Mr. Travis said that Prime's track record would make it easier for the project to secure financing. ''We needed a major player who could stand behind the mart,'' he said.
 Prime Construction will be responsible for operating the mart but will sell -- rather than rent -- space to individual wholesalers, who will work side by side without being separated by partitions, he said. Prime expects that many of the businesses in the Seoul Techno-Mart -- where the same merchant has both retail and wholesale customers -- will want to set up operations in New York, Mr. Travis said. He said that Prime also intended to offer space to Manhattan wholesalers, and that those that sell electronic goods would fit in especially well. ''I think we made it very clear to them that we would certainly welcome them as tenants,'' he said.
 But Mr. Chung said he did not know whether his members would agree to participate in the new project in a subordinate role, especially if they were relegated to the higher floors. He also expressed bitterness that Mr. Travis had sought another partner while the talks with his group were still under way. But he said the wholesalers would base their decision on business considerations, not emotion. Mr. Travis declined to respond to Mr. Chung's complaints.
 For Mr. Travis and Mr. Levin, the Merkel site seemed to offer the same potential they saw in the Kingsbridge area of the Bronx when they developed River Plaza, a shopping center at 225th Street and Broadway that opened in 2004. Then Mr. Towery introduced them to the Korean wholesalers. ''What could be more ideal -- the connection to the airport and this site?'' Mr. Travis said.
 He said it took them two years to get the plant's owner, Rita Stark, to agree to a long-term lease for the site. Ms. Stark inherited a local real estate empire from her father, who died in 1988, but has frustrated advocates of urban renewal for years by keeping many of her properties off the market.
 The lease was signed more than a year ago, Mr. Travis said. But Prime would not commit to the deal until the rezoning was approved. 
 The other participants in the project are the HRH Construction Company of New York and Acreciti Development. 
 Even before the lease was signed, demolition of the building began, with the city providing a $4 million loan. The partners expect to begin construction a year from now and complete the project in 2010.
 City officials said they were happy that the project was going forward. ''This reinforces the bigger goal that the administration has -- to diversify the city's economy not just by industry but by borough,'' said Robert C. Lieber, the president of the Economic Development Corporation. 
 Jonathan Bowles, the director of the Center for an Urban Future, a New York City research organization, and a critic of the Bloomberg administration for abandoning the plan for the College Point mart, said he hoped the new project would make room for the Midtown Manhattan wholesalers. These businesses, which sell goods to retailers up and down the East Coast, are suffering the same displacement as other niche industries, he said. 
 ''These industries don't get a lot of attention,'' Mr. Bowles said, ''but they are not unimportant to the city's economy.''

HEADLINE: The Audiophile's Goal Is to Rev Up the Music

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT

 BODY:
IF you saw the summertime television advertisements for Lexus, you might have noticed that the luxury carmaker was promoting only one of the many features it offers. It wasn't gas mileage, performance or sumptuous leather. It was the Mark Levinson stereo.
 That is not as crazy as it seems. Recent studies by the market research firm J. D. Power & Associates found that 52 percent of Lexus owners said they would be less likely to buy a car without a brand-name stereo. 
 And it is not just Lexus buyers who feel this way. Power also found that more than 80 percent of all car purchasers interested in premium sound were willing to pay $1,000 extra for a stereo with a brand name.
 Manufacturers have certainly taken note. Even economy vehicles offer multispeaker audio upgrades, including a subwoofer.
 So what do you get for that extra money? In some cases, not much, said Ralph Randall, chief executive of the United States Autosound Competition International, which holds car-audio competitions. ''Their thousand-dollar upgrade to a premium stereo is the equivalent of a $200 aftermarket stereo,'' he said.
 While not all upgrades are worthless, often there is more audio value in aftermarket gear. Small improvements can bring far better results than a factory upgrade. Yet it is not easy to make a car stereo sound good.
 ''We are dealing with the harshest acoustic environment,'' said Paul Papadeas, president of the International Auto Sound Challenge Association, in South Daytona Beach, Fla., which also holds car-audio competitions. The problems are that glass reflects sound, carpet absorbs it, road noise cancels out some musical tones, and car speakers are usually aimed at listeners' feet.
 In theory, factory systems would have an advantage because they can be optimally tuned to a car's interior. And they are, said Martin Lindsay of Bowers & Wilkins, which builds premium systems for Jaguar. His company works with Jaguar's engineers, starting two years before production. But ultimately, he said, speaker placement is secondary to other design considerations. 
 In addition, as carmakers walk a tightrope trying to please consumers and maintain profitability, they are likely to scrimp on unseen parts like speakers and amplifiers. A speaker from the manufacturer -- the O.E.M., or original equipment maker, as they are called -- ''costs $2 to make, even if it has a fancy brand on it,'' said Manville Smith, vice president for marketing at JL Audio, a car-audio manufacturer.
 To overcome these flaws, audiophiles spend thousands to soundproof cars, create custom fiberglass speaker boxes and add thousand-watt amplifiers. But casual listeners need not break the bank. Because manufacturers usually spend most on the radio/CD/DVD player (called the head unit), big improvements can be made without replacing it. The most obvious is in the lowest sound range. ''Even factory units with a subwoofer very seldom get real bass,'' said Leif Blackmon of Boston Acoustics, an audio equipment maker. Installing a subwoofer and an amplifier can add an octave or more to a system's range for about $300, he said.
 A more ambitious listener might replace the other speakers and add a second amplifier as well. ''If you have a good, strong head unit, I wouldn't tell you to pull that out,'' Mr. Randall said. ''You add something to it to improve what you've got.'' He estimates the average cost of four speakers, an amplifier and a subwoofer to be about $1,000, installed.
 There are other reasons to keep a factory head unit. Much of a car's digital data, which runs systems like keyless entry or trip computers, goes through a data bus. Tinkering with a radio can unexpectedly disable other features that share the data bus. 
 Those kinds of problems have spawned an opportunity for companies like Metra Electronics, Scosche, Peripheral and the Pacific Accessory Corporation, whose kits allow installers to replace a head unit without disabling controls. And to make an original head unit more acceptable to audiophiles, some devices cancel sound coloration built in to factory sets. 
 ''The dirty secret in O.E.M. audio is, to make those $2 speakers sound good, they pump in tons of equalization,'' said Mr. Smith of JL Audio. JL and others make devices that tune a head unit to a neutral sound.
 Another little secret is that those wattage figures on speakers and amps are nearly meaningless, said Eric Holdaway, general manager of Speaker Works, a repeat winner of national sound competitions. For example, he has speakers rated for only 250 watts, but they do fine with a 2,000-watt amplifier. If anything, he says, he is getting a cleaner, more accurate sound at lower volumes. One of your best audio investments is in proper installation. Car doors are poor speaker cabinets, flexing, vibrating and leaking road noise. Installers often add products from companies like Dynamat, Scosche or Cascade Audio Engineering inside doors to stiffen the panels and seal out noise.
 Taming acoustics is easy compared with finding the right installer. Before entering a shop, have a clear idea of what you want from a system -- to hear the violins more clearly, for instance. Ask to audition the employees' cars. If their first question to you is, ''What's your budget?,'' walk out.
 Look for a shop that has practical experience building competition cars. If it doesn't have a rack of trophies, it should at least have a photo album with installations it is proud of.
 You can also look for technicians who have graduated from the Mobile Electronics Certification Program. There are three levels of certification; try to find one of the 1,600 advanced technicians. Even better, try to work with one of the 70 master technicians.
 Now, if you have thrown out the spec sheet and ignored the brand names as the experts suggest, you may wonder what is left to go on besides luck? ''It's not a crapshoot,'' Mr. Smith said. ''People just need to trust their ears.''

HEADLINE: Better Mileage? Lower Emissions? You Can Do It, Detroit

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
THE automobile industry is rightly proud of its 100-year history of innovation, from the development of lightweight materials to advances in engine technology. The average car of today is a marvel of engineering -- vastly safer, faster, more comfortable and efficient than cars in the 1960s or '70s.
 But when faced with laws demanding higher fuel economy and lower greenhouse gas emissions, automakers whimper that they cannot possibly meet such challenges at a reasonable cost in vehicles that people would buy. 
 C'mon guys. Give yourselves credit. You're already doing it.
 Over the last two decades, auto companies have expanded many technologies, from tires with low rolling resistance to gasoline-electric hybrid drive systems, that could allow them to meet the strictest mileage and emissions standards proposed by Congress and California regulators. There are advances in engine technology, air-conditioners, transmissions, fuel sources and body design on the market that could make cars cleaner and more economical at relatively little marginal cost.
 The carmakers' marketing departments trumpet these green technologies as signs of their commitment to the environment. But their lobbyists and executives still battle Congress and the courts against new mandates on emissions and fuel efficiency.
 Some of the fixes are simple, and can be summarized on a doctor's prescription pad -- slow down and lose weight. The industry has been engaged in a horsepower race for a decade now, with several manufacturers offering family sedans with 400 or even 500 horsepower. Although cars shrank drastically after the oil shock of 1979, they have since been growing progressively bigger and heavier. American automakers still rely on the sales of millions of fuel-gulping trucks and sport-utility vehicles. It takes a lot of gas to push those big boys around.
 Beyond the obvious savings from slimming and slowing down, the automakers could meet the targets by building on several technologies. There are diesel engines that can meet all current emissions standards and most of those proposed for the near future.
 The Europeans are leading the way, with engines from the four-cylinder diesels used in many Volkswagen models to the Mercedes BlueTec diesel that uses urea to neutralize emissions. Audi is applying similar technology to its big Q7 crossover S.U.V., which will be coming to the United States with an advanced diesel engine next year.
 The American consumer has never fully accepted the diesel despite its advantages in fuel savings and low-end torque, partly because the fuel is not as available as it is in Europe. 
 American car companies offer diesel engines in some light-duty trucks and plan to increase diesel availability. They are experimenting with alternative fuel combustion systems like homogeneous charge compression ignition, which changes how diesels burn fuel, helping mileage and cutting emissions.
 There is another striking difference between the fleets in the United States and Europe, which currently imposes mileage standards as high if not higher than anything proposed in this country. Four-cylinder engines power more than 80 percent of cars sold in Europe, with only 14 percent packing six or eight cylinders. In the United States, 70 percent of autos have six or eight cylinders; only 28 percent of buyers choose four-cylinder engines.
 But there are ways to provide the thrust that Americans expect. Horsepower and torque can be increased in four-cylinder engines using turbochargers, which capture exhaust gases and use them to force pressurized air into the engine's compression chambers. Saab was an early proponent of small turbocharged engines; several other companies now produce them.
 Another means of adding power in small engines is gasoline direct injection, which is similar to the fuel-delivery system used in a diesel engine. It provides a roughly 3.5 percent improvement in fuel economy at relatively low cost. Mitsubishi and Volkswagen use the technology in production cars, and virtually all other automakers are considering a version of it.
 Some models, including Honda minivans, Chrysler sedans with Hemi engines and some V8-powered G.M. trucks, offer engines with cylinder deactivation, which shuts down a bank of cylinders when the engine is working lightly. It turns a V8 or V6 into a four- or three-cylinder engine. 
 A technology known to engineers as camless valve actuation is on the drawing boards but expected in production cars as early as 2010. This system eliminates the relatively heavy and inefficient camshaft, which controls the opening and closing of the engine valves, replacing it with electric devices known as solenoids. This allows infinitely variable valve control and promises huge improvements in engine function.
 Air-conditioners also offer potential improvements. Automakers are considering switching from the current refrigerant, a hydrofluorocarbon compound called R-134a, to a less-carbon-intensive refrigerant, R-152a, which has much less environmental impact. Air-conditioners could also be made with compressors that operate at lower power when less cooling is needed.
 Carmakers are taking advantage of transmission improvements that improve mileage, offering five- and six-speed automatics and units known as continuously variable transmissions, which do away with fixed gearing. 
 Vehicles could also benefit from more aerodynamic design, or drag reduction. Cars have become much more streamlined, with the average coefficient of drag falling from 0.48 to 0.31. Some say that streamlining cuts interior room or produces designs that most consumers reject. But the biggest Lexus luxury sedan, the LS 460, is one of the most aerodynamic cars on the road, and no one complains about its interior space.
 The question, then, is not whether automakers can meet proposed standards. They can. But will they build them, and will people buy them?
 ''Can Detroit do it? There's no reason it can't,'' said Ron Pinelli, president of Autodata, a marketing information company. ''It all revolves around the product. If a manufacturer puts out something that really appeals in terms of pricing, value, economy -- the entire package -- people will buy it.''

HEADLINE: Getting to Green

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DETROIT
 NEARLY a century ago, Henry Ford declared a customer could have a car in any color as long as it was black. Now, carmakers around the world are trying to convince consumers that their lineups come in green. From BMW to Honda, from Chrysler to Volkswagen, the industry is rushing to make vehicles that use less gasoline or don't rely on it at all. 
 The push -- involving hybrid-electric cars, diesel-powered cars, flexible-fuel models and vehicles that run on hydrogen -- is setting off the same kind of competitive frenzy that has always surrounded the development of sports cars and sport-utility vehicles.
 But with those models, the emphasis was on power under the hood and profits that flowed to the bottom line. 
 Now, in a turning point, the companies are portraying themselves as proponents of cleaner, more efficient vehicles, hoping for a dual payoff in sustainability, both for the earth and for them.
 There is ''a new DNA for the automobile,'' said Lawrence D. Burns, vice president for research and development and strategic planning at General Motors. 
 Environmentalists, who have begged carmakers for years to get serious about doing more to help the planet, are watching the events with a combination of satisfaction and skepticism.
 ''They have been dragged kicking and screaming toward producing more-fuel-efficient products,'' said David Friedman, research director for the vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
 Nowhere is the move more apparent than in Japan, where the Tokyo Motor Show, held every two years, features the latest shapes and sizes of environmentally friendly vehicles from Toyota, Honda and Nissan.
 The stakes are highest for Toyota and G.M., which lost its title as the world's biggest carmaker to Toyota earlier this year. Of all the companies, Toyota has spent the most time and money honing its green image, producing the hybrid-electric Prius and other fuel-efficient cars.
 It has sold more than a million hybrid vehicles around the world since the Prius went on sale nine years ago. More Toyota hybrids are reaching showrooms this fall, like the Highlander hybrid and the $104,000 Lexus LS hybrid, its highest-priced green car. 
 G.M., whose most notable environmental effort was last decade's EV1 electric car, is staying close to Toyota's heels. It will roll out a hybrid version of a vehicle in its lineup every quarter for the next four years, 16 in all.
 Beyond that, it is placing a huge bet on the Chevrolet Volt, a small sedan that can be recharged by plugging it into a wall outlet. Mr. Burns, the G.M. executive, says the Volt marks a rallying point in G.M.'s effort to be green.
 Yet, with gasoline prices at $3 or more a gallon, and with the environment a pressing issue for consumers worldwide, auto companies have little choice about paying attention to developing green automobiles.
 As Mr. Friedman of Concerned Scientists said: ''It isn't just about making more patriotic and environmentally friendly cars, it's also good business. Consumers are walking away from gas-guzzling vehicles.''
 Mr. Burns agrees, saying, ''For pure, raw business reasons, we've got to solve this problem because we want to continue to grow.''
 That realization has meant some serious adjustments for carmakers who gave the subject little attention or who backed away from their original commitments.
 Some analysts say that Ford and Chrysler fall into that camp, a particularly uncomfortable position for Ford, which had a lock on the title of greenest American company a few years ago. 
 At the time, Ford was headed by an avowed environmentalist, William Clay Ford Jr., Ford's great-grandson, who served as chief executive from 2001 until last year and remains its executive chairman. 
 Among other things, Mr. Ford built an environmentally conscious assembly plant in Dearborn, Mich., and pledged to improve the fuel economy of his best-selling S.U.V.'s by 25 percent and to produce more hybrids. 
 With the company losing billions of dollars, he retreated from both promises, saying that Ford needed to take a broader approach to green issues. But his replacement, Alan R. Mulally, has intensified Ford's environmental effort again. 
 Not long after Mr. Mulally joined Ford from the Boeing Company 13 months ago, he promoted the company's environmental vice president, Susan M. Cischke, making her the first Detroit executive to have the word ''sustainability'' in her title.
 Mr. Mulally told her, ''The time for talk is past, now we have to figure out how to be part of the solution,'' Ms. Cischke said in a recent interview. As a result, Ford is ''trying to figure out how we prepare for a future that may look very different,'' she said. 
 That future will probably include higher fuel economy standards in the United States, if Congressional supporters get their wish. 
 Detroit automakers were stung last spring when the Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of legislation that would require their vehicles to get 35 miles per gallon by 2020, up from the current standards of 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 24 miles per gallon for light trucks.
 The action has forced the Detroit companies, along with Toyota, to back slightly higher fuel economy standards and to take other environmental steps.
 Ford, for example, is peddling its hybrid-electric Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner S.U.V.'s to Washington lawmakers as patriotic (read: non-Toyota) symbols of their concern for the planet. It has also captured one high-profile customer, former President Bill Clinton. 
 His official fleet includes a hybrid Mariner, outfitted by Ford to meet Secret Service requirements. It also has rear bucket seats that provide more legroom for Mr. Clinton, as well as a minifridge.
 For non-V.I.P.'s, Brian Johnson, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said he expected Ford to fill out its lineup with fuel-efficient vehicles developed for Europe. There, Ford sells a variety of small vehicles aimed at consumers who are used to paying $6 a gallon for gasoline. Mr. Mulally, he said, ''has a pretty good track record of pushing engineers farther and faster.''
 Joining Mr. Mulally in the drive for more-fuel-efficient vehicles is Chrysler's new co-president, James Press, who spent 37 years at Toyota. Chrysler took its own back seat in developing hybrids while it was owned by the German carmaker Daimler, from 1998 until earlier this year.
 German officials thought diesel power, widely used in Europe, was the more realistic alternative for fuel economy. They pursued hybrid development mostly through a joint venture with BMW and G.M.
 Out from under Daimler's wing, Chrysler is now moving quickly to focus on its own hybrids. Mr. Press told The Detroit News last month that every vehicle in Chrysler's lineup would someday be available in a hybrid-electric version.
 For those companies, ''it's not too late, but I believe the next few years will be critical,'' said Roland Hwang, vehicles policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
 As yet, neither Chrysler nor Ford promises anything with the star power of the Prius or the Volt, which G.M. says it will build beginning in 2010. The Volt, in turn, has prompted Toyota to accelerate work on its own plug-in hybrid, which it is testing.
 Since neither company has the batteries to power its vehicles so far, the G.M.-Toyota contest is fraught with drama over which will get its car to consumers first. Yet the competition has some environmentalists shaking their heads.
 ''Companies that want to thrive in a world where carbon matters and there's $80-a-barrel oil can't just swing for the fences'' with one big effort like the Volt or a Toyota plug-in hybrid, Mr. Hwang said.
 ''You have to have technology across the whole line to get you singles, doubles and triples,'' he said. ''You've got to have a full suite of technology across the board that you're using to improve fuel economy and pollution performance.'' 
 That is where Detroit is trying to prove it can lead. Along with hybrids and other high-profile vehicles, G.M. and its American rivals have spent years selling flexible-fuel vehicles, which can run on a variety of fuels, an area where most Japanese companies have lagged. 
 Mr. Burns predicts that hybrid-electric vehicles, coupled with flexible-fuel models, could account for as much as 80 percent of the cars and trucks sold in the United States by 2030, once scientists fully develop alternatives to gasoline that consumers will willingly buy.
 ''It's not just the car that goes from black to green,'' he said, echoing Henry Ford. ''The energy has to be green as well.''
 Where Toyota is concerned, more than 300,000 Prius owners have already bought into that idea, although their hybrids in many cases sit in garages next to vehicles powered solely by gasoline.
 No matter what vehicles Detroit and its rivals develop, Mr. Burns says that ultimately car buyers will decide whether the environment wins. ''Unless you get consumers involved in this mission, it's not solvable,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Diesel Engines May Not Purr, But They Please the Mileage Mavens

BYLINE: By ERIC A. TAUB

 BODY:
LONDON
 THE metallic clanking was familiar, but the source seemed odd. While most Americans think nothing of hearing diesel engine noises emanating from large trucks, it is still a surprise to hear them coming from a fancy car. 
 Yet in Europe, diesel-powered cars, despite their noisiness, are popular for one reason: they get much better mileage than standard gasoline engines, often as much as 40 percent better. Driving on a British highway, nearly half the cars you pass are likely to be equipped with diesels. (About 41 percent of new-car registration in Britain is diesel. In France, it is 70 percent.) 
 A new generation of clean diesel engines coming to the United States next year seems like an obvious way to improve the nation's average fuel economy, but despite the fact that carmakers ranging from BMW to Ford and General Motors to Volkswagen sell millions of diesel cars in Europe, those same companies are gun-shy about introducing new diesel cars in America, where buyers may be wary. 
 ''There are still a lot of misconceptions about diesels being dirty or smelly,'' said Filip Brabec, general manager for product planning at Audi of America. Mr. Brabec said that many Americans pictured the large, smoke-belching Mercedes-Benz sedans of the 1970s when they think of diesels. 
 To get a sense of how today's diesel-engine cars stack up against their gasoline cousins, I drove an Audi A4 2.0 TDI last month in England, one of several diesel models the company sells in this country. Except for the right-side steering wheel and manual transmission, the car was a clone of the one I own in the United States.
 ''I can tell you what the difference is between driving a gasoline and diesel-engine car,'' said Norman Groves, an economic regeneration consultant from Berkhamsted, north of London, and an owner of two Volkswagen diesel vans. ''The difference is nothing.''
 Mr. Groves was basically correct. Except for the diesel rumbling at idle, the car accelerated quickly. Once at speed, the diesel sounds were no longer audible. Entering freeways or driving above the speed limit was as effortless as it was with my gasoline A4 back home. 
 I was sold on diesel when I saw the fuel-economy figures on the dashboard computer, registering 34 miles a gallon in city driving and 42 miles a gallon on the freeway. My car gets about 23 miles a gallon in town and 33 on the freeway.
 The A4 diesel's official numbers are even better: 30 in town and 52 on the freeway. That beats the 33 town-38 freeway mileage figures for Honda's smallest car, the Fit. 
 Now for the negatives: diesels cost more to produce and are likely to cost more to buy. In England, an Audi with a similar size gasoline engine costs about $950 less than a diesel version. 
 Some new clean diesels, like models from Audi and Volkswagen, require an additive called AdBlue to be continuously injected into the exhaust system to remove pollutants. When the vehicle is serviced according to the maintenance schedule, the additive is maintained.
 Another issue is that in very cold weather, a diesel can take longer to start. On Audi's British models, the driver must wait for a coil-heating light to go out before the engine comes on. In mild weather, the wait was a split second, although the manual warns that it could be a few seconds in very cold climates.
 American models might not have that limitation. Mr. Brabec of Audi said he drove Audi diesels when it was 30 degrees below centigrade (-22 Fahrenheit) ''and the engine started instantly.'' 
 Still, Audi is stepping cautiously into the United States. Its first diesel there will be available only in its large Q7 sport-utility vehicle -- and not until early 2009.

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Electric Dream Awaits Reality

BYLINE: By MARY M. CHAPMAN

 BODY:
AS car commercials go, the ads for the Chevrolet Volt are a typical mix of children, blue jeans, cute dogs and folksy instrumental music.
 But they are different in one respect: the small print on the screen reads, ''Not yet available for sale.''
 General Motors is staking a large chunk of its credibility on the Volt, a plug-in electric sedan that uses a gasoline engine only to recharge its batteries. 
 It is a concept car that cannot be built until the technology is available, and one that the company has not even officially announced it will build. 
 But given the state of the American automotive industry, with companies scrambling to be seen as green, the Volt is widely viewed as G.M.'s car of the future, capable of competing with imports like Toyota's Prius hybrid. 
 The company is vigorously promoting the Volt and, in a new contract with the United Auto Workers union, has assigned a Michigan plant to produce it, starting in 2010.
 What if it does not deliver? ''It will be misery for them,'' said John O'Dell, senior editor for Edmunds.com's Green Car Adviser.
 ''I think they will build it, because they are very much aware their reputation is on the line.''
 The Volt's most ardent supporters acknowledge that there is a lot at stake. G.M.'s environmental image suffered when it backpedaled on plans to build hydrogen-powered cars and stepped away from an earlier battery-powered car, the EV1. 
 ''The company has taken a risk,'' said Tony Posawatz, vehicle line director for the Volt.
 But even if it gives the Volt the go-ahead, G.M. may be overly ambitious with its timetable. 
 For the car to do what it is being designed to do -- run for up to 40 miles on an overnight charge from a wall outlet, and much farther if its batteries are recharged by its small gasoline engine -- it will need advanced lithium-ion battery technology. 
 And while lithium-ion cells are being used in many electronic devices, they will have to be made safer and more affordable and durable for use in cars.
 ''I've become quite convinced that they have to do it,'' said Walter S. McManus, an auto industry economist at the University of Michigan. 
 ''The problem,'' he added, ''is the battery technology is still not ready. I would say, when they break ground on a plant to make batteries, two years later the Volt will come out.''
 For the car to be built starting in 2010, he added, ''a factory has to be built soon, and it doesn't look like the batteries are that near production.''
 The Volt's supporters concede that there are hurdles, but they say they will not be deterred. 
 ''I've been unbelievably enthusiastic about this vehicle,'' said Robert A. Lutz, vice chairman for product development at G.M. and arguably the vehicle's most vocal promoter, despite his reputation as a fan of cars big and fast.
 ''I would be surprised, shocked and dismayed if we decide not to do it,'' he said.
 But Mr. Posawatz is more pragmatic. ''Until the product is done there is always some degree of uncertainty,'' he said. ''No such batteries exist today, but our confidence builds as days go on.''
 Since June, G.M. has awarded contracts for development of lithium-ion batteries to several companies, and expects to have samples later this year. Testing is to begin by mid-2008. 
 Mr. Lutz said he would not know how many Volts would be built, nor what they would cost, until G.M. had a better handle on production costs.
 ''If we have to charge $40,000 for it, the volume would be less than if we can get it out for $29,000,'' he said.
 But that hasn't stopped Chevrolet from marketing the car. 
 Kim Kosak, general director of marketing, Chevrolet division, said the Volt was first marketed to younger people and affluent households. Print ads appeared in publications like Newsweek, The New Yorker and The Economist.
 But now everyone is a potential customer, Ms. Kosak said. 
 Chevrolet has added Major League Baseball broadcasts to its list of advertising outlets. 
 At this summer's Dream Cruise, the Detroit-area's parade-like tribute to American cars, an elaborate, giant Volt was on display.
 Ms. Kosak acknowledged that she could not recall ever seeing such a marketing thrust for a vehicle that was not yet available. ''I would be hard-pressed to tell you when we ran anything of this nature,'' she said.
 Mr. Lutz said the goal was to make a car that would reduce oil use, withstand changes to federal fuel economy standards and do battle with Toyota. 
 ''In the space of three years, Toyota had gone from being a technological also-ran to the absolute environmental leaders in environmental technology,'' he said. 
 ''I thought to myself that we have to do something pretty radical, beyond where Toyota is.'' 
 (The Volt is powered by its electric motor only, while Toyota's Prius switches between gasoline and electric modes.) 
 Mr. Posawatz and his team began working on the car in early 2006. Although the Volt was a concept car, he said, ''we knew we were working on this in a production sense as well.'' 
 That meant paying attention to the car's look, particularly the exterior, with an eye toward marketing. 
 Prius owners say they are pleased that their cars resemble no others in Toyota's lineup. With its swooping curves, low roofline and sporty styling, the Volt stands out as well. 
 Bob Boniface, G.M.'s director of advanced design said, ''The charge in design was, 'Don't make it a science project.' '' 
 ''We tend to think of these kinds of vehicles as cars that you need to buy, not want to buy.
 ''We thought we could do a car that stands out and projects a green image, but projects a fashionable image too,'' he added.

 BODY:
 LOMBARD--Richard S 
 . Former general counsel of Exxon Corporation from 1973 to 1993, died at his home in Tucson, Arizona, on October 18, at age 79. A leader of the New York and national bars, he helped to shape the practice of law in the United States and abroad. Born in 1928 in the Canal Zone, Panama, he attended public schools in the Canal Zone, graduated from Harvard College in 1949 after one year's service in the Army Air Corps, and graduated from the Harvard Law School in 1952. He was an associate with the New York firm of Haight, Gardner, Poor, and Havens, from 1952 to 1955. He began work as a lawyer for Exxon's predecessor, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, in 1955, spending ten years in the law department of its Venezuelan subsidiary, Creole Petroleum, and eight years in the law departments of Exxon divisions in New York and Texas before becoming Exxon's general counsel in 1973 (vice president from 1980 to 1993). His career with Exxon, in 1973 the largest oil company and largest publicly traded corporation in the world, spanned a period of expansion in worldwide demand for oil and a major restructuring of the oil business. During the seventies, he coordinated Exxon's legal response to the Middle East oil crisis, including the nationalizations of the Iraqi, Libyan, Saudi Arabian, and Venezuelan oil industries between 1972 and 1976, an oil embargo by Arab members of OPEC, and the oil crisis following the Iranian revolution in 1979. Exxon's and other companies' success in using arbitration and negotiation to win compensation for their nationalized assets helped popularize the use of private international arbitration, now the standard mechanism for private international dispute resolution. 
During the eighties, he coordinated Exxon's response to increased litigation by expanding the size of Exxon's law department and handling much of the company's legal business inhouse, a model later followed by corporate law departments nationwide. From 1989 until 1993, he coordinated Exxon's legal response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. After his retirement from Exxon in 1993, he was of counsel to the Dallas firm of Baker and Botts until 1996, and served as an arbitrator in domestic and international business disputes until 2002. He influenced the profession as a leader of various organizations, as a former chairman of the boards of trustees of the American Arbitration Association and the Parker School of International and Comparative Law at Columbia University, and as a cofounder in the eighties, along with Cyrus Vance and others, of Volunteers of Legal Services (VOLS), to coordinate the provision of volunteer legal work during a time of cutbacks in federal funding for legal services for the poor. He was a former trustee of the Southwestern Legal Foundation (now the Center for International and American Law) at Southern Methodist University, former member of the advisory board at the Columbia University Center for Law and Economic Studies, and former trustee of the Practicing Law Institute, among other groups. He is the author of one book, ''American Venezuelan Private International Law: A Bilateral Study'' (New York, 1965) He is survived by his beloved wife of 55 years, Arlene Olson Lombard of Tucson, Arizona, his son James, also of Tucson, his daughter Anne, of Aliso Viejo, California, four grandchildren, and his sister, Elaine Newland of Bluffton, South Carolina. A memorial service will be held October 26, 1pm, at St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal Church in Tucson, Arizona Donations in lieu of flowers may be sent to the Primavera Foundation, 702 S. 6th Ave., Tucson, Arizona 85701. LOMBARD--Richard S. The Trustees of the Practising Law Institute record with deep sorrow the loss of our friend and colleague, Richard S. Lombard, a PLI Trustee from 1981 until 1997 and Trustee Emeritus since 1997. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family. Werner L. Polak, Chair William F. Kuntz II, Chair of the Exec Committee

HEADLINE: An American Story

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A Son of Immigrants Rises in a Deeply Southern State'' (Man in the News, front page, Oct. 22): 
 The election of Bobby Jindal, an Indian-American, as governor of Louisiana is truly an American story. It is a great illustration of who an American is, a subject that comes up occasionally in the press discussion. It is a triumph of pluralism, to which America is heading rapidly. 
 But what made Bobby's election possible is that he cared deeply about Louisiana. People want change and new energy, and they have given Bobby Jindal a chance to prove what he claims. One piece of advice to Bobby: Go easy on conservatism. Ideology is a luxury of the upper class. But rebuild New Orleans. Care about the poor, the children, the elderly, the unemployed, blacks and Hispanics. 
 Since you claim to be a Christian, teach and practice what Jesus taught: nonviolence, compassion for the poor and the oppressed and healing of sick (health care for all).
 Congratulations to you from your fellow Indian Christians. We are praying for your success.

HEADLINE: Bush to Warn Cuba on Plan For Transition

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
President Bush is planning to issue a stern warning Wednesday that the United States will not accept a political transition in Cuba in which power changes from one Castro brother to another, rather than to the Cuban people.
 As described by an official in a background briefing to reporters on Tuesday evening, Mr. Bush's remarks will amount to the most detailed response -- mainly an unbending one -- to the political changes that began in Cuba more than a year ago, when Fidel Castro fell ill and handed power to his brother Raul.
 The speech, scheduled to be given at the State Department before invited Cuban dissidents, will introduce the relatives of four Cuban prisoners being held for political crimes. A senior administration official said the president wanted to ''put a human face,'' on Cuba's ''assault on freedom.'' 
 In effect, the speech will be a call for Cubans to continue to resist, a particularly strong line coming from an American president. He is expected to say to the Cuban military and police, ''There is a place for you in a new Cuba.''
 The official said Mr. Bush would make the case that for dissidents and others pursuing democracy in Cuba, little has changed at all, and that the country has suffered economically as well as in other ways as a result of the Castro rule.
 He will say that while much of the rest of Latin America has moved from dictatorship to democracy, Cuba continues to use repression and terror to control its people. And, the administration official said, Mr. Bush will direct another part of his speech to the Cuban people, telling them they ''have the power to shape their destiny and bring about change.''
 The administration official said Mr. Bush was expected to tell Cuban viewers that ''soon they will have to make a choice between freedom and the force used by a dying regime.''
 Some of the sharpest parts of the speech, however, will be aimed directly at Raul Castro. Mr. Bush is expected to make clear that the United States will oppose an old system controlled by new faces. The senior administration official said that nothing in Raul Castro's past gives Washington reason to expect democratic reforms soon. And he said the United States would uphold its tough economic policies against the island.
 Mr. Bush would hold out the possibility of incentives for change, if Cuba demonstrated an openness to such exchanges, the official said. Those steps might include expanding cultural and information exchanges with Cuba and allowing religious organizations and other nonprofits to send computers to Cuba and to award scholarships. 
 However, he is expected to reiterate the administration's long-standing demands for free and transparent elections, and the release of political prisoners. 
 John Kavulich, senior policy adviser at the U.S.-Cuba Trade andEconomic Council, said those demands would likely be non-starters for Cuba. He said the technology and educational opportunities Mr. Bush intends to offer are being provided to Cuba by Venezuela and China. 
 He suggested that the real constituency for Mr. Bush's speech was the politically-powerful exile community in Miami. 
 Phil Peters, an expert on Cuba at the non-partisan Lexington Institute, said he saw Mr. Bush's speech as an attempt to reorient a policy that had fallen behind the times. American policy, he said, had been centered around the idea that the Communist government would fall once Mr. Castro left power, and that Mr. Castro, 81, would be forced out of power only by death. Instead, Mr. Peters said, Raul Castro's rise caught the administration off guard. 
 President Bush has remained largely silent, Mr. Peters said, while Raul Castro consolidated his control over Cuban institutions by establishing his own relationships with world leaders, and opening unprecedented dialogue with the Cuban people about their visions for their own country. Meanwhile, all the doomsday scenarios predicted for Cuba once Fidel Castro left power -- a violent uprising by dissidents and a huge exodus of Cuban refugees -- never materialized.
 ''The administration realized they had missed the boat,'' Mr. Peters said. ''Succession has already happened. They can no longer have a policy that keeps them waiting for Castro to die when the rest of the world has moved on.''

HEADLINE: Countrywide to Help Restructure Loans

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Countrywide Financial, the nation's largest home lender and loan servicer, announced yesterday that it would help borrowers restructure some $16 billion in mortgages to avoid foreclosure or financial stress associated with quickly rising adjustable-rate loans. 
 The effort by Countrywide follows weeks of intense criticism from advocacy organizations contending that the company had not moved quickly to help its borrowers escape risky, high-cost loans made before the mortgage crisis took hold this year. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, has also criticized Countrywide for not doing more for troubled homeowners. 
 And last week, the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., asked lenders to help struggling borrowers by modifying the terms of their mortgages.
 ''Unprecedented times call for unprecedented remedies,'' Countrywide's president and chief operating officer, David Sambol, said in a statement. ''We are determined to assist borrowers who have the willingness and wherewithal to remain in their homes, but need a little help to do it.''
 Bank regulators have been pushing loan servicers to modify the terms of more mortgages to avoid foreclosures. But regulatory efforts have been stymied by servicers' claims that they cannot modify loans without the approval of investors who own the mortgages in securitization trusts. Until recently, investors have objected to modifying loans because the income generated by such mortgages would be lower than under the terms of the original loans. 
 But Bruce Marks, founder of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, a nonprofit advocacy and mortgage company, said that this view appeared to be changing. ''There is a recognition now that it's better to have a reasonable return of, say, 6 percent,'' Mr. Marks said, ''than to force someone who has a 11 percent interest rate into foreclosure and to lose $100,000 or more.'' 
 Countrywide's program has three parts. First, employees in a newly created refinance unit will contact 52,000 borrowers holding roughly $10 billion in mortgages and offer alternatives to their existing loans. New options could include loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration or those available under programs offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big government-sponsored entities that finance billions in home loans. 
 Countrywide did not specify the interest rates on the refinanced loans, but subprime loans typically have higher rates than those backed by the government-sponsored entities. 
 In addition, Countrywide said it would identify borrowers who are current on their loans but who may have difficulty meeting the higher payments when their adjustable loans reset. For these customers, Countrywide said it would extend the initial interest rate for five years. Some 20,000 prime and subprime borrowers whose mortgages total $4 billion fall into this category, the company said . 
 Finally, Countrywide said it would bring interest rates back down to initial levels on an estimated 10,000 delinquent borrowers whose adjustable loans reset. Mortgages held by these borrowers total $2.2 billion, the company estimated.
 Delinquencies and foreclosures among the $1.46 trillion in loans serviced by Countrywide have been rising fast. As a percentage of unpaid principal balances, delinquencies reached 5.85 percent in September, up from 4.04 percent in the same period in 2006. Foreclosures in the loan servicing portfolio amounted to 1.27 percent of the total principal balance, up from 0.51 percent one year ago. 
 ''Given Countrywide's track record, a lot of questions must be answered before they get a pat on the back,'' Mr. Schumer said in a statement. ''What are the fees they will be charging borrowers to refinance or restructure their loans? Who will qualify for help? And are they putting these borrowers into safe, affordable products or another unsuitable loan?''
 A Countrywide spokeswoman said that the fees levied on borrowers who refinance into prime loans would vary based on the types of mortgages they assume, but that the charges would be typical of those currently found in the market. If the borrower's existing loan carries a prepayment penalty, Countrywide said it would ''take steps to schedule the closing so that the penalty is no longer in effect.''
 There will be no fees and prepayment penalties assessed on borrowers whose loans are modified or on delinquent borrowers, the spokeswoman said.
 Investors reacted negatively to Countrywide's announcement; even as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 109.26 points, the lender's shares fell 63 cents, to $15.05, in regular trading.

HEADLINE: A Streetcar Named Development

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
THE writer E. B. White once remarked in the 1930s that streetcars were ''brilliantly obsolete.'' But in Portland, Ore., and nearly a dozen other American cities, the whine of electric streetcar motors is fast becoming a symbol of a thriving city center. 
 Dallas opened a 2.8-mile line in 1989, and since then eight cities have built new streetcar lines, including Memphis, Little Rock, San Francisco and Tampa, all serving growing numbers of riders using restored cars or replicas. 
 Portland, which opened the first section of what is now an eight-mile loop in 2001, was the first to use modern streetcars, designed and built in the Czech Republic. 
 A new 2.6-mile streetcar line is scheduled to open in Seattle in December; a new line is to open in Washington in 2009; and a four-mile line is to begin operating in Tucson in December 2010. Miami, Columbus, Cincinnati, Phoenix, Missoula, Grand Rapids and some 70 other American cities are studying the feasibility of opening lines, according to Reconnecting America, a national nonprofit transit research group in Oakland, Calif.
 Not since the turn of the 20th century, when metropolitan regions built elegant urban-rail networks, which were later dismantled, have streetcars generated such intense interest, according to the American Public Transportation Association, a Washington trade group.
 Much of the reason lies in what happened after Portland decided that a streetcar, operating on fixed tracks and sharing the right of way with cars, was not only a new option for getting from one end of town to the other, but also a boon to developers as a new rail corridor for building homes and offices downtown. The Portland region also has a 44-mile network of light-rail lines, using faster and larger cars, that runs through the center of the city to the eastern and western suburbs. An 8.3-mile, $575.7 million extension is under way, scheduled to open in 2009. 
 ''All I can say is that the stars lined up the right way for Portland,'' said John Carroll, a local home builder who is on a committee that oversees the streetcars. ''The Portland streetcar demonstrated that the city was serious about developing downtown at a time when the core was much quieter than it is now. Our last seven or eight projects have been within a block, block and half of the streetcar line.''
 The city-owned streetcar line, which cost $100 million to build, has helped sweep in $2.4 billion in new commercial and housing development, with 7,248 new housing units, according to city statistics. A former vacant railway yard and grimy light-industrial sector on the line's northern end was transformed into a hip area called the Pearl District. On the other end, industrial ground along the Williamette River has become the South Waterfront, a neighborhood of high-rise condominiums, town houses, offices, parks and a tram with spectacular views. 
 Although riding the Portland streetcars now seems like a logical step to urban prosperity, getting the line built took 11 years of promoting the idea. 
 A major task included convincing residents that pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers and streetcars could co-exist in the same right of way. Miami, which plans to open a line in 2012, put the problem to rest by producing videos of Portland streetcars as they operate without a hitch, and posting them on a Web site, miamigov.com/MiamiStreetcar/pages/Videos.asp.
 Another challenge was raising money. Portland financed its line almost entirely with local taxes. 
 Two years ago, Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Portland, convinced his colleagues in the House of Representatives to approve a new ''funding provision called Small Starts in the federal transportation bill to help pay for the line. This year the program is providing $100 million for building streetcar lines and bus rapid transit systems. Portland wants to use $75 million in Small Starts money to partly finance a 6.7-mile, $146 million extension of its streetcar line. 
 ''There is a constellation of factors that are contributing to interest in alternatives to driving,'' said Norm Marshall, a principal at Smart Mobility, a transportation planning and engineering firm in Norwich, Vt. ''There are concerns about the lack of money to build major new roads and rising fuel prices. And more people understand the advantages to being in a place where you can get where you are going either in shorter car trips or no car trips at all.''
 Portland's streetcars carry nearly 10,000 passengers a day, almost four times the number it anticipated when the line opened, said Rick Gustafson, executive director of Portland Streetcar, the nonprofit corporation that operates the line. 
 ''There's no question that we are part of the combined investment over the last 20 years that produced the infrastructure that made it possible for people to park their cars and turn Portland into a walking environment,'' Mr. Gustafson said. ''When you create that, amazingly enough the market responds.''

HEADLINE: Stocks & Bonds: Rally in Technology Companies and Drop in Oil Price Help Lift Major Markets

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday after better-than-expected earnings from Apple and American Express eased concern that the housing slump has depressed consumer spending.
 Apple climbed after the company reported record sales of Macintosh computers and growing demand for iPods and iPhones. American Express gained on higher credit-card charges by wealthy customers. Burlington Northern Santa Fe rallied on earnings that topped analysts' forecasts.
Research in Motion's alliance with Alcatel-Lucent to distribute the BlackBerry e-mail phone in China helped spur a late-day rally in technology stocks that pushed the Nasdaq composite index up 45.33 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,799.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 13.26 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,519.59. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 109.26 points, or 0.8 percent, to 13,676.23. 
 The Russell 2000 index, a benchmark for companies with a median market value of $652 million, rose 1 percent, to 818.53.
 The yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 0.01 percentage point, to 4.40 percent. The price rose 2/32, to 102 23/32.
 The dollar dropped against the euro and oil fell for a third day, slipping 75 cents, to $85.27 a barrel in New York, on forecasts that a government report today will show that United States inventories rose.
 Amazon.com, the biggest Internet retailer, climbed $9.53, or 10 percent, to $100.82 for the best advance in the S.& P. 500 on optimism its earnings would top estimates. The stock then gave up almost all of the gains in extended trading after the company posted profit that exceeded the average analyst forecast by only a penny a share.
 Apple soared $11.80, or 6.8 percent, to a record $186.16. American Express gained $1.79, to $58.66. 
 Burlington Northern added $3.54, or 4.3 percent, to $86.54. The railroad said profit rose 8.4 percent, beating estimates, as it hauled more farm products and raised rates.
 Research in Motion jumped $11.15, or 9.8 percent, to $124.53. Alcatel will sell the BlackBerry 8700 model to business customers in China this year, Research in Motion said yesterday.
 The benchmark United States indexes briefly erased their advances after Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, told a conference in Chicago he sees a ''state of fear'' in the commercial paper market and Wal-Mart Stores lowered its capital spending forecast.
 Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, fell the most in the Dow, losing $1.32, or 2.9 percent, to $43.93. Wal-Mart cut its capital spending forecast for the second time this year, the chief financial officer, Thomas M. Schoewe, said at an analysts' meeting, as the company seeks to counter slowing growth in the United States.
 Whirlpool, the world's largest appliance maker, slipped $4.25, to $83.74. Whirlpool reported third-quarter sales below analysts' estimates as the housing slump hurt demand for refrigerators and dishwashers.
 AT&T advanced 85 cents, to $42.02. The owner of the biggest United States mobile-phone service posted a 41 percent increase in third-quarter earnings on savings from acquisitions and revenue from new wireless handsets, including the iPhone.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auctions of four-week Treasury bills and five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities:

HEADLINE: Broader Losses From Mortgages

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Every time economists and Wall Street executives think they have acknowledged the full extent of the losses from the meltdown in real estate mortgages, more bad news turns up. 
 Merrill Lynch said yesterday that it would take a charge for mortgage-related securities on its books that is $3 billion more than the $5 billion it expected just two weeks ago. And a report from the National Association of Realtors showed that sales of existing homes in September fell twice as much as economists had expected, to their lowest level in nearly 10 years.
 Stocks fell sharply early yesterday on the news, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index falling 1.8 percent before recovering in the afternoon. Investors also bid up Treasuries as they sought the safety of government-backed debt.
 At this juncture, economists say the troubles in the mortgage market could, all told, cost financial firms and investors up to $400 billion. 
 That is far more than the roughly $240 billion cost, adjusted for inflation, of the savings and loan crisis of the early 1990s, according to estimates of the combined financial toll of that crisis on both the federal government and private sector. The loss in total real estate wealth is expected to range from $2 trillion to $4 trillion, depending on how far home prices fall, according to several economists. 
 That would be significantly less than the losses suffered by investors in the stock market collapse earlier this decade, which erased more than $7 trillion, or about 40 percent, of market value.
 Experts caution that these estimates are preliminary and the total costs could get bigger still. They also note that the loss of real estate wealth could prove more damaging for the general public than falling stock values because more American families own homes than own stock. 
 In recent years, the rise in real estate values has helped propel consumer spending, as homeowners refinanced mortgages and took out home equity loans.
 ''There weren't a lot of people living off their capital gains from stocks,'' said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management. ''There were a lot people using their home as a piggy bank.'' 
 Of course, many people who bought their houses several years ago are still ahead financially, because the sharp run-up in home values is still far greater than the expected decline. Those who bought close to the peak stand to lose the most if they have to sell in the near future.
 In a new report to be issued today, the Joint Economic Committee of Congress predicts about two million foreclosures by the end of next year on homes purchased with subprime mortgages. That estimate is far higher than the Bush administration's prediction in September of 500,000 foreclosures, which in itself would be a tidal wave compared with recent years. Congressional aides provided details of the report yesterday to The New York Times.
 The Joint Economic Committee estimates that the lost of real estate wealth just from foreclosures on subprime loans will be about $71 billion. An additional $32 billion would be lost because foreclosed homes tend to drive down the prices of other houses in the neighborhood. 
 Those figures would cause a decline of $917 million in lost property tax revenue to state and local governments, which will also have to spend more on policing neighborhoods with vacant homes. The states most likely to be hard hit fall into two categories: those where prices had been rising fastest, like California and Florida, and Midwest states with weak economies, like Michigan and Ohio, where people with low or moderate incomes made heavy use of subprime loans to become homeowners and consolidate debts.
 ''State by state, the economic costs from the subprime debacle are shockingly high,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. ''From New York to California, we are headed for billions in lost wealth, property values and tax revenues.''
 Still, subprime mortgages make up a relatively small share of the total housing market -- about $1 trillion of the $10 trillion in outstanding mortgages.
 The much bigger losses will be in declining real estate prices. Household real estate currently totals about $21 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve. 
 Global Insight, a research firm, predicts that the national average for housing prices will drop 5 percent over the next year and 10 percent before mid-2009, for a total of about $2 trillion. Economists at Goldman Sachs have predicted prices will drop by 15 percent, meaning an overall decline of more than $3 trillion; other forecasters have said the decline could be 20 percent or more.
 House prices decline slowly, because many potential sellers simply stay in their current homes when they think prices are too low. But that becomes more difficult as people have to move either because of job changes or, increasingly, because their monthly payments are rising sharply. In the next 18 months, interest rates on more than two million homes loans will reset to higher adjustable rates. 
 Inventories of unsold existing homes rose last month to their highest level in almost 20 years. 
 Economists continue to update their predictions on how the loss of housing wealth might affect the overall economy. Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at Global Insight, said he assumes that consumers reduce their spending by about 6 cents for every dollar of lost wealth. 
 If prices drop 5 percent next year, that would mean a decline of $60 billion in spending, all else being equal. That would be a noticeable slowdown, but not enough to cause a recession.
 In the last several years, Americans have increased spending faster than their incomes by borrowing against the rising value of their homes. Economists estimate that such mortgage-equity withdrawals may have added one-quarter of a percentage point to consumer spending growth -- a boost that could now disappear.
 Thus far, spending has climbed more than 3 percent over the last year, and the most recent data on chain-store sales suggests sluggish growth but nothing near levels consistent with a recession.
 The housing bust has also led to job losses. From the start of 2003 to March 2006, housing-related businesses like mortgage companies, home builders and contractors added 1.3 million jobs, or about 23 percent of all new jobs created in that period, according to an analysis by Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com.
 Since then, the housing business has shed 383,000 jobs, while the rest of the economy has added nearly three million jobs.
 Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, said the small decline in housing employment thus far is surprising and suggests more layoffs are ahead. 
 ''You still have a million jobs that aren't really needed anymore due to the downturn in housing,'' he said.
 D. Ritch Workman, president of the Florida Mortgage Brokers Association, believes he has an explanation. Many of the brokers and loan officers he knows are still working in the industry, even though they have taken on second jobs to make ends meet.
 The home-loan company he owns with his brother in Melbourne, Fla., has seen revenue fall by half, to $500,000, and he has laid off two of its three salaried employees. But the firm has added several loan officers, who are paid on commission only, and it now has 18 people making loans.
 ''I am surprised they have hung in there,'' Mr. Workman said. ''But it's a scary thing when that's all you know. If for 15 years you have been a relatively successful broker and you have lived through the highs and lows, what are you going to do? Most of them are holding on for dear life and hoping things get better.''
 On Wall Street, which fueled the housing boom by lending to mortgage companies and packaging and selling home loans, banks are writing off billions of dollars in bad loans and are setting aside billions more for the expected surge in defaults. Late yesterday afternoon, Bank of America said it would lay off 3,000 people across the company and has replaced the head of its investment banking division.

HEADLINE: Downtown Newark Is Getting Set for a Large, Shiny New Resident

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: NEWARK, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
When 17,000 people pour into the heart of New Jersey's largest city on Thursday night to hear Bon Jovi perform the first of 10 shows, they will undoubtedly be impressed by the glimmering Prudential Center, the first new sports arena in the metropolitan region in 25 years. 
 They will squint into the glare of a towering 4,800-square-foot high-definition billboard, gaze at $1 million worth of hockey-themed art -- including some painted portraits of grinning men without front teeth -- and may react with some perplexity when a man who calls himself a sommelier arrives to take their wine order at the arena's unarenalike restaurant. 
 ''This is not something people are used to,'' said Jeff Vanderbeek, the owner of the Devils hockey team, during a tour last week of one of the arena's 76 luxury boxes, as men in hard hats worked to make the place presentable for its inauguration. ''I think they are going to be overwhelmed.'' 
 The question that many people here are asking is whether the millions of visitors expected to traipse through Newark on their way to and from the $375 million arena in the coming years will be equally entranced by a city that might be charitably described as a work in progress. 
 For now, when they look out through the arena's soaring glass facade or make the two-block hike from Pennsylvania Station, they will see a landscape of parking lots and ramshackle buildings. Their dining choices on Broad Street near Market Street, the city's storied but tattered main intersection, will be limited to a Burger King, a Popeyes and a Bojangles'. If they want to grab a beer or a wine spritzer after the show, they will have to satisfy their thirst at Arena Bar or Scully's Publick House, the only new drinking establishments within four blocks. 
 ''At this point, I thought there would be a lot more going on around the arena,'' said Joseph Aratow, a commercial real estate broker who has spent four years eagerly pitching the area's potential allure to national restaurant chains, banks and boutique cigar bars. ''I think a lot of people are in denial. They still can't believe it's happening.''
 City officials and arena executives take pains to point out that downtown Newark is a flower about to bloom. A hotel is planned for a parcel just across from the arena's front door, and next spring, an adjacent parking lot will be transformed into the $19 million Triangle Park. 
 As officials tell it, there is a hungry band of real estate developers jockeying to construct new residential buildings in the forlorn blocks that surround the red and gray brick-faced arena, which is nicknamed ''the Rock'' and will be home to Seton Hall's men's basketball team in addition to the Devils. 
 ''Things are really shaking. There's a lot of energy coming in,'' said Mayor Cory A. Booker, who opposed the arena's construction before he was elected but who was reborn as a booster after he realized he could not reverse the previous administration's decision to contribute $210 million in public money toward construction.
 ''The line of people who want to develop in that area is getting more exciting by the week,'' Mr. Booker said.
 If you listen to Mr. Vanderbeek, the former Lehman Brothers investment banker who made the arena a reality, the Prudential Center is already a success. More than 90 percent of the Devils' season ticket holders -- who for years endured the drab, swamp-bound isolation of the team's old Meadowlands home -- have renewed their subscriptions, and an additional 3,000 people have taken the plunge. There were so many corporations vying for the 18-seat luxury boxes that Mr. Vanderbeek gleefully hiked the annual price by $20,000, to $285,000. All of them are spoken for until 2010. 
 ''It's a dream come true,'' he said. 
 There has already been some gain for Newark residents. More than half the arena's 1,200 ushers, custodians and concessionaires have local ZIP codes, and eight of the outlets in the Taste of Newark food court will bear the names of popular local establishments. 
 ''I think it's going to be a windfall for us, and for all of Newark,'' said Michael Brummer, whose family-owned delicatessen, Hobby's, will be selling its trademark corned beef, tongue and pastrami concoctions from a counter high above the ice. 
 Mr. Brummer said the arena's opening persuaded him and his brother to start keeping their 90-year-old neighborhood restaurant open for dinner and to dust off the liquor license they have not used in decades. They have also started employing the line, ''We're a block from the Rock,'' on advertisements and fliers. 
 ''We used to walk home stepping on crack vials,'' he said, ''but things are changing. You can feel it in the air.''
 Of course, not everyone expects such change to be beneficial. Many owners of jewelry and clothing stores on Broad Street who cater to African-Americans are skeptical. They say hockey fans, an overwhelmingly white demographic, have little need for the hip-hop clothing shops and hair weaving services that dominate the Broad Street strip. There is also widespread concern that the arena's success will lead to soaring rents and the demise of many longtime businesses. 
 Sabina Smith, who owns the Calabash African Food Market in the shadow of the arena's facade on Edison Place, said she was pleased that a year of disruptive construction was finally ending but also fearful of what the future will hold. Since opening in 1995, Calabash has been the only business on a very forbidding block, although her rent, an affordable $1,300 a month, has made it easier to stay afloat. 
 Standing in her shop, the air heavy with the aroma of smoked mackerel, the shelves heaving with giant yams and sacks of potato starch, she said she would try to appeal to concertgoers and sports fans with Doritos and bottles of cold Sprite. But she admitted that it might all be for naught. ''This project is just too big for a little African shop like me,'' she said, growing tearful. ''I can see the landlord wanting me out of this place.''
 City officials acknowledge that some displacement is inevitable, but they say the new apartments and stores they hope will revive Newark's largely desolate downtown in the coming decade will create hundreds of new jobs and churn out desperately needed tax revenue. 
 ''I think we can recapture the dynamism that was downtown Newark in the '40s, '50s and '60s and create an engine that will stimulate development throughout the city,'' Mr. Booker said. 
 For the moment, arena executives and city officials are focused on surviving the next few weeks. With less than 24 hours left until the opening, municipal workers across the city were scurrying Wednesday night to plant flats of yellow pansies and weed-whack overgrown highway medians. 
 Others were posting the signs that are intended to direct thousands of suburbanites, many of whom have never been to Newark, to dozens of private parking lots. The Police Department has been figuring out deployments for the 80 extra officers who will walk the street when the arena is open. 
 ''My biggest battle right now is dealing with the perception of crime,'' said Deputy Chief Daniel Zieser, who is in charge of operations within a quarter-mile radius of the arena.
 Among hockey fans, who will be arriving on Saturday for the New Jersey Devils' home opener against the Ottawa Senators, the biggest concern right now is parking and traffic. Sam Schwartz, a transportation consultant hired by the city and the arena's owners to plan for the expected onslaught of cars and pedestrians, said there would be 10,000 spaces within a half-mile of the arena. 
 During a news conference last week, Mr. Schwartz urged people to take a train or bus to the city, although he predicted that fewer than a quarter of those coming to the arena would do so, at least in the beginning. He said the police would operate traffic signals by remote control and would favor foot traffic over cars. 
 ''Ultimately, we want to encourage the walking experience,'' he said.
 After the news conference, the city's deputy mayor for economic development, Stefan Pryor, was asked about the potential for traffic before and after games. 
 ''It will be messy, even ugly, in the early going, but the trick is to manage it,'' he said. 
 Then with a smile, he added, ''You know heavy traffic is a sign of a healthy city.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''California Fires Out of Control as 500,000 Flee'' (front page, Oct. 24):
 White ashes rain down from blackened skies; residents wear surgical masks outside; estates and homes crumble in seconds and tens of thousands flee. That was October 2003 around Halloween. 
 Four years later, little has changed except that more than 500,000 residents have fled and the devastation of life, property and serenity stretches from the Mexican border to Rancho Santa Fe and beyond, from the Cuyamaca mountains to the Pacific Ocean. 
 Will the fires ever leave San Diego County alone? Martin Kruming
 San Diego, Oct. 24, 2007
 To the Editor:
 It was evening of the third day of fires whipped by the infamous Santa Ana winds. It felt like sunset on another planet as I saw a truck drive slowly by with a driver staring up at the palm tree in our front yard. 
 Later, there was a knock on the door. I answered. It was the truck driver. He offered to buy the palm tree in our front yard.
 There was an eerie silence as I stood there in the orange smoky haze, ashes falling like snow on Mercury, and blinked two or maybe three times. 
 By motivation, this had absolutely nothing to do with the fire -- it just seemed like something that would happen in Southern California.
 As I quietly closed the door, I thought about Joan Didion; she would understand this. Tom Impelluso

 To the Editor:
 Re ''Victims in Wildfires' Fickle Path Say, 'Why Me?' '' (front page, Oct. 24):
 The answer to that question lies in our number.
 Simply put, there are too many people in Southern California -- building where homes should not be built, and too many driving too far every day to work.
 Mounting evidence suggests that there are too many people in this nation, let alone on this planet, given the polluting and inefficient technologies we use to shelter and sustain ourselves. 
 Too many fossil fuel emissions are warming the globe, disrupting natural weather cycles, bringing unprecedented drought, heat and wind to places like Southern California. 
 This is hardly the economic catastrophe predicted by the Stanford population biologist Paul R. Ehrlich, whose 1968 book ''The Population Bomb'' ought to be required reading in the world's capitals. But it is a sampling of what's to come if our numbers, along with our appetites and willful ignorance, continue to increase.

 Re ''With Katrina Fresh, Bush Moves Briskly'' (news article, Oct. 24):
 Isn't it great that President Bush has decided to act quickly to combat wildfires in California? The effort has been dubbed the ''anti-Katrina'' by the administration. Yet I am not convinced that scores of troops and helicopters have been deployed in the effort because the president has learned how to respond to a disaster. Not justly anyway. 
 Thousands remain homeless in New Orleans. And recently we learned that Katrina victims living in FEMA trailers may be suffering health effects because of formaldehyde exposure. New Orleans has not been cleaned up, and the administration has learned its lesson?
 The Californian wildfires are indeed the ''anti-Katrina'': they're raging toward Southern Californian beach homes, not poor, predominately black neighborhoods. I hope for the best in California, but please do not purport that all disaster victims are treated equally in this country.

 Seattle, Oct. 24, 2007
 To the Editor:
 ''Stadium Provides Relief Amid the Fires'' (news article, Oct. 23) made me ponder a stark contrast: At Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, middle-class suburbanites fleeing the fires enjoy pizza, steaming coffee, TV, free massages and autism specialists. 
 Just over two years ago, at the Superdome and Convention Center in New Orleans, poor people endured days of no food or water and stifling heat, as baseless reports circulated about rapes and murders, and National Guardsmen sent to help barricaded themselves instead behind locked doors. How come? 
 No one begrudges the help the San Diegans are receiving, and there are clear differences in the two situations. Yet the contrast has something to teach us. I hope we can learn from it.

HEADLINE: Less Than a Spa But More Than A Barbershop

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
 WITH its living-room decor and laid-back soundtrack, Starbucks has turned getting a cup of coffee into a spectacle. Now Floyd's 99 Barbershop on Massachusetts Avenue here is trying to do the same for the straight-razor shave with a salon designed for the multitasking male. 
 Last Friday evening, as they waited for shaves and haircuts, a handful of college students checked their e-mail at kiosks while others watched ''SportsCenter'' on plasma screens, as Foreigner's ''Double Vision'' thumped from Bowers & Wilkins speakers.
 ''It's right in between a real barbershop and a fancier hair salon,'' said Jonathan Leong, 24, a graduate student at Northeastern University on his second visit for a $24 haircut. ''An older, more conservative person might want something more formal, but this place feels like a pretty good fit for a college town.''
 Hipster barbershops that double as art galleries, men's stores or entertainment centers are turning up nationwide, with the aim of creating a midprice alternative to no-frills neighborhood barbershops and higher-priced salons. Some even offer services for women. 
 Just don't call them spas. These newfangled grooming centers refer to themselves as ''barbershop salons'' and attract men who want amenities, not manicures.
 Bishop's, www.bishopsbs.com, with five outlets in Portland, Ore., styles itself as a rock 'n' roll barbershop offering a free can of Miller beer to customers over 21. Frank's Chop Shop, frankschopshop.com, which uses its exposed brick walls to display photography, opened last year on Essex Street in Manhattan. And in Boston, Floyd's, floydsbarbershop.com, is a franchise of a chain founded by three brothers in Denver and named after the barber in ''The Andy Griffith Show.''
 ''The Floyd's customer is not going to feel comfortable changing into a robe at a spa and padding around in slippers,'' said Clare Midgley, an owner of Floyd's here. ''We have an upscale, energetic feel, but the game is on, the chairs are sturdy and it's not too froufrou.''
 Fred Fleisher, the other owner, said about 80 percent of the clients are men, many of whom come in for a classic shave with a straight razor, a 45-minute 14-step process that involves a series of treatments with lemon cleanser, cocoa butter, hot lather and hot and cold towels.
 Floyd's also attracts customers who want precise, linear hair. On Friday evening, Andre Johnson, a barber, spent 20 minutes on a haircut for Seif Dorani, an economics major at Northeastern, clipping his hair with an electronic trimmer into a symmetrical fade. Then he turned to Mr. Dorani's beard, first employing the trimmer then a straight razor to create a goatee of thin geometric lines.
 ''I've been to barbershops in Roxbury and in Astoria,'' said Mr. Dorani, 20, who is from New York City. ''But this appeals more to my generation.'' 
 Still, he had a request for updated barbershops: more up-to-date tunes. ''They should be playing Cassidy,'' he said, ''or at least some tracks from Jay-Z's new album.''

HEADLINE: Shake-Up and Job Cuts At Bank of America

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Bank of America's investment bank has lobbied hard to win Wall Street's respect. Now, it is lowering its head in retreat. 
 Bank of America announced a shake-up of its investment bank last night, cutting 3,000 jobs and installing Brian T. Moynihan as its fourth leader in fewer than seven years. 
 The announcement followed a terrible third quarter in which the investment banking unit's profit dropped 93 percent after virtually every area performed poorly. 
 The shake-up was a significant setback for Kenneth D. Lewis, Bank of America's no-nonsense chairman and chief executive who has clamored for the gravitas of Wall Street's more-established players. He said last week that the company's performance amid the credit market turbulence was ''not acceptable'' and announced a review of its investment banking operations. 
 Part of the move will include the early retirement of R. Eugene Taylor, a gentleman banker who led the division since 2005 and spent 38 years at the company. The changes will leave in place most of the management team that guided the unit through this summer's market turbulence. 
 The company replaced Christopher C. Hentemann as head of structured products on Friday, naming George Ellison to the post. His boss, Thomas G. White, was named head of capital markets after Mark Werner left in June, shortly before the markets soured. No other changes are expected. 
 The shake-up will result in the loss of 3,000 jobs, with the bulk coming from the bank's global corporate and investment banking business. That is less than 5 percent of the work force of that division, the company said. Most of the layoffs are in commercial banking, treasury services and back-office groups, and will be spread nationwide. However, investment bankers and traders, based largely in New York and Charlotte, N.C., are not immune.
 ''In light of the change in markets and growth prospects, the company is downsizing some positions,'' Mr. Moynihan, 48, said in a brief interview last night. ''It's a broad group, but it is preparing us for the slowdown ahead in the economy.''
 Mr. Moynihan, who until yesterday ran the bank's global wealth management division, is leading the review of the investment bank, but drew few conclusions. 
 He said that it would continue to support its commercial customers as well as its hedge fund and private equity clients, which have become a mainstay of its business. It would also look at businesses like the packaging of loans and financial instruments. 
 However, Mr. Moynihan did not address the prospects of proprietary trading and fixed-income operations, which were responsible for most of the third quarter's losses. Executives said there were no plans for more layoffs, but said it was unclear if there would be other rounds after the review. The findings are expected before the end of the year.
 Keith Banks, 51, who runs the Columbia Management mutual fund arm, will succeed Mr. Moyihan as the head of wealth management. Mr. Taylor, who Equilar says will leave with a $35 million exit package, will stay on until the end of the year.
 In Mr. Moynihan, Bank of America is installing a seasoned manager who brought a steady hand to the integration of U.S. Trust this year. While smart and a straight shooter, he he lacks the polish and pizazz of Wall Street's established chieftains. 
 Mr. Moynihan has quickly moved up Bank of America's corporate ranks, overseeing its strategy, commercial lending and treasury functions before taking charge of wealth management. But he has never run a capital markets unit.
 Mr. Moynihan said his responsibility was to ''get the right talent on the field.''
 ''Was I a trader? No,'' he said. ''More importantly, we have the right people leading the businesses and doing the right things.'' 
 Bank of America, itself a product of a string of several big deals to create a retail bank that stretched from coast to coast, has long desired to be an investment banking power. As it brushes up against a federal deposit cap, that has become an increasingly important goal because it needs to find growth opportunities outside of consumer banking.
 But like its Charlotte crosstown rival Wachovia, it has struggled to build a Wall Street franchise from scratch. It has has had trouble attracting and retaining star bankers. It has been roiled by top management turnover. 
 And though it has gained traction with many of its corporate clients, Bank of America still is overshadowed by more established, global players. Bank of America's dismal investment banking performance in the third quarter was only the latest in a series of troubles. 
 Profit plummeted to $100 million from $1.43 billion a year ago, leading to a 32 percent drop in earnings and raising questions about risk management.
 Nearly all of its fixed-income operations sharply declined, including a $607 million blow from bad trading bets and a $527 million loss from its packaging mortgage bonds, leveraged loans and other asset-backed securities. 
 Last week, Mr. Lewis said his initial assessment was that his investment bankers did a good job managing its leveraged loan portfolio and avoiding several bad deals. But he was less sanguine about the bank's trading performance, blaming about two-thirds of its poor results on bad judgment and mistakes. ''I've had all the fund I can stand in investment banking,'' he added.

HEADLINE: We'll Always Have Putin

BYLINE: By LEON ARON. 
Leon Aron, the director of Russian studies at the American Enterprise Institute, is the author of ''Russia's Revolution: Essays 1989-2006.''

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH said last week of his erstwhile ''friend'' Vladimir Putin, ''I have no idea what he's going to do.'' Mr. Bush is not alone: no one but Mr. Putin knows whether the Russian president will relinquish power next year. Still, after Mr. Putin's announcement that he would not be averse to becoming the next prime minister, the prevailing guess is that after the March 2 presidential election Mr. Putin will head the Russian government under a new president.
 Yet before the Bush administration and the leading contenders for the White House begin to design a Russia policy based on this, its plausibility has to be examined. In the light of what we know about Mr. Putin and the political and economic system he has forged, he is more likely to find a way to continue in office as President Putin.
 To begin, Vladimir Putin has done the opposite of what he publicly said he would do with regard to some major policy issues. In November 2003, he declared that ''the state should not really seek to destroy'' Yukos -- at the time Russia's largest, most modern and most transparent private company -- and then methodically did just that through a palpably fraudulent prosecution. 
 He has repeatedly averred that Russia needs a robust party system -- and then proceeded to make participation in parliamentary elections arduous and subject to unchallenged management by an election commission that is subservient to the Kremlin. No party may hope even to get on the ballot in Russia without the Kremlin's approval. 
 The president has extolled democracy in virtually every one of his annual state-of-Russia addresses since 2000 -- and then canceled the election of regional governors, who are now all but directly appointed by Moscow. He correctly identified independent mass media as the main weapon against corruption -- and then brought under the Kremlin's control practically all nationwide print, radio and television outlets. 
 For Mr. Putin, taking on the job of prime minister would be not just ''stepping down'' but wallowing in self-abnegation. The prime ministers under Mr. Putin have been appointed by the president and have served at his pleasure. They have been little more than figureheads who cannot even pick their own cabinets. This year, Mr. Putin deprived the prime minister of supervision over the so-called state corporations, into which the president's administration had earlier merged some of Russia's vital, and often most profitable, industrial enterprises -- like missile production and nuclear power.
 Of course, with Mr. Putin's party, United Russia, poised to take two-thirds of the seats in Parliament, its approval of constitutional amendments emaciating the presidency and fashioning a more powerful ''executive'' role for the prime minister is assured (as is the constitutionally mandated endorsement of the two-thirds of the regional legislatures now also firmly in the Kremlin's hand). 
 Still, while Ukraine has profited from a similar devolution of presidential authority, Russia would have to go much further to make the job of prime minister palatable for Mr. Putin. In addition to giving the Parliament, and not the president, the right to form the government, the prime minister may have to be made commander-in-chief as well.
 Yet power in Russia today grows not only from the barrel of a gun, but also from a barrel of oil. And here, too, everything has been done to ensure that the president's administration, not the prime minister's office, be in charge of the daily export of seven million barrels of crude oil and oil products (like fuel oil and diesel fuel). With natural gas, these fuel exports fetched $190 billion last year. 
 Never before in Russian history have so few exercised such tight control over a national wealth that is so vast and liquid, in more ways than one. The stakes of relinquishing power have grown commensurately for Mr. Putin. If he becomes prime minister, a vast network of informal arrangements that made the president and his entourage the managers of Russia's most lucrative natural resources will have to be dismantled -- redirected away from the Kremlin and toward the prime minister. 
 For a man who declared the demise of the Soviet Union to be ''the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century,'' even the most ''executive'' of prime-ministerships may not be enough. The Russian president is the symbol of the nation, its above-the-fray father. He is now also in complete control of the election and of much of the economy. Mr. Putin must consider moving out, like some silly American president vacating the White House, to be downright humiliating -- not to mention bad for the country and the people who like him so much.
 Staying in the Kremlin without violating the letter of the 1993 Constitution (the spirit went out of it several years ago) could be accomplished by Mr. Putin in several ways. The easiest method would be for Parliament to pass a constitutional amendment eliminating term limits. The problem with this solution is that it would make Russia look like Belarus or Kazakhstan, ruled by a president-for-life. For all the popularity that Mr. Putin enjoys, the national embarrassment (never mind the international outcry) might be acute and widespread enough to carry significant political risks.
 But at least two other solutions could be found. Both possess the significant advantage of avoiding a constitutional amendment that President Putin seems reluctant to bless. In one possibility, Mr. Putin could become prime minister and then become acting president should the new officeholder find himself incapable of carrying out his duties. Viktor Zubkov, plucked by Mr. Putin from obscurity a few weeks ago to be made prime minister, is 66, six years past the retirement age for men in Russia (and 11 years older than Mr. Putin). Should Mr. Zubkov, with Mr. Putin's endorsement, be elected president, he may quickly find the burdens of power too hard to sustain after only a few months in office. And then a new presidential election, which must be held within three months and which Mr. Putin would be certain to win, would give Mr. Putin another full term in office, without formally violating the constitutional limit of two consecutive terms.
 The other option would not require Mr. Putin to move out of the Kremlin even for a short time. According to the Russian Constitution, the president may declare martial law in the case of aggression or ''direct threat of aggression.'' A subsequent ''martial law regime'' could be easily fashioned by the Parliament to include the cancellation of elections until the ''threat'' is over. 
 The ''threat'' could be found to emanate from Estonia, which has been sharply denounced by Russia's official propaganda this year. Estonia's ambassador in Moscow has been harassed by a government-organized youth group and its Web sites have been subject to cyberattacks. Or it could be Georgia, which borders on Russia's volatile North Caucasus and is in a de facto state of war with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, its two breakaway provinces. In Abkhazia, a majority of the population holds Russian passports, and the leaders of South Ossetia have repeatedly expressed the desire to join the Russian Federation. 
 During a state of emergency, Russians could be counted on to rally around the flag, at least initially. In a longer run, the prolonged presidency would have to be legalized somehow. But, as Lenin wrote, quoting a maxim often attributed to Napoleon, ''on s'engage et puis on voit'': you get in a fight and then you see what to do next. 
 Apart from Nicholas II, who resigned in a revolution, only two Russian leaders have walked away from power: Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. But these two men were remarkable in a larger sense: they presided over a proto-democracy that made Russia the freest it has ever been, save for the eight months from February to November 1917. Proto-autocracies -- even ''softer'' ones that, for the moment, enjoy popular allegiance -- are harder, and more dangerous, to leave behind.

HEADLINE: Using Chavez as Counterpoint, Bush Pursues Latin Trade Pacts

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has enlisted an unlikely ally in its international trade agenda: Hugo Chavez, the leftist president of Venezuela, who makes a practice of denouncing United States' influence in Latin America.
 Facing opposition to his proposed trade accords with Peru, Panama and Colombia from labor unions, social activist groups and many Democrats, President Bush has unleashed an intense campaign to win approval for the deals, arguing that they will strengthen capitalism and democracy and weaken Mr. Chavez in a volatile region.
 White House officials say Mr. Bush is passionate about the Latin American agreements, and also one with South Korea, considering them essential to his program in the waning months of his administration. 
 The effort includes trips to Colombia by two Cabinet members -- Carlos M. Gutierrez, the commerce secretary, and Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative -- accompanied by Democratic and Republican lawmakers. In a separate push, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is emphasizing security interests in Latin America. 
 In addition, Mr. Bush has invited Democrats to the White House to discuss trade issues, and the president's lobbyists have been frequent visitors to Capitol Hill. 
 With some Democrats, the arguments are persuasive. The trade pact with Peru is expected to be approved, although the Panama and Colombia deals are less certain. The one with Colombia has been held up by Democratic concerns over the killings of labor leaders there.
 Bush aides say the president is especially determined to help Colombia's president, Alvaro Uribe, who is credited with cracking down on crime and drug trafficking, even if officials agree that Colombia could do more in this area.
 ''The economic arguments are very strong for the Colombia deal,'' Mr. Gutierrez said in an interview. ''But the political arguments are equally strong. Colombia has been one of our closest allies in the region. What an irony it would be if it is punished for its support of the United States.''
 Many Democrats have opposed trade deals, even those pushed by President Bill Clinton. The administration hopes to win over enough Democrats to pass the Latin American pacts this year or next. There is, however, considerable disagreement whether the argument of countering Mr. Chavez as a security matter will persuade Democrats.
 Democrats say that the House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi, has warned the administration not to invoke the specter of Mr. Chavez but to focus on curbing the labor abuses under Mr. Uribe. 
 ''The problem is that Hugo Chavez is not their main thrust -- he is their only thrust,'' Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said. ''Nobody likes Chavez, but I don't think a bogeyman is going to get people excited into voting for these trade deals.''
 But two other Democratic Congressmen from New York City, Representatives Gregory W. Meeks and Eliot L. Engel, who traveled to Colombia recently, said in interviews that they agreed that the United States needed to help Colombia and other countries face up to the Venezuelan president.
 ''The Chavez issue plays on something important,'' Mr. Meeks said. ''What has to be considered is the difference between two economic systems. One is the capitalist model of friends like Colombia based on market access. The other is the failed socialist model of Venezuela. We have to show that our system works.''
 Mr. Engel said of Mr. Chavez: ''He's saying, 'Follow me, I'm the wave of the future in Latin America.' We do have to counter that.'' But he said he was not ready to endorse the Colombia deal without labor improvements there.
 Trade has been a sensitive issue since Democrats regained control of Congress last year. Many Democrats blame free trade deals for the loss of manufacturing jobs. Some even cite trade-opening measures in connection with the influx of shoddy and unsafe imports. The leading Democratic presidential candidates have expressed concern about the effects of trade deals on American workers.
 As a result, Democrats are generally opposed to the administration's trade proposals. But in May, Ms. Pelosi won a major concession when the administration agreed to attach labor and environmental protections to all pending trade deals.
 The accord with Peru is close to winning approval, but the one with Panama is being held up because a top Panamanian legislative leader has been charged with murdering an American soldier. The South Korea pact is also stalled.
 Opponents of the Colombia deal do not deny that conditions have improved since the late '90s, when President Clinton and Republican Congressional leaders put together a multibillion-dollar aid package. But they say conditions have not improved enough and labor organizers are still killed with impunity.
 When Mr. Gutierrez said recently that labor violence was no longer a problem in the country, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a Democrat who won last year in part by challenging recent trade agreements, said he was ''astounded'' by the comment.
 ''On the contrary,'' Mr. Brown said in a letter to the commerce secretary, ''there is overwhelming evidence that Colombia remains the most dangerous country in the world in which to be a labor leader.''
 The dispute over violence in Colombia has all but overshadowed economic arguments. According to the administration, nearly 20,000 American companies sell products in Colombia, and Latin America is the fastest-growing region in the world for goods from the United States. This country is now Colombia's biggest source for imports.
 Secretary Rice joined the chorus this month. She was careful not to use Mr. Chavez's name -- administration officials say they do not want to emphasize his importance -- but she said the Latin America deals were important to head off ''authoritarian'' influences in the region.
 Colombia, she said, was a ''failed state'' seven years ago, but with American assistance had pushed back the influence of insurgents and narcotics gangs and lowered the number of kidnappings, bombings and other acts of violence. The trade deals, she said, were ''essential to our strategic interests'' in the region.

MEASURING A MELTDOWN Economists say the meltdown in the American mortgage market could, all told, cost financial firms and investors more than the savings and loan crisis of the early 1990's. But the loss in total real estate wealth is expected to be less than that of the stock market collapse earlier this decade. 
 A $2.3 BILLION LOSS AT MERRILL Merrill Lynch said that it would take a $7.9 billion write-down because of its exposure to collateralized debt obligations, complex debt instruments and subprime mortgages. The result was a $2.3 billion loss, the largest in the firm's history. ''We made a mistake,'' said the chief executive, E. Stanley O'Neal. [C1.] 
 Merrill Lynch appears ready to move its longtime headquarters from Lower Manhattan to a new skyscraper in Midtown, across from Pennsylvania Station. [B1.]
 TURNING ON A WHISTLE-BLOWER In a rare case of someone blowing a whistle on a whistle-blower, the Justice Department has decided that a man who told the government about fraud at his former employer was, in fact, the mastermind of a bigger scheme within the company. [A1.] 
 TAX OVERHAUL LEGISLATION The House's leading Democratic tax writer, Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, will propose a sweeping overhaul of the tax code today that would increase rates on many people with incomes above $200,000 but reduce them for most other people. The bill would also overhaul corporate taxes by eliminating many major tax breaks and lowering overall tax rates. [C1.] 
 MICROSOFT STAKE IN FACEBOOK Microsoft will pay $240 million for a 1.6 percent stake in Facebook, the two companies said. The investment values Facebook, the social networking upstart, at $15 billion. [C1.] 
 DEFINING 'SMALL BUSINESS' When a small business accepts venture capital money, does it become controlled by the investors? A debate has been stirred by a bill introduced by a Pennsylvania congressman, and at stake are billions of dollars in federal grants and contracts set aside for small companies. [C1.] 
 Many survivors of breast cancer are starting companies and organizations that try to lessen the ordeal of others who may be diagnosed with the disease. Small Business. [C13.] 
 SHAKE-UP AT BANK OF AMERICA Bank of America announced a shake-up of its investment bank last night, cutting 3,000 jobs and installing Brian T. Moynihan as its fourth leader in less than seven years. The announcement followed a terrible third quarter, where the investment banking unit's profit dropped 93 percent after virtually every area performed poorly amid the credit market turmoil. [C4.] 
 BUSH PURSUES TRADE PACTS 
 The Bush administration, fighting for proposed trade accords in Latin America, has enlisted an unlikely ally: Hugo Chavez, the leftist president of Venezuela. President Bush says the accords will weaken Mr. Chavez in a volatile region. [C6.] 
 WILDFIRES' COST TO INSURERS As bad as the California fires look on television and as horrible as they are for families with homes in their path, the wildfires are expected to cost insurers about $1 billion, only a fraction of the $41.1 billion that insurance companies paid out for Hurricane Katrina. 
 [A18.] 
 PLUNGING SALES' SILVER LINING A bleak report on sales of existing homes -- sales plunged 8 percent in September to the slowest annual pace in nearly a decade -- gave investors hope that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. The Dow Jones industrials recovered morning losses and ended the day flat. [C4.] 
 AUTO WORKERS VOTING The tentative agreement between Chrysler and the United Automobile Workers union got a boost when workers at three big factories in the Detroit area voted in favor of the contract by a wide margin. About 9,000 workers voted in the Detroit area on what one union leader called Super Wednesday. Once their ballots are counted, almost 90 percent of the votes will be in, and the outcome is likely to be clear. [C2.] 
 CABLEVISION BUYOUT REJECTED Shareholders voted to block the Dolan family's $10.6 billion bid for Cablevision Systems, the largest rebuke of a buyout ever. Many large shareholders had expressed reservations about the offer of $36.26 a share. [C4.] 
 WPP ACQUIRES ANOTHER AGENCY The WPP Group, the giant advertising company, has for the second time in two weeks bought a leading interactive agency: Blast Radius, an agency based in Vancouver, British Columbia, whose revenue last year was 41.8 million Canadian dollars (about $43 million). [C12.] 
 TIME FOR A SPOKESAPPLE Casual dining chains, which have seen sales soften lately, are revamping their marketing campaigns. On Sunday, Applebee's will unveil a new theme (''Together is good'') and a sass-talking apple. [C12.] 
 MILITARY CONTRACTORS' PROFIT The military contractors Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics posted higher third-quarter profit and raised their financial forecasts as a result of strong Pentagon spending. Boeing also reported higher profit over all, but its military unit, which makes up half of the company's sales, said profit fell as it took a one-time charge. Boeing also warned of relatively slow growth. [C6.]

HEADLINE: Tribune Profit Declines on Lower Newspaper Ad Revenue

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
The Tribune Company, the media conglomerate, said Wednesday that its third-quarter earnings dropped 7 percent as the housing slump and lower consumer spending worsened a continuing decline in newspaper advertising revenue. 
 Even that reduced profit and a 4 percent drop in revenue were better than analysts' expectations, however, and Tribune's stock rose.
 Despite skepticism on Wall Street, the company's chief executive, Dennis J. FitzSimons, said the transaction to take Tribune private remained on track to close in the fourth quarter.
 Nearly seven months after the real estate magnate Samuel Zell agreed to lead the $8.2 billion buyout, Tribune is still waiting for the Federal Communications Commission to waive rules banning same-market ownership of television stations and newspapers.
 Net income for the July-September quarter fell to $152.8 million, from $164.3 million a year earlier. Earnings per share nearly doubled, to $1.22 from 65 cents, because the number of shares outstanding fell by half.
 Earnings from businesses operated in both periods rose to 69 cents a share, from 65 cents a share last year. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 38 cents a share, or 12 cents better than the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.
 Revenue slipped to $1.28 billion, from $1.33 billion last year, but beat Wall Street's estimate of $1.25 billion. Advertising revenue fell 9 percent, to $674.5 million, from $741.2 million a year earlier.
 Tribune shares rose 63 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $28.18 on the New York Stock Exchange. That is well below the $34-a-share price agreed to by Mr. Zell on April 1, reflecting market doubts about whether the deal will go through.
 Tribune owns The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times, The Sun in Baltimore and eight other daily papers, as well as 23 television stations and the Chicago Cubs baseball team, which is to be sold as a condition of Mr. Zell's deal.

HEADLINE: Turkish Planes and Copters Attack Kurds Near Border

BYLINE: By SEBNEM ARSU and GRAHAM BOWLEY; Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Baghdad.. 
Sebnem Arsu reported from Istanbul, and Graham Bowley from New York.

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Turkish warplanes and helicopters on Wednesday attacked the broad mountain passes that Kurdish separatist rebels use to travel from hide-outs in northern Iraq into Turkey, the state-run Anatolian News Agency reported.
 The report did not disclose the number of aircraft involved or whether they had entered Iraqi airspace. Some unconfirmed news reports said they had flown into Iraqi territory. 
 The use of warplanes followed days of Turkish shelling in response to a raid by Kurdish militants into Turkey that killed 12 Turkish soldiers on Sunday. 
 In Baghdad, the American second in command, Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, said he could not confirm that any warplanes from Turkey, a NATO ally, had flown into Iraqi airspace, which is under United States control. 
 A Turkish government official briefed about the military's activities on Tuesday evening said Turkish soldiers might already have crossed the border -- a rocky, uninhabited area -- in brief pursuits of the Kurdish rebels, returning quickly.
 ''It is a harsh, rugged region away from residential areas, and in pursuit of the rebels, troops from time to time cross the border for few kilometers, and that's what was mentioned to us,'' the official said. 
 The Turks are threatening to send troops into Iraq after months of frustration over raids into Turkey by Kurdish rebels. Turkish authorities say the rebels have killed at least 42 people in Turkey in the past month. 
 The Anatolian report said planes from Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey, destroyed hide-outs belonging to the rebel group, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K.
 In the past few days, Turkish armored vehicles have taken positions along the border, and Turkish newspapers have reported military operations, with helicopters firing at targets near the border and troops shelling several villages in northern Iraq.
 Amid rising diplomatic tension, the United States and other countries have warned Turkey not to invade Iraq. The NATO secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, on Wednesday praised Turkey, NATO's only Muslim member, for its ''remarkable restraint.'' 
 Turkey's national security council, its highest security body, met for almost six hours to discuss the Iraq border situation. Both President Abdullah Gul and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended. A statement after the meeting called for the government to apply economic measures against ''the groups in Iraq that directly or indirectly provide support to the separatist terror organization.'' 
 The Sunday ambush, in which the rebels say they took eight soldiers hostage, provoked large street protests in Turkey and calls for the government to take action. Last week, Parliament authorized the government to send troops into Iraq if the Kurdish attacks continued. 
 The Anatolian agency said Turkish security forces had captured many P.K.K. hide-outs and destroyed livestock that they said belonged to the rebels. It did not say which side of the border this happened on; the P.K.K. has hide-outs on both sides.
 Turkey has expressed growing impatience with Iraq and the United States for failing to curb the Kurdish rebels, who operate unchecked in their autonomous region of northern Iraq and use it as a haven after ambushes in Turkey. 
 The State Department announced Wednesday that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will travel to Ankara next week to meet with Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Gul.
 The United States lists the P.K.K. as a terrorist organization, but American commanders in Baghdad have not wanted to use American military resources against the group in the difficult border terrain.
 This week the Turkish government gave Iraq a list of demands to thwart the rebels' activities, including the extradition of P.K.K. leaders. 
 An Iraqi delegation is to arrive in Ankara, the capital, on Thursday to present its ideas about how to solve the crisis. However, many Turkish lawmakers are skeptical of the Iraqi government's ability to tackle the rebels. They say that only American intervention can solve the problem. 
 ''People are at a point beyond waiting for the results of proposals, offers and promises as such,'' said a member of the governing AK party who refused to be identified. ''Here, we expect the U.S. to do something tangible like returning some leading members of the P.K.K., closing down their camps. Only the U.S. has the intelligence and the capacity to do that.''

HEADLINE: How the Applause Meter Rates Bush's Pressure on Cuba

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON; Marc Lacey contributed reporting from Mexico City.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
There's no science to gauge how President Bush's speech on Cuba will play around the world. However, if a large part of diplomacy is theater, audience reaction seems an appropriate first indicator.
 Seated behind Mr. Bush on Wednesday were the wives and daughters of Cuban dissidents being held in prison as traitors to their country. In front of him was an audience almost evenly divided between Latin American diplomats to his left and Cuban exiles to his right.
 ''These are just a few of the examples of the terror and trauma that is Cuba today,'' Mr. Bush said after introducing the women. ''The socialist paradise is a tropical gulag. The quest for justice that once inspired the Cuban people has now become a grab for power. And as with all totalitarian systems, Cuba's regime no doubt has other horrors still unknown to the rest of the world.'' 
 ''Once revealed,'' Mr. Bush added, ''they will shock the conscience of humanity.''
 The right side of the room leaped to ovation. The left side stayed in its seats, and the world was reminded that nearly five decades after the rise of a Communist government in Cuba, American policy toward the island continued to be driven by domestic interests.
 What was not on display was how those interests are changing.
 The Bush administration billed the speech as an international event and gave it all the right trappings in a room lighted by a constellation of chandeliers at the State Department. 
 In the days leading up to the speech, aides to Mr. Bush indicated that his remarks would outline the administration's view of the transition that began in Cuba more than a year ago, when Fidel Castro became ill and handed control of the government to his brother, Raul. 
 The aides said that President Bush did not expect the younger Mr. Castro to break with the practices of his brother, at least not while the elder Mr. Castro is still alive. However, upon the eventuality of Fidel Castro's death, they said, Cuba will face a choice of whether to stick with socialism.
 Mr. Bush demanded that the country try a new way, making a daring pitch to the Cuban military.
 ''When Cubans rise up to demand their liberty, you've got to make a choice,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Will you defend a disgraced and dying order by using force against your own people? Or will you embrace your people's desire for change?''
 He reiterated his staunch support for the economic embargo that has been the centerpiece of United States policy on Cuba for more than 40 years. He acknowledged that much of the rest of the world disapproves of it, but encouraged other governments to put aside their differences and work together with him to establish a multibillion-dollar fund to help rebuild Cuba's badly dilapidated infrastructure once a democratic transition is under way.
 ''We will know there is a new Cuba when opposition parties have the freedom to organize, assemble and speak with equal access to the airwaves,'' he said. ''We will know there is a new Cuba when a free and independent press has the power to operate without censors. We will know there is a new Cuba when the government removes its stranglehold on private economic activity. Above all, we will know there is a new Cuba when authorities go to the prisons, walk to the cells where people are being held for their beliefs and set them free.''
 It is still a little early to tell what the official responses of other governments will be. The Latin American diplomats in the room came from countries where the popularity of the United States has plummeted in recent years, and many of their leaders expressed little sympathy watching Mr. Bush try with mixed success to persuade people in the Middle East to elect the kinds of leaders the United States would like. 
 Reactions from Havana, relayed to Mexico City, suggest that Mr. Bush's efforts have no better chance at success in Cuba.
 Humberto Valdez, 39, who sells sandwiches on the seaside boulevard in Havana called the Malecon, said: ''The embargo has only proven damaging to the Cuban people. Because of it, we lack medicine, clothes, food. It is unfair.''
 Laudelina Rivas Corp, 74, said: ''War! War! War! That's about all Bush wants. War against Iraq, against Afghanistan and against the Cuban people.''
 Meanwhile, initial reactions from Florida -- home to the largest Cuban exile community in the United States and the source of crucial support for Republicans -- seemed swift and glowing. 
 ''President Bush's leadership on the issue of Cuba's freedom, especially at this time when the tyrant's death is approaching, is historic and decisive,'' said Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican who was seated in the front row. 
 Joe Garcia, executive vice president of NDN, a liberal nonprofit policy group formerly known as the New Democrat Network, said not to mistake those views as unanimous. He said that as the Cuban exile population has grown younger, its loyalties to the Republican Party have shifted, and a Cuba policy that has become increasingly isolated internationally has also become anachronistic at home. 
 ''Their whole policy has been about Castro, about squeezing and pressing,'' Mr. Garcia said. ''The problem is, that trick does not play anymore.''

HEADLINE: Reports Show Mixed Economic Picture Ahead of Fed Meeting

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
New data on the economy presented a mixed picture yesterday, providing little guidance for investors ahead of the Federal Reserve board's meeting next week to consider an interest rate cut. 
 Sales of new homes rose slightly in September but remained near the lowest level in a decade. Orders declined for durable goods -- major consumer products like appliances, airplanes and machinery -- but a crucial measure of business spending rose. 
 New-home sales reached an annual rate of 770,000 in September, an increase from the previous month only because the August figure had been revised downward to 735,000, the Commerce Department said. The September figure was down 23.3 percent from September 2006, when sales were at an annual rate of 1.004 million.
 Inventories continued to move higher last month, with home builders now saddled with 8.3 months' worth of unsold supply. Prices rose, however, with the median cost at $238,000, up from $232,100 in August.
 ''This was on the whole another quite weak report, particularly given the aggressive price-cutting that home builders have been implementing in order to try to reduce inventory,'' Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at MFR, said in a research report. 
 On the manufacturing side, orders for military and transportation goods fell in September, with military spending declining 38.7 percent. Shipments of motor vehicles, semiconductors and commercial aircraft all fell, though sales of those goods are considered relatively volatile. 
 Still, overall durable goods orders fell 1.7 percent in September, accelerating a 5.3 percent decline in August. Orders are down 8.4 percent in the last 12 months, the Commerce Department said.
 But one crucial indicator -- orders of nonmilitary capital goods that includes appliances and home computers, but excludes aircraft -- rose 0.4 percent, suggesting stronger spending by consumers. 
 ''It was basically a mixed bag,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn. ''Nothing in that report is enough to allay anyone's concerns about what happens in the fourth quarter and going forward.''
 The report indicates that American businesses have been buoyed by a weak dollar and strong foreign sales, analysts said, but domestic spending may be slowing. Overall orders, excluding military-related goods, rose 0.7 percent in September, though they have fallen 4.9 percent since this time last year. 
 The Fed will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected to consider an additional cut to its benchmark interest rate. Investors betting on the Fed's action appear certain that the governors will cut rates, but some analysts say underlying strength in the economy could dampen chances for a cut. The reports are the final flurry of economic data before the meeting. 
 On the job front, fewer workers filed for unemployment last week, with the Labor Department reporting 331,000 claims for first-time benefits, down 2.4 percent from the previous week. But continuing claims ticked up 0.3 percent for the week that ended Oct. 13, to a seasonally adjusted level of 2,530,000. 
 Analysts said the reports, which tend to jump around from week to week, indicate a job market that is softening, though they still predict an overall gain in jobs for September.

 Opera
 'AIDA' (Saturday and Tuesday) Micaela Carosi (Aida) and Olga Borodina (Amneris) are now the female leads in the Met's extravagant and durable production. The tenor Stephen O'Mara will play Radames, replacing Marco Berti, who has withdrawn from remaining performances because of illness. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out Saturday; $65 to $175 remaining for Tuesday. (Bernard Holland) 
 'CARMEN' (Friday and Sunday) Six feet tall and stunning, the mezzo Beth Clayton is a rare bird: a Carmen naturally able to project the character's tremendous power and sexiness, and incapable of the usual hip-swinging schtick. All she needs is a little more concentration on the purely musical side to help showcase her fine voice and turn her impressive Carmen into a great one. Scott Piper is alternately strong and wavering as Don Jose, and Carlos Archuleta sings for the first time with the company in the ungrateful role of Escamillo. (Was ever a hit tune so difficult to bring off well?). Friday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Anne Midgette)
 'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA' AND 'PAGLIACCI' (Saturday) The City Opera's current run of this beloved double bill comes to an end this weekend. The Stephen Lawless production updates a violent 19th-century rural love triangle to gritty postwar Italy. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Holland)
 'CENDRILLON' (Saturday and Thursday) City Opera has offered a number of versions of Cinderella, from Rossini's to Rodgers and Hammerstein's. This season, it's the turn of Massenet, whose pretty piece arrives here in a pretty production from Europe (by Renaud Doucet and Andre Barbe), with Cassandre Berthon making her company debut in the title role. Saturday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Midgette) 
 'MACBETH' (Friday and Wednesday) In his Met debut the English director Adrian Noble has created a stylistically eclectic, grimly effective and, at times, intriguingly playful new production of ''Macbeth,'' Verdi's breakthrough early masterpiece, last seen at the house in 1988. The modern-dress staging blends contemporary and melodramatic touches: The chorus of witches is portrayed as a coven of bag ladies in frumpy coats with bulging handbags. Though the baritone Zeljko Lucic is not the most menacing Macbeth, he sings with rich lyricism and burnished tone. The soprano Maria Guleghina has a hard edge to her sound these days. But she certainly has searing power as Lady Macbeth. James Levine's exciting and insightful conducting is the highlight of the production. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out on Friday; $80 to $175 for Wednesday. (Anthony Tommasini)
 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Saturday) This is the last performance of the current revival of last year's headliner from the director Anthony Minghella. Scheduled as the opera's love interests are Patricia Racette and Roberto Alagna. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Holland)
 'IL SANT'ALESSIO' (Monday and Tuesday) Stefano Landi's 1631 opera about the life of St. Alexis is said to be the first opera about a historical figure (as opposed to a Greek myth). William Christie, whose visits to New York with Les Arts Florissants are always season highlights for anyone interested in Baroque opera, restored this rarity to life in a 1996 Erato recording. He brings it to New York, semistaged by Benjamin Lazar, with a cast heavy in countertenors. (The original was sung by castratos.) At 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $40 to $70. (Allan Kozinn)
 'DIE ZAUBERFLOTE' (Monday and Thursday) The bears are the hit in Julie Taymor's bright pageant of a ''Zauberflote,'' in which swaying puppets and colorful alchemical symbols are woven into a production that can sometimes overshadow the singers. This revival tries to restore the balance by bringing in the vibrant soprano Diana Damrau to do her first Paminas. Eric Cutler should be a respectable Tamino, and Stephane Degout did such a fine job as Mercutio in ''Romeo et Juliette'' this season that there is extra interest in his Papageno. Kirill Petrenko conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Midgette)
 Classical Music
 OLE BOHN (Friday) Tributes to Edvard Grieg, who died 100 years ago, continue this season, notably at Scandinavia House in New York. The eminent Norwegian violinist Ole Bohn, who tours the world and has played major works written for him by Elliott Carter and other composers, will present a program of Grieg's three violin sonatas, with the pianist Geir Braaten. These rhapsodic and affecting works are not as well known as they deserve to be. At 8, Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 847-9740, scandinaviahouse.org; $15; $10 for members and students. (Tommasini)
 LE CONCERT DES NATIONS (Monday and Wednesday) One of the most justly anticipated highlights of New York's early-music season are visits by the eloquent viola da gamba maestro Jordi Savall and Le Concert des Nations, his period-instrument band. The concert on Monday in Zankel Hall features music by Lully, Saint-Colombe, Charpentier, Marais and Couperin. On Wednesday Mr. Savall will give a solo recital in Weill Recital Hall of works by English composers of the Renaissance period, including Tobias Hume and Simon Ives. At 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $56 to $62 on Monday; $42 on Wednesday. (Vivien Schweitzer)
 'ELGAR AND HIS WORLD' (Friday and Saturday) After two full weekends of concerts, lectures and panels this summer, the Bard Music Festival's thorough exploration of the music, life and times of Edward Elgar, the seminal British composer, continues this weekend. On Friday the American Symphony Orchestra (Leon Botstein conducting) performs Elgar's First Symphony and the Violin Concerto of his near-exact contemporary Charles Villiers Stanford; Saturday afternoon faculty and students from the Bard College Conservatory play chamber works by Elgar, John Ireland, Frank Bridge and Vaughan Williams. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 3 p.m., Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7900, bard.edu/bmf; $25 to $55. (Tommasini)
 ENSEMBLE ACJW (Tuesday) An awkward name for an excellent chamber music group. The initials stand for the Academy of Carnegie Hall, the Juilliard School and the Weill Music Center. The academy is a two-year fellowship program for top-notch postgraduate musicians who received extensive training; they also bring music to the public schools of New York. The academy players present concerts too, and this week's offers an enticing program with works by John Cage and Tan Dun, as well as Mozart's extraordinary ''Gran Partita'' Serenade for 13 Winds. At 7 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $15. (Tommasini)
 GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Saturday) In 1900, when the series that became the Peoples' Symphony Concerts got going, an individual ticket cost 10 cents. Amazingly, tickets for the 12 Saturday night concerts this season go for $9 each, which, adjusted for inflation over 107 years, is not that much of an increase. This essential series begins with the Guarneri in a program of quartets by Bartok, Haydn and Smetana. Washington Irving High School is a wonderfully homey and acoustically lively place to hear chamber music. At 8 p.m., Irving Place at 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org. (Tommasini)
 ANGELA HEWITT (Friday and Sunday) Playing both books of Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier'' in a weekend is a tall order, although in recent years several pianists have undertaken it, some even preferring to plow through the full contrapuntal monument in a single day. Ms. Hewitt, a Canadian whose Bach performances in recent years have been uncommonly elegant and full of character, sensibly puts a day between the books, playing the first Friday and the second on Sunday. Friday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $38 to $48. (Kozinn)
 ANDREW MANZE AND RICHARD EGARR (Thursday) The violinist Andrew Manze and the pianist Richard Egarr (also both prominent conductors) continue their successful partnership, in which they recently recorded Schubert sonatas. Mr. Egarr and Mr. Manze, who frequently record and perform on period instruments, will use modern instruments for this concert, which features Bach's Violin Sonata in C minor (BWV 1017); Hubert Parry's Violin Sonata in D; Mozart's Violin Sonata in F (K. 376); and Schubert's ''Duo'' Sonata in A. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $36 to $44. (Schweitzer)
 MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Sunday) Three eminent composers -- Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt and John Harbison -- take up the speaking roles in Stravinsky's ever wonderful ''Histoire du Soldat.'' James Levine and his Met players also perform music by the three. At 5 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $94. (Holland)
 MY LORD CHAMBERLAIN'S CONSORT (Saturday) This ensemble brings together experienced early-music players and singers -- among them Drew Minter, countertenor; Philip Anderson and Grant Herreid, tenors; Marcia Young, soprano; Rosamund Morley, viol player; and Andy Rutherford, lutenist -- for music of the Elizabethan lute-song composers, most notably John Dowland. The group will revisit some of its specialties in a 10th-anniversary program, as part of the New York Early Music Celebration. At 8 p.m., Church of St. Luke in the Fields, 487 Hudson Street, at Grove Street, West Village, (212) 749-2848, nyemc.com; $15 and $20. (Kozinn)
 NEWBERRY CONSORT (Sunday) Now in its 25th year, this ensemble, based at the Newberry Library in Chicago -- but drawing heavily on musicians from Boston's thriving early-music scene -- is offering a concert of Elizabethan music as part of the Music Before 1800 series. Included on the program ''Shakespeare's Songbook'' are works by Dowland, Bachelar, Cornish, Morley, Jones and Edwards, as well as variations on popular Elizabethan dance tunes by the group's violinist, David Douglass. At 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266, mb1800.org; $25 to $40; $20 to $35 for students and 62+. (Kozinn)
 NINE CIRCLES CHAMBER THEATER (Wednesday) Art of the Himalayas and music of the West may seem an odd juxtaposition, but the violinist Gil Morgenstern is seeking to build a bridge. On Wednesday he and his Nine Circles Chamber Theater begin Reflections, a new series of what they call ''interdisciplinary performing art'' at the Rubin Museum of Art. The first performance, ''Sacred Landscapes,'' features music in which composers confront the world around them, from Dvorak's ''American'' Quartet to David Wilde's ''Cellist of Sarajevo,'' with works by Bright Sheng and Osvaldo Golijov. At 7 p.m., 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org; $20. (Midgette) 
 ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S(Sunday) This exemplary ensemble, conducted by Roberto Abbado, performs works by American composers written during the last 70 years, including ''In Memory'' by Joan Tower, St. Luke's composer in residence. Also on the program is Barber's ever popular, lyrical Violin Concerto -- an ideal showcase for the glowing tone and technical gifts of Joshua Bell -- and the world premiere of the one-movement Violin Concerto by Jay Greenberg. Unsurprisingly, this 16-year-old composer has yet to develop an original voice, but he's certainly a precocious talent. The program concludes with Haydn's Symphony No. 93. At 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $24 to $79. (Schweitzer)
 ITZHAK PERLMAN (Saturday) Mr. Perlman begins a three-concert series featuring recent alumni of the Perlman Music Program, which tutors gifted young musicians. The concert on Saturday includes Mozart's Viola Quintet in G minor, Steve Reich's Triple Quartet (conducted by Patti Monson) and Tchaikovsky's ''Souvenir de Florence.'' Mr. Perlman will perform in the Mozart and Tchaikovsky alongside program participants. At 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $60. (Schweitzer)
 DAVID SANFORD (Friday) As a child of the 1960s, this composer draws on rock, jazz and rhythm and blues influences freely in his works for classical ensembles.

 ST. PETERSBURG PHILHARMONIC (Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Though underrated in this country, Yuri Temirkanov is one of the greatest living conductors. His home turf is Russia, both geographically and musically, so hearing him play with his own orchestra, which he took over in 1988, is a special pleasure. The programs this week focus on Prokofiev (''Alexander Nevsky'') and touch on Mussorgsky (''Songs and Dances of Death,'' with Larissa Diadkova), but also feature Beethoven's Violin Concerto (with Julia Fischer) and Schumann's Piano Concerto (with Nelson Freire). Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $21 to $79. Tuesday through Thursday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $37 to $126. (Midgette) 
 TOKYO STRING QUARTET (Saturday) This venerable group kicks off its fifth season as the 92nd Street Y's quartet in residence with Haydn's Quartet in B flat (Op. 50, No. 1) and Tchaikovsky's Quartet No. 3. The program also includes the New York premiere of ''Primera Luz'' by Lera Auerbach, a Russian-born and Juilliard-trained composer, pianist and poet. At 8 p.m., 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40. (Schweitzer)

 BODY:
SHIRLEY AT THE TROPICANA Meet Shirley Johnson. Or perhaps you already have. She is that executive secretary who is just a bit too intensely devoted to the man in charge. Nothing salacious is going on, but there is no doubt about it: Shirley is in love, and the only way she can show it is through slavish devotion, impeccably sharpened pencils and the perfect cup of coffee delivered to the boss each morning. 
 As written and performed by Amanda Ronconi, above, Shirley is also not very unlike Lucille Ball -- her boss is called Mr. Arnaz, in fact -- and at one office event the Champagne flows a tad too freely and leads to some especially Lucy-like zaniness. Ms. Ronconi plays all of the characters in this solo show, which, though not autobiographical, is inspired by her experiences during a decade as a temp, she said in a telephone interview. While working in offices just enough to support her acting without letting the administrative work consume her, Ms. Ronconi said, she met all kinds of office dreamers. 
 ''What I saw was unfulfilled romance,'' she said. ''Women who were so dedicated to this one man, and he wasn't even their husband or anything, that they would do anything for him.'' In the show Shirley has big dreams for her future with Mr. Arnaz. But when Marilyn, a sexy new temp, arrives, the obsessively ordered office falls apart, and Shirley's Champagne-fueled downfall soon follows. 
 Aided by several short films created by Jeff Wiens to complement the action and further the story, Ms. Ronconi's comical tale spans more than 20 years in Shirley's life in just 90 minutes. After losing her secretarial job and trying careers as both a flight attendant and a hand model, will Shirley find her bliss and walk off into the sunset with the man of her dreams? (Through Nov. 18, Access Theater, 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, 212-868-4444, smarttix.com; $25.) STEVEN McELROY

 Broadway
 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened on Broadway 32 june 1975 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 
 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'GREASE' A limp revival of a musical set in a high school that feels like a musical put on by a high school. Kathleen Marshall directs and choreographs a charisma-free ensemble, whose leads (Max Crumm and Laura Osnes) were cast via reality television (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)
 'MAURITIUS' Ersatz Mamet -- ''American Buffalo,'' to be exact. Theresa Rebeck's deftly formulaic drama about a power struggle over a rare stamp collection has the feeling of an expertly drawn blueprint on tracing paper. Doug Hughes directs a tasty cast that includes Alison Pill, Bobby Cannavale and F. Murray Abraham (2:00). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. 
 (Brantley) 
 'LES MISERABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'PYGMALION' David Grindley's misfired revival of Shaw's classic comedy pairs a de-sexed, infantile Henry Higgins (Jefferson Mays) with a hard-working but affectless Eliza Doolittle (Claire Danes). Chemistry? ''Not bloody likely,'' as Eliza would say. With excellent supporting performances from Boyd Gaines and Helen Carey (2:25). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)
 'THE RITZ' This oddly inert revival of Terrence McNally's risque 1975 farce set in a gay bathhouse demonstrates that yesterday's dirt is often today's dust. But it does feature a delicious turn by Rosie Perez as a talentless chanteuse and Kevin Chamberlin as the evening's much put-upon straight man. Joe Mantello directs (1:55). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'SPRING AWAKENING' (Tony Award, best musical 2007) Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 
 'XANADU' An improbably entertaining spoof of the majestically awful movie from 1980 about a Greek muse (Olivia Newton-John, roller-skating into oblivion) who inspires a young artist in Venice Beach, Calif., to chase his disco dream. Kerry Butler mimics Ms. Newton-John's Aussie accent and sports her signature skates-and-leg-warmers look, but also puts her own affectionate stamp on a seriously silly role. The impish playwright Douglas Carter Beane, who wrote the adaptation, also supplies great material for the domineering comic actresses Jackie Hoffman and Mary Testa. Blissfully idiotic, practically sublime (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 Off Broadway
 'BLACK WATCH' Gregory Burke's transfixing play from the National Theater of Scotland, inspired by interviews with soldiers who served in Iraq, is a glorious reminder of the transporting power of the theater. John Tiffany directs this seamless, haunting mix of drama, song and dance (1:50). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779. (Brantley) 
 'DIE MOMMIE DIE!' A happy play about haute homicide in Beverly Hills, written by Charles Busch, who also portrays the irresistibly evil has-been heroine. Mr. Busch manages to summon an entire host of over-the-hill screen sirens from the twilight of Hollywood's golden age (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'A FEMININE ENDING' Sarah Treem's play is about an oboe player and aspiring composer trying to choose between pursuing a career and marriage to a pop star. An outmoded concept treated with minimal truthful detail. With Marsha Mason and Richard Masur as kooky parents (1:30). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)
 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: RUDE AWAKENING' The 25th-anniversary version of Gerard Alessandrini's invaluable index to current American musicals has priceless moments (especially its parody of the hot-and-bothered antics of ''Spring Awakening''). But it's also a sobering reminder that even an inspired satirist can be defeated by emaciated targets (1:30). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'GONE MISSING' A delightful revival of the Civilians' revue of songs and monologues about lost shoes, cellphones, jewelry and maybe an illusion or two. The sharp young company brings energy and wit to both the collagelike text, composed of odd tales of dispossession, and Michael Friedman's eclectic cavalcade of pastiche songs. Brisk, funny and clever (1:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 'GREETINGS FROM YORKVILLE' No theme is hardier in musical theater than that of the ingenue trying to break into the big time: In this slender but sweet musical, basically a glorified cabaret evening, the set-up has a veritable reality-show spin, since it is the true story of the people who wrote and are performing it. Anya Turner and Robert Grusecki, a struggling team of songwriters, portray their efforts to get ahead in the songs they wrote along the way, some of which are very good, and which are well sung, particularly by Ms. Turner, who has a deep, warm voice with a hint of whiskey in its color. The question is whether the happy ending that this piece cries out for is actually being provided by its current incarnation (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Anne Midgette) 
 'THE H. G. WELLS SCIENCE FICTION FESTIVAL' This slick bit of radio theater will appeal mostly to science-fiction and horror buffs (1:15 each play). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)
 'JUMP' Video-game theater from Korea mixes martial arts and broad comedy with lowbrow results (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Zinoman)
 'MASKED' A powerful play about three Palestinian brothers torn by the dilemma of accommodation or resistance to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Written by an Israeli, the play is a thoughtful and sobering drama that avoids political statements or moral judgments (1:25). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Manhattan (212) 239-6200. (Wilborn Hampton) 
 'THE MISANTHROPE' The experimental Belgian-born director Ivo van Hove goes for the guts in this production, turning Moliere's courtly hypocrites into a wallowing, rutting, howling menagerie of beasts. Less a deconstruction than a detonation, but it does allow the excellent Bill Camp to find the tragic anguish in the title role (1:50). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'MY FIRST TIME' Ken Davenport's venture into Web-theater synergy mines a site called MyFirstTime.com to cull stories of inaugural encounters with sex. Four actors deliver the anecdotes in what amounts to little more than a crassly commercial effort to replicate the success of ''The Vagina Monologues'' (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante)
 'NONE OF THE ABOVE' An uneven revival of a slight comedy that wants to be taken seriously. There are some clever one-liners, but much of the humor is of the sitcom variety. A bigger problem in this staging is a lack of chemistry between the play's two characters. (1:45). Lion Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Hampton) 
 'THE OVERWHELMING' J. T. Rogers's smart and honorable drama about blundering Americans in Rwanda presents a sprawling panorama of perspectives on a nation in turmoil. Fluidly directed by Max Stafford-Clark, the production never quite evokes lives that are real instead of representative (2:20). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'THE RISE OF DOROTHY HALE' Myra Baistow has fashioned an intriguing but uneven look at the real-life case of Dorothy Hale, a minor actress with important friends (including Harry Hopkins, adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt), who fell to her death from the Hampshire House on Central Park South in 1938. The case has eerie parallels to the Marilyn Monroe story, but the starry cast, which includes Sarah Wynter and Sarita Choudhury, plays it all with a chilly detachment (1:45). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger) 
 'THE SENSUOUS WOMAN'Margaret Cho headlines an oddball burlesque review that mixes stand-up comedy (mostly gay) and stripping (a little of everything). Raunchy but only intermittently fun (1:30). Zipper Factory, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 
 'SIVE' The Irish Rep throws itself away on this clunky 1959 melodrama about a schoolgirl married off to a rich old man (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Caryn James) 
 'THREE MO' TENORS' Great opera it ain't, but there's kitschy fun and not too much that's cringe-inducing in this diverse musical vehicle for black tenors (2:00). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Claudia La Rocco) 
 'TINGS DEY HAPPEN' An engrossing one-man show about the Fulbright year its author and performer, Dan Hoyle, spent in Nigeria; in the spirit of theatrical journalism, it is at once a travelogue, a cultural survey and a good introductory course in oil politics. But it is the people the audience meets who raise the exercise above a guided tour (1:25). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Hampton) 
 'VENGEANCE' Ron Fitzgerald's ''Rats,'' featuring a terrific performance by Michael Mosley as an unemployed adman with an unexpected visitor, is the high point of this entertaining bill of five new short plays, presented by stageFarm. Gina Gionfriddo's ''Squalor'' takes a skewed look at the search for Internet pedophiles, and ''Specter,'' by Neena Beber, is a daffy take on a certain record producer named Phil. Five actors do it all, impressively (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 
 'A VIEW FROM 151ST STREET' Bob Glaudini's modest, appealing drama for the Labyrinth Theater Company explores the aftermath of a shooting in Harlem with a minimum of sensationalism. Rich in gritty, honest and funny performances (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) 
 'WALMARTOPIA' This time-traveling musical satire is an uneasy mix of an earnest, power-to-the-workers message and blunt satire, positing an Orwellian future ruled by Wal-Mart. The music is a pastiche of styles, ranging from a Peter Allen conga line to gospel, but Cheryl Freeman's energetic performance as a put-upon Wal-Mart employee rises above it all (2:00). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (James)
 Off Off Broadway
 'A GLANCE AT NEW YORK' Axis Company's daffy resurrection of this lowbrow stage work from 1848 seems, at 50 minutes, to go by in a heartbeat, and when it's over, you'll have no sense of what made the play so popular way back when. But you'll have been entertained by the company's assaultive delivery. The story involves a rube who comes to New York and is fleeced repeatedly, and a fireman named Mose who punches people (1:00). Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 
 'NIGHTMARE: GHOST STORIES' This annual Lower East Side haunted house has some decent frights, though you may leave wishing there had been more. An accompanying maze, new this year, is disappointing (1:00). Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 
 Long-Running Shows
 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

 'THE BEEBO BRINKER CHRONICLES' If you can still get a ticket, do so. This overheated, over-the-top saga, based on Ann Bannon's pre-Stonewall lesbian novels, is teeming with delights (1:30). Fourth Street Theater, 83 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (La Rocco)
 'DIVIDING THE ESTATE' In the midst of death we are inescapably in life, with all its attendant pettiness, in Horton Foote's deeply funny play about a quarrelsome, greedy Texas clan going downhill fast. Michael Wilson directs a fine cast that includes Elizabeth Ashley, Penny Fuller, Gerald McRaney and the incomparable Hallie Foote (2:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Saturday. (Brantley) 
 'THE GOLDMAN PROJECT' This tidy drama about the secret of a Holocaust survivor proves to be an unlikely light entertainment (2:00). June Havoc Theater at the Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)
 'HAMLET' The Pearl Theater Company's deliberately modest production, directed by Shepard Sobel, makes a virtue of simplicity and throws the role of Hamlet in high relief, as it should. Sean McNall, with his pleasant, open face, seems at first an odd, too light choice for Hamlet. But he uses his agreeable manner as a weapon that lends force to the character's quick turns to sarcasm and cruelty and anger. And, best of all, he makes us listen to Hamlet's rushing thoughts. This production may not be daring, or even particularly emotional, yet there's real value in a working company smartly engaged in Shakespeare (2:45). Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closes on Sunday. (Rachel Saltz) 
 'KOSHER HARRY' This absurdist comedy by Nick Grosso, in which four people in a diner toss around unflattering stereotypes about Jews, Pakistanis, Spaniards and others, isn't as daring as it thinks it is, at least for anyone who ever saw ''All in the Family.'' Nicu's Spoon, in collaboration with New York Deaf Theater, stages it with a speaking and a signing cast on the stage simultaneously, a treatment that's too busy for a play that relies on quick repartee and incongruity (2:00). Spoon Theater, 38 West 38th Street, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 
 'PHILOKTETES' John Jesurun's multimedia update of Sophocles' play is like an unintentional parody of avant-garde theater (1:05). Soho Rep, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (James) 
 'THE POWER OF DARKNESS'Leo Tolstoy's rarely produced morality play about greed and redemption is an intriguing curiosity, more interesting than good (3:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 
 'ROCK DOVES' Marie Jones, who wrote the popular two-hander ''Stones in His Pockets,'' considers the troubles that have followed the end of the Troubles in this Belfast-set comedy-drama. Four marginal characters share their sorrowful pasts when they take refuge together in an abandoned building. Fine acting transcends the writing's flaws (2:00). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 53rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 
 'WHEN THE MESSENGER IS HOT' Chick lit for the stage, basically, with three actresses dividing the role of an urban woman undergoing an emotional crisis. Mother is dying, and a good man is hard to find. Genial but pedestrian (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)

 Opera
 'AIDA' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Micaela Carosi (Aida) and Olga Borodina (Amneris) are now the female leads in the Met's extravagant and durable production. The tenor Stephen O'Mara will play Radames, replacing Marco Berti, who has withdrawn from remaining performances because of illness. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out tomorrow; $65 to $175 remaining for Tuesday. (Bernard Holland)
 'CARMEN' (Tonight and Sunday) Six feet tall and stunning, the mezzo Beth Clayton is a rare bird: a Carmen naturally able to project the character's tremendous power and sexiness, and incapable of the usual hip-swinging schtick. All she needs is a little more concentration on the purely musical side to help showcase her fine voice and turn her impressive Carmen into a great one. Scott Piper is alternately strong and wavering as Don Jose, and Carlos Archuleta sings for the first time with the company in the ungrateful role of Escamillo. (Was ever a hit tune so difficult to bring off well?). Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. 
 (Anne Midgette)
 'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA' AND 'PAGLIACCI' (Tomorrow) The City Opera's current run of this beloved double bill comes to an end this weekend. The Stephen Lawless production updates a violent 19th-century rural love triangle to gritty postwar Italy. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Holland)
 'CENDRILLON' (Tomorrow and Thursday) City Opera has offered a number of versions of Cinderella, from Rossini's to Rodgers and Hammerstein's. This season, it's the turn of Massenet, whose pretty piece arrives here in a pretty production from Europe (by Renaud Doucet and Andre Barbe), with Cassandre Berthon making her company debut in the title role. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Midgette) 
 'MACBETH' (Tonight and Wednesday) In his Met debut the English director Adrian Noble has created a stylistically eclectic, grimly effective and, at times, intriguingly playful new production of ''Macbeth,'' Verdi's breakthrough early masterpiece, last seen at the house in 1988. The modern-dress staging blends contemporary and melodramatic touches: The chorus of witches is portrayed as a coven of bag ladies in frumpy coats with bulging handbags. Though the baritone Zeljko Lucic is not the most menacing Macbeth, he sings with rich lyricism and burnished tone. The soprano Maria Guleghina has a hard edge to her sound these days. But she certainly has searing power as Lady Macbeth. James Levine's exciting and insightful conducting is the highlight of the production. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out tonight, $80 to $175 for Wednesday. (Anthony Tommasini)
 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) This is the last performance of the current revival of last year's headliner from the director Anthony Minghella. Scheduled as the opera's love interests are Patricia Racette and Roberto Alagna. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Holland)
 'IL SANT'ALESSIO' (Monday and Tuesday) Stefano Landi's 1631 opera about the life of St. Alexis is said to be the first opera about a historical figure (as opposed to a Greek myth). William Christie, whose visits to New York with Les Arts Florissants are always season highlights for anyone interested in Baroque opera, restored this rarity to life in a 1996 Erato recording. He brings it to New York, semistaged by Benjamin Lazar, with a cast heavy in countertenors. (The original was sung by castratos.) At 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $40 to $70. (Allan Kozinn)
 'DIE ZAUBERFLOTE' (Monday and Thursday) The bears are the hit in Julie Taymor's bright pageant of a ''Zauberflote,'' in which swaying puppets and colorful alchemical symbols are woven into a production that can sometimes overshadow the singers. This revival tries to restore the balance by bringing in the vibrant soprano Diana Damrau to do her first Paminas. Eric Cutler should be a respectable Tamino, and Stephane Degout did such a fine job as Mercutio in ''Romeo et Juliette'' this season that there is extra interest in his Papageno. Kirill Petrenko conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Midgette)
 Classical Music
 OLE BOHN (Tonight) Tributes to Edvard Grieg, who died 100 years ago, continue this season, notably at Scandinavia House in New York. The eminent Norwegian violinist Ole Bohn, who tours the world and has played major works written for him by Elliott Carter and other composers, will present a program of Grieg's three violin sonatas, with the pianist Geir Braaten. These rhapsodic and affecting works are not as well known as they deserve to be. At 8, Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 847-9740, scandinaviahouse.org; $15; $10 for members and students. (Tommasini)
 LE CONCERT DES NATIONS (Monday and Wednesday) One of the most justly anticipated highlights of New York's early-music season are visits by the eloquent viola da gamba maestro Jordi Savall and Le Concert des Nations, his period-instrument band. The concert on Monday in Zankel Hall features music by Lully, Saint-Colombe, Charpentier, Marais and Couperin. On Wednesday Mr. Savall will give a solo recital in Weill Recital Hall of works by English composers of the Renaissance period, including Tobias Hume and Simon Ives. At 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $56 to $62 on Monday; $42 on Wednesday. (Vivien Schweitzer)
 'ELGAR AND HIS WORLD' (Tonight and tomorrow) After two full weekends of concerts, lectures and panels this summer, the Bard Music Festival's thorough exploration of the music, life and times of Edward Elgar, the seminal British composer, continues this weekend. Tonight the American Symphony Orchestra (Leon Botstein conducting) performs Elgar's First Symphony and the Violin Concerto of his near-exact contemporary Charles Villiers Stanford; tomorrow afternoon faculty and students from the Bard College Conservatory play chamber works by Elgar, John Ireland, Frank Bridge and Vaughan Williams. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 p.m., Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7900, bard.edu/bmf; $25 to $55. (Tommasini)
 ENSEMBLE ACJW (Tuesday) An awkward name for an excellent chamber music group. The initials stand for the Academy of Carnegie Hall, the Juilliard School and the Weill Music Center. The academy is a two-year fellowship program for top-notch postgraduate musicians who received extensive training; they also bring music to the public schools of New York. The academy players present concerts too, and this week's offers an enticing program with works by John Cage and Tan Dun, as well as Mozart's extraordinary ''Gran Partita'' Serenade for 13 Winds. At 7 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $15. (Tommasini)
 GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) In 1900, when the series that became the Peoples' Symphony Concerts got going, an individual ticket cost 10 cents. Amazingly, tickets for the 12 Saturday night concerts this season go for $9 each, which, adjusted for inflation over 107 years, is not that much of an increase. This essential series begins with the Guarneri in a program of quartets by Bartok, Haydn and Smetana. Washington Irving High School is a wonderfully homey and acoustically lively place to hear chamber music. At 8 p.m., Irving Place at 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org. (Tommasini)
 ANGELA HEWITT (Tonight and Sunday) Playing both books of Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier'' in a weekend is a tall order, although in recent years several pianists have undertaken it, some even preferring to plow through the full contrapuntal monument in a single day. Ms. Hewitt, a Canadian whose Bach performances in recent years have been uncommonly elegant and full of character, sensibly puts a day between the books, playing the first tonight and the second on Sunday. Tonight at 7:30, Sunday at 2 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $38 to $48. (Kozinn)ANDREW MANZE AND RICHARD EGARR (Thursday) The violinist Andrew Manze and the pianist Richard Egarr (also both prominent conductors) continue their successful partnership, in which they recently recorded Schubert sonatas. Mr. Egarr and Mr. Manze, who frequently record and perform on period instruments, will use modern instruments for this concert, which features Bach's Violin Sonata in C minor (BWV 1017); Hubert Parry's Violin Sonata in D; Mozart's Violin Sonata in F (K. 376); and Schubert's ''Duo'' Sonata in A. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $36 to $44. (Schweitzer)
 MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Sunday) Three eminent composers -- Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt and John Harbison -- take up the speaking roles in Stravinsky's ever wonderful ''Histoire du Soldat.'' James Levine and his Met players also perform music by the three. At 5 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $94. (Holland)
 MY LORD CHAMBERLAIN'S CONSORT (Tomorrow) This ensemble brings together experienced early-music players and singers -- among them Drew Minter, countertenor; Philip Anderson and Grant Herreid, tenors; Marcia Young, soprano; Rosamund Morley, viol player; and Andy Rutherford, lutenist -- for music of the Elizabethan lute-song composers, most notably John Dowland. The group will revisit some of its specialties in a 10th-anniversary program, as part of the New York Early Music Celebration. At 8 p.m., Church of St. Luke in the Fields, 487 Hudson Street, at Grove Street, West Village, (212) 749-2848, nyemc.com; $15 and $20. (Kozinn)
 NEWBERRY CONSORT (Sunday) Now in its 25th year, this ensemble, based at the Newberry Library in Chicago -- but drawing heavily on musicians from Boston's thriving early-music scene -- is offering a concert of Elizabethan music as part of the Music Before 1800 series. Included on the program ''Shakespeare's Songbook'' are works by Dowland, Bachelar, Cornish, Morley, Jones and Edwards, as well as variations on popular Elizabethan dance tunes by the group's violinist, David Douglass. At 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266, mb1800.org; $25 to $40; $20 to $35 for students and 62+. (Kozinn)
 NINE CIRCLES CHAMBER THEATER (Wednesday) Art of the Himalayas and music of the West may seem an odd juxtaposition, but the violinist Gil Morgenstern is seeking to build a bridge. On Wednesday he and his Nine Circles Chamber Theater begin Reflections, a new series of what they call ''interdisciplinary performing art'' at the Rubin Museum of Art. The first performance, ''Sacred Landscapes,'' features music in which composers confront the world around them, from Dvorak's ''American'' Quartet to David Wilde's ''Cellist of Sarajevo,'' with works by Bright Sheng and Osvaldo Golijov. At 7 p.m., 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org; $20. (Midgette) 
 ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S(Sunday) This exemplary ensemble, conducted by Roberto Abbado, performs works by American composers written during the last 70 years, including ''In Memory'' by Joan Tower, St. Luke's composer in residence. Also on the program is Barber's ever popular, lyrical Violin Concerto -- an ideal showcase for the glowing tone and technical gifts of Joshua Bell -- and the world premiere of the one-movement Violin Concerto by Jay Greenberg. Unsurprisingly, this 16-year-old composer has yet to develop an original voice, but he's certainly a precocious talent. The program concludes with Haydn's Symphony No. 93. At 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $24 to $79. (Schweitzer)
 ITZHAK PERLMAN (Tomorrow) Mr. Perlman begins a three-concert series featuring recent alumni of the Perlman Music Program, which tutors gifted young musicians. The concert tomorrow includes Mozart's Viola Quintet in G minor, Steve Reich's Triple Quartet (conducted by Patti Monson) and Tchaikovsky's ''Souvenir de Florence.'' Mr. Perlman will perform in the Mozart and Tchaikovsky alongside program participants. At 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $60. (Schweitzer)
 DAVID SANFORD (Tonight) As a child of the 1960s, this composer draws on rock, jazz and rhythm and blues influences freely in his works for classical ensembles. This installment of the Miller Theater's Composer Portraits series includes his ''22 Part I'' (1995), ''Seventh Avenue Kaddish'' (2002), ''Alchemy,'' ''Link Chapel'' and ''V-Reel'' (all 2003), and Scherzo Grosso (2005). Matt Haimovitz, a cellist whose tastes are as eclectic as Mr. Sanford's, performs with the Pittsburgh Ensemble. At 8, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $25; $15 for students. (Kozinn)
 ST. PETERSBURG PHILHARMONIC (Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Though underrated in this country, Yuri Temirkanov is one of the greatest living conductors. His home turf is Russia, both geographically and musically, so hearing him play with his own orchestra, which he took over in 1988, is a special pleasure. The programs this week focus on Prokofiev (''Alexander Nevsky'') and touch on Mussorgsky (''Songs and Dances of Death,'' with Larissa Diadkova), but also feature Beethoven's Violin Concerto (with Julia Fischer) and Schumann's Piano Concerto (with Nelson Freire). Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $21 to $79. Tuesday through Thursday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $37 to $126. (Midgette) 
 TOKYO STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) This venerable group kicks off its fifth season as the 92nd Street Y's quartet in residence with Haydn's Quartet in B flat (Op. 50, No. 1) and Tchaikovsky's Quartet No. 3. The program also includes the New York premiere of ''Primera Luz'' by Lera Auerbach, a Russian-born and Juilliard-trained composer, pianist and poet. At 8 p.m., 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40. (Schweitzer)

HEADLINE: Manhattan: Flight Limits Opposed

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and a coalition of groups representing airlines, passengers and businesses will hold a news conference today to express their opposition to the Federal Aviation Administration's proposal to reinstate limits on the number of flights at Kennedy International Airport. The groups fear that limiting flights at Kennedy to 80 an hour would slow economic growth in the region and would not ease the congestion and delays that have hurt the airport since flight limits were lifted at the beginning of this year. Representatives from the Air Transport Association, the Air Travelers Association and the Partnership for New York City will be among those speaking.

HEADLINE: Slowing Marginally, China's Economy Sets 11.5% Growth Pace

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
China said Thursday that its economy expanded at a powerful 11.5 percent annual pace in the third quarter, a slight slowing from the second quarter that might help Beijing officials control inflation.
 But the overall pace of China's economic development is still strong enough to keep pushing up prices around the world for a wide range of things like oil, iron ore and freight shipping.
 Chinese officials welcomed Thursday's growth figure. ''The macroeconomic controls this time around have not only effectively prevented the economy from transitioning from speedy growth to overheating -- by curbing too-rapid growth -- but at the same time have not resulted in a sharp downturn, thereby preventing severe fluctuations in economic growth,'' said Li Xiaochao, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics. 
 Chinese investors were more skeptical. They responded to the latest growth figures by sending the Shanghai stock market down 4.8 percent on Thursday, on fears that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates to limit inflation.
 China's annual growth rate in the third quarter, while a little less rapid than the 11.9 percent of the second quarter, keeps the country well ahead of its two leading rivals among high-growth Asian nations, India and Vietnam.
 India has had more success than China this year in taming inflation, but at the price of a steep rise in the rupee, which has undermined the competitiveness of Indian exports and begun to hurt economic growth.
 Vietnam estimated Thursday that higher food, transport and housing costs had raised inflation this month to 9.3 percent from 8.8 percent last month.
 By contrast, inflation in China slowed slightly in September, to 6.2 percent, compared with a year earlier, from 6.5 percent in August. Government officials and some Western economists predict that it will continue to slow gradually the rest of this year.
 But some economists worry that inflation may prove a persistent problem in China. The annual growth rate of industrial production accelerated in September to 18.9 percent. And the money supply keeps increasing faster than government targets. 
 Jing Ulrich, the chairman of China equities at JPMorgan Chase, pointed out that the government had raised bank lending rates much faster than bank deposit rates.
 The temptation to buy stocks or property or spend on consumer goods -- retail sales were up 17 percent in September from a year earlier -- has increased as bank deposits earn regulated interest rates as low as half the inflation rate.
 ''No wonder people are fed up putting money in banks,'' Ms. Ulrich said.
 Inflation in Asia is creating a quandary for the Federal Reserve. It faces pressure to cut interest rates to help the ailing real estate and financial sectors in the United States. But it also needs to prevent inflation from creeping into the American economy from abroad.
 Businesses continue to flood China with investment, as a combination of foreign investment and trade surpluses has China adding to its foreign currency reserves at a pace of $1 billion a day.
 Through huge purchases of dollars and other currencies, as well as by easing restrictions on overseas investments by Chinese citizens, China has greatly slowed the appreciation of its currency and maintained a competitive advantage over other Asian nations.
 Mark Thirman, the chief executive of AirPrint Networks, a company in Framingham, Mass., that is developing the technology for printing plane tickets and other documents from a cellphone, said he chose to have the software engineering for his company done in Suzhou, China, after finding that outsourcing companies in India charged far more.
 ''Some of the firms we've looked at in India are at least a third to 50 percent higher in price,'' Mr. Thirman said. ''It's a combination of the currency appreciation, the wages, and I think they oversold their capacity.''
 To help control the rise in consumer prices, China froze all government-set prices on Sept. 19, notably those of gasoline, water, electricity and natural gas, until at least the end of this year. At the same time, the government's National Development and Reform Commission banned any increases in the maximum permitted prices for medicines, air and rail trips and certain agricultural commodities like wheat, rice and cotton.
 These measures are aimed at preventing high food prices from spilling over into increased prices and higher wage demands across the entire economy. 
 Price controls, a tactic tried and discarded in the United States in the 1970s, run the risk of temporarily tamping down inflationary pressures that later burst out with even greater force. China hopes deflationary pressures, like the country's heavy investments in an abundance of projects, including highways and new factories, will soon offset higher food prices.
 Wages in China are already rising briskly, although there are no reliable statistics on the precise rate. But Yi Gang, an assistant governor at the People's Bank of China, said here on Wednesday that workers were producing more.
 That means workers can be paid more without requiring inflationary increases in the cost of each unit of goods sold.
 ''I believe enhancements to labor productivity are the main reasons for the rise in wages -- the rise in food prices is more a secondary reason,'' Mr. Yi said. ''Whether the rise in wages will continue will depend in large part on the sustainability of further improvements in labor productivity.''
 While some sectors of the Chinese economy show rising prices or wages, like the pay of workers skilled in the installation or maintenance of factory equipment, the steepest price increases are found in commodities, especially food. 
 Raising interest rates to curb growth and inflation is a sensitive domestic political issue in China, India and Vietnam, because all have many poor people who have yet to share in any of these countries' recent growth.
 ''When you have a country like India where you have a huge number of people unemployed, it's hard to say you're overheating,'' Rakesh Mohan, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said here this month.

 Broadway
 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened on Broadway 32 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 
 'GREASE' A limp revival of a musical set in a high school that feels like a musical put on by a high school. Kathleen Marshall directs and choreographs a charisma-free ensemble, whose leads (Max Crumm and Laura Osnes) were cast via reality television (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)
 'MAURITIUS' Ersatz Mamet -- ''American Buffalo,'' to be exact. Theresa Rebeck's deftly formulaic drama about a power struggle over a rare stamp collection has the feeling of an expertly drawn blueprint on tracing paper. Doug Hughes directs a tasty cast that includes Bobby Cannavale and F. Murray Abraham (2:00). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'PYGMALION' David Grindley's misfired revival of Shaw's classic comedy pairs a de-sexed, infantile Henry Higgins (Jefferson Mays) with a hard-working but affectless Eliza Doolittle (Claire Danes). Chemistry? ''Not bloody likely,'' as Eliza would say. With excellent supporting performances from Boyd Gaines and Helen Carey (2:25). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)
 'THE RITZ' This oddly inert revival of Terrence McNally's risque 1975 farce set in a gay bathhouse demonstrates that yesterday's dirt is often today's dust. But it does feature a delicious turn by Rosie Perez as a talentless chanteuse and Kevin Chamberlin as the evening's much put-upon straight man. Joe Mantello directs (1:55). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'SPRING AWAKENING' (Tony Award, best musical 2007) Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 
 'XANADU' An improbably entertaining spoof of the majestically awful movie from 1980 about a Greek muse (Olivia Newton-John, roller-skating into oblivion) who inspires a young artist in Venice Beach, Calif., to chase his disco dream. Kerry Butler mimics Ms. Newton-John's Aussie accent and sports her signature skates-and-leg-warmers look, but also puts her own affectionate stamp on a seriously silly role. The impish playwright Douglas Carter Beane, who wrote the adaptation, also supplies great material for the domineering comic actresses Jackie Hoffman and Mary Testa. Blissfully idiotic, practically sublime (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 Off Broadway
 'BLACK WATCH' Gregory Burke's transfixing play from the National Theater of Scotland, inspired by interviews with soldiers who served in Iraq, is a glorious reminder of the transporting power of the theater. John Tiffany directs this seamless, haunting mix of drama, song and dance (1:50). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779. (Brantley) 
 'DIE MOMMIE DIE!' A happy play about haute homicide in Beverly Hills, written by Charles Busch, who also portrays the irresistibly evil has-been heroine. Mr. Busch manages to summon an entire host of over-the-hill screen sirens from the twilight of Hollywood's golden age (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'A FEMININE ENDING' Sarah Treem's play is about an oboe player and aspiring composer trying to choose between pursuing a career and marriage to a pop star. An outmoded concept treated with minimal truthful detail. With Marsha Mason and Richard Masur as kooky parents (1:30). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)
 'JUMP' Video-game theater from Korea mixes martial arts and broad comedy with lowbrow results (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. 
 (Jason Zinoman)
 'THE OVERWHELMING' J. T. Rogers's smart and honorable drama about blundering Americans in Rwanda presents a sprawling panorama of perspectives on a nation in turmoil. Fluidly directed by Max Stafford-Clark, the production never quite evokes lives that are real instead of representative (2:20). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'THE SENSUOUS WOMAN'Margaret Cho headlines an oddball burlesque review that mixes stand-up comedy (mostly gay) and stripping (a little of everything). Raunchy but only intermittently fun (1:30). Zipper Factory, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 
 'THREE MO' TENORS' Great opera it ain't, but there's kitschy fun and not too much that's cringe-inducing in this diverse musical vehicle for black tenors (2:00). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Claudia La Rocco) 
 'VENGEANCE' Ron Fitzgerald's ''Rats,'' featuring a terrific performance by Michael Mosley as an unemployed adman with an unexpected visitor, is the high point of this entertaining bill of five new short plays, presented by stageFarm. Gina Gionfriddo's ''Squalor'' takes a skewed look at the search for Internet pedophiles, and ''Specter,'' by Neena Beber, is a daffy take on a certain record producer named Phil. Five actors do it all, impressively (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444.
 (Neil Genzlinger) 
 'A VIEW FROM 151ST STREET' Bob Glaudini's modest, appealing drama for the Labyrinth Theater Company explores the aftermath of a shooting in Harlem with a minimum of sensationalism. Rich in gritty, honest and funny performances (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) 
 Off Off Broadway
 'A GLANCE AT NEW YORK' Axis Company's daffy resurrection of this lowbrow stage work from 1848 seems, at 50 minutes, to go by in a heartbeat, and when it's over, you'll have no sense of what made the play so popular way back when. But you'll have been entertained by the company's assaultive delivery. The story involves a rube who comes to New York and is fleeced repeatedly, and a fireman named Mose who punches people (1:00). Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 
 Last Chance
 'THE BEEBO BRINKER CHRONICLES' If you can still get a ticket, do so. This overheated, over-the-top saga, based on Ann Bannon's pre-Stonewall lesbian novels, is teeming with delights (1:30). Fourth Street Theater, 83 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (La Rocco)
 'DIVIDING THE ESTATE' In the midst of death we are inescapably in life, with all its attendant pettiness, in Horton Foote's deeply funny play about a quarrelsome, greedy Texas clan going downhill fast. Michael Wilson directs a fine cast that includes Elizabeth Ashley, Penny Fuller, Gerald McRaney and the incomparable Hallie Foote (2:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Brantley) 
 'THE GOLDMAN PROJECT' This tidy drama about the secret of a Holocaust survivor proves to be an unlikely light entertainment (2:00). June Havoc Theater at the Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)
 'KOSHER HARRY' This absurdist comedy by Nick Grosso, in which four people in a diner toss around unflattering stereotypes about Jews, Pakistanis, Spaniards and others, isn't as daring as it thinks it is, at least for anyone who ever saw ''All in the Family.'' Nicu's Spoon, in collaboration with New York Deaf Theater, stages it with a speaking and a signing cast on the stage simultaneously, a treatment that's too busy for a play that relies on quick repartee and incongruity (2:00). Spoon Theater, 38 West 38th Street, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 
 'PHILOKTETES' John Jesurun's multimedia update of Sophocles' play is like an unintentional parody of avant-garde theater (1:05). Soho Rep, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. 
 (Caryn James) 
 'THE POWER OF DARKNESS'Leo Tolstoy's rarely produced morality play about greed and redemption is an intriguing curiosity, more interesting than good (3:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 
 'ROCK DOVES' Marie Jones, who wrote the popular two-hander ''Stones in His Pockets,'' considers the troubles that have followed the end of the Troubles in this Belfast-set comedy-drama. Four characters share their pasts when they take refuge in an abandoned building. Fine acting transcends the writing's flaws (2:00). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 53rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)

HEADLINE: An Innocent Mentored By the Mob

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
Do you still hunger, night after night, for pasta with red sauce?
 Do you find yourself hankering for a turnpike tour of the construction sites, strip bars and McMansions of northern New Jersey?
 Do you continue to bore friends with musings on the meaning of that pointedly ambiguous visit to the diner? 
 Should you answer any of those questions in the affirmative, you are clearly still suffering from ''Sopranos'' withdrawal. If constant reimmersion in the DVDs has not cured you, a visit to the Walter Kerr Theater may temporarily salve those cravings for underworld intrigue, Old World sentiment and scary men with silly nicknames. A revival of ''A Bronx Tale,'' a solo show written by and starring Chazz Palminteri, opened there last night, bringing to Broadway a saga that could be said to have prefigured, in its small way, the Mafia mania reignited by the recently deceased ''Sopranos.''
 Mr. Palminteri's stage memoir, a semi-autobiographical account of growing up under the loving protection of an Italian-American crime kingpin, had its debut in Los Angeles in 1989 and was later produced Off Broadway. In 1993 it became a movie directed by Robert De Niro, with a full cast including Mr. De Niro and Joe Pesci. Mr. Palminteri took the role of the big boss, Sonny. 
 He has subsequently appeared in dozens of Hollywood films, perhaps most memorably in Woody Allen's ''Bullets Over Broadway,'' for which he received an Oscar nomination. But Mr. Palminteri left a sliver of his heart back in the Bronx, specifically on the corner of Belmont Avenue and 187th Street, the intersection where it all began. That's where we find him as the lights rise again on ''A Bronx Tale,'' which retains sufficient heart, spice and humor nearly 20 years after its debut.
 Mr. Palminteri is now 55, an age at which you might think it would be hard to muster the energy to play more than a dozen characters in the course of 90 minutes, not to mention the innocence to play a 9-year-old boy caught between the rigid moral vision of an upright, bus-driving father and the canny wisdom of a powerful capo. 
 But while Mr. Palminteri's expressive, fleshy face bears more than a few traces of the passing years, he is in trim, energetic shape. As he strides across the stage with a lively gait, nimbly sliding from one role to another, he exudes a moment-to-moment engagement that suggests that this revival is not a lazy ego trip but a rejuvenating act of faith in the complementary powers of acting and storytelling.
 The bustle of neighborhood intimacy, and maybe the pinky finger of fate, brings young Cologio Palminteri into the orbit of Sonny, the crime boss who rules over this patch of the Bronx from under a corner lamppost. (The skeletal but effective set is by James Noone.) An altercation over a parking spot ends when Sonny trumps a baseball bat with a volley of gunfire in defense of a friend. From his apartment's stoop little Cologio witnesses it all. When he is questioned by the police, he chooses to forget who pulled the trigger, earning Sonny's undying affection and respect.
 Sonny is surrounded by a rogue's gallery of colorful associates, whom Mr. Palminteri clearly delights in describing, and portraying, in all their quirky splendor. Rudy Ice, who owns the bar where Sonny conducts most of his business, fancies himself the Tom Jones of the Bronx. He sets all his small talk to melody. Eddie Mush ''was such a loser that he would go to the racetrack, and the teller would give him his tickets already ripped up.'' Frankie Coffee Cake earned that sobriquet from a case of bad acne. Jojo the Whale's nickname probably doesn't need explaining. 
 The allure of this lively bunch and their rough-and-tumble world casts a strong spell over Cologio, who is given a more economical handle, C, by his mentor. But when Cologio's father, Lorenzo, discovers a $1,200 stash in his son's bedroom, he decides to take a stand against Sonny's corrupting influence. Defending his surrogate father, Cologio compares the friendly esteem in which Lorenzo is held by his bus patrons to the fawning worship Sonny receives from the whole neighborhood. 
 ''They love you, and they love him,'' Cologio insists. ''It's the same thing.''
 ''It's not the same,'' his father gravely replies. ''People don't love him. They fear him.'' 
 Fortunately for us, Sonny's glamour proves impervious to Lorenzo's disapproval. Cologio continues to spend afternoons surreptitiously watching craps in the bar, absorbing the raucous antics of this minor mob.
 Still, ''A Bronx Tale'' loses some of its narrative momentum after a confrontation between Sonny and Lorenzo. The second half of the show, in which our hero discovers the charms of the female sex, and the limits of his father's uprightness, is more scattered and less compelling, although Mr. Palminteri and his director, the veteran Jerry Zaks, never allow the energy level to flag for long.
 The cozy word ''tale'' could hardly be applied to even a small segment of ''The Sopranos,'' David Chase's epic television serial about the strange fusion of bourgeois domesticity, operatic feeling and gruesome violence that constitutes mob life today. (Or constitutes Mr. Chase's persuasive vision of it, anyway.) But that term is exactly right for Mr. Palminteri's warmhearted memoir, which is infused with tasty doses of broad comedy. (Mr. Palminteri's timing and inflections are classic Catskills.)
 ''A Bronx Tale'' may not possess the emotional breadth or sophistication of ''The Sopranos.'' But, appealingly, it lacks that show's brutality too. I was always a bit revolted by the clinical realism of the bloodletting in ''The Sopranos,'' which made me feel soiled for taking a sympathetic interest in the personal foibles of the men perpetrating it. Mr. Palminteri may present his childhood hero through the worshipful eyes of youth, but even the nicest mobsters can benefit from a little fairy-tale airbrushing here and there.

HEADLINE: Oil Surges $3.36, Closing Above $90

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Oil prices closed above the symbolic level of $90 a barrel yesterday, pushed up by a host of concerns, from tensions in the Middle East to worries about supply.
 Crude oil futures jumped $3.36, to close at $90.46 a barrel, exceeding the highs reached last week, though still shy of the inflation-adjusted record price of $101.70 set in April 1980. 
 Concern over supplies helped drive the price increase after the Energy Department reported two days ago that crude oil stockpiles fell last week. Additionally, traders reacted to reports yesterday that oil shipments from the Middle East were expected to grow more slowly than expected. 
 Hostilities between Turkey and Iraqi Kurds contributed to the sudden spike, along with a decision by the United States to impose new sanctions against Iran. Prices were also pushed up by expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut its benchmark interest rate next week, which could strengthen American economic growth and therefore contribute to rising oil demand, analysts said.
 ''It's almost like a perfect storm,'' said Fadel Gheit, managing director of oil and gas research at OppenheimerFunds.
 Oil closed at its lowest point this year on Jan. 18, at $50.48 a barrel. Since then, it has risen 79 percent. Some analysts have projected in recent days that oil will soon top $100 a barrel on the basis of supply and demand. Others say only a political crisis, like a new war in the Middle East, could drive the price that high.
 Mr. Gheit, for one, questioned whether the run-up was sustainable.
 ''I know that we are closer to an end here because this is like the fireworks,'' Mr. Gheit said, noting that oil jumped nearly 4 percent in a single day yesterday. ''When you see the bigger noise and the biggest glare, then you better hit the exits because it's going to be over soon.''
 Larry Goldstein, a director at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, said the tensions in Turkey and Iran were a big factor in yesterday's jump. Unlike some analysts, he dismissed the recent reports of reduced inventories.
 ''It's a noisy statistic that can really be reversed by next week's data, where imports could easily go back to over 10 million barrels of crude oil a day,'' Mr. Goldstein said.
 High oil prices contributed to an erratic day on Wall Street, where stock markets were down most of the day but recovered late. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished down 0.1 percent, or 1.48 points, at 1,514.40. The Dow Jones industrials dropped more than 100 points by 2 p.m., but climbed back to a virtually flat close at 13,671.92, a 3.33-point decline. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.9 percent, or 23.90 points, to close at 2,750.86.
 Investors remained skittish yesterday about fallout from the credit crisis. Stocks fell after an analyst report speculated that the American International Group, the insurance giant, would be forced to write down the value of some assets linked to subprime mortgages. The company would not comment to Bloomberg News.
 Economic data that came out yesterday on sales of new homes and of manufactured goods were consistent with the view of many analysts that the economy is gradually slowing. 
 Traders and investors are hoping for another cut in interest rates when the Federal Reserve meets next week, and a recent run of weak economic statistics has persuaded some of them that a cut is likely.
 ''The positive spin on weak economic data is, 'Well, the Fed will cut more, and that will bail the market out,''' said Russ Koesterich, senior portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investors. ''That kind of 'glass is half full' attitude has kept the market from moving lower over the last couple of sessions.''

HEADLINE: For Former Newark Mayor, Arena's Opening Is Tough to Savor

BYLINE: By RICHARD G. JONES

DATELINE: NEWARK, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
It was nearly high noon on Thursday when Sharpe James strolled down the streets he had governed for two decades as mayor, wearing a dark suit and alligator shoes, smiling that familiar gap-toothed smile, and proving once again that he wears an indictment well.
 But for all the bluster that he has shown since his departure from office in July 2006 and his federal indictment on corruption charges three months ago, Mr. James seemed to move delicately through what was a bittersweet day for him at the opening of the Prudential Center arena. 
 Mr. James served as mayor from 1985 to 2006, a stretch marked by lean economic times for this long-suffering city. It was a period during which Mr. James was Newark's loudest cheerleader.
 For years, he said that a linchpin for economic development here would be the construction of a professional sports arena. It was a wildly unpopular idea among most state officials, particularly after the New Jersey Nets decided to take their basketball team to Brooklyn, leaving the Devils hockey team as the only professional sports organization that would use the facility. 
 Many said the arena, which cost about $375 million to build, was too expensive; others questioned why a sport whose players and fans are overwhelmingly white would come to a city that is predominantly black and Hispanic. Still others insisted that Newark had too much crime for spectators to venture into for evening sporting events.
 Still, Mr. James championed the project and pushed it along with an audacious bit of fiscal sleight-of-hand in 2004, when he said that the city would help pay for the arena with $210 million it had earned from leasing the land for Newark Liberty International Airport to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
 Yet on a chilly, rainy morning, when Mr. James's quest ended at the ribbon-cutting for the Prudential Center, he seemed hardly able to enjoy it.
 Instead of sitting on the dais with Gov. Jon S. Corzine and Mayor Cory A. Booker, Mr. James, 71, sat with about 60 dignitaries in the rotunda where the ribbon-cutting took place.
 Throughout the ceremony, he heard speaker after speaker refer to the ''renaissance'' and ''rebirth'' of Newark, words he had repeatedly used in recent years to extol the virtues of building the 17,000-seat arena.
 Jeff Vanderbeek, the chairman of Devils Arena Entertainment, was the first person connected with the project to speak. Mr. Vanderbeek, the arena's main developer, said that Mr. Booker, Mr. James's successor, was ''the reason this city will prosper.'' 
 Mr. James shifted in his seat and gazed at the ceiling.
 Mr. Corzine, who had clashed with Mr. James on a range of issues, also did not acknowledge the former mayor in his remarks.
 Mr. James sat with his arms folded, his head lowered.
 It was not until Mr. Booker spoke, about a half-hour into the program, that the former mayor was mentioned. Mr. Booker, who all through his campaign had spurned the notion that a city awash in red ink should finance a costly arena, complimented his predecessor for having the swagger and tenacity of a ''South Side bulldog'' in seeing the project through.
 With that, Mr. James rose to uneven applause and tipped his Devils cap toward Mr. Booker. 
 The chill was not unexpected. Before the ceremony began, Mr. James said he had accepted the invitation knowing that he would not participate. ''I understand the circumstances involved,'' he said.
 And he still managed to maintain his trademark sense of humor. Asked if he would attend any hockey games at the arena, Mr. James replied: ''I'm a season ticket holder. I'm applying for a job to be the backup goalie.''
 As the former mayor left the ceremony, Cassandra Dock, a Newark resident who was walking by, burst into applause. 
 ''Go, Sharpe,'' she said. ''This is your building.''

HEADLINE: Mexicans Miss Money From Workers Up North

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: EL RODEO, Mexico 

 BODY:
For years, millions of Mexican migrants working in the United States have sent money back home to villages like this one, money that allows families to pay medical bills and school fees, build houses and buy clothes or, if they save enough, maybe start a tiny business.
 But after years of strong increases, the amount of migrant money flowing to Mexico has stagnated. From 2000 to 2006, remittances grew to nearly $24 billion a year from $6.6 billion, rising more than 20 percent some years. In 2007, the increase so far has been less than 2 percent. 
 Migrants and migration experts say a flagging American economy and an enforcement campaign against illegal workers in the United States have persuaded some migrants not to try to cross the border illegally to look for work. Others have decided to return to Mexico. And many of those who are staying in the United States are sending less money home. 
 In the rest of the world, remittances are rising, up as much as 10 percent a year, according to Donald F. Terry of the Inter-American Development Bank. Last year, migrant workers worldwide sent more than $300 billion to developing countries -- almost twice the amount of foreign direct investment. 
 But in Mexico, families are feeling squeezed. 
 Estrella Rivera, a slight 27-year-old in this stone-paved village in Guanajuato state in central Mexico, was hoping to use the money her husband, Alonso, sent back from working illegally in Texas to build a small clothing shop at the edge of her garden.
 But a month ago, Mr. Rivera returned home. His hours at a Dallas window-screen factory were cut and rumors spread that he would inevitably have to produce a valid Social Security number. Now, he works odd jobs or tends cornfields. Mrs. Rivera's shop is indefinitely delayed, a pile of bricks stacked on the grass.
 Like Mr. Rivera, some of the men who went to work in the United States illegally have returned discouraged. And less work means less money to send home -- particularly from the southern United States and other areas where Mexican migrants are a more recent presence. 
 ''One out of three people in these new states who was sending a year ago is not sending it home today,'' Mr. Terry of the Inter-American Development Bank said. ''There are some 500,000 families who aren't receiving this year.''
 Until last year, the American housing trades absorbed hundreds of thousands of migrants, and the hardships of the trip north seemed to pale beside the near certainty of finding work.
 Now, the construction slump -- along with a year-old crackdown on illegal immigration at the border and in the workplace, and mounting anti-immigrant sentiment in places -- has made it even harder for Mexican migrants to reach the United States and land well-paying jobs. 
 Many experts say it is too early to know if the negligible increase in remittances will continue. Some argue it was to be expected: much of the initial spike in money transfers had resulted from better accounting. In addition, earlier waves of migrants are returning to the houses they built, or they have managed to legalize their status in the United States and bring their families, sending less money back. 
 But the events of the last year in the United States, political and economic, have also clouded the prospects of many illegal Mexican workers. New walls, new guards and new equipment at the border have dissuaded many from trying to cross and raised the cost for those who try to as much as $2,800. Workplace raids and stories of summary deportations stoke fears among Mexicans on both sides of the border.
 Referring to tougher measures in the United States, Primitivo Rodriguez, a Mexican immigration expert, said: ''Psychologically, they lead you to save money in case of an emergency. You send less, you save more.'' 
 The shakier economy in many states means that migrants have moved from well-paying steady jobs to work as day laborers. 
 ''In our interviews with families, they say that migrants are now working two or three days when before they worked four or five days,'' said David Skerritt, a historian at Veracruzana University.
 Rodolfo Garcia Zamora , an immigration expert at the University of Zacatecas, said money transfers to Zacatecas state fell by about 25 percent this year.
 Here in Guanajuato state, remittances have created a peculiar economy in villages tucked among rolling corn and sorghum fields. There are few jobs, yet many houses have stereo systems, washing machines and three-piece living room sets. 
 Things are changing, though. Some of the men are back and need cash for seeds and fertilizer to plow long-neglected fields. At the microcredit association operated by a local nonprofit group, the Bajio Women's Network, loans for agriculture, which barely existed last year, now account for 11 percent of all borrowing.
 Women are finding it harder to save, said Evelyne Sinquin, the network coordinator. ''The people who have come back can't work, and the people in the United States are working fewer hours.''
 Other than agriculture, the jobs here are in construction, building houses of absentee owners houses along the cobbled streets. Some are modest with a few brick rooms; others are ornate tributes to their absentee owners' success: gold-painted balconies, the Virgin of Guadalupe etched in a window, Greek columns. Los Emigrantes carpentry shop in nearby La Cuevita sits on a traffic circle adorned with a monument showing several figures, one of them a migrant waving a fistful of dollars.
 Not much else flourishes. Three months ago, Monica Nunez closed her tortilla shop in the village of San Lucas. ''Most people went to the United States and sales went down,'' she said. 
 Her husband has been home from Houston for a year, but she has seven brothers and a sister in the United States who still send money. She is planning a new business, perhaps an Internet cafe so people can connect with relatives in the United States. 
 Less than an hour's drive away, the city of Queretaro is prospering, turning out home appliances for the world market. But for most people in the villages, education ended after elementary school. An unskilled factory or construction job pays little more than $50 or $60 a week. 
 With those prospects, the next generation -- some of them as young as 15 -- seemed to have few doubts about heading to the United States. 
 Estrella Rivera's brother Francisco left for the first time when he was 16. Now 21, he recently came home after a year and a half in Orlando, Fla., working in construction. He earned enough to add a floor to his parents' house, but then he struggled. 
 ''Either there was no work or they did not want to hire somebody without papers,'' he said, perched on an old Ford pickup truck with Michigan tags beside his family's sheep and cow pens. 
 But he expects to go back again. ''To tell the truth, it really is worth the trouble,'' he said, recounting a terrifying crossing getting lost in the Arizona desert. 
 Mrs. Rivera's husband is not so sure. ''It's really tough to go back,'' he said. ''Now they lock you up. Before, they grabbed you and sent you back. The laws were never this tough.''

HEADLINE: Banished, Risk Finds Way Home

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
E-mail: norris@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The transfer of risk was supposed to be the great advance brought to the world by financial engineers. They developed exotic derivative products that enabled risks to be sliced and diced in all manner of ways.
 Central banks and bank regulators cheered on the process. The transfers of risk meant that those who were comfortable with a given risk would wind up with it. 
 The apparent triumph of that process came after the technology stock bubble burst and the American economy went into recession in 2001. A lot of money was lost because of huge overinvestment in things like fiber optic cable, but the losses were dispersed. No significant banks failed or even got into trouble. 
 The system worked, the regulators told themselves as they praised the financial advances brought on by the derivative revolution.
 Sometimes those regulators did wonder just where the risk was. If it was no longer the banks that would suffer when a financial crisis came around, who would? Could it be the insurance companies? Perhaps pension plans? Would hedge funds that gambled and lost be unable to meet their obligations and bring on a systemic failure?
 In this financial crisis, the one that started with subprime loans, we are learning the answer to that question. The risks that banks would have taken on under the old system -- when banks made loans and profited only as they were paid back -- had been transferred through a bewildering wilderness of options, swaps, swaptions, specialized investment vehicles, collateralized debt obligations, variable interest entities and who knows how many other instruments.
 And when the whole daisy chain was through, a lot of the risk seems to have ended just where it used to end. With the banks.
 There were differences, of course. For one, the banks are ending up taking losses from loans that others made. 
 A suit filed this week in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan sheds light on one way this happened. American Home Mortgage Holdings, a subprime lender that went broke in August, sued Bank of America, saying it reneged on a deal to bear losses if mortgages were sold for less than face value. The bank asserts that some of the loans shouldn't have been made at all, but American Home says that is irrelevant. 
 Here's how it worked, in a simplified explanation that does not come close to capturing all the complexities that the financial engineers inserted:
 American made subprime loans and sold them to special purpose entities it set up. Those entities, in turn, financed themselves by borrowing, mostly through the short-term commercial paper market.
 To reassure investors, the special purpose entities entered into swap agreements with Bank of America and other big banks, in which the banks promised to make up the difference if the entities could not retain financing and therefore had to sell loans for less than par value. The chances of such a sale presumably seemed slight when the deal was made in 2004, but lots of unexpected things are cropping up these days.
 In late September, American auctioned off the loans. Note that these appear to be loans made in 2004 or earlier, before lending standards are supposed to have crumbled. 
 We now have a market value for such loans. Packages of mortgages that were classified as performing -- meaning the homeowner is mailing in a check every month -- sold for as little as 80 percent of face value, and none went for more than 92 percent. The nonperforming loans sold in a range of 54 to 59 percent.
 American Home says it sent out bills to its swap partners, and all but Bank of America agreed to pay. 
 The amount in dispute is just $25 million, an insignificant amount for the bank. But its refusal to pay may indicate an effort to find ways to shed what now seem to be foolish risks. The man in charge of that area of the bank was pushed out this week in a reorganization. The bank would not comment on the lawsuit.
 There are other ways that banks may come to lose a lot of money. Jonathan Weil of Bloomberg News points out that Citigroup has no legal obligation to make up losses in the specialized investment vehicles -- SIVs -- it set up, but some analysts think it will do so to avoid a hit to its reputation. If it does put up cash, that will call into question the accuracy of Citi's financial statements. If not, some of Citi's customers will be very upset.
 Not all the losses will end up with banks. Some will go to mutual funds and hedge funds and pension funds. Some will go to those who insured the value of securities, like Ambac Financial, which surprised Wall Street by posting its first quarterly loss this week.
 Still, it is remarkable that the financial engineers generated large commissions and fees by selling risk-transfer products that, in the end, moved a lot of the risk back to where it started.

HEADLINE: Riding the Rapids On 'Deliverance' River

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER PERCY COLLIER

 BODY:
BEFORE they arrived in Long Creek, S.C., to test themselves against the rapids of the Chattooga River, the rafters had been warned that the water was low. It wasn't that the Chattooga would be tame; its 57 miles of federally designated wild and scenic river is never static. But a summer of drought in the Southeast had so depleted the water that new records were being set each day -- a film crew from the Weather Channel had recently stopped by to record the phenomenon. 
 The rafters, a dozen male friends planning their annual ''boys' night out'' weekend, were told that they would probably find a more raucous ride 100 miles away on the Ocoee in Tennessee. 
 But the men had no interest at all in switching rivers. 
 On an afternoon in late August, as he stood dripping wet on the bank after being dumped from one of their rafts (the Chattooga was more vigorous that expected), George Bell, a semiretired businessman from Libertyville, Ill., explained their fixation. 
 '''Deliverance,''' Mr. Bell said as he stood next to an overturned raft now serving as a picnic table. ''That's why we're here.''
 ''Deliverance,'' the 1972 Academy-award nominated film based on the novel of the same name by James Dickey, carved out a permanent dark corner in the American psyche with its unsettling combination of backwoods menace and masterly banjo playing. The Web site promoting the recent release of a newly remastered 35th anniversary DVD advertises the movie's world as ''a wilderness of terror.'' But even as it played chillingly on the primal fear of encountering malefactors in remote places, ''Deliverance'' also acquainted a wide swath of Americans with a stunning stretch of river. 
 The word was soon out that many of the perilous rapids that filled the screen were on the Chattooga, which starts in North Carolina and runs along the Georgia-South Carolina border, coursing through two national forests, the Sumter and the Chattahoochee, which together make up over 1.1 million acres. Soon Payson Kennedy, Claude Terry and Doug Woodward, who ran the rapids as stunt doubles in the movie, were setting up rafting operations to meet the demand of outlanders clamoring to test themselves against the same maelstrom of danger where Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Jon Voight had launched their canoes. 
 It was a time when whitewater rafting and boating was just taking off as a mainstream activity. The sport's thrilling edge of peril dovetailed so eerily with Dickey's metaphorical river of concealed evil that no one seems ever to have forgotten the connection: 35 years later, you can't go rafting down a wild river without someone in the group humming a few bars of ''Dueling Banjos.'' And the cultural resonance shows no sign of fading: US Graphics of Norfolk, Va., which prints T-shirts for the resort industry, reports that its T-shirt imprinted with the slogan ''Paddle faster, I hear banjo music'' has sold more than any other in its 12 years in business, even though it wasn't introduced until two years ago.
 The Chattooga isn't the first river in the country to have commercial rafting operations. That distinction belongs to the Green River in Colorado, where Hatch River Expeditions started operations in 1931. Nor was it even the first river to be commercially rafted in the East. That was the Youghiogheny River in Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, the Chattooga's influence on the world of whitewater rafting in America is unmistakable, and unmistakably bound up with the film. For many, it has the aura of the ultimate rafting trip.
 When they rafted the river on a recent Friday, Mr. Bell and his friends saw Deliverance Rock, where expensive film equipment is said to have been lost in the rapids, and the site in the woods where, in the movie, Mr. Reynolds rescues his companions from sadistic mountain men. But the main point was the adventure, and the men learned firsthand to respect the power of the Chattooga. 
 Their lead guide, Greg Burhop, began the trip by settling the men into a fleet of small rafts, none over 12 feet long. On some rivers (the Snake River in Wyoming, for example), 20 or more people might be packed onto a single raft, with guides doing the paddling. On the Chattooga and a growing number of other rivers, big thrills come, in part, from being in a small boat: two paying customers, one guide. 
 ''Sport rafts,'' as they are often called, are the Porsche Boxsters of whitewater rafting: nimble, able to fit into places others don't. They move faster and get stuck less often. There are several models: the Otter, made by NRS Inc. in Moscow, Idaho, with a self-bailing floor that keeps water from pooling inside; the Tygart, known as ''Diblet,'' made by Demaree Inflatable Boats of Friendsville, Md., with black synthetic rubber and metal inflation valves; the Spider made by Maravia Rafts of Boise, Idaho, and composed of synthetic fabric encapsulated in polyurethane. Mr. Burhop's favorite is the Momentum (a k a the Momo), made by a company that is now out of business, and no longer available. ''This thing's so light it's ridiculous,'' he said as he readied one for its trip into the river. ''It caterpillars over just about anything on the river.''
 When water levels drop on the Chattooga, small boats are both a selling point and necessity. Though low water is not often the sort of thing that attracts adrenaline fiends, there are benefits to running the Chattooga in this condition. At one stop, rafters-turned-swimmers can drop down into a cylindrical hole in the granite, six feet in diameter, swim out the bottom and end up in a different channel of the river. With the aid of ropes and a guide, they can also be safely plunked down into an alcove behind a rapid, so you can look out from beneath it. What's more, pointed out a guide named Erin Mckergow, the waterfalls drop farther and more steeply at low water. ''Rather than the water shooting you outward,'' she said, ''you're dropping almost straight downward.'' 
 Mr. Bell and his friends learned about those waterfalls. 
 Two and a half miles out, Mr. Burhop got out onto the shore and perched on a kiosk-sized boulder beneath a seven-foot waterfall. Clutching a bag of yellow floating rope and equipped with other rescue gear, he had already guided several of the rafts over the crest of the falls and down into the pool below when it was time for the one carrying Joe Kraft and Don Kemper to take the plunge. 
 With a wave of his free hand, Mr. Burhop signaled from below to their guide, Andy Burton. Mr. Burton waved back, and the raft advanced toward the drop. ''Paddle forward!'' commanded Mr. Burton, who was at the back of the raft, moving a plastic paddle deep in the tepid brown water and fighting hard against the current to keep the raft on course to go squarely over the falls. 
 The raft slumped languidly, almost awkwardly, over the ledge. Then: whoosh! The men were sucked downward. Mr. Burton slid down to the floor of the raft, seeming to abandon the notion of going anywhere but where the river wanted to take them. Water gushed in. His two charges clutched the Jesus strap (guide-speak for a nylon blue line that runs along the outer walls of the raft) as the craft splashed down at the base of the falls, jarring all its occupants. Hands flailed. Bodies shifted. Out toppled Mr. Kraft, and, falling backward, he was instantly swallowed up in the wash. 
 Soon a pale, sneakered leg emerged from the churning water. Mr. Burton reached to pull his charge back to the raft, and after a few moments of floating in the opposite direction, Mr. Kraft was hoisted up, unharmed. 
 A few yards farther downstream, the rafts that had already made it down the waterfall waited in quieter water beneath overhanging hemlocks, American hollies, mountain laurel and rhododendron. Howls, winces and chuckles reverberated from this flotilla -- a few minutes before, several of the other rafters had experienced similar baptisms. 
 On any other river, the rafters' score would be obvious: Man, 0; Mother Nature, 1. But this was the Chattooga, where making it out in one piece, through whatever (or whomever) stands in the way, is deemed victory enough.

HEADLINE: Credit Crisis Spreading New Jitters In Europe

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Europe, which once hoped to avoid major fallout from the summer's credit crisis, is now feeling an autumn chill of slackening economies and warnings of further market upheaval.
 The ill tidings came in several European capitals Thursday, including a reduced growth forecast in Germany and a Bank of England report that said financial markets were still vulnerable to shocks from the crisis that originated in the American home mortgage market.
 ''The financial turmoil of the last months is not yet behind us,'' the European commissioner of economic and monetary affairs, Joaquin Almunia, said at a conference of bond dealers in Brussels. ''Downside risks to the growth outlook have now obviously increased due to the events in the financial markets,'' he added. ''It is apparent that economic outlook will be somewhat less favorable than we expected.'' 
 The German government cut its forecast for growth next year to 2 percent, from 2.4 percent, citing a more sluggish global economy, as well as high oil prices and the relentlessly rising euro.
 A survey of German business confidence by the Ifo Institute in Munich registered a decline for the sixth consecutive month, though the institute said the results did not suggest Germany would fall into recession.
 ''The shift in sentiment this summer was as sudden as anything I've seen in my 15 years in the business,'' said Jorg Kramer, the chief economist of Commerzbank. ''It is clear that the boom is over.''
 What is not clear is whether Europe's financial system faces more jolts of the kind set off in the United States this week by Merrill Lynch's disclosure that it had written down nearly $8 billion in mortgage-related securities, $3 billion more than it estimated just two weeks earlier.
 While big European banks like UBS and Deutsche Bank have announced multibillion-dollar write-downs of these securities, they insist that they are on top of the situation and that the bad news has been acknowledged.
 But analysts remain wary of further nasty surprises, particularly among less well-known banks like IKB Deutsche Industriebank of Germany, which needed to be rescued after ruinous losses. Smaller banks were keen buyers of these complex investments.
 The depth of uneasiness among banks is evident in the three-month interest rate that banks charge one another for loans: 4.6 percent, well above the benchmark 4 percent rate set by the European Central Bank. The interbank rate peaked at 4.79 percent during the crisis, analysts said, but the fact that it remains stubbornly above the central bank's rate underscores how rattled the money markets remain.
 The Bank of England warned about this fragility in its semiannual Financial Stability Report, released Thursday.
 ''There have been signs of recovery in recent weeks, but some markets are still illiquid and the financial system remains vulnerable to further shocks,'' the bank's deputy governor for financial stability, John Gieve, said in a statement. ''Some important lessons need to be learned.''
 The Bank of England has come under criticism for not intervening more quickly to help troubled lenders like Northern Rock of Britain. Mr. Gieve acknowledged the need for work on ''liquidity risk management, valuation of complex instruments, disclosures of risk positions and on crisis management.''
 For Europe, perhaps the biggest loss from the crisis so far has been confidence, which had been surging in recent years as countries like Germany racked up uncharacteristically strong growth.
 ''The present turbulence has spread a lack of confidence in the financial markets and beyond, in a manner and intensity that was not foreseeable,'' Mr. Almunia said in his speech in Brussels.
 Adding to the pressures on Europe is the strength of its single currency, the euro, which settled at $1.432 Thursday in New York, a shade below the record high it set this week.
 German officials tried to put a good face on their subdued expectations for 2008, saying they expected consumer spending to improve next year, making Germany less dependent on exports.
 They even nudged up their growth forecast for this year, to 2.4 percent from 2.3 percent. The German economy expanded 2.9 percent in 2006, its fastest pace since the boom year of 2000. ''The growth dynamic is intact,'' the German economics minister, Michael Glos, said.
 But for those who argued that Europe could sidestep a downturn in the United States -- because of its booming trade with China, among other reasons -- the latest news underscores that the economic vigor of Europe remains closely linked to that of the United States.
 ''There was only a temporary decoupling of Europe and the U.S.,'' Mr. Kramer of Commerzbank said. ''The credit crisis has had a real-world economic impact in the U.S., and we are affected by that.''

HEADLINE: House Defies Bush and Passes Children's Insurance Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Once again defying a veto threat from President Bush, the House on Thursday passed a bill to provide health insurance for 10 million children. But supporters did not have enough votes to override the promised veto.
 The bill was approved by a vote of 265 to 142, less than the two-thirds needed to override a veto.
 Last week, when the House considered a similar bill vetoed by Mr. Bush, supporters fell 13 votes short of the number needed to override. The roll calls are not directly comparable because several lawmakers were absent on Thursday, many of them helping constituents cope with the California wildfires. 
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the latest vote was ''a step forward'' toward the goal of insuring millions of children from low-income families.
 But the gains were not immediately evident in the roll call. Of the Republicans who voted against the bill last week, none voted for the new version. And one Republican who supported the old bill, Representative Vernon J. Ehlers of Michigan, voted against the new one, citing concerns that the measure had been brought up on short notice, without enough input from Republicans.
 Senate Democrats said they expected to take up the new bill and pass it next week. The House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, said it was at least conceivable that the bill could be amended in the Senate, to meet some Republican concerns.
 If some version of the new bill is approved by Congress and vetoed by Mr. Bush, and if the House again sustains his veto, Democrats said they might extend the existing children's insurance program through next summer. They could then schedule a vote on the issue in September or October, in hopes of inflicting maximum political damage on Republicans just before the 2008 elections.
 The bill passed on Thursday by the House, like the one vetoed by Mr. Bush, would add $35 billion to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing a total of $60 billion over the next five years. 
 Ms. Pelosi said the bill was a test of the nation's values and priorities. ''To be a great nation,'' she said, ''we have to take care of the health of our children. It should almost go without saying, but it doesn't. There is every compassionate, humanitarian, motherly, fatherly and family reason to be for this legislation. It also makes good economic sense.'' 
 Healthy children become productive adults, the speaker said.
 Supporters of the new bill said it addressed all the major concerns that prompted Republicans to oppose the earlier version. The measure, they said, would end coverage of childless adults, ban coverage of illegal immigrants and generally prohibit states from covering children in families with incomes above three times the poverty level -- $61,950 for a family of four.
 Ms. Pelosi said the restrictions on adults, illegal immigrants and high-income families were clear in the first bill and ''are even clearer in the second bill.''
 But Mr. Bush said his concerns had not been addressed ''in a meaningful way.'' He derided the new bill as ''more of the same,'' and many Republican lawmakers said the changes were insignificant.
 ''The new bill puts lipstick on a sow,'' said Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, Republican of New York. ''Today is raw politics -- trotting out a vote just for the sake of a vote.''
 The House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, said, ''This is nothing more than a political game, getting ready for the next election.'' 
 Representative Ginny Brown-Waite, Republican of Florida, said the child health program would still be a ''magnet for illegal aliens.'' 
 Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, said children from affluent families could still qualify for benefits because states, in determining eligibility, could ignore or disregard part of a family's income.
 Democrats said such concerns were unwarranted.
 In general, the bill says, federal money cannot be used to cover children in families with incomes above three times the poverty level. New Jersey, the only state that now covers children in such families, would be allowed to continue doing so for three years -- and perhaps longer, if it also covered more of its poorest children.
 Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, hailed this provision, saying it was needed ''because of the high cost of living in the state.''
 The child health program is intended for families who have too much income to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private health insurance. It now covers 6.6 million children, and the new bill, like the original one, would add nearly four million children to the rolls.
 Throughout the day, House Republicans urged Democrats to put off a vote on the new bill to next week. Ten of the 26 House members who did not vote Thursday are from California, and 8 of those 10 are Republicans.
 Mr. Hoyer said the absent lawmakers would not have changed the outcome of the vote.
 Forty-three Republicans voted for the bill; one Democrat voted against it.
 Besides complaining about the timing of the vote, Republicans voiced several other objections.
 Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, said the bill still called for ''a massive tax increase.'' The federal excise tax on cigarettes would be increased to $1 a pack, which is 61 cents more than the current levy.
 And Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, said that under the new bill, as under the old one, two million people would lose or drop private health insurance coverage and enroll in the expanded federal program.

HEADLINE: A Catastrophe Foretold

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''Increased subprime lending has been associated with higher levels of delinquency, foreclosure and, in some cases, abusive lending practices.'' So declared Edward M. Gramlich, a Federal Reserve official. 
 These days a lot of people are saying things like that about subprime loans -- mortgages issued to buyers who don't meet the normal financial criteria for a home loan. But here's the thing: Mr. Gramlich said those words in May 2004.
 And it wasn't his first warning. In his last book, Mr. Gramlich, who recently died of cancer, revealed that he tried to get Alan Greenspan to increase oversight of subprime lending as early as 2000, but got nowhere. 
 So why was nothing done to avert the subprime fiasco?
 Before I try to answer that question, there are a few things you should know.
 First, the situation for both borrowers and investors looks increasingly dire. 
 A new report from Congress's Joint Economic Committee predicts that there will be two million foreclosures on subprime mortgages by the end of next year. That's two million American families facing the humiliation and financial pain of losing their homes.
 At the same time, investors who bought assets backed by subprime loans are continuing to suffer severe losses. Everything suggests that there will be many more stories like that of Merrill Lynch, which has just announced an $8.4 billion write-down because of bad loans -- $3 billion more than it had announced just a few weeks earlier.
 Second, much if not most of the subprime lending that is now going so catastrophically bad took place after it was clear to many of us that there was a serious housing bubble, and after people like Mr. Gramlich had issued public warnings about the subprime situation. As late as 2003, subprime loans accounted for only 8.5 percent of the value of mortgages issued in this country. In 2005 and 2006, the peak years of the housing bubble, subprime was 20 percent of the total -- and the delinquency rates on recent subprime loans are much higher than those on older loans.
 So, once again, why was nothing done to head off this disaster? The answer is ideology.
 In a paper presented just before his death, Mr. Gramlich wrote that ''the subprime market was the Wild West. Over half the mortgage loans were made by independent lenders without any federal supervision.'' What he didn't mention was that this was the way the laissez-faire ideologues ruling Washington -- a group that very much included Mr. Greenspan -- wanted it. They were and are men who believe that government is always the problem, never the solution, that regulation is always a bad thing. 
 Unfortunately, assertions that unregulated financial markets would take care of themselves have proved as wrong as claims that deregulation would reduce electricity prices.
 As Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, put it in a recent op-ed article in The Boston Globe, the surge of subprime lending was a sort of ''natural experiment'' testing the theories of those who favor radical deregulation of financial markets. And the lessons, as Mr. Frank said, are clear: ''To the extent that the system did work, it is because of prudential regulation and oversight. Where it was absent, the result was tragedy.''
 In fact, both borrowers and investors got scammed.
 I've written before about the way investors in securities backed by subprime loans were assured that they were buying AAA assets, only to suddenly find that what they really owned were junk bonds. This shock has produced a crisis of confidence in financial markets, which poses a serious threat to the economy.
 But the greater tragedy is the one facing borrowers who were offered what they were told were good deals, only to find themselves in a debt trap.
 In his final paper, Mr. Gramlich stressed the extent to which unregulated lending is prone to the ''abusive lending practices'' he mentioned in his 2004 warning. The fact is that many borrowers are ill-equipped to make judgments about ''exotic'' loans, like subprime loans that offer a low initial ''teaser'' rate that suddenly jumps after two years, and that include prepayment penalties preventing the borrowers from undoing their mistakes. 
 Yet such loans were primarily offered to those least able to evaluate them. ''Why are the most risky loan products sold to the least sophisticated borrowers?'' Mr. Gramlich asked. ''The question answers itself -- the least sophisticated borrowers are probably duped into taking these products.'' And ''the predictable result was carnage.''
 Mr. Frank is now trying to push through legislation that extends moderate regulation to the subprime market. Despite the scale of the disaster, he's facing an uphill fight: money still talks in Washington, and the mortgage industry is a huge source of campaign finance. But maybe the subprime catastrophe will be enough to remind us why financial regulation was introduced in the first place.

HEADLINE: In Sanctioning Iran, U.S. Plays Its 'Unilateralism' Card

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
In announcing sweeping new sanctions against an elite unit of the Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran, Bush administration officials took pains to offer assurances on Thursday that at least for now, the United States is not going to war with Iran.
 ''We do not believe that conflict is inevitable,'' said R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs. ''This decision today supports the diplomacy and in no way, shape or form does it anticipate the use of force.'' 
 The move designated the Quds force of the Revolutionary Guard and four state-owned Iranian banks as supporters of terrorism, and the Guard itself as an illegal exporter of ballistic missiles. The decision thus raised the temperature in American's ongoing confrontation with Iran over terrorism and nuclear weapons. 
 But it also reflected some caution by an administration that has also accused the Quds force of aiding Shiite militia attacks on American soldiers in Iraq, and has even detained some Quds force members there, but has resisted calls for retaliatory strikes inside Iran.
 ''This is a warning shot across the bow, not that the U.S. is going to invade Iran, but that Iran has pushed the level of escalation, particularly inside Iraq, to unacceptable levels,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''In many ways, this kind of warning is more a demonstration of restraint than a signal that we're going to war.''
 Still, after 18 months in which the administration has touted the virtues of collective action against Iran by the United States and its allies, the sanctions are a major turn toward unilateralism. 
 The shift represents a tacit acknowledgment that the diplomatic strategy pressed most vigorously by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has been ineffective, and it prompted fresh criticism on Thursday from Russia: ''Why make the situation worse, bring it to a dead end, threaten sanctions or even military action?'' President Vladimir V. Putin asked, in a report by Agence France-Presse.
 The administration clearly hopes to enlist allies around the world in its new, tougher stance -- in part because the United States, having maintained its own stiff sanctions against Iran since the Islamic revolution in 1979, does not have much leverage left itself. 
 The administration hopes its influence can turn Iran into a political and economic pariah from which more foreign institutions will shy away.
 The sanctions will ''provide a powerful deterrent to every international bank and company that thinks of doing business with the Iranian government,'' Ms. Rice said. 
 Yet officials acknowledged that past attempts to enlist allies in limiting their business ties to Iran have come up short. In each instance, they acknowledged, some other countries have partly offset the sanctions.
 China, for instance, has increased trade with Iran in the past year, Mr. Burns said. And analysts pointed out that Russian, Indian, European and even Canadian companies continued to do business with many different sectors of the Iranian economy, particularly its all important oil and natural gas industries.
 Ms. Rice maintained that American officials would continue to work with their European, Russian and Chinese counterparts to come up with a new set of United Nations Security Council sanctions to rein in Tehran's nuclear ambitions. 
 But she also said she would be willing to ''meet with my Iranian counterpart anytime, anywhere,'' as long as Iran first suspended its nuclear activities, a longstanding American precondition for such talks.
 But Iran has shown no sign that it is remotely interested in complying with the Security Council demand that it suspend its uranium enrichment. 
 Indeed, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ari Larijani, whom American officials viewed as a moderate, quit last week and was replaced by Saeed Jalili, who is believed to be a supporter of Iran's conservative president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
 The United States is not accusing the entire Revolutionary Guard Corps of being a terrorist organization, a step advocated by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who voted in favor of such a measure last month and has since come under attack from antiwar members of her Democratic party. Some conservatives in the administration had also pushed for the broader declaration. 
 But Thursday's announcement is still an ambitious attempt to squeeze the upper echelons of the Iranian government, including the Ministry of Defense. It is the first time that the United States has tried to use the terrorist label and the sanctions associated with it to isolate or punish another country's military.
 In Tehran, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Mohammad Ali Hosseini, shrugged off Washington's announcement, saying America's hostile policies ran counter to international regulations and were ''doomed to fail,'' the official news agency IRNA reported. 
 Mr. Hosseini said the United States produced nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and had supported what he called terrorist groups. He called the Bush administration's accusation that Iran was arming Shiite militias in Iraq ''ridiculous.'' 
 Israel, on the other hand, welcomed the announcement. Sallai Meridor, Israel's ambassador to the Washington, called it ''a major diplomatic step in the effort to prevent Iran -- a global menace and leading sponsor of terrorism -- from obtaining nuclear weapons, which threatens international peace and security.''
 Four state-owned Iranian banks, Bank Melli, Bank Mellat, Bank Saderat and Bank Kargoshaee, were also cited as supporters of terrorist groups for their activities in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Middle East.

PERSON: Randall Forsberg 

HEADLINE: Randall Forsberg, 64, Nuclear Freeze Advocate, Dies

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Randall Forsberg, who as a typist at a peace institute in Sweden in the 1960s began studying the potentially terrifying consequences of nuclear proliferation, then helped start the nuclear freeze movement that culminated in the largest political demonstration in American history, died on Oct. 19. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.
 Her death, at a Bronx hospital, was caused by cancer, said her sister, Celia Seupel. 
 Dr. Forsberg, who went on to earn a doctorate in international studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, focusing on disarmament, is widely credited with creating the concept of a nuclear freeze -- a mutual and verifiable halt by the United States and the Soviet Union on the testing, production and deployment of all nuclear weapons.
 That simple idea gained increasing public support in the late 1970s and early '80s as an alternative to the complexities of the arms race, with its continuing posturing and intermittent negotiations about megatonnage, throw weight and inspections. 
 By 1982, nuclear freeze proposals had been approved by dozens of town, city, county and state legislatures throughout the country, and by referendums in eight states. The effort peaked on June 12, 1982, with a mass march through Manhattan and a gathering of more than 700,000 people in Central Park, according to crowd estimates.
 By then, there were more than 5,000 disarmament groups, large and small, throughout the United States. But the movement lost momentum that year when a resolution urging President Ronald Reagan to negotiate a bilateral freeze with the Soviet Union failed by two votes in the House of Representatives. 
 The movement slowed even further in 1984 with the re-election of Reagan, who had pushed for a $240 billion buildup in MX missiles, cruise missiles and Trident submarines and for creation of a missile defense shield, popularly known as Star Wars. 
 ''The grass-roots people who poured in thousands of hours over the last few years through their work on the freeze are tremendously disappointed and frustrated,'' Dr. Forsberg said a year later. ''We felt that degree of commitment and devotion had to make a difference, and the shock of what happened in the 1984 elections left us reeling.'' 
 Some historians and military experts argue that Reagan's insistence on increasing military spending, combined with economic and political instability in the Soviet Union, led to the downfall of the Soviet bloc and to the eventual, if often tenuous, improvement in relations between the United States and Russia.
 Randall Caroline Watson was born on July 23, 1943, in Huntsville, Ala., into a family with ''a few Georgia plantations ravaged by Sherman's troops floating around in our past,'' she once said. Her father, Larkin Douglass Watson, was an actor who later moved the family to New York where, under the name Douglass Watson, he appeared for 15 years on the NBC soap opera ''Another World.''
 Ms. Watson graduated from Barnard in 1965 and soon began teaching English at a private school in Pennsylvania. Two years later, she married Gunnar Forsberg, a young Swedish student, and moved to Stockholm. They later divorced.
 Besides her sister, of High Falls, N.Y., Dr. Forsberg is survived by her mother, Genie Loaring-Clark Watson of Greenwich, Conn.; and a daughter, Katarina Forsberg of Medford, Mass. 
 By the time the Forsbergs arrived in Stockholm, the Swedish government had established the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Ms. Forsberg was able to walk in off the street and get a job as a typist. Her introduction to the complexity of the nuclear weapons race came when she began reading what she was typing. 
 By her account, Ms. Forsberg could not believe that the 1963 talks on a comprehensive test ban treaty had broken down over a dispute between Washington's demand for seven on-site inspections a year and the Russians' insistence on no more than three. She wondered, Why not compromise on five? Soon she was writing her own research papers on the arms race. 
 In 1974, divorced and the mother of a 5-year-old, Ms. Forsberg moved to Boston and began studying arms control at M.I.T.; she received her Ph.D. in 1980. By then, she had opened the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies, in suburban Brookline. 
 Based on her studies, Dr. Forsberg concluded that despite a limited nuclear test ban treaty signed in 1963, arms-control experts had given up on complete disarmament, and even on substantial reductions. They had replaced it with the idea of managing a permanent, equalized arms race. Her idea was to reduce nuclear stockpiles and bring a halt to the introduction of newer, more lethal weapons.
 In 1983, a year after the rally, Dr. Forsberg received the so-called ''genius award'' from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. In 1995, President Bill Clinton appointed her to the Director's Advisory Committee of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. 
 In 2002, she challenged Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts in his campaign for re-election, entering the race as a write-in candidate about two weeks before the election to protest his vote authorizing military action against Iraq. She received more than 22,000 votes. Two years ago, Dr. Forsberg was appointed as the first holder of the Anne and Bernard Spitzer chair in political science at City College in New York. 
 In 1982, addressing the rally, Dr. Forsberg looked out over the crowd and exulted: ''We've done it! The nuclear freeze campaign has mobilized the biggest peacetime peace movement in United States history. The politicians don't believe it yet.''
 ''Until the arms race stops,'' she continued, ''until we have a world with peace and justice, we will not go home and be quiet. We will go home and organize.''

HEADLINE: Bush's Tough Talk on Cuba: Then What?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''How the Applause Meter Rates Bush's Pressure on Cuba'' (news analysis, Oct. 25):
 President Bush warns Cuba about what will be ''unacceptable'' in the transition to a post-Castro regime. Since the Spanish-American War, the United States has assumed that we have the right to decide how Cuba shall be governed. 
 If Cuba does not bow to the will of the United States, will President Bush mount another Bay of Pigs invasion? We have already tried to strangle the Cuban economy for almost 50 years since Fidel Castro came to power, so what else can we do to force the Cubans to obey us? Emmett Barcalow
 Northampton, Mass., Oct. 25, 2007
 To the Editor:
 In his Oct. 24 speech, President Bush reiterated over and over again that the Cuban people can count on the United States to assist their transition to democracy and the rebuilding of their society. But as they look at the still devastated Gulf Coast, and at the bloody, smoldering ruins in Iraq, where we haven't even been able to get lights and water back on, why would they have any confidence in President Bush's assurances?
 The cold fact is that under President Bush, the United States' reputation for national building has reached an all-time low. Wayne S. Smith
 Washington, Oct. 25, 2007
 The writer, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, was chief of the United States Interests Section in Havana, 1979-82.
 To the Editor:
 President Bush issued a warning to Cuba regarding its plan for a political transition. I wonder if he has issued similar warnings to other countries with undemocratic policies that are not consistent with American democracy. Did American presidents warn Jordan or Saudi Arabia when family members took over leadership of their countries, or do they consider it the right of a country to choose its own government?
 And what about the undemocratic coups that the United States has supported and/or fomented? Did we object when a coup overthrew Allende in Chile? Or Mossadegh in Iran? Or Arbenz in Guatemala? Each was a democratically elected leader whom we opposed and then deposed with involvement of the C.I.A. Those who live in glass houses ...

HEADLINE: ING Learns to Build Its Identity 26.2 Miles at a Time

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN; Joshua Robinson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When ING, the Dutch-based financial services company and the title sponsor of the New York City Marathon, began to establish its operations in the United States in 2001, it had a small problem.
 For starters, the corporate acronym gave zero hint of ING's identity. Was it a banking firm? An insurance company? A gerund?
 ''We were the largest financial company that no one had ever heard of,'' said Tricia Conahan, ING's senior vice president in charge of brand marketing. 
 How to quickly and efficiently establish an identity in a cluttered market with established names, where one company seemed indistinguishable from the other?
 Instead of attaching itself to golf and tennis, more traditional branding routes, ING in 2003 jumped into the New York City Marathon. This year's race is scheduled for Nov. 4.
 The initial three-year agreement as title sponsor cost close to $6 million, according to officials with the New York Road Runners, the race organizers. The arrangement with ING has since been renewed through 2010, and is believed to cost $2 million to $3 million a year. (The New York Times is also a sponsor of the marathon.)
 ''Our strategy was to zig when everyone else zagged,'' Conahan said.
 ING, which operates in more than 50 countries, has since become the title sponsor in the United States of the Georgia Marathon and the Miami Marathon. It also sponsors international marathons in Amsterdam, Brussels, Ottawa and Taipei and has become the first nonsports-related company to become widely associated worldwide with distance running, marathon experts said.
 ''My sense is, they are a very strong influence on running around the country,'' said Amby Burfoot, an editor at large of Runners World magazine, who won the Boston Marathon in 1968.
 Noting that the inaugural ING Georgia Marathon last March attracted about 15,000 marathoners and half-marathoners in Atlanta -- a city with a popular 10-kilometer run but an indifferent history to 26.2-mile races -- Burfoot said: ''They're putting together a strong program. Somebody knows what they're doing.''
 It is not surprising that a financial services company would find attractive qualities in sponsoring a marathon, especially in New York, a global economic capital, said Don Hinchey, a vice president of The Bonham Group, a Denver-based sports and entertainment marketing firm.
 Marathoners tend to be affluent. The average household income for participants in the New York City Marathon is $130,000. Two-thirds of the 37,000 runners this year are between 30 and 50, an age when people are becoming aware of and receptive to the need for financial planning.
 ''Couple that with the fact that marathon runners, by nature, think long term,'' Hinchey said. ''They're comfortable with delayed gratification. Isn't that the essence of the appeal of an insurance product or financial planning?''
 For its first 34 years, the New York City Marathon existed without a title sponsor. But, by 2003, new economic realities existed. Pontiac had not renewed its automobile sponsorship of the race, and J. P. Morgan Chase had ended a nearly 30-year affiliation with the marathon as a financial services sponsor.
 Also, the Chicago Marathon, whose faster, flatter course was more conducive to world records, had begun to somewhat overshadow New York among elite runners. So the New York City Marathon went the way of football bowl games and signed ING as a corporate title sponsor.
 ''It was insuring our viability in tough economic times,'' Allan Steinfeld, then the chief executive of the New York Road Runners, said at the time.
 Prize money for the men's and women's champions has increased to $130,000 apiece, from $80,000 in 2002, ensuring top fields that this year will include Paula Radcliffe of England, the women's world record holder. ING has also contributed $750,000 to the city parks foundation and the New York Road Runners foundation toward running programs aimed at children, marathon officials said.
 ''Since ING got involved, we have elevated every aspect of the event,'' said Mary Wittenberg, chief executive of New York Road Runners and the marathon's race director.
 In cities where it sponsors running events, ING scores 20 percent higher on such factors as favorability, trust and intent to do business, said Conahan, the company's brand marketing chief. Still, ING exists among an alphabet soup of corporations.
 Interviews with runners in Central Park who were training for the marathon indicated that many knew that ING sponsored the race, even if some did not quite know what the company did. Neil Cook, 63, said he thought ING was a Danish bank. Edgar Moran, 33, thought it was the ''MGM Marathon or something, right?''
 Andrew Sinclair, 27, a banker, said he knew precisely what ING was, even if the acronym made the identification tricky for those not in the financial world.
 ''I've heard a number of people say they're running in the AIG New York City Marathon,'' Sinclair said.

HEADLINE: An Airline Holding Pattern

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

 BODY:
It's not just flights that are being delayed. United States airlines are also putting off purchases of new planes, meaning the nation's fleet of aircraft, on average, is aging right along with the passengers. 
 Northwest Airlines, for example, flies 109 of the oldest jetliners in the country, DC-9s, with an average age of 35 years. Northwest has yet to decide how to replace the DC-9s, which could remain in service another five years or more.
 American Airlines operates a fleet of 300 older MD-80s, a model that guzzles fuel and lacks the latest in passenger comforts. And American has only a handful of replacement planes coming in the next couple of years. 
 The fleet of big jets operated by nine major domestic airlines has aged steadily since 2002, according to Airline Monitor, an aviation research firm. The average age was 10.6 years at the end of 2002, and it has risen each year, hitting 12.2 years at the end of 2006. Domestic airlines largely stopped ordering new planes after Sept. 11, 2001, shrinking their fleets to adjust to a drop in demand. Travel has rebounded strongly, but airlines are, for the most part, years away from taking delivery on large numbers of new planes. A big reason is that Boeing and Airbus have committed most of their airliner production capacity in coming years to carriers outside the United States.
 Indeed, only 43 of the 710 Boeing 787s on order have been identified as going to domestic airlines; 25 to Continental Airlines and 18 to Northwest. And none of the 165 giant Airbus A380s on order are destined for United States carriers. In essence a new generation of jetliners -- bigger, more comfortable, more fuel efficient -- is largely bypassing domestic airlines and their customers.
 ''The fleet is aging almost one-for-one with the calendar,'' said Roger E. King, an analyst at CreditSights, who predicts that the trend will continue for about five years.
 Scott Carr, a technology executive in Tulsa, Okla., said that when he flies on one of Northwest's DC-9s, ''I feel like I'm in a tuna can.'' 
 ''I've grown to know enough about the various kinds of airplanes,'' Mr. Carr said. ''I try to avoid Northwest now whenever possible. If I'm flying Southwest, they're flying newer planes and I can tell the difference.''
 Warren D. Miller, co-founder of Beckmill Research, a Lexington, Va., firm that appraises private businesses, said he braces himself for an old plane except when flying JetBlue Airways, which operates newer Airbus A320s. On other airlines, ''the planes are just dirty; the upholstery is just not very comfy,'' Mr. Miller said.
 He wishes regulators would allow foreign airlines into the United States to fly domestic routes, which would increase competition and bring some new planes into the market.
 Airplane cleaning became something of a lost art during the industry's deep post-Sept. 11 swoon. Airlines are increasing the frequency of cleaning again, but still have some catching up to do. And the oldest planes often have the most grime.
 Carl Zwisler, a Bethesda, Md., lawyer, said he did not think about the age of the US Airways 757 he was flying this month until visiting the lavatory. 
 ''The bathroom looked old: dingy, dusty, not inviting,'' Mr. Zwisler said.
 Airlines could afford to buy more planes. United States carriers collectively socked away about $28 billion in cash, as of June 30. But they are using it to pay down debt or as a financial cushion after lean years when much of the industry took a tour through bankruptcy court. 
 Older planes are safe, experts said, largely because of nearly 20 years of government and industry research after a 1988 incident in which the fuselage of an Aloha Airlines 737 was torn open 24,000 feet over Hawaii, killing one flight attendant. It prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to form the National Aging Aircraft Research Program, studying metal fatigue and other problems in older planes and subjecting them to increased inspection and maintenance procedures.
 Even so, the industry's aging jets contribute to the general unpleasantness of air travel these days. They are often noisier and less comfortable than newer models. 
 They are delayed by mechanical problems more frequently than new planes and often have built-up grime in passenger spaces.
 Moreover, airlines are using these planes on longer routes than in previous years, and onboard delays have grown more frequent, meaning a lengthier stay in less-than-ideal quarters. Planes will also grow even more crowded, as rising demand for travel bumps up against a shortage of planes.
 Newer planes are generally roomier and some offer conveniences like seat-back television screens and outlets to recharge a laptop computer. But airlines configure them differently (SeatGuru.com provides comparison information on seat width, legroom and other features in its ''comparison charts'' section).
 Airlines routinely announce refurbishment programs to install new seats, seat-back televisions, laptop outlets and other features. But those efforts can take two to three years to complete throughout the fleet, because they are typically done when planes are brought in for periodic heavy maintenance.
 ''Gadgets are very important,'' said Linda Hirneise, who heads the travel practice at J. D. Power & Associates, the market research firm. ''In coach, where most people fly, the airlines have taken away more and more.'' 
 Mr. King, the analyst, estimates the industry needs to spend about $280 billion over the next 20 years to replace aging fleets. Even if they had the financial wherewithal, planes are getting hard to come by. 
 Asian airlines have big orders. Lion Air of Indonesia has 95 Boeing 737s on order. Qantas Airways of Australia has signed up for 65 Boeing 787s.
 Discount airlines in Europe are also buying lots of new planes. Wizz Air, a Hungarian carrier, ordered 50 Airbus A320s this month. And Air Berlin has about 85 of the 737s on order.
 With the exception of Southwest Airlines, the major domestic carriers have all either been through bankruptcy or narrowly avoided it in recent years. They were back in the black in 2006 and this year, but profit margins are still anemic -- ''amongst the worst industries in the country,'' said Scott Kirby, president of US Airways. ''The whole industry is hardly the poster child for strong credit.''
 Thus, airline executives are cautious. Even with $3 billion now on hand, ''anything we'd do with cash would be related to strengthening the balance sheet -- paying down debt,'' Mr. Kirby said. The airline recently placed a huge order for jets, but most of the deliveries are years off. 
 Philip A. Baggaley, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor's, said that keeping a large cash reserve is, for some airlines, the best safeguard against another bankruptcy in the event of a recession or labor dispute.
 But there are other demands on those cash hoards. Airline workers, who made wage and pension concessions during the last six years, want raises and better benefits. The airlines carry big debt loads, and investors would like to see some money go to stock buybacks. Frank Boroch, an analyst at Bear Stearns, prodded United Airlines management as early as last spring about ''returning some of that excess cash flow to shareholders.''

HEADLINE: Oil Climbs, And Stocks Do Likewise

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The price of crude oil hit another record high yesterday, capping a wild week on Wall Street, punctuated by widespread rumors and violent market swings.
 Crude oil surged to $91.86 a barrel, after briefly topping the $92 mark, a record high in nominal terms, although still short of the inflation-adjusted high of $101.70, set in April 1980. Existin-home sales fell to their lowest annual pace in almost a decade. Merrill Lynch announced the worst loss in the company's history. And on two separate occasions, stocks briefly swung more than 100 points on rumors that were later discredited. 
 Yet at the closing bell, stock markets were up more than 2 percent for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average recovered most of its 366-point drop of last Friday, closing yesterday at 13,806.70. And investors left for the weekend confident that a rate cut by the Federal Reserve is just around the corner. 
 The volatility left some analysts sounding disoriented yesterday. 
 ''I find that a lot of our assumptions, things we just intuitively believe, are called into question,'' said Marc Chandler, who oversees currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. ''We're fumbling for something, grasping at straws.''
 The Dow closed up more than 130 points yesterday after investors cheered a promising profit outlook from Countrywide Financial, the lending giant, and a bullish earnings report from Microsoft. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished up 20.88 points, or 1.38 percent, at 1,535.28.
 The rally capped an erratic week with several violent intraday swings. Analysts described traders as jumpier than usual on fears of a renewed credit crisis, leaving markets more vulnerable to hearsay.
 ''There seem to have been an abnormal number of rumors, just judging on the e-mails that I see,'' said Brian Gendreau, a vice president at ING Investment Management, referring to messages between his company's traders.
 On Wednesday afternoon, a rumor began circulating that the Federal Reserve was planning an emergency meeting to cut its discount rate, which would make it easier for banks to borrow money from the government. 
 The possibility that such a meeting would actually occur ''didn't pass the laugh test,'' said one economist. But stocks rose more than 100 points on the news.
 On Thursday, a report circulated that the American International Group, the major insurance company, was planning to announce write-downs on assets linked to mortgage-backed securities. Stocks plunged, eventually climbing back to close virtually flat after speculation died down. 
 ''We're in an environment right now where no matter how ridiculous you think the rumor is, or whether it's true, it's having an effect on stock prices and overall market direction,'' said Steve Sachs, who directs trading at Rydex Investments, a firm in Rockville, Md., that manages $16 billion in assets. ''No matter how ludicrous you think it is, you have to pay attention to it. You have to protect yourself against those movements.''
 The summer's subprime shake-up has left traders facing a market in which conventional wisdom no longer seems to apply, analysts said.
 ''If someone told me a couple years ago what would happen if oil got to $90 a barrel, I would say the world economy is turning down sharply,'' said Mr. Chandler of Brown Brothers Harriman.
 Indeed, analysts say the factors that drove up the cost of oil -- including a weakening dollar, concern over lowered supplies, and a flare-up of tensions in the Middle East -- suggest further economic troubles on the horizon. 
 But the market simply shrugged off the rising prices, even though by many accounts, oil prices may now be headed even higher in real terms than their levels in 1980. 
 ''Have we seen the ultimate highs? I wouldn't think so,'' said Ric Navy, an energy analyst at BNP Paribas. ''These hedge funds and these pools of money that are out there, they'd like to go with the trend.''
 Even Wednesday's housing report, which showed that sales of existing homes in September dropped far more than expected, was seen by investors as a promising sign. The data means the Fed may be more inclined to cut its benchmark interest rate, analysts said, which would free up capital for banks and ease fears of a credit squeeze.
 Mr. Chandler said he could not predict the market's behavior next week. ''What can we trust?'' he asked.

HEADLINE: As Housing in Florida Plummets, the Top Tier of the Market Just Dips

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Oct. 20 

 BODY:
Despite a record number of foreclosures and a raft of public auctions of unwanted houses, the upper tier of the real estate market in Florida remains relatively immune to the spreading disaster. 
 Houses and condominiums with price tags of $1 million or more are still changing hands robustly in some of the most exclusive areas, though at a pace less brisk than a year ago. The glistening waterfront glass towers on Miami Beach, the sprawling estates set in manicured gardens in Palm Beach and the clustered mansions in Naples are attracting buyers, both domestic and foreign. 
 As in other once-booming regions, in Florida the housing market seems to be not one market, but two. The lower end is littered with vacant houses and unfinished developments, and homeowners are struggling to meet their monthly payments as rates adjust upward. The luxury end has its unsold new condos and mansions lingering on the market, too, but as in New York, where the demand in pricey Manhattan is still strong, sales have fallen less. And Miami and other parts of Florida are continuing to attract interest among the wealthy.
 Both markets have been buoyed by foreign buyers attracted to the United States because the weak dollar makes American homes comparative bargains. Florida has the added demand from affluent retirees across the country and second-home buyers, particularly from the Northeast. 
 ''The very, very high end of the markets in communities such as the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Manhattan and Miami and to a lesser degree Chicago, Seattle and Washington that have global appeal have held up much better than the rest of the housing market,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''A recession would certainly not help the high end, but it would not undermine it. And much of their buying is done with cash and not affected by the global financial turmoil and its impact on the availability of mortgages.'' 
 Take the greater Miami area. Over all, home prices have fallen 7.3 percent from their peak in December 2006, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index that tracks repeat sales of specific homes. But because of a shift upward in the value of the homes that have traded hands, the median price for condos sold so far this year for over $1 million is holding steady at $1.5 million, according to the Realtor Association of Greater Miami and the Beaches. 
 The median price for single-family homes sold is even reported to be up slightly, to $1.51 million from $1.46 million in the 2006 period. In Miami Beach, two brokers, Kevin Tomlinson and Dora Puig, recently represented a buyer from the Midwest who paid $7 million for a beachfront triplex. The sellers, a group of wealthy Mexicans, had bought the apartment for $6.13 million in April 2005, near the height of the market. They put it up for sale in early 2006 for $9.5 million and finally sold it for a 14 percent gain.
 ''When people are realistic about prices, they can sell,'' said Mr. Tomlinson, a broker with EWM Realty, an affiliate of Christie's. 
 Based on the number of sales, the Florida real estate market as a whole has taken a huge hit this year. Unit sales of homes and condominiums worth less than $1 million in Miami-Dade County, for example, fell 37.2 percent through Oct. 23 compared with the period a year earlier. So far in 2007, 7,078 homes have been sold. 
 But even the high end is cooling off. In the greater Miami area, the number of condos and single-family homes that sold for more than $1 million through Oct. 23 fell 18 percent, to 958 units from 1,166 units in the comparable period a year earlier.
 At the very high end of the market in Naples on Florida's west coast, there have been about 40 sales so far this year, compared with 46 sales for all of 2006, according to Thomas L. Campbell Jr., sales associate at Premier Properties. 
 In Palm Beach, the number of units sold has fallen 15 percent, to 223 properties. 
 ''There is more inventory in all price ranges,'' said Deborah Boza Valledor, the chief operating officer of the Realtor Association of Greater Miami and the Beaches. But even as more homes linger on the market, some areas remain particularly popular with potential buyers. ''They are waterfront properties that are exclusive,'' she said, ''and people are willing to pay the price.''
 Indeed, more than 78,000 homes were for sale in the Miami area in August, up from 51,000 a year before, according to ZipRealty, the real estate brokerage firm.
 The overhang of unsold homes helps explain why reported selling prices do not tell the whole story. Sellers ''are making concessions,'' Ms. Boza Valledor said. ''They will offer a year's worth of paid maintenance fees to the buyer, or they will pay for the parking space or they will throw in country club fees that might be part of the expense of buying a home in a gated community.''
 Just a year ago, when buyers were bidding against one another for properties, such deals would have been unusual. And in another sign that the feeding frenzy has ended, the highest price paid for a Miami-area condo this year was $13.9 million, down from the top price of $16.9 million last year.
 Mr. Tomlinson, the Christie's broker, suggests that sellers are starting to be more realistic. ''They are coming off their 2005 prices and are more in today's market,'' he said. ''Two years ago, if you sold something at $3.5 million, the next listing in that building came at $4.2 million. Now it is more reasonable.''
 Across the state through the end of September, the real estate company Coldwell Banker has sold 1,222 condos worth a million dollars or more, said Clark W. Toole, who runs the company's operations in Florida. The average sale price is down less than half a percent from last year. 
 To the degree that the market has held up, it has been helped by eager foreigners, checkbooks in hand, who are still showing up and often paying cash. A survey last year by the National Association of Realtors found that the number of foreign buyers in Florida had dropped significantly from 2005. But of those who bought, 29 percent paid cash. Only 8 percent of domestic purchasers did. More than 10 percent of the foreigners bought homes for over $1 million. 
 The pattern of sales remains uneven, with evidence that some of the most exclusive places are having a harder time. On Fisher Island, the private island just off Miami Beach that has its own golf course, tennis courts and spa, business has slowed sharply, said Lars Ekdahl, who has worked as a real estate agent on the island for 13 years. 
 Right now, the island, which boasts Andre Agassi as a frequent visitor and where Oprah Winfrey once owned a home, has 96 of its 700 housing units for sale. At one point, the number offered was just 39.
 ''I didn't think it would affect us so much at Fisher Island,'' Mr. Ekdahl said, ''with the dollar so weak and the euro so strong.'' Only about half the island's residents are Americans. The cost of living on the island has risen because of dues and other expenses, and in a market in which buyers have more choice, they may be pickier. 
 Perhaps the starkest sign of a two-tier housing market is in Palm Beach. The island of Palm Beach itself has about 8,000 housing units. Leslie Evans, a local real estate lawyer, said that about 80 percent of sales there are cash deals and that most buyers are American. But just across the bridge in West Palm Beach, ''there are buildings with 200 units and 80 of them are for sale, and others where the building is nearing completion and sales will never close.''

HEADLINE: Homeownership Declines for Fourth Consecutive Quarter

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
(Bloomberg News) -- Homeownership in the United States dropped for a fourth consecutive quarter, the longest decline since at least 1981, suggesting that more Americans will miss their best chance of building wealth. 
 The proportion of households that own their residences fell to 68.1 percent in the July-September period, from 68.3 percent in the previous three months, according to a report Friday from the Census Bureau in Washington, whose comparable records go back to 1981. 
 The rate has been declining from a peak in 2004 that came after a decade of gains encouraged by easier lending standards and rising home purchases by immigrants and younger households.
 ''Owning a home in this country has been a principal source of wealth creation for low- and moderate-income people,'' said Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. ''In the absence of home equity, families will inevitably spend less.''
 Homeowners accumulate wealth faster than renters. Median net wealth for owners was $184,400 in 2004, compared with $4,000 for renters, according to Federal Reserve figures.
 The ownership rate reached a record 69.3 percent of households in 2004, up from 64 percent a decade earlier. With home prices soaring, net household wealth nearly doubled, to $51.8 trillion at the end of 2005 from $27.6 trillion in 1995, with real estate accounting for 47 percent of the change, according to the Federal Reserve data.
 A study released last month by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that as much as 70 percent of the increase in the aggregate homeownership rate over the decade was a result of the introduction of new mortgage products, some of which reduced down-payment requirements. 
 Demographics, including the rapidly growing immigrant population, accounted for up to 31 percent of the increase, the study said.
 In the last year, the proportion of American households that own their homes dropped by 0.8 percentage point, the biggest year-over-year decline since 1981-82.
 Lower ownership rates also could signal further declines in new-home sales that may extend the drag on growth from falling construction, said Jan Hatzius, the chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs.
 The Census Bureau report also found that a record 17.9 million American homes stood empty in the third quarter as lenders took possession of a growing number of properties in foreclosure.
 The figure is a 7.8 percent gain from a year ago, when 16.6 million properties were vacant, the Census Bureau said. About 2.07 million empty homes were for sale, compared with 1.94 million a year earlier, the report said.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths DRUCKER, BYRD

 BODY:
 DRUCKER--Byrd , 78, died peacefully on October 25 surrounded by his loving family in New York City. The beloved husband of Janet for 57 extraordinary and memorable years, he is also survived by his adoring children, Carol, William and his wife Rhonda, and his youngest daughter, Abby, as well as three amazing grandchildren, Elizabeth, Sarah Beth and Matthew. His older brothers, Joseph, Simon, and David Drucker predeceased him. 
He was especially devoted to his sister-inlaw, Anita Caminiti, who showered him with laughter, kindness and an abundance of Italian cuisine. He met Janet at 15 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where they were both raised, and their lives have been inextricably linked ever since. After enlisting in the U.S. Army at 17, he served as a paratrooper in World War II. A graduate of Boys High School in Brooklyn, with both a B.A. and an M.A. from Brooklyn College, he was a devoted teacher of economics and history for 35 years for the New York City Board of Education. An educational innovator, he developed an alternative school at Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, which prepared high-school graduates for immediate entry onto a career track. He was the Executive Director of Camp Louemma, part of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, in Glenwood, New Jersey, for 17 years. During this time, he mentored young people in the social work field and created a wonderful camping experience for thousands of New York City children, in the process forming life-long bonds with many of the campers. In 1976, Byrd, along with his wife, Janet, founded Drucker Antiques, which is now operated by their son, William. Their shared passion for art, antiques and design created a business that has cultivated a worldwide appreciation for Georg Jensen silver. His passion, knowledge and perseverance enabled his wife, Janet, to complete her labor of love, the authoritative monograph on Georg Jensen silver, ''Georg Jensen: A Traditional of Splendid Silver,'' now in its second edition. In their 60s, they embarked on a new adventure, and moved from their longtime home in Canarsie, Brooklyn, into Manhattan, where they truly felt like every day was a holiday. He enjoyed summering in the Adirondacks and East Hampton. A passionate New York Knicks fan, whether they won or lost, he was a gracious sportsman and an avid swimmer. Byrd will always be remembered for his humor, intelligence, curiosity, persistence, courage, kindness, wisdom, and his ability to savor every moment of joy. Family was most important to him, and in his mind, a man's wealth could be measured by his abundance of loving family and friends, and in this regard, he was the richest of men, and will be sorely missed. One of the greatest lessons he imparted to his children and grandchildren was that the only things that could limit them were their own dreams. A memorial service will be held, Sunday, October 28, at 11:45am at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, at Amsterdam Avenue.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Investigates Major Debt-Rating Agencies

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
The Connecticut attorney general opened an investigation yesterday into whether the various ratings agencies had improperly pressured issuers of commercial debt as a condition of doing business with them. 
 The investigation by the office of the state's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, signaled a widening scrutiny of the ratings industry, beyond its role in the credit crunch and subprime mortgage crisis. 
 Mr. Blumenthal said yesterday that his investigation was focused on whether the three largest ratings agencies, which dominate the market, had threatened to downgrade single issues of debt unless an issuer gave a single agency all of its business. 
 In a statement, he said that his investigation also concerned whether the ratings companies had engaged in anticompetitive practices by, among other things, offering discounts to debt issuers who gave all of their ratings business to one agency.
 The inquiry also revolves around complaints that the ratings companies would rank debt against an issuer's wishes, and then demand payment for the ranking. 
 Mr. Blumenthal's office said that it had issued subpoenas on Oct. 10 to the three largest agencies -- Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings Service.
 His investigation follows inquiries by the attorneys general in New York and Ohio, which are investigating whether the three ratings agencies improperly gave favorable marks to mortgage securities on the eve of the subprime crisis, during which their values plummeted. 
 Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission said that it was investigating whether investment banks exerted pressure upon the agencies to give favorable ratings to certain mortgage securities. 
 Investment banks and other financial institutions, which issue trillions of dollars in various types of debt for sale to investors, depend upon ratings from the agencies to sell their paper. The ratings rank creditworthiness and the ability of the issuer to repay investors. 
 ''The debt-rating industry is a highly concentrated market controlled by a handful of companies,'' Mr. Blumenthal's office said.
 ''Without a good credit rating, many loans cannot be made. My investigation seeks to determine whether credit-rating agencies may be exploiting their dominant position to unfairly raise prices or exclude competitors.''
 A spokesman for Standard & Poor's, which is part of the McGraw Hill Companies, said yesterday that it was responding to the subpoena. 
 A spokesman for Moody's, Tony Mirenda, said that ''we have received and anticipate receiving various governmental inquiries, and of course we will cooperate.''
 A spokesman for Fitch, James Jockle, said, ''We are cooperating with this investigation as with all other investigations.''

HEADLINE: Edwards Offers Savings Plan

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Former Senator John Edwards proposed yesterday that rules governing retirement savings be revised by creating new 401(k)-type accounts that employees could carry from job to job, and that the government match workers' contributions to the accounts, dollar for dollar, up to $500 a year. 
 Under his plan, workers would also have the option upon retirement to convert their savings to annuities that are sponsored by the government and administered at low fee.
 Mr. Edwards has outlined some of these provisions before, including his proposal for the $500 government match, through tax credits, to what he calls Get Ahead Accounts. The match would be intended to benefit middle-class employees, though the Edwards campaign has not specified an income cap.
 The senator discussed his plan yesterday in Des Moines, where, stumping for the Democratic presidential nomination, he also advocated measures to heighten corporate responsibility. He called for acting against what he called unfair levels of executive compensation, increasing corporate transparency and overhauling labor laws, among other things banning the permanent replacement of striking workers.
 ''Instead of protecting the compact of equal opportunity and shared prosperity, Washington protects corporate profits and hoards prosperity,'' he said. ''That is wrong, it is shameful, and it is bad for our economy to boot.''
 Mr. Edwards's proposals on the retirement front came two weeks after one rival for the nomination, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, proposed a retirement plan that would create 401(k)-style accounts with a dollar-for-dollar government match on the first $1,000 saved by workers earning up to $60,000 a year, with lesser matches for those earning more.

HEADLINE: Cheney Attacks Democratic Plan to Revamp Tax Code

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney on Friday joined a chorus of Republican opposition to a sweeping overhaul of the tax code proposed by the House's leading Democratic tax writer. 
 The Republican response to the proposal by Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, underscored the hardening positions of the two parties on taxes as they head into the 2008 elections.
 In a television interview, Mr. Cheney said Mr. Rangel's proposal would reverse the Bush administration's tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, one of the president's signature accomplishments and one the vice president credited with ''driving this economy.'' 
 ''There is a fundamental difference between the parties in terms of how we look at the world with respect to tax policy,'' Mr. Cheney said in an interview on CNBC.
 Mr. Rangel's proposal, unveiled on Thursday, would cut taxes on married couples with annual incomes below $200,000 but raise taxes of most people earning more. It would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which was created to prevent the rich from avoiding paying any taxes but could this year affect millions of families with incomes as low as $50,000; it would replace the lost revenue with a 4 percent to 4.6 percent surcharge on the top 10 percent of taxpayers.
 Mr. Rangel, who previously called his proposal the ''mother of all tax reforms,'' characterized it as the broadest reform of tax policy since the overhaul in 1986 under President Ronald Reagan. Republicans in Congress, however, swiftly recast it as the ''mother of all tax hikes,'' even though Mr. Rangel said it was intended to be revenue neutral.
 The proposal has little chance of passing and surviving a presidential veto, as Mr. Cheney made clear. Some action, however, is expected on the alternative minimum tax and other tax proposals in the months ahead, and the fierce reactions set the stage for a debate that will only intensify as the 2008 election heralds the end of the Bush administration and the beginning of the next. 
 ''Charlie Rangel's mother of all tax hikes is really the vision, I believe, that Nancy Pelosi and others have for the direction this country ought to go in over the next decade or so,'' Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, said on Thursday, referring to the House speaker. ''And I think what you're hearing from all of us, it's a very frightening vision.''
 Mr. Cheney, when asked, welcomed one part of Mr. Rangel's proposal: a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 30.5 percent from 35 percent. But he sharply criticized higher rates on capital gains, dividends and the highest incomes.
 ''He's doing any awful lot of damage in the name of what he describes as tax reform,'' Mr. Cheney said. 
 Mr. Cheney also took issue with criticism of the state of the economy from Democratic presidential candidates, especially Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York. ''And the suggestion that somehow it's hard times out there, I just think is a misstatement,'' he said.
 He also addressed the recent disclosure that he and another Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, shared an ancestral link.
 Referring to Mr. Obama as Cousin Barack, Mr. Cheney said he had not discussed the link with the senator.
 ''Well, I didn't know whether that would help or hurt him,'' he said, laughing, ''so I thought I'd probably stay away from him. 
 ''But apparently we do have a common ancestor, about eight or nine generations back.''

HEADLINE: That Old Time Religion

 BODY:
President Bush was back in campaign mode this week, resurrecting two tried-and-true red-meat issues to rally the cadres in his dispirited Republican Party -- fervent supporters of missile defense and of squeezing Fidel Castro's Cuba. Seven years in the White House have done nothing to change his views. Campaigning now for his legacy, he is still wrong on both issues. 
 Mr. Bush has brought his 1960s Cuba policy into the Internet age by allowing private organizations to send computers to Cuban youths -- if the government does not control their use. That is unlikely. And he proposed an international fund to provide grants, loans and debt relief to the Cuban government -- but only after it allows free speech and open elections. Until then, Mr. Bush will cling stubbornly to the half-century-old economic embargo that has failed to unseat Mr. Castro while giving him an ever ready excuse for his government's economic failings and repression. 
 No one knows what will happen when Mr. Castro, who is ailing, dies. The United States is denying itself any chance to help influence Cuba's future by sticking to the failed policies of the past. Its overriding interest should be in a peaceful transition to the democratic and economically dynamic society that Cubans have dreamed of for decades. 
 Easing the embargo could strengthen Cuba's battered middle class and help it play a more active role in whatever comes next. Mr. Bush's call for the Cuban people to rise up is more likely to persuade the government's supporters -- the only ones with guns -- to hang on even more stubbornly or brutally.
 Mr. Bush's blind faith in missile defense is equally disquieting. The president has already wasted billions on a small and unproven system in Alaska. Now he wants to build one in Europe to guard against a possible attack on American allies by Iran. 
 Those allies are far less certain that Iran poses a near-term ballistic missile threat, and far less eager than Mr. Bush to anger the Russians, who fiercely oppose the system. Moscow, as ever, is being disingenuous. But Mr. Bush should be looking for ways to persuade Russia to increase pressure on Iran rather than giving it more excuses not to. 
 Mr. Bush and his cadre may be stuck in the past. But Congress does not have to be. It should restrain even more than it has Mr. Bush's exorbitant missile defense spending.
 Congress and the Democratic candidates for president should also find a way to challenge Mr. Bush's Cuba policies. The issue has not gotten much attention in the campaign, although Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico has said he would reassess the trade embargo in exchange for the release of all political prisoners and ''positive steps'' toward democratic freedoms. Given Florida's electoral clout, bold initiatives may be too much to expect in an election year -- except that Mr. Castro's health may not wait. The White House may thrive on red meat; the voters shouldn't have to.

HEADLINE: DANCE Back to the Days of Painting With Dancing Feet

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

 BODY:
To hear the choreographer Deborah Hay talk, there is no overstating the connection between visual art and dance in New York in the 1960s, when the Judson Dance Theater movement was radically questioning the nature of performance.
 ''Year after year after year you would follow the openings, and the growth of an artist,'' she recalled, ticking off names like Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt and Robert Morris. ''I could feel myself being altered chemically by what it was that I was looking at.''
New Yorkers can see the results on Nov. 13, when a video of two of Ms. Hay's pioneering 1968 dances will be shown for the first time during Performa 07, the second biennial festival of new visual art performance, which opens today. Performa seeks to rekindle connections between the arts through discussions, screenings and new work. 
 Today's New York scene, in which the various art worlds and their audiences have largely retreated to their own corners, makes Ms. Hay's experience -- which was just as powerful for many visual artists -- sound like an impossible utopia. 
 ''There seems to be little time spent either studying or taking in things that might be just to the left or the right of your primary interest,'' said Debra Singer, the Kitchen's executive director and chief curator. ''In New York, we're so blessed with so much that you can indulge your primary passion.'' She added, ''At the artist and audience level, almost ironically, it can perpetuate a kind of parochialism.''
 Yet the boundaries keep blurring. Ann Liv Young, a dancer by training, creates raunchy hybrids of musical theater, movement and text, controlling all aspects of her visually intricate spectacles. Visual artists employ dancers in their installations, and artists like Miranda July tackle everything from feature films to live action-video performances.
 At its best, this fearless do-it-yourself aesthetic, which exists for reasons both artistic and economic, leads to wonderfully rich, unmediated worlds in which artists' ideas drive new creations. A recent example is Chase Granoff's and Jon Moniaci's ''Boredom!!! (as an amplifier)'' in May at the Chocolate Factory in Long Island City, Queens. Mr. Granoff, trained as a dancer and not as a musician, participated heavily in the live score.
 The Chocolate Factory's artistic director, Brian Rogers, recalled that Mr. Granoff had taken heat from musicians for having the nerve to play guitar. For me, his consciously naive relationship to the instrument held much charm at a time when specialized, insider knowledge often obscures rather than enables artistic meaning. But I understand the resentment, having suffered through incredibly unsophisticated movement in gallery installations and untold dances employing video art that looked as if it had been made in 20 minutes on someone's home computer -- and not in a good way.
 A central Performa mission is to upend today's parochialism -- as the festival's founder, RoseLee Goldberg, put it, ''to open the doors and windows between the dance and art world, to find the conceptual underpinnings where there could be a crossover.''
 ''How come this conversation was so profound and rich in the '60s and '70s?'' she added. ''Can we reinstigate that?''
 There are obvious barriers, including visual art's astounding economic trajectory in the last few decades, while dance has remained among the have-nots of the arts. Still, though contemporary choreographers dismiss the notion, there are striking parallels between their concerns and those of the Judson era.
 Much of today's best work is re-examining everything about performance. Just what is this pact that artists and audiences make? What is valuable about it? What are our expectations regarding virtuosity, our desires to be entertained? It is a quieter re-evaluation than what occurred during the'60s and '70s, which came complete with manifestoes, but the sense of a restless repositioning against an insular tradition is similarly vibrant.
 This repositioning extends to language. Contemporary choreographers frequently express dissatisfaction with the terms choreography and dance, and the expectations they prompt. 
 ''The word doesn't somehow acknowledge the different strategies people are using to think about or create their work,'' Miguel Gutierrez explained, referring to choreography. ''If 'choreography' is simply about the arrangement of bodies in graphic space, then no, this doesn't adequately describe what I am interested in.''
 These categories seem particularly inadequate for performers in their 20s and early 30s, people like Mr. Granoff, Ms. Young or Levi Gonzalez -- a new generation creating work without having served a long apprenticeship in a dance company, and distinctly uninterested in honing a specific movement technique. While Ms. Young, who spurns almost all art (and has been criticized for unknowingly recycling outdated theatrical ideas), is an extreme case, Mr. Gonzalez reflects a prevalent sensibility when he describes feeling more kinship with contemporary visual art and film than with conventional dance practices. 
 ''Experimental dance doesn't have this baggage of a technique,'' he said. ''There's something about the practice of making dance that seems to me really fluid in terms of what materials you can attach it to.''
 The danger, of course, is in getting lost in all this freedom. But that is also the excitement -- for the makers, and for those watching. 
 Performa 07 continues through Nov. 20 at various sites. Full schedule: (212) 366-5700, 07.performa-arts.org.

RIVAL BIDS FOR BRITISH INSURER A bidding contest began yesterday for the British insurer Resolution as a sweetened $10.4 billion offer from the Pearl Group threatened a deal just announced by Resolution and Standard Life. Pearl bolstered its position by snapping up a bigger stake in Resolution, which specializes in so-called zombie funds, or life insurance policies closed to new business.
 The new Pearl offer values Resolution at around $:5.1 billion, just above the $:4.9 billion ($10 billion) bid from Standard Life that Resolution recommended to shareholders earlier in the day. Resolution shares jumped 2.4 percent as analysts speculated that the bidding showdown had just begun. (AP) 
OPERATING PROFIT UP AT NISSAN Nissan Motor bolstered operating profit by the most in at least three years after increasing sales in Russia, China and the Middle East. Operating profit rose 12 percent to 218.7 billion yen ($1.9 billion) in the fiscal second quarter, the company said yesterday.
 Sales rose 13 percent, to 2.62 trillion yen. Net income fell 27 percent after gains from asset sales and tax breaks in the year-ago period. The chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, above, turned to developing economies after lower domestic demand forced the carmaker to cut its earnings forecast last year. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 BANK WEIGHS RESCUE PLANDeutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, is considering whether to join an $80 billion plan backed by the United States Treasury to revive the commercial paper market, its chief executive, Josef Ackermann, said. ''We're currently studying it and we're in a constructive dialogue with the American banks as well as American authorities,'' Mr. Ackermann said in Frankfurt. 
 In talks brokered by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, the three biggest American banks, agreed on Oct. 15 to start a fund that would buy assets from distressed structured investment vehicles, or SIVs. Investors are refusing to buy commercial paper -- loans due in 270 days or less -- from the SIVs because they are concerned about the value of the mortgage securities, asset- backed debt and finance company bonds they own. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 SENTENCE IN STOCK FRAUD An Atlanta lawyer convicted of securities fraud was sentenced yesterday to eight years and a month in prison by a judge who described the lawyer as a ''predator on innocent investors.'' Judge William H. Pauley III of Federal District Court also ordered the man, Ulysses Thomas Ware, 47, to forfeit $228,000 and fined him $25,000 after a jury in Manhattan convicted him of conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud and securities fraud.
 A jury convicted Mr. Ware in April of duping investors in 2001 and 2002 through a ''pump and dump'' scheme of sending false press releases over the Internet that drove up the value of companies that had paid him in stock for consulting and financial advice. (AP) INQUIRY INTO DRUG MAKER ENDSKing Pharmaceuticals said yesterday that federal securities regulators had completed an investigation into its underpayments to government pricing programs and did not intend to recommend any enforcement action.
 King said in 2003 that it owed Medicaid and other government health programs $46.5 million in unpaid drug rebates, and set aside $65 million in the second quarter of 2004 to cover fines and other costs related to the inquiries. The company had already reserved $65.4 million to cover estimated underpayments to Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for the poor. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 ALLTEL DEAL APPROVED Federal communications regulators gave approval yesterday for private equity investors to acquire the wireless provider Alltel. The Federal Communications Commission voted to give its consent to the deal after concluding it would not be anticompetitive.
 Alltel, which has about 12 million subscribers, agreed in May to be bought for about $25 billion. The company said in a statement that it expected the deal, with TPG Capital and GS Capital Partners, to close before Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 22. (REUTERS)
 VONAGE EXECUTIVE QUITS Timothy G. Smith, a Vonage Holdings executive, has resigned, becoming the fourth top manager to leave the money-losing Internet phone company this year. Mr, Smith, head of the Vonage Network unit, stepped down on Oct. 22, the company, based in Holmdel, N.J., said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing yesterday.
 Vonage, which appointed Mr. Smith as president of the unit in June 2006, shook up management this year after patent lawsuits sent the company's stock price plummeting. Mr. Smith joined Vonage in 2005 after working at Sun Microsystems, UUNET Technologies and Wayport. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 CHINESE BANK REPORTS PROFIT The China Construction Bank, the world's second-largest bank by value after Citigroup, reported a third-quarter profit of 22.8 billion yuan ($3 billion).
 Earnings were 0.1 yuan a share, the company, based in Beijing, said in a release to Shanghai's stock exchange yesterday. It did not give comparative figures. Chinese banks, flush with cash from selling $63 billion of shares since 2005, extended 17 percent more loans in the first nine months from a year earlier, and fees from selling mutual funds have soared.

SECTION: Section AU; Column 0; Automobiles; TOKYO MOTOR SHOW; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 792 words

HEADLINE: Go Green, Someday. For Now, Go Fast.

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

DATELINE: CHIBA, Japan 

 BODY:
 THE Tokyo Motor Show, which opened to the public in this suburban city on Saturday and runs through Nov. 11, is a showcase of the automobile industry's split personality. The industry indeed seems increasingly to be of two minds, and the split between them is becoming more like a fracture.
 On the one hand, the Tokyo show offers the requisite number of socially responsible hybrid concept cars, alternative-fuel propulsion systems and traffic-congestion-relieving technologies. On the other, there is a bigger collection of the newest engine-revving, pollutant-belching, tire-smoking supercars. Can this house, so divided, continue to stand? 
 The supercars seem to be taking the fast lane to dealer showrooms. That certainly is true of the unquestioned star of the show, the new Nissan GT-R sport coupe. The GT-R, redesigned for the first time in five years, goes on sale in Japan in December and for the first time in the United States and Europe next summer. The GT-R is one of Japan's truly legendary performance cars, much more respected than Nissan's Z sports cars.
 The GT-R, which first appeared here in 1969, is the very antithesis of social responsibility. This newest version is equipped with a 3.8-liter V-6 with twin turbochargers and will produce 480 horsepower and 434 pound-feet of torque. The real performance capabilities of this engine originally designed for racing are probably much higher. Knowing this, Nissan said it had gone to great lengths to make the car's engine control unit tamperproof to discourage freelance engine hot-rodding. (Engine tuners tend to wink when they hear this.)
 The specter of a new GT-R was enough to scare off a couple of important competitors. Toyota had been expected to unveil a closer-to-production version of its 500-horsepower Lexus LF-A supercar concept, but only the unchanged model introduced last January at the Detroit auto show was here. And the latest Acura supercar concept, a likely precursor of the next NSX, was a no-show.
 Not every hot rod manufacturer was cowed by the GT-R juggernaut. Mitsubishi went ahead and introduced its next Lancer Evolution, the X (as in 10), and its rally rival Subaru showed a new WRX STI. Both of these 300-horsepower rockets, based on plebeian four-door compact sedans, have sleeker styling than previous models.
 Toyota did show its sleek FT-HS sports car concept, which produces about 400 horsepower with a hybrid gas-electric powertrain. But if the FT-HS or anything like it ever makes it to production -- perhaps as the 2010 Supra -- don't expect to see the hybrid part of its propulsion system.
 The FT-HS provides a segue, if an awkward one, to the opposite end of the social responsibility scale here. This is where each of the major Japanese manufacturers is showing off its green credentials with at least one new hybrid or other type of ''sustainable mobility'' vehicle.
 Mazda is presenting a Premacy minivan (Mazda 5 in the United States) with a rotary engine that could, if it's produced, run on gasoline or hydrogen with an assist from an electric motor. The Premacy Hydrogen RE is part of Mazda's Sustainable Zoom-Zoom project.
 Likewise for Mitsubishi, which for several years has been showing versions of a microcar powered by electric motors in each wheel. It never seems to evolve much closer to production, but the latest version being shown here is the i MiEV. It is cute enough in a quirky way to pique interest. 
 Much better looking is Honda's CR-Z hybrid concept, a sports-oriented coupe that probably does not offer clues about Honda's next major hybrid production vehicle, which is promised for 2009. In automotive terms, 2009 is nearly upon us and there is still no sign of that hybrid. But there was some news here about it: When it arrives, the hybrid will be smaller than a Civic, but ''big enough for a family,'' said Sage Marie, a spokesman for American Honda.. 
 It will be Honda's first globally sold gas-electric hybrid, and Honda said it hoped the car would be the volume leader, with 200,000 worldwide sales a year. With those lofty sales goals, it might be wise to expect the new Honda hybrid to be the auto industry's next fuel-economy champ. Honda also announced that it has a goal of 500,000 yearly combined sales of all its hybrid models.
 Honda showed its FCX fuel-cell vehicle here, but said a significantly different, nearly production-ready version would be introduced at next month's Los Angeles auto show.
 While on the subject of high-mileage hybrids, the completely redesigned 2009 Toyota Prius hybrid was also a no-show here. This is significant for the Japanese audience because it means the new Prius will probably be introduced at an American auto show. The next Tokyo show is not until 2009.

HEADLINE: Worrying About the Public Worrying

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
In a typical year, lightning kills about 47 people in the United States, and venomous animals and plants, 94. 
 Last year, passengers flew 760 million times on airline flights in the United States, with just one death, a mechanic who fell while trying to close the door of a parked Boeing 737. 
 Looking at those numbers, flying seems pretty safe. Make that, very safe.
 So why won't the National Aeronautics and Safety Administration release the results of a survey of 8,000 commercial pilots that sought to track safety problems and determine if they were worsening?
 The agency says it doesn't want to scare people (as if that explanation won't scare them).
 The Associated Press had sought the data under the Freedom of Information Act. In refusing to turn it over, NASA told The Associated Press that releasing the data ''could materially affect the public confidence in, and the commercial welfare of, the air carriers and general aviation companies whose pilots participated in the survey.''
 NASA's response is nothing new for the federal government, which has traditionally said as little as possible about the safety of individual airports or airlines, even when the news is good.
 The F.A.A. was founded in part to promote aviation, though in 1996, Congress removed that mission because it conflicted with the agency's role as a regulator. Even so, that tension remains in cases where data might raise public apprehension about air travel.
 Economists have been able to quantify that fear. After Pan Am 103 was bombed over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, trans-Atlantic passenger traffic fell by 20 percent in the next year.
 That figure was cited in a risk/benefit analysis published by the F.A.A. in July 2001 justifying a new security rule. The benefit of keeping bombs off airplanes, the agency said then, was not only that a plane and its passengers would be saved, but also that travelers would not be frightened into staying home. The F.A.A. called it ''the known reaction of Americans to any aircraft operator disaster.''
 Perhaps with that in mind, the F.A.A. plans to change the way it compiles statistics on aviation-related deaths. Only passengers and members of the crew will be counted. Mechanics have been eliminated from the tabulation, which should paint a safer picture of the industry. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 4, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about a survey of commercial pilots designed to track safety problems misidentified the federal agency that conducted the study. It was the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

HEADLINE: Shinnecocks Face New Challenges in Racetrack Bid

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 After New York State officials asked for bids to operate video-lottery terminals at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens, proposals came in this month from two companies that operate racetracks and three American Indian casino owners.
 The sixth bidder was the Shinnecock Indian Nation, which operates neither casinos nor racetracks, but a small cluster of smoke shops here on its reservation on the East End of Long Island.
 The bid was backed by Gateway Casino Resorts, a Detroit-based casino development company operated by Marian Ilitch, part owner of the Detroit Red Wings and Tigers and the Little Caesars Pizza chain. 
 The Shinnecocks' proposal seemed audacious: a casino with 500,000 square feet of gambling space, hundreds of gaming and card tables, more than 10,000 slot machines and a 1,200-room hotel. The estimated annual revenue would be $2.1 billion.
 But to Lance A. Gumbs, a tribe trustee, the audacity does not lie with the Shinnecocks, who say the tribe has been insulted for years by state and federal officials.
 To Mr. Gumbs, it was audacious for state officials to consider bids for Aqueduct from out-of-state tribes and to belittle the Shinnecocks' offer.
 ''They're not taking us seriously, but sooner or later, they're going to have to take us seriously,'' said Mr. Gumbs recently at his shop, the Shinnecock Indian Outpost, which sells discounted cigarettes.
 It was audacious, he said, when the state tried to ban the sale of tax-free cigarettes at reservation shops, which is the economic engine of a tribe with more than half its families living below the federal poverty level.
 And, he said, there is the audacity of the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, which does not formally recognize the Shinnecocks as a tribe, a status needed to open a casino.
 Mr. Gumbs is no less angered by Southampton officials, who, he said, run their wealthy town on former Shinnecock land yet begrudge the tribe's proposal for a 60,000-square-foot casino there.
 In April, Mr. Gumbs took the step of calling in the state police to clean up the tribe's drug problem, resulting in a sweep that snared his own son.
 He said that the drug problem came from a lack of opportunity in a tribe stripped of its educational and cultural programs, and that a casino was the only viable way to reverse the fortunes of the reservation and attain self-reliance. ''We feel we are already federally recognized,'' he said. ''One way or another, we know it's going to happen.''
 New York State has regarded the Shinnecocks as a tribe for generations, and a federal judge ruled in 2005 that it should be granted recognition. Mr. Gumbs said the tribe is gathering documents to prove it has been federally recognized, including a letter found last month in a New York Public Library archive, sent by a representative from the Department of the Interior in 1914, identifying local Indian tribes.
 But the Shinnecocks have to wait behind eight other tribes for review by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which has said there is little chance of recognition before 2014.
 For now, said Paul Larrabee, a spokesman for Gov. Eliot Spitzer, ''The state cannot deal with the issue of a casino until their status is clarified by the courts.''
 The tribe has elected leaders every April since 1790, and Mr. Gumbs -- who compares himself to Moses wandering with a lost tribe for decades -- relishes his position. Their land has steadily shrunk to the 1,200-acre reservation that is now home to about half of the 1,300 tribal members.
 Despite the financial backing, critics have called the Aqueduct bid a publicity stunt intended to gain leverage for the tribe's longer range plan to build a casino in the Hamptons, which Southampton officials have taken seriously enough to wage a costly battle against in federal court.
 In the summer of 2003, Southampton got word that a bulldozer had begun clearing a 79-acre parcel of tribal land in Hampton Bays. With no fanfare or permission, the tribe had begun breaking ground on a casino on the longstanding tribal firewood-gathering site known as Westwood. A court order halted work, and the two sides began a protracted battle in federal court in Central Islip, dredging up case law going back more than four centuries. A decision is pending. The 1,000 exhibits included maps, documents and deeds from the 1600s, and cited a land sale by Queen Elizabeth I.
 The tribe called Westwood sovereign territory, exempt from town regulations and zoning. Southampton countered that aboriginal rights had lapsed and that the parcel was no longer Indian country, making it subject to local zoning laws prohibiting casinos and other major commercial projects in the residential area. 
 Michael S. Cohen, a lawyer for the town, said a casino in Westwood would cause traffic and environmental problems. He said he thought the plan for Aqueduct would draw similar complaints.
 For his part, Mr. Gumbs said he has been frustrated at every turn: an oyster hatchery was foiled by brown tide; plans to build windmills to generate electricity received no offers for financing; a proposal to build cell towers never got off the ground, and a plan for a recycling depot was rejected because of concerns about truck traffic.
 Profits from a Queens casino, which could begin as a slots parlor and expand once government approval comes, would revitalize the tribe, Mr. Gumbs said, and provide the reservation with educational and cultural programs, housing, senior and youth services and health care.
 ''I laugh when I hear people say, 'Oh, they'll be a bunch of rich Indians,''' Mr. Gumbs said. ''It's not like each member will be handed a million dollars, but yes, people will get jobs. Yes, we will be able to educate our kids and address our health needs and take care of our land and our seniors, and do the thing every civilized society is able to do.''

HEADLINE: A War On Every Screen

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
THERE is a lot in Brian De Palma's new movie, ''Redacted,'' that audiences are likely to find shocking and painful to watch. An Iraqi teenager is raped and then killed, along with her family, by American servicemen. An improvised bomb blows one character to pieces, and another soldier is beheaded by insurgents. But the most disturbing images come at the end, after the lightly fictionalized atrocities are over. At that point the film's fake-documentary conceit gives way to the genuine article as the screen fills with photographs of dead and maimed -- and very real -- Iraqis.
 Even though ''Redacted'' will not open until Nov. 16, these pictures have already been the subject of intense argument, some of it between Mr. De Palma and Magnolia Pictures, the film's distributor. Because the eyes and some other facial features of the people in the photographs have been blacked out, Mr. De Palma has complained that his film was itself subjected to redaction, its confrontational impact blunted. Magnolia says the modification of the photographs arose from straightforward legal considerations having to do with the risk of showing the faces of real people without permission. 
 This explanation hardly settles the aesthetic and ethical questions raised by the intrusion of reality into a cinematic fiction. The sickening, saddening power of the photographs is undeniable. But what beyond that stark, literal reminder of horrors outside the movie theater is their purpose, their relevance? What, in the context of a moviegoer's expectations and experience, do they mean? These are questions that reverberate far beyond those pictures, and beyond ''Redacted.'' They can also be addressed to a growing roster of movies that try, in different styles and with varying degrees of success, to bring the conventions of cinematic storytelling into contact with the truth of the war. Not just the conflict in Iraq, but also the larger, more nebulous struggle -- War on terror? Clash of civilizations? Response to 9/11? Imperial overreach? -- of which it is part. 
 The season started with ''In the Valley of Elah,'' a somber thriller about Iraq, and ''The Kingdom,'' a frenetic thriller about Saudi Arabia. ''Rendition,'' a drama about the kidnapping and brutal interrogation, under C.I.A. auspices, of an innocent Egyptian-born resident of Chicago, opened Oct. 19. Along with ''Redacted'' November will bring Robert Redford's ''Lions for Lambs,'' in which two soldiers in Afghanistan fight to survive while, stateside, a professor argues with a student about civic engagement, and a senator lectures a journalist on military strategy. And then, in time for the holidays, come ''Grace Is Gone'' with John Cusack as a military husband who must tell his two daughters that their mother has been killed in Iraq; ''The Kite Runner,'' based on Khaled Hosseini's best seller about life under the Taliban in Afghanistan; and ''Charlie Wilson's War,'' about American involvement in an earlier phase of that country's painful history.
 This is just a partial list, omitting documentaries and some smaller, independent films. But the upshot is clear: Jihad; torture; suicide bombings; terrible things done by and to American soldiers; official secrets and government lies; the failures and responsibilities of journalists, politicians, law enforcement officials and ordinary citizens in the face of terror -- such matters will be hard to avoid in movie theaters between now and Christmas. 
 Except, of course, that the public may well succeed in avoiding them. Even the most politically engaged among us may pause over the movie listings and ask the question that comes up in those last moments of ''Redacted'': Do I really need to see this? And soft box office returns -- already the fate of ''In the Valley of Elah'' and ''Rendition'' -- are likely to help solidify the emerging conventional wisdom that we don't. Public indifference, in turn, may bolster the ideologically convenient notion that Hollywood is out of touch with the American people, and also the economically convenient idea that people go to the movies to escape the problems of the world rather than to confront them.
 All of which may be true, at least partly. According to polls, a majority of the population is unhappy with American foreign policy under the Bush administration, in particular with the war in Iraq. It may be that this opposition finds its truest expression in the wish that the whole thing would just go away, rather than in an appetite for critical films. It may also be that even the most zealous opponents of the president and his policies don't want to be preached at when they go to the movies. 
 When filmmakers leave such touchy, serious political issues alone they tend to be scolded for complacency or cowardice. But to describe even a movie as angry and confrontational as ''Redacted'' as an exercise in finger-wagging or sloganeering is to miss the point. What is notable about this new crop of war movies is not their earnestness or their didacticism -- traits many of them undoubtedly display -- but rather their determination to embrace confusion, complexity and ambiguity.
 ''Redacted'' itself seems less interested in making a single argument than in staging a series of angry, unpredictable and sometimes incoherent debates between the soldiers. You hear a lot of heated, pointed arguing in ''Rendition'' and ''Lions for Lambs'' too. And while it is clearly not the intention of those films to be neutral or evenhanded -- ''Rendition'' is as unmistakably anti-torture as ''Lions'' is opposed to military adventurism -- they try to give a fair hearing to other points of view.
 In ''Rendition'' a high-ranking C.I.A. official played by Meryl Streep lectures a young Senate aide on the strategic necessity and moral defensibility of secret prisons and harsh interrogation methods. Not torture, since, as she says, ''the United States does not torture,'' an almost verbatim rendition of the real-world administration line. Nor does the steadfast, clear-sighted talk of victory offered by Senator Jasper Irving, Tom Cruise's character in ''Lions for Lambs,'' sound terribly exaggerated. His interlocutor, a journalist played by Ms. Streep, must fight to hold on to her professional skepticism, a fight that she is ashamed of having lost when the case for the Iraq war was being made.
 Senator Irving, by the way, is a Republican, with pictures of George W. Bush prominently displayed in his office. This may not sound surprising, but in the movies it is something of an anomaly. A visitor from outer space who tried to understand the American system from recent American cinema would learn something about the institutional tensions between, say, the F.B.I. and the State Department or the C.I.A. and the legislative branch, but not necessarily about the two parties whose rivalry is surely among the system's most salient real-life feature. 
 The only real politician whose name is mentioned in ''Rendition,'' for example, is Bill Clinton, under whose watch the practice that gives the movie its title got started. This bit of accurate historical background is followed by the observation that, ''after 9/11'' the policy of snatching up suspected terrorists and sending them overseas for interrogation intensified. But the leaders who may have been responsible for this shift -- did it just happen, like a change in the weather? -- are left unnamed, like the North African country where the interrogation takes place.
 The vocabulary most of us have acquired over the past six years is heavily edited for entertainment purposes. While there may be an anti-Bush agenda in ''Redacted,'' ''Rendition,'' ''Lions for Lambs'' and ''In the Valley of Elah,'' the president's name is barely uttered. Nor are others, like Rumsfeld, Cheney, Gonzales, bin Laden, Hussein and Musharraf.
 I'm not suggesting that filmmakers are obligated to lay out a factual bill of particulars. Realism is a loose cloak, not a suit of armor. And facts are what documentaries are for, at least documentaries like Charles Ferguson's ''No End in Sight,'' which came out last summer and painstakingly reconstructed the fateful decisions made in Washington and Baghdad in the early months of the American occupation. 
 There are other stories to tell and other ways to tell them, and Hollywood, in spite of its reputation for liberal bias, does not like to risk alienating potential ticket buyers by taking sides. This fear may be misplaced, since the highest-grossing Iraq-related movie released is also among the most polemical, Michael Moore's ''Fahrenheit 9/11.'' But it is remarkable that nondocumentary filmmakers consistently draw the boundary between fact and fiction in such a way that the most vexed political event of our time has its political meaning blunted. 
 Instead the movies supply emotion, sentiment, metaphor and abstraction. Even those bloody Iraqis at the end of ''Redacted'' function as symbols, since we know nothing about who they were or how they died. In other Iraq movies, including quite a few documentaries, the local population is almost entirely invisible. Films set in other contemporary war zones -- Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, wherever ''Rendition'' is supposed to take place -- manage to include more Arab and Muslim characters, but their function tends to be symbolic as well.
 And the final image of ''In the Valley of Elah'' -- an American flag flying upside down -- is, similarly, both disturbing and vague. It is a sign of danger and distress, and it brings home the grief and confusion that have haunted the film's main character, a retired army officer played by Tommy Lee Jones whose son has gone AWOL shortly after returning from Iraq. 
 The grief and confusion are left hanging like that flag, and like the feelings of sorrow, anger and impatience that linger at the end of ''Lions for Lambs,'' ''Redacted'' and the others. What is missing in nearly every case is a sense of catharsis or illumination. This is hardly the fault of the filmmakers. Disorientation, ambivalence, a lack of clarity -- these are surely part of the collective experience they are trying to examine. How can you bring an individual story to a satisfying conclusion when nobody has any idea what the end of the larger story will look like? 
 During World War II Hollywood churned out combat pictures and home-front melodramas with the speed and efficiency that characterized so much wartime production. Those movies reflected a consensus that it was also their purpose to promote. The best of them were more than simple propaganda, but they tended to share a sense of clarity and purpose in their narrative structure as well as in their themes. Even before the war was over, its desired outcome -- the defeat of the Nazis, the rolling back of the Japanese empire -- could be prefigured in microcosm. The resistance fighters would be freed; the bad guys would receive their comeuppance; the strategic spot named in the title (''Objective: Burma,'' ''Wake Island'') would be captured or heroically defended.
 And the Vietnam movies that came after the end of that war could at least rely on a shared knowledge of how the larger story ended, a knowledge that is implicit in the shape of the smaller stories they tell. Their politics range from the wounded liberalism of ''Coming Home'' and ''Platoon'' to the wounded conservatism of ''The Deer Hunter'' and ''Rambo,'' but they nonetheless agree that the wounds are there, to be healed, avenged or perhaps reopened. 
 But how do you end a movie about the war in Iraq or about the war on terror? Is it possible to picture victory -- concretely, in visual and narrative detail? Is it possible to imagine defeat? To tell the difference? Where will we find the sweet relief or bitter catharsis we expect from movies? 
 We have been told from the start, by both the administration and its critics, that this will be a long, complicated, episodic fight. And so attempts to make sense of it piecemeal and in medias res, in discrete narratives with beginnings and ends, are likely to feel incomplete and unsatisfying.
 The exception, so far, is ''The Kingdom,'' but not because it offers deeper political insights or greater realism than the other films. On the contrary. It is, without pretense or apology, a genre movie, an action-revenge fantasy in which four tough Americans investigate a crime and collect some payback. They are identified as F.B.I. agents, but really the four are a team of superheroes who take out scores of jihadis and (sorry about the spoiler) return home in triumph. But not quite; at the very end we hear the chief terrorist, as he draws his last breath, promise another round of vengeance. A sequel. 
 And this may be the lesson that filmmakers need to absorb as they think about how to deal with the current war. It's not a melodrama or a whodunit or even a lavish epic. It's a franchise.

HEADLINE: Did We Do That?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
 Why do I feel like I began my reporting career 30 years ago listening to the BBC World Service and I'm going to end it glued to the Weather Channel? 
 I flew into Los Angeles last Monday -- right through a gray-brown cloud of smoke from the forest fires burning in the hills east of the city. I couldn't actually see the fires from the air, only the smoke billowing out of mountain caverns, like so many smoldering volcanoes. There was something wild and prehistoric about it. It looked like either the end of the world or the beginning. As I watched from the plane window, I thought to myself, ''I've never seen that before.''
 I had had a similar thought a day earlier, playing golf in high-70s weather in Washington, D.C., in late October. Because of the warm weather, the leaves had barely changed to fall colors. I've never seen that before. 
 One should never extrapolate about climate change from any single weather event or season, but it does seem that we keep having more and more weather events and seasons that are modified with the words ''since records have been kept'' -- as in the Los Angeles Times fire report on Monday, which noted that forecasters from the National Weather Service ''couldn't recall such intense winds in Southern California,'' a region that meteorologists said was ''already dealing with the driest year on record.''
 So a question has started gnawing at us as we observe events like Katrina and the California wildfires. I asked my friend Nate Lewis, an energy chemist at the California Institute of Technology, what is that question? He thought for a moment and answered: ''Did we do that?''
 Is man's cumulative impact on the climate now as responsible for the weather as Mother Nature herself? ''That is the question Katrina really introduced for the first time -- the sense that soon, if not already, what we used to call acts of God are really acts of man,'' Professor Lewis said.
 We may have introduced enough of man's economic activities -- enough CO2 emissions -- into Mother Nature's operating system that we cannot determine anymore where she stopped and we started. As Professor Lewis would say: Did we make it hot or did she make it hot? Did we make that drought or did she make that drought? We don't know anymore. 
 But we do know that the Weather Channel is slowly morphing into the news channel. Local news at 10 p.m. used to be titled, ''News, weather and sports.'' I fear that for our kids it's going to be, ''Weather, other news and sports.''
 To probe this shift, I called Dr. Heidi Cullen, the climate expert at the Weather Channel and a scientist formerly with the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
 ''One thing people always loved about the Weather Channel was that it was nobody's fault,'' Ms. Cullen explained. ''We didn't point fingers. Our news was not political. And then Katrina came along, and suddenly the weather wasn't the weather anymore. It was something else. Suddenly the weather was potentially our fault.'' 
 Again, she noted, one should never point to a particular weather event and say, ''That's what global warming looks like.'' What you can do, Ms. Cullen said, is look at things like the dikes and levees in New Orleans and say, ''That is what bad infrastructure looks like'' in an age when the vast majority of scientists are warning that global warming will make seas rise, storms more powerful, and droughts and heat waves longer and deeper.
 Getting society focused on meeting these new infrastructure needs is huge. Our creaky power grid or leaky water pipes really matter in prolonged, record-shattering droughts like the one Georgia is now experiencing. ''Some scientists have suggested giving droughts names, like we do hurricanes,'' Ms. Cullen noted. ''If we did, this Southeast drought would be called Katrina, and it would be about to hit Atlanta.''
 That might get people more focused on infrastructure, which may not be sexy, she added, but it is how a society thrives, and it is going to be much more important in the age when the Weather Channel sounds like a broken record -- seemingly announcing every day, ''We just broke another record ...''
 Yes, I really enjoyed playing golf in late October, as though it were July. But you know what? It also felt a little freaky. Should I be enjoying this? Is there some connection between this and the fires I saw burning in California the very next day? I know the answer is complicated.
 ''And that is where the dialogue should start,'' Ms. Cullen said. ''When people look at something and feel confused, that's the time to starting talking.'' Usually when we get an unseasonably nice day in late fall or winter, she added, we call it a gift, ''but now you realize you may be paying for it.''

SECTION: Section AU; Column 0; Automobiles; BEHIND THE WHEEL 2008 HONDA ACCORD; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1633 words

HEADLINE: All Grown Up, Like the Boomers Who Embraced It

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
FOR more than three decades, we baby boomers have grown older, and often larger, along with the Honda Accord. With the arrival of the all-new 2008 Accord, this should be cause for celebration, for these latest Hondas prove that maturity can also mean excellence.
 Bigger and roomier, with more power and finesse, this eighth-generation Accord is surely the best one yet, a serious challenger to every car in the segments where it competes.
 The first Accord arrived in June 1976. At the time, Honda was still an upstart-punk company, having been founded by Soichiro Honda after World War II to install gasoline engines on bicycles. By the 1960's, with Honda minting profits on motorcycles and racing in Formula One, its founder had the audacity to imagine that he could challenge America's gargantuan automakers.
 He started with tiny but often endearing cars, so the first Accord was a giant leap despite dimensions that seem quite modest today. Initially a two-door hatchback, it was only 162.8 inches long -- about 14 inches shorter than the current Civic sedan, and 31 inches shorter than the 2008 Accord sedan. Priced at $3,995, that first Accord had a small (1.6 liter) 4-cylinder engine that produced just 68 horsepower. Honda boasted that standard safety items included radial tires and a day-night rearview mirror. 
 The proto-Accord was lean and economical, like many boomers in those days. It had a kind of antiestablishment appeal, and heaven knows many of us were suckers for that.
 That Accord, and each of the subsequent seven versions of it, recalibrated Americans' expectations of how good a Japanese car could be. In 1982, the Accord became the first Japanese-brand auto built in the United States. In 1989, it become the first foreign car to top the sales charts. It offered new choices: two or four doors, a smooth V-6 engine as well as an economical in-line 4, a hybrid powertrain. 
 Many Americans have never known a world in which there was not an Accord. By the end of this year Honda figures it will have sold 10 million Accords in the United States.
 The latest version is bigger and more powerful than ever, just like many boomers. (Thanks to Tom Brokaw, we are doomed to never match our parents. After all, how could we be greater than ''The Greatest Generation?'') 
 But this redesigned Accord is surely the greatest generation of Honda's best-selling model. It is incredibly important to the company, since it faces competition not just from the Toyota Camry but from a host of solid new entries like the Saturn Aura, Kia Optima, Hyundai Sonata, Ford Fusion, Nissan Altima and an all-new 2008 Chevrolet Malibu.
 The coupe and sedan also have looks that by Honda's standards are adventurous. The new Accord still uses front-wheel drive and is available as a coupe or sedan. It comes with either a 2.4-liter in-line 4-cylinder or a 3.5-liter V-6 (which replaces a 3-liter V-6). Honda did not replace the slow-selling Accord Hybrid.
 The 4-cylinder engine comes in versions with either 177 or 190 horsepower, with either a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic. The V-6 is rated at 268 horsepower and comes with a five-speed automatic, except on the EX-L coupe, which is available in a six-speed manual. With the automatic transmission, the V-6 has the fuel-saving ability to operate on three or four cylinders when full power is not needed.
 Regular fuel is recommended for all engines. In states that have adopted California's air-quality regulations -- including New York and most of New England -- the V-6 with automatic transmission gets an extra-clean PZEV rating (for partial zero emission vehicle).
 Like most Accords sold in the United States since the early 1980s, the new sedan will be built primarily (80 percent) in Marysville, Ohio, with the remainder being imported from Japan.
 When Honda opened the first Japanese transplant factory, there was a perception that American auto workers couldn't do anything right but that their Japanese counterparts were super-assemblers. Yet before long the corn-fed Buckeyes in Marysville proved that they could produce high-quality vehicles; the secrets were good management, a good process and thoughtful engineering. 
 Prices start at $20,995 for a four-cylinder LX sedan. The least expensive V-6 sedan is $26,595 and the most expensive is $30,895, which includes leather upholstery and a navigation system. 
 The four-cylinder coupe starts at $22,495, while the least expensive V-6 is $28,945. The fanciest coupe is $31,145.
 I drove a V-6 sedan briefly in Michigan, and later spent a week testing a 4-cylinder EX with an automatic transmission and a sticker price of $24,495. That car was nicely equipped and -- like all Accords -- it came with all the crucial safety gear.
 That included skid-correcting electronic stability control; antilock brakes; curtain air bags, which cover the side windows to provide protection in a side-impact crash; air bags mounted in the front seat for chest and pelvis protection in a side-impact crash; and ''active'' head restraints that move forward to reduce the chance of whiplash injuries for the front occupants. It also had brake-assist, which ensures that the driver is using all of a vehicle's braking power in a panic stop.
 The new sedan and coupe are each about three inches longer than the models they replace. That makes the 2008 sedan five inches longer than the Camry. The sedan has a little more knee and legroom than last year and four six-foot adults can easily be carried. 
 The new coupe, however, has four inches less rear legroom than the new sedan. The trunk capacity goes from 14 cubic feet in the sedan to about 12 in the coupe.
 The interior excels in common-sense functionality including large and easy-to-use controls and enough bins to allow for tidy motoring. But aesthetically the EX is a little disappointing. There's a lot of hard plastic, and the cloth on the seats seems to have been inspired by the bargain-rack towels at Wal-Mart. On the other hand, do you want fancy fabric or all that standard safety gear?
 The fanciest V-6 Accords with leather upholstery are more handsome inside, and the extra performance moves the car up into the near-luxury category. The unpretentious Honda badge lets you luxuriate incognito, appealing to those of us who want pampering but like to keep a low profile while getting it.
 The EX sedans and coupes with automatic transmissions are equipped with active noise control, previously found on the Accord Hybrid, which uses two microphones to detect ''low-end drivetrain frequency noise'' entering the cabin. That sets off a reverse-phase audio signal to reduce the ''booming sound of the exhaust.'' I think I saw something like that on ''Star Trek'' that was used to kill tribbles. The all-new 2008 Chevrolet Malibu lacks such gimmicks yet seems quieter.
 All this comes in a bigger package, and that is a cause for concern. Typically, adding size and weight do not improve the performance of people or cars. Middle-age bloat has killed plenty of baby boomers, and it is always worrisome when an automaker increases the size of a vehicle that had been entertaining to drive. 
 Happily the Accord has survived its growth. The sedan's ride -- for either 4-cylinder or V-6 models -- is slightly firm. However, while rough surfaces are noticed, they are not hurtful. Only those who put the highest priority on a coddled backside would object to the ride.
 Meanwhile, the Accord's body movements are far more tightly controlled than those in the Camry. That means the Accord always feels sharp and eager while the Camry (except for the SE version with a sport suspension) often feels bouncy. 
 A tour through the White Mountains of New Hampshire quickly showed that the Accord may be bigger but it is not sloppier, which is more than can be said for many boomers.
 Honda is doing a better job with its steering, and the Accord provides a good connection with the driver. The body feels solid (Honda says torsional rigidity has improved by 20 percent), and it responds quickly to even the most challenging series of turns. It is quite at home being driven in a brisk fashion that would fluster a Camry. 
 The 190-horsepower 4-cylinder does not let down the suspension. If there is a weakness, it is acceleration from a standing start since the empty vehicle weighs 3,408 pounds. Once under way, however, the reoccurring thought is, ''Why would I get the V-6?''
 A fair amount of the credit for this performance comes from a gifted five-speed automatic that is fabulously quick to downshift and invariably selects just the right gear to accelerate out of a corner. One reason for the automatic's excellence is that Honda has programmed the transmission not to upshift into fourth or fifth gear if the computer detects that the driver is repeatedly letting off the gas and then braking, which might indicate spirited driving on a twisty road. By comparison, the automatic in the Camry seems drowsy. 
 While the 4-cylinder is impressive, the V-6 is alluring. It was strong, incredibly smooth and handled any chore with ease. When full power is not needed, it can drop from six cylinders to four, or even three.
 The extra power reduces fuel economy, of course. The government estimate of 19 m.p.g. city and 29 m.p.g. highway is 2 m.p.g. less (in both city and highway estimates) than the 190-horse 4-cylinder with the automatic.
 With either engine, the new Accord proves to be that rarest of creatures, a family sedan with sporting abilities that go well beyond fancy trim or decals. The car is more practical, and safer, and yet a driving enthusiast can enjoy it. It also shows that bigger and older can mean better, just as it does with me and my fellow boomers.

HEADLINE: Few Choices In Shielding Of Witnesses

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: NEWARK, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
The head of the homicide unit at the Essex County prosecutor's office, Judy M. Gagliano, was responsible for investigating 155 killings in 2006, as gang violence continued to fuel a surge in murders. 
 Handling those cases is a daunting assignment, one made even more so because street gangs hold such a brutal grip on some neighborhoods that prosecutors often have difficulty protecting one of the essential components of any investigation: witnesses. 
 Yet the prosecutor's office has no staff assigned to the task, and no dedicated financing to cover the cost, for instance, of relocating terrified witnesses. So each time one of Ms. Gagliano's witnesses is threatened -- she says it happens several times a week -- investigators may be forced to scramble to search for the money and staff to keep him or her safe.
 ''There's not nearly enough resources to relocate people in the way we'd like, so we have to be creative,'' Ms. Gagliano said. ''And when people see the reality of how difficult it is, it doesn't make it easier.'' 
 The state attorney general's office, which oversees the county prosecutors, has spent less than $400,000 during the past four years on relocating witnesses, moving just 21 people, along with 35 of their relatives.
 And while the New Jersey State Police have a relocation unit that moves an additional handful of witnesses a year, they do so only in cases begun by their own detectives. They offer their unit's assistance to local prosecutors only if the district attorneys agree to pick up the bill -- costs that the local prosecutors say are prohibitive. 
 The lack of financing for effective state witness protection programs has been a problem for years in New Jersey, as it has in many states. State witness protection programs are often starved for resources, prosecutors say, and efforts by federal officials to inject additional money have so far been modest.
 But the shortages in New Jersey have persisted despite a dramatic increase in the number of threats, and in the face of repeated calls for action by elected officials across the state.
 Part of the state's trouble in protecting witnesses, though, goes beyond money to the very policy it applies: the attorney general's State Witness Assistance Program refuses to relocate most witnesses who have a criminal record or a drug problem, or are unemployed, saying that to do so might send criminals into unsuspecting cities and neighborhoods.
 ''That rules out about 80 percent of the people we have to rely on for our cases,'' said Mindy Mellits, a homicide prosecutor in Camden.
 As a result, many people who witness crimes have little confidence in the law enforcement system's ability or resolve to protect them; meanwhile, some killers have been able to escape prosecution by silencing witnesses with threats or in some cases, bullets. 
 In one of Newark's most notorious homicides in recent years -- the murder of a witness named Carmen Estronza, who was killed along with three friends in November 2004, then dumped near a church -- the trail of bloodshed claimed two more witnesses over a span of 18 months. A year after the quadruple homicide, one suspect in the case, Michael Melvin, shot and killed another, LaMar McMillan. Mr. Melvin pleaded guilty Oct. 19 to aggravated manslaughter in that killing. 
 The authorities then had one remaining witness to work with, Howard Roberts, who saw Ms. Estronza and her friends killed. Although Mr. Roberts's willingness to help investigators made him a likely target for violence, his criminal record disqualified him from the state's relocation program.
 And he refused Essex County's offers of assistance, said his mother, Linda Roberts, because of the prosecutor's imperfect record in protecting witnesses. In June 2006, a few months after agreeing to testify, Mr. Roberts was killed in a drive-by shooting, forcing prosecutors to drop charges against Mr. Melvin in the quadruple slaying and infuriating Newark police commanders whose detectives thought they had solved the case.
 The United States Marshals Service runs the gold standard of witness protection programs, with a $20 million annual budget and elaborate programs to provide participants with new identities, Social Security numbers and homes in distant locales. The Justice Department said that since the program was founded in 1970, it has relocated more than 7,900 witnesses and 10,000 of their family members, and never had a single participant harmed.
 Meanwhile, local law enforcement agencies have been forced to devise their own, much more modest, strategies. In New York, Chicago and San Francisco, prosecutors use a network of safe houses, many run by nonprofit agencies, to hide witnesses before they testify.
 In Baltimore, the state attorney's office established a witness security program that helps provide temporary housing to nearly 200 endangered witnesses a year. The prosecutor's office in Philadelphia spends $1 million a year protecting witnesses, and is now pushing city and state officials to establish a permanent relocation fund.
 New Jersey's efforts have been more limited. Each of the state's 21 prosecutor's offices has a victim witness unit to provide transportation and counseling to people who agree to testify. Those who face credible threats are referred to the State Witness Assistance Program, which officials say has delivered 8,000 ''services'' since 2003; services are defined as everything from interviewing witnesses about threats to helping them obtain government assistance to actual relocations. 
 But the program has run out of money on several occasions, according to veteran prosecutors, and the most basic questions about what help is available can prevail.
 ''Does it still exist now?'' Ms. Mellits asked in an interview last month.
 And of course, there is the matter of New Jersey's screening process for potential recipients of witness protection. Witnesses are automatically disqualified unless county prosecutors are willing to answer yes to the question ''Is the witness likely to lead a law-abiding life once relocated?''
 Hester Agudosi, the deputy attorney general who supervises New Jersey's county prosecutors, defended the screening process, saying that the state had an obligation to avoid moving a potentially dangerous witness into a new neighborhood. 
 ''Once we move someone, we're responsible for them,'' she said. ''So we have to be careful not to create a public danger in some other community.''
 But Attorney General Anne Milgram said that her office is now reviewing its witness relocation programs, as Gov. Jon S. Corzine ordered when he released his anticrime proposals early this month, and will search for ways to loosen those restrictions. 
 ''The reality is that some of your witnesses aren't going to be angels,'' Ms. Milgram said, ''so we need to find ways to offer protection to these people if that's what it's going to take to successfully prosecute these cases.''
 The state's stringent requirements often leave county prosecutors facing a dilemma: cobble together enough money to hide witnesses yourself or run the risk that they will be killed.
 Essex County was left to pay for 9 relocations last year and 15 so far this year, using a combination of petty cash, drug forfeiture money and general operating revenues. In addition to the cost of housing and living expenses, which average several thousand dollars per relocation, the county also bears the burden of diverting at least two investigators and one assistant prosecutor each day from investigating crimes to looking after witnesses.
 ''With the crime we have to deal with, those people should be out investigating other cases,'' Ms. Gagliano said. ''But there's no choice.''
 For years, local law enforcement agencies have been pushing for the money to provide better protection to more witnesses, according to Theodore Romankow, director of New Jersey's County Prosecutors' Association. State lawmakers have proposed various plans, including creation of a witness relocation office and a fund that would provide college tuition to young people who agree to testify against fellow gang members, but they have never made it through the Legislature.
 ''It's easy to get votes for locking suspects up,'' said Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, the majority leader and a Mercer County Democrat. ''But with something like witness relocation, people seem to think it only happens in other neighborhoods and not to them. It's only now that there have been enough high-profile cases that the public and elected officials realize that this problem has reached the crisis point.''
 But New Jersey has done so little to address the problem, and seen so many witnesses harmed, that the authorities now face something of a credibility gap, according to defense lawyers and victims advocates. Even under the best of circumstances, witnesses are reluctant to have their lives overturned by being sequestered from their families, friends and neighborhoods.
 In 2003, Darren Johnson of Camden agreed to testify about a gang murder he had witnessed, but turned down the county prosecutor's offer to relocate him because he did not want to be separated from his children, and ''he was confident he could handle himself,'' according to Glen Bowe, a friend who was with him the night of the killing. 
 Mr. Johnson moved to an apartment in a nearby suburb, but two days before the trial was scheduled to start, he answered the door and was greeted by a fusillade of bullets. Once he was hospitalized, Mr. Johnson received round-the-clock protection from police and prosecutors, and a year later, he testified from his hospital bed and helped win a conviction.
 Mr. Johnson never recovered, and last year died from his wounds. 
 But other witnesses opt out when they learn that the arrangements being offered are far more spartan than the glamorized image of witness protection they have gleaned from movies or television. The typical relocation by the state or a county prosecutor's office often includes little more than a few weeks in a budget motel or a bus ticket to out-of-state relatives.
 Once a trial ends, the state and county do not have the resources to provide long-term protection, so witnesses face the prospect of returning to neighborhoods ruled by gang members with long memories and a motive for retribution. 
 Patricia Weston Rivera, a lawyer who has represented an assortment of people accused of being gang members, captured the stark choice facing many of the young men and women she deals with.
 ''A lot of these witnesses are kids who have to make a life-or-death decision: Are the gangs more intent on trying to kill me or are the police more intent on trying to protect me?'' she said.

HEADLINE: Deciphering Rent Regulation

BYLINE: By HOPE REEVES

 BODY:
THOUGH synonymous in many people's minds, the two types of New York City rent regulation -- rent control and rent stabilization -- are not the same. And the differences can be significant for anyone who is thinking about buying an apartment or house occupied by rent-regulated tenants. 
 There are about 43,000 rent-controlled apartments in the city, compared with 1.044 million rent-stabilized apartments, according to the 2005 New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, the latest data available.
 From a prospective buyer's point of view, perhaps the biggest difference is that rent-stabilized tenants may be more readily removed from an apartment if the new owners want to use it themselves. Courts have maintained that there is no limit to how much space the owners can recover. They may begin eviction proceedings when the current lease expires, but only after notifying the tenants in writing 90 to 150 days before the expiration. 
 In general terms, rent-stabilized apartments are subject to rent increases every year or every other year when the leases are renewed, but rent-controlled tenants pay increases only after their landlord is granted permission by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. Further information is available from the division's Web site at www.dhcr.state.ny.us. 
 To qualify for rent-controlled status, a tenant in a building with three or more apartments must have lived in the apartment continuously since June 30, 1971. Tenants in two-family buildings must have lived there continuously since March 31, 1953.
 Rent-controlled tenants enjoy many rights, including the absolute right to stay unless a landlord can prove an ''immediate and compelling necessity'' to take over the apartment, a standard that Susan Baumel-Cornicello, a landlord-tenant lawyer in Manhattan, says is very difficult to meet. 
 ''We always advise our clients that it's practically impossible'' to remove a rent-controlled tenant from the apartment, Ms. Baumel-Cornicello said.
 Many rent-controlled tenants are 62 or older and therefore also qualify for additional protections granted to older residents.
 Both types of rent-regulated apartments are subject to succession rights -- a tenant's companion or family member can take over an apartment when the original tenant dies or moves out -- further complicating a complex situation.

HEADLINE: In the Ashes, Californians Ask How to Defeat the Santa Anas

BYLINE: By MICHELLE O'DONNELL

 BODY:
EVERY devastating fire in Southern California is followed by a period of taking stock: how can the fast-growing exurbs that ring Los Angeles and San Diego protect themselves from the inevitable next big blaze? 
 Last week, the tension between growth and safety arose again as people in the region began to assess the damage from wildfires that have so far consumed nearly half a million acres, killed seven people, and burned almost 1,800 structures to the ground. 
 If fire danger was enough to stop development, much of the populated part of California would never have been inhabited. The early Indian tribes understood the threat, and periodically burned meadows and forests to reduce the underbrush, which would otherwise fuel more dangerous firestorms. 
 Despite the dangers of living in a fire-prone arid basin, developers and home buyers have rarely been deterred, and they are not likely to be in the future, even with the state's well-organized antigrowth forces. California is expected to absorb 17 million more people in the next four decades.
 The key, then, is to find the always elusive balance between hellbent growth and no growth. Even Joel Kotkin, the author of ''The New Geography'' and an admirer of the economic dynamism of the exurbs, sees the need for limits. ''You need to have respect for what nature can do, and then you adjust,'' he said. ''There certainly needs to be an assessment as to whether in some areas the danger is so great that we may consider not building in that particular place.'' 
 One eternal problem is the legendary Santa Ana winds, which blow hot, dry air from the Nevada deserts through the parched underbrush of Southern California in autumn. 
 So while some activists say that global warming is to blame for the fires' fury, and others want to bar the door to newcomers, some scientists and planners are looking at the details: topographical maps, alternatives to mass evacuation during fires, and the reintroduction of native fire-resistant plants. 
 There are many efforts, but two are especially relevant after last week. Given that the Santa Anas are a predictable phenomenon, Max Moritz, a fire ecologist at the University of California at Berkeley, is trying to map the land susceptible to wildfires fueled by winds, like the map of a floodplain or a fault line. 
 Dr. Moritz's preliminary research shows that some areas are sheltered from the winds. And he has found that even young vegetation can be dangerous fuel in Santa Ana conditions, contrary to conventional wisdom that older vegetation is more likely to burn.
 Dr. Moritz said that a better understanding of what drives fire patterns in wildlife areas was needed. ''Fire shaped this place for a very long time,'' he said. ''If we're going to live on a fire-prone landscape, we need to know how to do it.'' 
 Another strategy involves a controversial new approach called ''sheltering in place,'' in which residents do not leave home, but hunker down in their homes outfitted with fireproof construction and protective landscaping, like golf courses that act as firebreaks, all designed to deter ignition. 
 In Rancho Santa Fe, the wealthy exurb outside of San Diego, five subdivisions have adopted this concept for surviving wildfires. 
 This strategy was developed in Australia to keep residents, who typically leave too late under an evacuation order, inside their houses, said John Handmer, the head of the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre at RMIT University in Melbourne, where it became a national policy in 2005. 
 Many deaths in a wildfire occur when residents flee too late. Cars stall in high heat, and the normally jam-packed narrow roadways like those in the almost-rural neighborhoods around Rancho Santa Fe become parking lots. 
 In Australia, however, residents are trained to defend their homes from burning embers, which cause most home losses during fires, Professor Handmer said. ''No approach is risk free, of course,'' he added, in an e-mail message. 
 Yet not all fire officials in California support the strategy, because they still believe that residents may have to evacuate at some point, and fear that by hunkering down, a resident may linger too long. And some foes of sprawl have opposed the concept because they see it is an attempt by developers to keep building in grassland areas.
 Still, after not a single home was lost last week in the shelter-in-place homes in the five neighborhoods -- though the flames destroyed other swaths of Rancho Santa Fe and surrounding areas -- the strategy was hailed as a success in some quarters. Others said that because the residents were ordered to evacuate anyway, the concept remains untested in saving lives.
 ''It's too soon to say whether such an approach would work here,'' Dr. Moritz said. ''Its success is going to depend on a location's fire weather patterns, the local home construction and siting, and whether culturally and legally we could make this kind of leap.''

HEADLINE: Conductor of the People

BYLINE: By ARTHUR LUBOW. 
Arthur Lubow, a contributing writer for the magazine, last wrote about the ownership fight over Machu Picchu artifacts housed at Yale.

 BODY:
In 2004, Gustavo Dudamel, who was then virtually unknown outside his native Venezuela, entered the first Gustav Mahler International Conducting Competition, for conductors under 35. One of the jurors in Bamberg, Germany, was Esa-Pekka Salonen, music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. ''I arrived a bit later than the rest of the jury, and by the semifinals, there was already a lot of buzz about him,'' Salonen said. At 23, Dudamel was not only an unusually young contestant; this session with the Bamberg Symphony marked his first time conducting a professional orchestra. He seemed unfazed. ''You are young and inexperienced, but you should somehow create an aura of confidence and authority,'' Salonen explained to me recently. ''Gustavo is not concerned about authority. He is concerned about music, which is exactly the right approach. The orchestra gets seduced into playing well for him, rather than forced.'' After the prize was awarded to Dudamel, Salonen telephoned Deborah Borda, president of the L.A. Philharmonic. ''He says, 'Deborah, you won't believe this kid from Venezuela who won the competition,' '' Borda recounted to me. ''I said, 'What's he like?' He said: 'He's a conducting animal. Let's get him in for a bowl concert right away.' '' 
 Dudamel didn't even have a manager. First he found one, then Borda booked him for a philharmonic outdoor summer concert in the Hollywood Bowl. ''When he came, we were getting toward the end of the bowl season, it's 110 degrees, the orchestra was getting ready for vacation -- and it was electric,'' Borda recalled. She immediately signed him up for a regular subscription date in Disney Hall and, in the meantime, embarked on what she calls ''a two-year odyssey'' to watch him work with orchestras throughout Europe. For Borda, who was scouting candidates to succeed Salonen someday, the turning point arrived while she was watching Dudamel rehearse the La Scala orchestra in Milan in Mahler's Fifth Symphony (as it happens, the piece he performed in the Bamberg competition). ''That is a great opera orchestra, but you don't think of them as a great Mahler band,'' Borda says of La Scala. ''When they started playing, it sounded like Verdi. By the end, it sounded like Vienna, with the klezmer, Jewish, real Mahlerian weighty sound. This was heavy lifting, a real crucible for a young conductor.'' The only remaining question in her mind was to see how he fared at Disney Hall in his debut there last January. After a rapturous response from the players and audience members, she offered Dudamel a five-year contract as music director, starting in the 2009-10 season.
 There was a sense that she had snaffled the Man o' War or Secretariat of the classical-music racetrack. Dudamel, now 26, is the most-talked-about young musician in the world. Sir Simon Rattle, the principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, has called him ''the most astonishingly gifted conductor I have ever come across.'' At a time when recording companies are cutting back on orchestral releases, Dudamel has received a coveted contract with Deutsche Grammophon and has released two CDs of Beethoven and Mahler symphonies. Already a frequent presence in European halls, he will begin his most extended appearance in the United States next month, performing in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston -- and, for the first time, in New York, with the New York Philharmonic and, at Carnegie Hall, with his own Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela.
 Is there a risk in committing an orchestra to a leader who is still relatively unproved? At this stage of his career, Dudamel has a limited repertory, focused on the familiar Central Europeans (Beethoven, Mahler) and the underperformed Latin Americans (Arturo Marquez, Jose Pablo Moncayo, Oscar Lorenzo Fernandez). Also untested is his capacity for the administrative and public relations tasks that American orchestras require of their music directors. But the L.A. Philharmonic has a history of hiring dynamic young music directors (Salonen was 34 when he began there, and Zubin Mehta was only 26), so you could say that taking risks is part of its tradition. A Latin American conductor in Los Angeles County, where roughly half the population is Hispanic, also makes sense. ''It's exciting for people here,'' Borda says. 
 In selecting Dudamel, the L.A. Philharmonic is also allying itself with a uniquely successful education initiative, of which its new music director is the most illustrious product; this week the philharmonic will announce plans to inaugurate a program, ''Youth Orchestra L.A.,'' that is directly modeled on a Venezuelan prototype. Youth Orchestra L.A. will begin with youngsters between the ages of 8 and 12 in a disadvantaged district in central Los Angeles, but its ultimate goal is much grander: to provide a musical instrument and a place in a youth orchestra for every young person in Los Angeles County who wants one. Borda says that she was inspired by her visit late last year to Caracas. In vivid contrast to the situation in the United States, where arts-education programs have been snipped from school curricula as unaffordable frippery, the Venezuelan system provides a place in an orchestra for children, no matter how poor or troubled their backgrounds, throughout the country. And the results have been astonishing. I asked Borda if she was surprised by anything she had seen during her Venezuelan visit. ''I didn't imagine I would be in tears as much as I was,'' she told me.
 A decade ago, in a gymnasium in Barquisimeto in western Venezuela, Dudamel, then 17, stood on a podium with a baton in his hand, facing an orchestra and chorus of about 800. Conducting a musical ensemble of that size is like commanding a regiment. For the teenage novice, the challenge was heightened by the conspicuous and audible presence of his mentor, Jose Antonio Abreu, who was seated front-row center and calling out suggestions. ''Woodwinds up!'' Abreu urged his protege. ''Tell the strings more bow!'' The conductor sailed ahead confidently. ''I think that was the test,'' Dudamel told me. If his unflappability was the quality being sized up, the young man triumphed. His musical instincts were equally impressive. On the five-hour car trip back to Caracas, Abreu telephoned home to tell his sister, ''I think we have found the new conductor for the Children's Orchestra.''
 Dudamel's rocket-fast rise can't be grasped without an understanding of the music-education system that launched him. With an enrollment of 250,000 students, most of them from humble backgrounds, the National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras of Venezuela -- known popularly as el sistema -- is the lifetime work of the visionary and tireless Abreu, who in 32 years has navigated the program through 10 different administrations of this politically turbulent country, flourishing under the conservative presidents of the 80s and the defiantly leftist Hugo Chavez today. Combining political shrewdness with religious devotion, the stooped, ascetic Abreu, who is 68, seems to have stepped out of a novel by Stendhal or Greene (if you overlook the ever-present cellphone). His friends invariably compare him to a priest. Unencumbered by family obligations or material possessions, he has dedicated himself to a utopian dream in which an orchestra represents the ideal society, and the sooner a child is nurtured in that environment, the better for all. Sometimes Abreu emphasizes the spiritual enrichment that music brings to the individual; at other times, he points to evidence that students who go through the sistema become more productive and responsible members of society.
 The most remarkable feature of the Venezuelan music-education system is its instant immersion: the children begin playing in ensembles from the moment they pick up their instruments. Their instructors say the students are learning to behave as much as they are discovering how to make music. ''In an orchestra, everybody respects meritocracy, everybody respects tempo, everybody knows he has to support everyone else, whether he is a soloist or not,'' explains Igor Lanz, the executive director of the private foundation that administers the government-financed sistema. ''They learn that the most important thing is to work together in one common aim.'' Across Venezuela the sistema has established 246 centers, known as nucleos, which admit children between 2 and 18, assign them instruments and organize them into groups with instructors. Typically practicing for two or three hours every day, the children are performing recognizable music virtually from the outset.
 Not long ago I visited a few nucleos, including one in a concrete-block building in the Los Chorros district of Caracas that was constructed in the mid-60s as a detention center for juvenile delinquents. It now houses youngsters who have been taken from the streets or from violent or crime-ridden homes into the protective custody of the state. Only 57 kids were residents of the shelter, but 300 more who lived in the neighborhood came there for daily music instruction. I watched several orchestral groups perform, including a string ensemble of 7- and 8-year-olds sawing away at Beethoven's ''Ode to Joy,'' the first violinists scratchily bowing and the second violinists fingering pizzicato notes. The harsh overhead fluorescent lights, the white and ocher paint peeling off the concrete walls and the bars on some windows (dating from the building's origins) might have cast a gloomy air over the proceedings. Instead, the pleasure and pride that the children took in their collective effort was infectious. ''It was a shot in the arm,'' Matias Tarnopolsky, the artistic director of the New York Philharmonic, told me of his own tour of the sistema in Caracas. ''It reminded me of the reasons I went into the music world as a profession.'' Rattle has called the sistema ''the most important thing happening in classical music anywhere in the world.''
 Like a far-reaching catchment network that comprises 1,800 teachers and some 600 orchestras, the sistema pulls in youngsters who, depending on talent and ambition, advance to statewide orchestras, with the younger ones in children's orchestras and those in their late teens and 20s in youth orchestras. The best are funneled into the national Bolivar Youth Orchestra. (One of them, Edicson Ruiz, a double bassist, at 19 became the youngest musician admitted to the modern-day Berlin Philharmonic.) Directed by Dudamel since 1999, the Bolivar Youth Orchestra enjoys a worldwide reputation for a sound that is not only passionate -- to be expected with youth orchestras -- but also surprisingly polished and balanced. 
 Dudamel, who began playing as an orchestra violinist in Caracas at age 12, has known some of the players for half his life, and he conducts them with the intimate assurance of someone who grew up with them. ''The relationship between the orchestra and me is so easy that sometimes in rehearsal I don't have to tell them anything -- they are waiting for my hands and my movements,'' he says. During a rehearsal he can good-naturedly chide, ''No, muchachos,'' wagging his forefinger and shaking his head, in a way that probably wouldn't work with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. ''We used to believe that a conductor is an old, introverted guy,'' says Rafael Payares, who plays French horn in the orchestra and is one of Dudamel's closest friends. ''But this is the same Gustavo you used to see playing the violin or throwing parties. He's still the same -- crazy.'' Dudamel is diminutive in stature and warm but unshowy in conversation; when the music begins, however, with his thick curly hair bouncing as he leaps passionately on the podium, an electrifying avatar materializes.
 Abreu and Dudamel are the two most identifiable figures of the sistema, and Abreu's mentoring of Dudamel has taken on the appearance of fathering. ''When I met Gustavo, I thought he was the son of Jose Antonio -- the way he walks, the way he talks, even the way he writes,'' Dudamel's wife, Eloisa Maturen de Dudamel, a journalist and former dancer, told me. At the all-night parties following Caracas concerts of the Bolivar Youth Orchestra, typically held in the home where Abreu lives with his sister and brother-in-law, Dudamel will always peel off to speak with the maestro. ''I know when they sit down and start talking, it can last forever,'' EloAsa says. ''It can start with one bar of the 'Eroica' Symphony, and it can go to the universe. Jose Antonio arrives very late at these parties. When he arrives, he always kidnaps Gustavo. And when that happens, we know Gustavo is finished with us for the night.'' Some people wonder if Dudamel will curtail his international commitments one day so he can assume the role of Abreu's successor. ''Gustavo is much more than a successor,'' Abreu told me, laughing, when I posed the question. ''He is a universal glory of Latin America. He is a flag, a standard.'' 
 The sistema is a kind of religion, and among its initiates, I grew accustomed to hearing Abreu described in Godlike terms (all-seeing, all-knowing, never-resting) and Dudamel celebrated as his charismatic, filial prophet. Attending concerts of the Bolivar Youth Orchestra in Caracas these days, Abreu can still be found seated front and center, but he no longer feels the need to issue instructions. At a performance last summer of Beethoven's Third ''Eroica'' Symphony and Bartok's thorny First Piano Concerto, Dudamel radiated eager boyishness and delight as he indicated the emphatic successive downbeats in the ''Eroica.'' He grinned whenever the musicians played a phrase to his liking, and his eyes twinkled and his fingers plucked the air, as if wheedling the sound he wanted from individual sections of the orchestra. His face and body expressed torment, elation or despair, to elicit the mood he was after, while the stick in his right hand and the undulations of his left relayed the entrances and rhythms to the players. In his ringside seat, the old maestro, in rapt absorption, beamed and nodded approvingly. ''Every time I see in Abreu's face the joy of watching how Gustavo can make music that is not written,'' Frank Di Polo, a violist who is married to Abreu's sister, told me. ''I think Abreu is not only proud. It is his son now.''
 Dudamel was raised in Barquisimeto, a city that prides itself on a rich tradition of popular music. His father, Oscar, played the trombone professionally, mainly with salsa bands, so Gustavo attended concerts before he was old enough to speak. The family lived with Oscar's parents until Gustavo was 12, when Oscar landed an office job in a nearby city and the parents relocated. Gustavo chose to stay behind with his grandparents. (Both his parents now work for the sistema.) Gustavo's grandfather, who was a truck driver, died five years ago, but I visited his grandmother, Engracia de Dudamel, in the modern apartment in Barquisimeto that Gustavo bought for her in 2005. 
 At an early age, Engracia de Dudamel told me, Gustavo was concentrating on music. By 5, he was studying music in the sistema in the afternoons. When he came home from school at lunchtime, he would arrange his Fisher-Price toy figures as if they were an orchestra, making a little box for the conductor, and put a record on the phonograph; he would ask her not to break up the orchestra while he was in music class so that he could resume directing the musicians on his return. One time his grandmother took him to see his father perform in a classical concert in Barquisimeto. ''He was very small, I thought he was going to fall asleep,'' she told me. ''And he was completely attentive to details of the instruments. He said, 'Grandmother, I like this music.' '' When I repeated this story to Dudamel, he told me what the program had been.
 Although the boy wanted to learn to play the trombone like his father, his arms were still too short. Instead, he took up the violin. ''From the very beginning he showed signs of great talent and learned everything very easily,'' says Luis Gimenez, the principal administrator of the sistema in the state of Lara, of which Barquismeto is the capital. When Gustavo was accepted by a renowned violin instructor in Caracas, his grandparents proudly shepherded him to weekly lessons, departing at 3 a.m. on Fridays to get him there. 
 Exceptional as were both his talent and family support, Dudamel also benefited immeasurably from the institutional framework in place for him to climb. ''It is a brilliant result of the sistema,'' Abreu says. In the Lara children's orchestra, Dudamel was soon appointed concertmaster; and when Gimenez formed the Amadeus Youth Orchestra to explore Baroque string music, Dudamel served as concertmaster there too. One afternoon, Gimenez arrived late to a scheduled rehearsal of the Amadeus Youth Orchestra in the school cafeteria and discovered that the musicians had started playing without him, under the baton of Dudamel, who was then 12 or 13. ''He was great, he was like a regular conductor,'' Gimenez says. He appointed Dudamel to be assistant conductor, which meant in practice that the boy was doing much of the conducting for both the Amadeus string ensemble and the Lara children's orchestra.
 Abreu, who monitors in-house talent as closely as a studio mogul of the Hollywood golden age, encouraged Dudamel to take conducting classes along with his regular violin lessons in Caracas. So when he saw Dudamel conduct the oversize orchestra in Barquisimeto for the annual May concert in 1998, he wasn't totally surprised by the boy's prowess. After the concert, he went to speak to Dudamel's grandparents and said, ''I have to take him to Caracas.'' They were shocked, but they could not refuse. ''We cried a lot,'' Engracia recalls. ''And my husband told Dr. Abreu, 'You are taking the light out of this house.' '' But Dudamel's talent shone more brightly in the big city. He honed his conducting skills rapidly; indeed, his last decade has whirred forward like a sped-up film. In 1998, when Dudamel was 17, Abreu gave him less than two months' notice that he would be conducting the national children's orchestra in Mahler's First Symphony on a tour of Italy. Abreu coached him personally. At one session, held on the move in typical Abreu fashion, he handed Dudamel the partiture -- the full conductor's score -- and told him to mark up the first movement. Then the maestro went off to Mass. ''I looked at it and kept writing, 'This is important, this is important,' '' Dudamel recalls. ''You couldn't read the score, I wrote so much. He came back and said, 'O.K., conduct.' I went to take what I had written and he said, 'You don't need the partiture.' When I started, he said: 'Where is the entrance? Sing the second melody. Sing it in reverse.' '' It was sink or swim. During the orchestra's tour, Dudamel met the conductor Giuseppe Sinopoli in Sicily. He became the first of Dudamel's foreign mentors, to be followed by Claudio Abbado, Daniel Barenboim and Simon Rattle, who have all encouraged and coached him.
 Over the last three years, Esa-Pekka Salonen has seen Dudamel develop as his opportunities have exponentially increased. Most notably, a year ago, he signed on to eight weeks annually as principal guest conductor of the Gothenberg Symphony in Sweden. ''He has had a few years of very professional conducting around the world, and obviously he is a very different kind of guy,'' Salonen told me. ''What hasn't disappeared is the sense of wonder and awe and discovery. These are wonderful qualities in all human beings, but especially in a conductor.''
 Musicians grasp to put into words what makes it so exciting to play for him. ''When he's conducting the piece, you're feeling like it's just been composed, it's like he's creating it himself,'' says the L.A. Philharmonic's principal clarinetist, Michele Zukofsky. ''He throws away the past. You're not bogged down by what's supposed to be. It's like jazz, in a way.'' In a rehearsal for Dudamel's debut at Disney Hall, Zukofsky performed an extended solo that is featured in Zoltan Kodaly's ''Dances of Galanta.'' ''I played an ascending run very softly, pianissimo,'' she recounted. ''He said, 'Oh, I love this.' '' It is a passage that she normally plays mezzoforte, or moderately loud. ''Even though it was a mistake, he enjoyed the difference,'' she says. He had her do it that way at each of the concerts.
 Just as down to earth as Dudamel's talent is the social transformation that was needed to nurture it. In 1975, when Abreu began what was then called the Youth Orchestra of Venezuela, the nation had only two orchestras, the Venezuela Symphony and the recently founded Maracaibo Symphony. Both were staffed mainly by European emigres. Initially, the chief appeal of the Youth Orchestra was the professional opportunity it provided for young Venezuelan classical musicians. Abreu had a greater goal, however -- to create many orchestras, which would embrace a segment of the population that was thought to be incapable of appreciating the art form. ''For me, the most important priority was to give access to music to poor people,'' he says. ''As a musician, I had the ambition to see a poor child play Mozart. Why not? Why concentrate in one class the privilege of playing Mozart and Beethoven? The high musical culture of the world has to be a common culture, part of the education of everyone.'' 
 Abreu combines a deep knowledge of music (he studied composition and conducting and performed on keyboard instruments in churches and concert halls) and economics (he taught the subject at Andres Bello Catholic University in Caracas and served a term in the Venezuelan National Assembly). So he was unusually well equipped to found an orchestra system. He works without rest, despite a frail constitution that was further weakened by serious abdominal surgery for ulcers in 1973. Ever since, he has been forbidden alcohol and restricted to a low-fat, nondairy diet of small meals. An onset of diabetes later deprived him of chocolate, his one indulgence. Today he is a gaunt, bony figure, swaddled in woolen clothing even in the Venezuelan heat, his bright eyes and smile blazing beneath a big domed forehead.
 The Venezuelan government began fully financing Abreu's orchestra after it succeeded brilliantly at an international competition in 1977 in Aberdeen, Scotland. From the beginning, the sistema fell under the dominion of social-services ministries, not the ministry of culture. Strategically, this positioning has helped it to survive, since Venezuelan presidents feel varying degrees of commitment to the arts and, when possible, prefer to reject anything associated with the previous regime. The current Chavez administration, best known in this country for its populist, vehemently anti-American tone, has been the most generous patron of the sistema so far, footing almost all of its $29 million annual operating budget and ponying up for additional capital projects. When I talked to leaders of the sistema, I thought I detected a special emphasis on the socially progressive aspects of the program that would gratify the Medici of the masses. But that social-welfare element is central to Abreu's philosophy, and if the theme is being underscored now -- well, such choices are a musician's prerogative.
 In politically polarized Venezuela, a government-supported institution walks a tightrope. For the sistema, the delicacy of the footwork became unpleasantly public earlier this year. The minister of communications asked the Bolivar Youth Orchestra, with Dudamel conducting, to play the national anthem in late May, at the moment that Radio Caracas Television, an outspokenly anti-Chavez broadcasting network, went off the air for the last time. The performance would be the first programming on the new, Chavez-compliant station that replaced RCTV, which had lost its license. Under longtime law, the national anthem is heard whenever a TV station begins or ends its regular day of broadcasting in Venezuela. Officially, the government was requesting a newly performed, complete version of the anthem with an orchestral introduction. In context, though, it would appear that the nation's acclaimed young conductor and orchestra were endorsing the Chavez administration's refusal to renew the RCTV license, a decision that bitterly divided the nation.
 Pleading technical impediments, the orchestra's leaders begged off a live appearance and instead provided a videotape. But because the anthem on television is typically accompanied by a photomontage of picturesque Venezuelan scenes, many viewers who watched the tape on TV thought Dudamel and the orchestra were indeed performing live. In the press and on blogs, some of Chavez's critics -- who tend to be the people who buy concert tickets -- expressed outrage and dismay. Looking back, the orchestra's leaders say they had no choice but to provide the tape. ''How could you say no?'' explains Lanz, the foundation's executive director. ''What will be your next answer? The organization depends on the state, and they are asking for something that is absolutely normal.'' He allows, however, that ''for some people it was shocking.'' The next day, he went to the manager of the new station to say that ''many people are using this as a political cause and it is causing damage, not to us but to the kids,'' and to request that in the future, the audio be used without the images of the orchestra and Dudamel. ''They did it immediately, which I am thankful for,'' he says. ''Having your anthem being used politically is terrible.'' Some people told me that Dudamel was upset by the controversy, but to me he would speak only in generalities about the current world situation. ''We are in a point of intolerance,'' he said. ''The national anthem is the glory of the country. It is for all Venezuelans.'' Abreu, a little disingenuously, told me: ''We have recorded the national anthem dozens of times. We were never told the particular use of a particular recording. When we deliver a video, it is for all. It is the national anthem. It is not our fault.'' When I said that it was a question of context, he repeated, with a pained expression, ''It is not our fault.''
 Not to say that political posturing is demanded solely by the government. The recording of the anthem was made in the sistema's new Center for Social Action Through Music, an 11-story, $25 million building on the edge of downtown Caracas that officially opened at the end of July. I had assumed that its cumbersome name constituted another blandishment for the Chavistas, but I was wrong. It was a sop to the Inter-American Development Bank, which helped underwrite it with a $5 million loan and is now advancing $150 million for the construction of seven other regional centers of the sistema throughout Venezuela. Development banks prefer to lend money for infrastructure: sewers, roads, water-treatment plants. Within the I.D.B., many bankers objected to a loan for such a frivolous-seeming project. ''One of my colleagues joked, 'Are you going to finance the poor kids to carry the instruments of the rich kids?' '' says Luis Carlos Antola, a representative of the bank in Venezuela. ''Because there is the feeling that classical music is for the elite.'' In fact, the bank has conducted studies on the more than two million young people who have been educated in the sistema, which show that two-thirds of them are from poor backgrounds. Other studies link participation in the program to improvements in school attendance and declines in juvenile delinquency. Weighing such benefits as a falloff in school dropout rates and a decline in crime, the bank calculated that every dollar invested in the sistema was reaping about $1.68 in social dividends.
 It is true, however, that Abreu argues that the poor are entitled to not only Mozart and Beethoven but also to the best of art and architecture. He retained two of Venezuela's most distinguished abstract artists to help decorate the center, which contains a beautiful wood-paneled 1,200-seat auditorium, a 400-seat chamber music hall (an afterthought of Abreu) and several acoustically pleasing recording spaces. After attending concerts of Dudamel with the Youth Orchestra at the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland, which is one of the poshest settings for music in the world, Abreu admired the granite entry floor of the concert hall. ''He went to the Ministry of Finance,'' Antola says. ''He convinced them. There was not even enough granite in the country. They had to bring it back from Panama, where they had already sold it. He is like a serpent enchanter. You can't resist.''
 And his ambition is unbounded. Within Venezuela, Abreu is determined to reach even further into society. Supported by the government, the sistema has started to introduce its music program into the public-school curriculum, aiming within five years to be in every school and to double its enrollment to 500,000 children. The organization is also pressing lower in the class structure, having introduced a pilot music-education program in three cities for the homeless children who subsist as scavengers in garbage dumps. Outside the country, the sistema is cooperating with programs in nearly every Latin American country; and in Europe, Simon Rattle, a leading proponent of music education, has worked with Venezuelan experts to enhance the already impressive program that his orchestra manages in Berlin. 
 In a stroke of auspicious timing, Dudamel's precocious success has coincided with the sistema's international advance. ''Gustavo is the visible face of what is coming behind,'' Antola says. ''You needed some sort of emblem. People are discovering Gustavo and the sistema simultaneously.'' In his words and his achievements, Dudamel is an unmatched spokesman for the sistema's virtues. ''You feel a young sound and a young energy in the sistema,'' he says. ''We are not looking at an individual goal, it is always collective. I am a product of the sistema, and in the future, I will be here, working for the next generations.'' 
 As an international celebrity whose career was incubated by the sistema, Dudamel is uniquely able to champion its expansion at home and promote its adoption abroad. If successful, the ''Youth Orchestra L.A.'' initiative of his new home, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, may prove to be a pilot project for reinventing music education in this country. You can see why devotees are looking to Venezuela with the fervor of Ponce de Leon hunting for magically rejuvenating waters in Florida. This dual vision -- of hundreds of thousands of young people transformed by the sistema and of a youthful conductor who can bring audiences to their feet cheering -- is a powerful sign of vitality to rebut those grim-faced pulse takers who are forever proclaiming the senescence of classical music.

HEADLINE: Maybe Inflation Is More Than a Sideshow

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
BY many measures, inflation is rising -- yet investors seem to be thinking less about it. 
 Look at the numbers: In July, consumer prices were up 2.4 percent over the same month the previous year. Gold was trading at $660 an ounce. Crude oil was hovering at around $75 a barrel. And a survey of money managers by Merrill Lynch showed that a majority on Wall Street feared that inflation would creep higher.
 Fast forward to today. The most recent Labor Department inflation report, based on September data, shows the Consumer Price Index climbed 2.8 percent over the past year. Gold prices are now around $780 an ounce. Oil recently hit $90 a barrel for the first time. Yet even against this grimmer backdrop, less than a third of fund managers now think that inflation is a threat. 
 Of course, these fund managers aren't alone in believing that inflation is either dead, dying or no longer a serious concern. 
 Even the Federal Reserve is talking less about inflation as it focuses on trying to stoke an economy that's being pressured by ailing credit and housing markets. 
 This week, investors will pay particularly close attention to the Fed to see whether it will cut a key short-term interest rate for the second time in as many months -- and to see whether the Fed's views on inflation continue to evolve. 
 In August, the Fed made clear that it wasn't convinced of a ''sustained moderation in inflation pressures.'' 
 But a month later, inflation went from being a front-burner issue to almost an afterthought. After its Sept. 18 meeting, the Fed said it cut rates by half a percentage point to ''forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time.'' 
 And what about inflation? The central bankers indicated that ''some inflation risks remain'' but also pointed out that ''readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year.''
 This shift in language -- and policy -- puts the Fed ''in a funny corner,'' said Jeffrey L. Knight, chief investment officer of the global asset allocation team at Putnam Investments in Boston. Mr. Knight said the Fed clearly believes that it must ''liquefy the credit markets'' to lend support to an economy that's slowing. ''On the other hand, by doing so, they will be fanning the flames of the very risk that they purportedly were most concerned about two months ago,'' he said.
 To be sure, many investors and economists are convinced that inflation is under control. And a number of government statistics support this. 
 For instance, so-called core inflation readings, which strip out volatile food and energy prices, have been mild for some time. In fact, according to the Labor Department, core consumer prices have been growing at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 2.3 percent for the first nine months this year. That's down from 2.6 percent last year. 
 ''Inflation, despite some sharp increases in food and energy prices, has really been fairly tame on a year-over-year basis,'' said Paul L. Kasriel, director of economic research at Northern Trust in Chicago.
 But Michael J. Cuggino, manager of the Permanent Portfolio, a mutual fund, says we shouldn't rely exclusively on core C.P.I. data because ''in reality, businesses need energy and people need to eat.'' And government data show that the costs of food and energy are going through the roof.
 For example, in the first nine months this year, food and beverage prices rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.7 percent. Transportation costs jumped at a 6 percent annual clip. For energy, the figure was even higher: nearly 12 percent.
 The bottom line is that ''inflation is still a risk,'' Mr. Cuggino said, especially now that ''there's no longer that same level of diligence there was with respect to keeping inflation down.'' 
 In addition to an accommodative Fed, there are a couple of reasons that investors may want to keep an eye on inflation:
 RISING PRICES IN CHINA In the past few years, the United States economy has essentially been importing deflationary pressures by buying goods from China. And that's kept overall prices in check. 
 But Thomas H. Atteberry, co-manager of the FPA New Income fund, notes that inflation in China has begun to soar as the economy grows and as millions of new workers a year join China's burgeoning urban labor market. 
 Indeed, inflation in China was running at 6.2 percent, year over year, in September, versus 6.5 percent in August. Both figures were well above the government's target of a 3 percent rate of inflation for 2007. ''Given that we import so much from China,'' Mr. Atteberry said, ''this certainly doesn't help.'' 
 THE FALLING DOLLAR A weakening currency has always been thought to be inflationary, because consumers and businesses require more dollars to buy goods from overseas.
 Ned Davis Research studied dollar declines back to 1974 and found that when the dollar has dropped more than 4.3 percent annually against a basket of foreign currencies, the Consumer Price Index has tended to accelerate by half a percentage point more than it would otherwise. Over the last 12 months, the dollar has fallen more than 10 percent against a basket of foreign currencies. 
 Of course, this relationship isn't perfect. After all, the dollar has been tumbling for nearly six years, and inflation has been rather benign throughout this decade. But Gordon B. Fowler Jr., chief investment officer at Glenmede Investment Management, an institutional money manager based in Philadelphia, says that ''if there's a run on the dollar, that would be very bad for inflation.''
 That brings us back to the Fed. Robert D. Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates, an investment management firm in Pasadena, Calif., says the Fed is ''caught between a rock and a hard place.'' If the Fed leaves rates alone, he said, it ''risks the markets cratering and the economy going from slowdown to possible recession.'' But if it lowers rates again, he said, ''the dollar would be at further risk.'' 
 And that could prompt more inflation, which would be just as bad for the economy.

HEADLINE: Buffalo Looks North for an Economic Lift and a Fan Base From Toronto

BYLINE: By MATT HIGGINS; Judy Battista contributed reporting from Philadelphia.

DATELINE: ORCHARD PARK, N.Y., Oct. 27 

 BODY:
For many fans of the Buffalo Bills, the thought of their team's playing home games in Toronto seems to signal that their worst fears have come true.
 About 100 miles to the north, with a booming population and economy, Toronto has long loomed over small-market Buffalo as a place for the Bills to relocate. But a plan to play some home games there is being portrayed by team officials not as a threat, but as the best hope for the Bills to remain in western New York.
 At a meeting Tuesday in Philadelphia, the Bills' owner, Ralph Wilson, asked the other N.F.L. owners for permission to play eight home games in Toronto over five years, beginning next season. 
 ''It helps expand our market in Buffalo,'' Wilson told reporters after the meeting. ''It gives us a major metropolitan area to expand our base.''
 The plan calls for one regular-season game annually for the next five years, and one preseason game in 2008, 2010 and 2012. The games would be played at the Rogers Center, a 50,000-seat stadium and home to the Toronto Blue Jays and the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts.
 The proposal came five days before the Giants and the Miami Dolphins were to play in London as part of an N.F.L. strategy to market the league outside the United States. The proposal is reminiscent of the years when the Packers, seeking to broaden their market beyond Green Bay, played some home games in Milwaukee from 1933 through 1994.
 For the Bills' plan to pass, 24 of the league's 32 owners must approve. A vote is expected in the coming months. Several owners have signaled their support.
 ''Any team in smaller markets should be encouraged to expand their market,'' said Robert McNair, the chief executive of the Houston Texans. ''I think it's very positive. This will strengthen the team's ability to survive in Buffalo.''
 Because Bills officials have said little since the plan was revealed, speculation has run rampant that games in Toronto, Canada's largest city, could be a first step in permanently relocating the team there.
 Brandon Bahret, a dentist who lives in a suburb of Buffalo, attended the Bills' game last Sunday against the Baltimore Ravens. ''I think the Bills will leave, like the steel plants,'' he said.
 But N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell described Wilson's pitch as an extension of previous regionalization efforts. In 2000, the Bills moved their training camp to a suburb of Rochester. Today, 14 percent of the team's season-ticket holders are from that area.
 ''The key point made by Ralph Wilson is that this is to try to make the team more viable in the Buffalo market,'' Goodell said. ''The Toronto area is an important market for them.''
 Of the Bills' 48,000 season-ticket holders, 11 percent come from Canada. As many as 15,000 Canadians attend home games.
 Aris Dalakis of Toronto was with a group of eight people who traveled to the Ravens-Bills game.
 ''We'd like to see a team in Toronto,'' said Dalakis, chomping on a cigar, in a parking lot outside the stadium. ''But we wouldn't want to have Buffalo's team move there.''
 ''We're polite Canadians,'' he added.
 It is not manners the Bills seek in Canada. With a population of 5.5 million, and with Canadian currency trading about even with the dollar, greater Toronto offers an economic lifeline for the Buffalo area, which is reeling from a loss of jobs and people.
 ''The people of western New York have been hit hard,'' Wilson told N.F.L. owners Tuesday.
 Losing the Bills would be a blow to the region, too.
 Still, many said that forfeiting one home game to Toronto would be a small price to pay if it prevented the team from moving.
 ''We realize that we may go play in Toronto as soon as next season,'' Bills defensive end Chris Kelsay said. ''It's for the benefit of this team. It's for the benefit of Buffalo to keep the franchise here.
 ''I think we've got to take any necessary step to keep the team in Buffalo.''
 A decade ago, Wilson considered relocating the Bills. But Erie County countered with incentives to stay.
 In 1998, the Bills and the state signed a lease agreement to use Ralph Wilson Stadium through 2012, a deal estimated to be worth more than $100 million.
 As part of the agreement, Erie County and state authorities could have blocked attempts to play in Toronto. But both have signed off on the plan, citing the Bills' need for revenue.
 Still, there are no guarantees the Bills will stay. Wilson, 89, has refused to settle on a succession strategy for the team. Once he dies, the franchise will be sold to the highest bidder.
 Asked if he envisioned the Bills' remaining in Buffalo in 20 years, Goodell responded as only a western New Yorker might.
 ''I don't know,'' said Goodell, who was born in Jamestown, an hour south of Buffalo. ''I hope so.''

HEADLINE: Not to Get Too Mystical About It

BYLINE: By CHIP BROWN. 
Chip Brown is the author of ''Good Morning Midnight'' and ''Afterwards, You're a Genius.'' His last article for Play was on skiing in the Italian Alps.

 BODY:
Steve Nash sat down on a playground bench in Washington Market park, like all the other tired Manhattan fathers. 
 It was a summer evening, late in August, and somewhere in the scrum of kids roiling under the monkey bars was one of his 3-year-old twin girls, Lola, and her nanny. A rubber ball came bounding by with a pre-K hotshot in hot pursuit. He seemed like the sort of kid who in a few years would be shooting baskets behind a school, pretending he was Steve Nash. Nash from the corner! 
 Nash driving the lane! Nash in the media room talking to a reporter! 
 At the sight of the kid, the wariness melted out of Nash's blue eyes. It was easy to imagine the N.B.A. star himself at that age, before he had his paper route, before the local newspaper clips began to trickle in, and the trophies, and the fans, and the Sports Illustrated covers, and the instructional DVDs, and the $11-million-a-year contract and now the 11 seasons as a pro in which he has enjoyed every success but a championship, his one remaining goal as a professional athlete. The hint of sweetness that crossed his stoic face said he knew how joyful and profound the rapport of a boy and a ball could be. Nearly all the canonical stories of Nash's ascent to the pantheon of N.B.A. point guards feature some kind of ball, whether it is the round mound of wadded-up tape he and his younger brother Martin used to play hall-hockey with, or the basketball he took out to shoot on Christmas Eve in the rain at the junior-high-school court behind his parents' house in Victoria, British Columbia, or the tennis ball he once dribbled around Santa Clara University on his way to class, or the soccer ball he once kept aloft for 600 consecutive kicks until he collapsed. A ball had been the talisman of what he called ''my dream.''
 Then again, maybe what the ball-crazed kid provoked had as much to do with the fact that Nash often found himself in the position of pretending to be Steve Nash, too: ''Steve Nash'' the brand pushing the ball up court on the Wheaties box or hawking watches and sneakers and bottles of Clearly Canadian water; ''Steve Nash'' the white, non-dunking, four-time all-star whose back-to-back Most Valuable Player Awards won him the unwanted role of minority-race champion in a predominantly black league; ''Steve Nash'' the self-effacing Canadian long shot whose life story had been pureed into an edifying fable about Chasing Your Dreams and Working Hard and Always Giving Back, and in some parts of his home country had been polished to such a saintly sheen that people called him Can-Je, short for ''Canadian Jesus.'' Nash himself sometimes seemed flustered by this double team of person and persona, struggling to reconcile his sardonic sense of humor and lethal competitive instincts with the humanitarian concerns that obliged him to ladle out all kinds of canned corn at charity events and celebrity appearances. What can you say without playing yourself false, or leaving your body completely, when zoo officials who have paid you the compliment of naming a 12-pound female Bengal tiger cub in your honor put the razor-clawed kitty-cat in your arms and stick a microphone in your face? (Shrewdly, Nash channeled Tiger Woods: ''It's pretty special.'') Or for that matter, what about the play-killing questions routinely lobbed by sportswriters after the game?
 ''It's always the same three questions,'' Nash said. '' 'What do you think about the game tonight?' 'How do you feel about the game tomorrow night?' 'What do you think you'll have to do differently next time?' I started off trying to answer honestly, and then I tried being ironic, but that didn't really work either. . . . '' 
 In the park, a stranger approached, hand extended.
 ''Steve Nash!'' the man said.
 ''Hey, man,'' Nash said, shaking his hand after a quick assessment. 
 ''I love your game.''
 ''Thanks.''
 Nash's game had been on the shelf for three months, since the Phoenix Suns were muscled out of the second round of the Western Conference playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs, who went on to win the N.B.A. championship against the overmatched Cleveland Cavaliers. It was a bitter end for the Suns' championship hopes, and for Nash especially. A Game 1 collision with Spurs guard Tony Parker had split his nose so badly that Nash had to leave the court at a crucial moment in the fourth quarter. It took six stitches to close the bloody gash. In Game 4 the Spurs forward Robert Horry forechecked him into the scorer's table, and the ensuing melee cost the Suns their big men when Amare Stoudemire and Boris Diaw were suspended one game each for leaving the bench. Losing the series 4-2 was a defeat that would ''forever haunt us,'' Nash said at the time. In the months since, he'd consoled himself with the distractions of New York, the adopted off-season city where he has spent the last three summers with his wife, Alejandra, and their twins, Lola and Bella.
 ''I've had a great summer,'' he was saying now as he stretched out on the bench. He was wearing cargo shorts, a gray T-shirt and laceless black Converse sneakers. ''I watched Tiger Woods and Roger Federer. I went to movies and restaurants. I had great conversations.''
 He stayed in shape mainly by working out with a trainer and playing soccer at Pier 40 off the Hudson River with a team sponsored by Phebe's Tavern & Grill in the East Village. When he took up basketball in the eighth grade it was for ''social reasons,'' a means of hanging out with his friends. Being able to use his hands felt almost like cheating, because the sport he loved best was soccer. '' 'Goal' was my first word,'' he told me, a vintage Nash brand detail found in nearly every profile of him. Nash's English father, John, played soccer professionally in South Africa, where Nash was born; his Welsh mother, Jean, had various careers as an airline ticket agent, secretary and special-education teacher. Sickened by apartheid, they emigrated to Canada when Steve was one, eventually settling in Victoria. 
 ''We had one little TV you had to turn on with tweezers, and even on Christmas Day we would watch the N.B.A.,'' recalled Joann Nash, who was born after Steve and Martin. ''When I was eight, I could recite the audio commentary on the Michael Jordan highlight video. It was burned into my mind.'' Joann, who recently married Manny Malhotra, a center for the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League, had been captain of the University of Victoria soccer team. Martin still earns his living as a midfielder for the Vancouver Whitecaps, a first-division team in the United Soccer League. In the family, the source of the kids' competitive fervor is not ascribed to their pro-athlete dad but to Mom, who can be counted on to dig deep for victory whether the game is tennis, Pictionary or simply beating other shoppers to the only open checkout lane at the grocery store.
 ''Steve makes a mockery of Pictionary,'' Joann said with a forlorn note in her voice. ''He won't take it seriously.''
 Nash's soul-salving summer had already included a trip to Thailand, and some time back home in July, where he opened a sports club and hosted a charity basketball game in Vancouver. He had spent three days in New Jersey tutoring college and high-school point guards at a camp organized by Nike. He also produced a video for Nike, with a crew shooting him as he legged around Manhattan on his skateboard. He sat for an interview with Charlie Rose, confiding in his self-deprecating way that there were other N.B.A. point guards who ''are more talented than me physically. . . . I say to myself, 'How do I have the same job as this guy?' '' 
 At 33, Nash has defied the actuarial trends of point-guard mortality. He has gotten steadily better with age and insists he is now not just smarter but quicker than when the Phoenix Suns, amid a crescendo of boos, made him the 15th pick in the first round of the 1996 N.B.A. draft. The statistical evidence bears him out. Last season Nash put up his finest numbers, better than some of those he posted in his two 
 M.V.P. years. He may not have the obvious physical gifts of some point guards, explosiveness or vertical leap, but his repertoire of inventive shots and ballhandling skills, his break-neck transitions and barn-swallow zigzagging through the tall timber of big men in the paint bespeaks exceptional body control. ''His core strength is off the charts,'' the Phoenix Suns' coach, Mike D'Antoni, told me. ''Steve's balance is so good he can stand on an exercise ball.''
 I'd been struck by Nash's poise, the mental counterpart of his physical balance. Talking to Charlie Rose, the word Nash had picked to describe his ideal state of mind on court was ''unflappable.'' Had he always been able to cast a cool eye at pressure?
 ''My first and second years in the N.B.A., I used to get really nervous in a tight game,'' he said. ''But now I wait for that moment when things are really close -- that's what I really love. Having the ball in my hands and the responsibility makes me feel calm and open. Not to have that, not to get to that point in a game, would feel really. . . .'' He paused to find the precise word. '' . . . Really confining,'' he said.
 ''Was there one shot or game when you first felt that way?''
 ''Probably it built over time -- I don't want it to sound like there's anything too mystical about it.''
 In a few days he was flying to England to visit relatives and meet with the officers of the Tottenham Hotspurs to discuss business opportunities with the soccer club. ''I'd like to be an owner,'' he says. ''It's something I could do for the rest of my life after my little window of popularity dies.'' In September he was leading a group of N.B.A. players to China for a series of charity events.
 We had been talking in the park for almost an hour now, and I was beginning to appreciate the elusive quality that the author Jack McCallum, who spent a year with the Phoenix Suns for his book '':07 Seconds or Less,'' described as Nash's ''mysterious Canadian reticence.'' Even though Nash is one of the more introspective and intelligent athletes in the N.B.A. -- a player who got a lot of criticism for speaking out against the war in Iraq in 2003, and had the sportswriter fraternity in a dither because his winter reading list included bodice-rippers like ''The Communist Manifesto'' and Solzhenitsyn's ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' -- it didn't seem that what made him interesting was coming out in conversation. Part of the reason may have been that what made Nash exceptional was his temperamental inclination to downplay what made him exceptional. In interviews he often conveys a mix of humility and politic self-restraint.
 As Nash began to fidget on the bench -- maybe his back was tightening up, or he was thinking about Lola's supper, or he was just tired of answering questions and the full-court press of chores entailed in being ''Steve Nash'' -- I remembered something his agent, Bill Duffy, had told me: ''With Steve it's all about the flow.'' Flow, of course, being shorthand for that state of mind that artists and athletes strive to enter into, and which in full flood entails an ecstatic expansion of consciousness that releases them from confines of the self and produces crowning moments of creation and performance -- not to get too mystical about it. Maybe the truest picture of Nash depended on seeing him in motion, in the flow; whether he was threading a half-court bounce pass or exploiting his small window of fame to get potable water to third world villages or practicing surreptitious acts of generosity, like slipping spending money to the coaches to give to his less wealthy basketball teammates at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. Enacting himself, as it were, as opposed to talking about himself. 
 Three-Point Land and Beyond 
 ''Hey, rooks,'' Nash shouted from the back of the bus idling in the garage of the Regent Beijing hotel. ''What time does the 9:30 bus leave?''
 It was a trick question, of course, but the ''rooks'' -- D. J. Strawberry Jr. and Alando Tucker, both new members of the Phoenix Suns -- froze.
 ''They told us to go back and get our umbrellas,'' said Strawberry, a shooting guard and the son of the former New York Mets star outfielder Darryl Strawberry. 
 ''Let's go!'' Nash hollered to no one in particular. Apparently more stragglers were still fetching umbrellas. It was nearly 10 a.m., a rainy Thursday in mid-September, though in truth you couldn't be sure what time it was from the coal-and-car-fume miasma obscuring China's capital.
 Among the two dozen or so passengers on the bus -- agents, trainers, friends, a reality-show film crew -- were eight N.B.A. players: the rooks Strawberry and Tucker; the 20-year-old Detroit Pistons forward Amir Johnson; Paul Davis, a 23-year-old center with the L.A. Clippers; Chuck Hayes, a 24-year-old forward with the Houston Rockets; and the established stars like the Suns' Leandro Barbosa (the ''Brazilian Blur,'' who last year won the N.B.A.'s Sixth Man Award); Carmelo Anthony, the outstanding forward for the Denver Nuggets who was one of the top scorers in the league last year; and Baron Davis, the street-Shakespeare point guard who led the Golden State Warriors on an improbable run that was the dramatic highlight of the N.B.A. playoffs last spring. 
 And of course Nash, riding a flow unlike any he'd ever caught on the basketball court, as much a celebrity as an athlete now, his Q-score jacked up by photos with Sharon Stone and Donald Trump and the M.V.P. shout-out in the lyrics of Nelly Furtado's hit ''Promiscuous'' and the GQ ''baller of the year'' spread featuring an epicene Nash with overly sculpted hair. The fame that had recently produced the tribute of his face stenciled into an Arizona cornfield had also given him the power to ''make a difference.'' Befitting a point guard, he seemed to be feeling his way through celebrity, into that seam between his identity in a profession that had defined his existence since the eighth grade, when he prophetically informed his mother that one day he would play in the N.B.A., and whatever he might become or do next, out of uniform, away from the confines of the court and the quest for championships.
 As the impresario who put the whole China show together, with crucial behind-the-scenes help from Bill Duffy and a team of people from his company, BDA Sports Management, Nash had suspended his mysterious Canadian reticence in hopes of improving the flow of a sightseeing trip to the Forbidden City. Nash broached the idea of the Beijing tour with Yao Ming after a game with the Rockets in Phoenix last March. Yao was thrilled by the prospect of Nash and a pick-up crew of players coming to China to help raise money for charity. Bing Hu, the Chinese founder of a high-end architecture development company in Scottsdale, Ariz., had offered to fly the cast to China on his Falcon 900 jet. Eventually an agenda was set, calling for a four-day barnstorm of press conferences, practices, luncheons, a charity auction and black-tie banquet, sightseeing, photo ops, random cultural encounters and unofficial karaoke pub crawls, along with a televised charity hoops match that would pit Western Hemisphere pros (the Nashionals?) against Yao and the Chinese National team, and would, as it turned out, draw a Chinese TV audience more than three times the size of the horde agglomerated by the Super Bowl. 
 The Nashionals had landed in China the night before, Sept. 12, and had come shuffling in glassy-eyed from the airport, luggage in tow, to a surreal press conference at the Regent Beijing. Backed by a drop cloth splattered with corporate logos, they sat Last Supper-style along a table onstage, peering out at a bank of eight TV cameras and some 60 Chinese journalists. An earsplitting remix of Queen's ''We Will Rock You'' pumped through speakers.
 ''I just want to say that we're here to help out the children in your community,'' Nash said. He was wearing below-the-knee shorts, a gray shirt and, as he had in Washington Market Park, black laceless sneakers. ''I think so highly of Yao as a person and a player that I asked if he'd be willing to host some of us to come over here and give back. I want to thank the guys for making the long trip.'' 
 The proceeds would go to build schools and help impoverished girls in the Xinjiang Kezilesu Keerkzi Autonomous Region, a vast and sparsely settled area in Western China, which most people would be hard-pressed to find on a map, much less pronounce. This was Nash's first trip to China, and it wasn't unreasonable to wonder whether his interest in charity work thousands of miles from home in an alien culture where he doesn't understand the language was really a heartfelt reflection of altruistic values. Pieties about the importance of Giving Back are so routinely coughed up you'd think that if N.B.A. stars didn't have such wicked cross-over dribbles or a faculty for tomahawk dunks they'd all be following in the footsteps of Albert Schweitzer. The benefits that redound in P.R. brownie points and I.R.S. income-tax offsets are seldom mentioned. 
 But Nash often speaks of his interest in ''the global village'' and doing what he can wherever he can. The Steve Nash Foundation has focused on programs that help ''under-served'' children and promote worthwhile social and environmental causes, like low-impact development and eco-friendly construction. (The rugs in Nash's new sports club in Vancouver are made of recycled athletic shoelaces.) His foundation has also set up safe drinking water projects in Nicaragua and Guatemala and recently underwrote a hospital ward for neonates in Paraguay, where Nash's wife is from.
 Most of the rooks and younger players on the trip were just curious to see a patch of China for the first time; some of the more established stars were eager to enhance their brand visibility in the largest basketball market outside the United States. One third of all hits to the N.B.A. Web site come from Chinese Internet users, and in recent years the N.B.A. has made a concerted effort to capitalize on what is already China's multibillion-dollar love affair with basketball, going so far as to publish a partial list of N.B.A. players' Chinese nicknames. (Nash is not on it, for some reason, perhaps because the Chinese haven't solved the conundrum of his mysterious Canadian reticence, either. But Carmelo Anthony is known as Sweet Melon, and in what is clearly the most telling evidence of Chinese basketball acumen, Tim Duncan, nemesis of Nash and his fellow Suns, is known as Stone Buddha.)
 Nash was as happy to have the good publicity as the next multi-millionaire, but the trip was clearly part of a course in continuing education. He studied sociology at Santa Clara University, where he did enough to get by. ''I basically majored in basketball,'' he told me. He reads during the season when the team is on the road with time to fill, and he is eager to travel abroad during the off-season, pressed, it often seems, by a deep curiosity and thirst for knowledge that the strictures of his N.B.A. dream didn't give him the luxury of indulging as a younger man. Of course it was a two-edged sword. The celebrity that made it possible to come to China also brought the unscholarly and flow-impeding distraction of having to stop every 10 seconds to pose for pictures or sign an autograph.
 The microphone was passed to all the players, including the rooks. Suddenly flashbulbs went off in the back of the room and a hubbub broke out. Yao Ming, the colossus of Chinese basketball, had unexpectedly arrived. He thundered in wearing a white polo shirt as long as a crib sheet. Photographers herded Nash and Yao together, Nash, 6-foot-3, Yao, 7-foot-6. Side by side they looked like a comparative bar graph of Chinese and Canadian economic growth rates. 
 Now, a day later, fully provisioned with umbrellas, the Nashionals' bus pulled into the traffic of Beijing's Dongcheng district and headed west toward the Forbidden City. Arriving at the Divine Military Genius Gate, the players filed out into the toxic drizzle, and into the vast palace complex that is the heart of Chinese civilization. Nash stepped out of the flow of tourists at one point and stood under an umbrella by a parapet to make a phone call. When he turned around he was ringed by a semicircle of Chinese sightseers, more interested in him than the gargoyles on the Hall of Supreme Harmony. It was to be a recurring theme, the players constantly assembling for pictures with strangers and with one another, the last of the morning a semi-comical group portrait at the Gate of Heavenly Peace, where a giant picture of Mao looked out over Tiananmen Square.
 ''I'm gonna do that,'' Baron Davis said. ''Buy me some property way out in the middle of nowhere and put up a big-ass picture of myself!''
 That night there was a black-tie auction and banquet for six or seven hundred people. When the bus pulled up at the Diaoyutai State Guest House, where Richard Nixon had stayed and met with Premier Chou En-lai on his landmark trip to China in 1972, the Chinese team was milling around the entrance. 
 ''They're probably thinking, 'Goddamn Nash,' '' said Nash, who was wearing a gray suit and black shoes. '' 'If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have to be standing here doing this stupid stuff.' ''
 It was a long night, especially for Nash. The suit. The play-by-play of gala stage business in Mandarin. The banquet board of bloodless beef, which, later, on the way back to the hotel, Baron Davis speculated may have been a flank of Snoopy or one of Michael Vick's pit bulls. (''You bite into that meat you gonna be barking! You gonna grow paws!'') The jet lag seemed to be catching up with Nash. Arms clasped behind his back, he stood gamely on the stage while the crowd bid in a strangely prolonged and desultory fashion on a basketball holiday from China to Houston and passes to the opening of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Somebody bid $60,000 for a special one-off edition of a Yao & Nash-embossed Platinum Visa card.
 ''Although it is a beautiful card,'' Nash said, ''they don't get to spend our bank accounts.''
 Nash was bearing up as if he were the true Stone Buddha. He listened earnestly to a musical performance by the Moon, the Sun and the Star, a Mongolian family trio famous for having had the No. 1 ringtone in China for six months. Given how the sheer volume of people in China made everyone seem sort of faceless, I wondered if Nash's fortitude, his willingness to stop again and again and again to pose and scribble his name and stretch out his hand, was in some way a measure of his ability to particularize an abstraction -- that is, to know that everything he was doing to improve the lives of girls in that all-but-Platonic realm known as the Xinjiang Kezilesu Keerkzi Autonomous Region would give a real and particular child a real and particular book that would sweeten her day, or awaken an idea that would make a difference in her life. Whoever she was. . . . 
 Near midnight Nash climbed wearily aboard the bus and stood in the aisle. 
 ''I know it was a long night, guys,'' he said. ''And the food was rough. But we raised almost a million dollars tonight. So thanks to all of you.''
 At the Nashionals practice on Friday morning before the game with the Chinese team, Nash and Leandro Barbosa were locked into a fierce 
 H-O-R-S-E battle. It was a test of wits as much as skill. Making a key shot, Nash pumped his fist, as if victory in H-O-R-S-E meant as much as an N.B.A. championship. After the game, Barbosa unleashed a slam dunk. Nash gave it a college try, but the ball clanged off the iron. Nash's college coach, Dick Davey, had told me he thought he could remember Nash dunking a few times in college, ''but only on a really springy floor.'' 
 I asked afterward who won the H-O-R-S-E games. 
 ''We kinda split them,'' Nash said.
 ''I won two,'' Barbosa said. ''The third one we tied.''
 When the practice was over and the players were waiting to get on the bus, Yao, who had been practicing with the Nashionals, walked out and crammed himself into the passenger seat of an Audi A-8 sedan with tinted windows. People stared at the car in disbelief. The window came down and there was Yao, head sideways, cervical vertebrae pressed against the roof. He looked like a coal miner in a cave-in.
 ''It's not my car,'' Yao said.
 The Flow He Knows
 The venue for the Yao & Nash Charity Game was an arena in the west of the city called Capital Steel Plant Basketball Center, which looked to seat around 6,000 people.
 ''Why am I so tired?'' Nash asked as the bus pulled into the traffic outside the hotel around 5:30 p.m. and immediately lost momentum.
 ''It's, like, 4 a.m. in the morning in Phoenix,'' said Aaron Nelson, the Suns' trainer.
 ''It'd be O.K. if you made a few early turnovers so I have to bench you,'' said Bill Duffy, a former player himself who was going to coach the Nashionals.
 Nash lay down on the backseat and closed his eyes. 
 Even with the help of a police escort, we reached the arena a scant 15 minutes before the scheduled 7:30 start of the game. Throngs of people from China's seemingly limitless supply of N.B.A. fans were massed outside around the gate and hanging out of the windows of temporary workers' housing. The game was a sell-out, but apparently safety regulations required a certain number of empty seats. 
 In the visitors' locker room, Nash began to get himself into the flow. He nipped at a basketball with his feet, and before long was booting it back and forth with Barbosa, over a table of bananas and Snickers bars and off the metal ceiling -- bang! It was as if Nash and his brother Martin were kids playing hall hockey and seeing what they could get away with before they broke a lamp or drove Mom buggy. Bang! Nash had told me he always liked to be playing a game within the game, if only to keep alive that spark of whimsy and invention that seemed almost subversively opposed to the business of the pro game.
 ''When you go in, run around the whole arena,'' said Duffy.
 ''Move the needle,'' cried Bill Sanders, an agent with Duffy's company.
 ''Remember, guys,'' said Baron Davis, ''this is just a charity game.''
 After the film star Jackie Chan tossed the opening jump ball, the Chinese team raced out to the lead. The 6-foot-9 point guard Sun Yue, who had been drafted by the Lakers, was dunking at will when not deigning to can 3's from downtown. Of course the Chinese hadn't flown halfway around the world, or been out till 5 a.m. singing karaoke, or fretting about the provenance of the banquet beef. Nash threw a dilly of a one-handed bounce pass down the lane to a cutting Carmelo Anthony, but Sweet Melon's shot was blocked by Yi Jianlian, the 6-foot-11 first-round draft choice who would be playing for the Milwaukee Bucks in the fall. Every time Yao made a basket, or even touched the ball, 6,000 of his countrymen broke into song, singing a little rising-falling ditty: ''Yao Ming! Yao Ming!'' Yao snared a rebound and held the ball out of reach like a father holding a pinata at a birthday party of leaping 3-year-olds. And at the end of the first quarter, the Chinese team led by 17 points. 
 But then the Nashionals began to get into the flow. Barbosa the Brazilian Blur got hot from 3-point land. Baron ''Remember It's Just a Charity Game'' Davis went diving into the stands. Nash drove coast-to-coast and hit one of his acrobatic left-handed layups over Yao, and by the half the Chinese lead had shrunk to 42-37. 
 Nash's one-handed bounce pass reminded me of a story I'd heard from Dick Davey, the Santa Clara coach, who had been the only man in college basketball interested in recruiting the future two-time M.V.P. They were having lunch a couple of years ago, and the coach had a bone to pick with his former protege. 
 ''I said to him, 'Dammit, Steve, you penetrate the paint and you kick the ball out with one hand, you gotta do it with two hands.' And he said, 'If I do it with one hand, it's about three-tenths of a second faster, and my teammate is going to have a better look at the basket.' Do you want to know how smart he is? If he had a guy on the right wing in transition who he knew couldn't shoot the ball, he'd throw a pass that was just good enough to include the guy in the fast break, but just bad enough that the guy wasn't in a position to get off a shot and would have to pass the ball back.''
 At the start of the third quarter, in front of a CCTV audience estimated at 250 million, Nash stripped off his shorts. He posed a moment in his black compression underwear, as if ready for another GQ shoot, and then climbed into a pair of red shorts, thus defecting to the Chinese team. Perhaps he felt it was the most charitable thing he could do, not just for the girls of the Xinjiang Kezilesu Keerkzi Autonomous Region but for all of China. But, alas, all the tension went out of the game. Flow without meaning. By the end, a bunch of players had changed sides, and after a flurry of empty whoop-de-do dunks, the final score of 101-92 in favor of the home team was hardly worth remembering. 
 Back in street clothes but still drenched in sweat, Yao ducked into the visitors' locker room. ''Thank you for doing this for the Chinese people,'' he said. The Nashionals spontaneously broke into the signature singsong chant: ''Yao Ming! Yao Ming!''
 Nash had gotten the numbers. ''We raised $2.5 million,'' he told the players. ''That money will build 70 schools. That's 35,000 kids who'll be able to go to school. So to all of you guys, thanks a lot.''
 Sweet Melon emerged from the shower with a towel around his waist and said: ''I know about five or six schools in Baltimore that need help, y'all.''
 A Basket With His Arms
 I stopped off in Phoenix on my way back from China and spent a few days watching Nash and his Suns teammates scrimmage on the practice court in the US Airways Center. The scrimmages were unofficial, as training camp wouldn't start for a couple of weeks, but there was no shortage of intensity. Among the players running with Nash were Suns regulars Barbosa, Amare Stoudemire and Marcus Banks, along with their new teammate Grant Hill. There were some good players from Europe trying to catch on. They kept the flow going with a 24-second clock and got into arguments about the score and whether on one possession one team had been unfairly denied an extra four seconds. During breaks when players flopped down onto benches and threw back cups of water, often the only person on the court, practicing shots, was Nash.
 Three years ago, newly repatriated to Phoenix, which had traded him to the Dallas Mavericks in 1998, Nash's back went out during practice, the result of a congenital displacement of his fifth lumbar vertebra. To relieve the muscle tightness, he now will often lie on the court during rests and timeouts. And though Nash may be getting better and better as a player, his body doesn't recover from exertion as fast. Nash's preferred method of treating his sore muscles and swollen joints is to lever himself into a 53-degree ice bath, wearing thermal socks to keep the frostbite out of his toes.
 ''I can't even pull a beer out of water that cold,'' says the Suns' assistant coach Alvin Gentry.
 Over the summer Nash opted not to take a spot on the Canadian Olympic basketball team, wanting to rest and conserve his energy for the upcoming run at the championship he covets. He has two years left on his contract with the Phoenix Suns; barring a catastrophic injury, he could certainly get another deal if he desired. (The Hall of Fame point guard John Stockton, with whom Nash is often compared, played until he was 41.) How long he plays in the N.B.A. seems as much a matter of a willing mind as an able body. 
 ''I've always said when Steve retires, I'll retire,'' Coach Mike D'Antoni said. We were sitting in a little gallery off the practice court watching the scrimmage. ''I don't want anyone to be able to figure out whether our success is because of my system or Steve's ability to make it work. There's a period in a player's life where the novelty wears off. You've got kids and money, and sometimes your basketball flame begins to flicker. And then a few years later, you realize you've got a limited amount of time and this is the best it's ever gonna be. I think Steve is one of those guys who has always lived for the game. You can have all the money in the world, but for the great players the only thing that matters is winning a title.''
 When Nash was done with the scrimmage and some work in the weight room, we headed over to Kincaid's near the US Airways arena to get some lunch. He ordered a couple of salads. 
 ''There are nights when I ask myself, 'Am I really playing basketball?' '' Nash said. ''But that's mostly from the stuff around the game: talking to the media, taking the bus, getting warmed up. Once I'm out on the court, in the game, the game is great.''
 I asked what drove him, beyond the obvious goal of a championship.
 ''I don't know,'' he said. ''I have a lot of energy and a lot of motivation. I have a hard time sitting still. I guess in a way I can't live with the alternative to being driven, which is sitting around being bored. If I'm going to go for something, I'm really going to go for it. I think I realized as a kid that I would keep going when other kids stopped. If my legs are there, if my quickness is there, I can have a good game. If not, I try to find other ways of making plays without being quick. Making smart plays. Making the game simple.''
 Like he had the last day in China, when the Nashionals were literally mobbed at a fitness-club opening with Yao Ming and Jackie Chan. When they were all safely back on the bus, waiting to be shuttled to the airport for the long flight home, the die-hards in the crowd milled around on the sidewalk, taking pictures and waving at players behind the windows. All except one kid, who was about 12 or 13 years old. He wore glasses. He wasn't tall. He was draped in a purple-and-white Steve Nash Phoenix Suns jersey, No. 13. He stood outside Nash's window and pantomimed jump shot after jump shot, like he was Steve Nash. He had Nash's form down pat -- the slight gathering before the jump, the leap straight up, elbows squared, the impeccable wrist-break that left the hand lingering a moment high overhead like it was pleased with itself. Even the way Nash sometimes crimped his lips when he shot. ''Look at this dude, he's wiggin' out,'' one of the players said. Everyone in the bus was falling apart laughing. Again and again, as dogged as a gym rat with a dream, No. 13 launched an imaginary ball. Nash for three from the sidewalk! Nash from half court! Nash from downtown Beijing! And then he untied one of his sneakers and began to fire off shots with it, hopping on one foot, form still constant. Nash went to the window and made a basket with his arms.
 ''Right here, dude!'' he said through the glass.
 But the kid just slung the sneaker straight up in the air.
 ''No, right here,'' Nash said again, tapping the pane, and again he made a basket with his arms. The kid saw what Nash wanted; he jumped and sent his sneaker arcing toward the hoop. If there hadn't been glass in the way, it would have gone in. 
 ''Yeah! Atta boy!'' said Nash, and when the bus pulled out, he blew the kid a kiss.

HEADLINE: A Half, A Quarter Or None?

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THE Federal Reserve is likely to make one of three moves on interest rates on Wednesday. Two of them would be bad for the stock market, one strategist warns, although it is the third, benign possibility that he and others consider most likely. 
 Komal Sri-Kumar, chief global strategist at the TCW Group, a fund management firm in Los Angeles, expects a cut of a quarter of a percentage point, as does a Bloomberg News poll of economists. As Mr. Sri-Kumar explains it, either of the other two choices -- holding rates steady or cutting by half a point -- is not acceptable at all.
 The preponderance of evidence highlighting the dismal state of the housing market, as well as recent reports showing flat to lower corporate earnings, makes clear how fragile a state the economy is in, Mr. Sri-Kumar said. That should discourage the Fed from standing pat.
 The chances for a half-point cut should drop with every cent that the dollar falls against the euro and other currencies, in his view. A substantially weaker dollar makes inflation more of a risk because it raises prices for imported goods.
 Another potential byproduct of a soft dollar is a decline in investment by foreigners in American stocks and bonds. The possibility of such an outcome could hurt the stock market if the Fed opted for the bigger cut.
 A half-point move might briefly send share prices higher, but the rally would falter as traders began to worry about the impact of a tumbling dollar, Mr. Sri-Kumar said. If the Fed does not move at all, he said, the prevailing opinion would be that the central bank, which was so helpful a month ago, had done nothing further to support an obviously flagging economy. The Fed cut rates half a point on Sept. 18.
 A big rate cut or none would be disastrous for the stock market, but in different ways, he warned. The middling course, a quarter-point cut, would produce a rally, he predicted -- but just a middling one.
 If the Fed decides on the quarter-point reduction, he said, ''I think there will be one more relief rally, but it will not be as great as after Sept. 18 because other negatives are starting to outweigh the possible impact of Fed rate cuts.''
 Alluding to the palpable economic and corporate weakness confronting investors, he added that ''you can't offset all of that'' with one more quarter-point cut.
 DATA WATCH The Fed decision may overshadow an event that otherwise might have occupied center stage this week: the report on employment conditions in October, which is to be released on Friday. The Bloomberg poll estimates that the economy will have added 80,000 net jobs in the month, down from 110,000 in September.

HEADLINE: To Know Contractors, Know Government

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
ALLEGATIONS of misbehavior by employees of Blackwater USA in the shooting deaths of 17 Iraqis have brought the military's use of private contractors into question. But whatever the possible sins of the Blackwater firm, the overall problem is not private contracting in itself; contractors do not set the tone but rather reflect the sins and virtues of their customers, namely their sponsoring governments.
 It is easy to rail against contractors for holding money above loyalty to country; Halliburton, for instance, has been a target of this criticism. But money isn't the real issue. Few Americans would join the armed services without pay, and most American weapons are made by the private sector for profit. 
 Furthermore, privateers, private ships licensed to carry out warfare, helped win the American Revolution and the War of 1812. In World War II, the Flying Tigers, American fighter pilots hired by the government of Chiang Kai-shek, helped defeat the Japanese. Today, many of our allies receive payment, either implicitly or explicitly, to support American efforts. War is, among other things, an economic undertaking, so the profit motive in military affairs isn't always bad or ignoble.
 When it comes to supplying troops, or protecting high-ranking officials, private military contractors often offer greater flexibility and rapidity of response. The employees, many of whom are former soldiers or operatives, tend to have more experience than current, mostly younger soldiers.
 The recent comeback of private contracting suggests that central governments have become weaker again, at least relative to the tasks they are undertaking. Alexander Tabarrok, my colleague (and sometimes co-author) at George Mason University, where he is also a professor of economics, traced the history of private contractors in a study, ''The Rise, Fall, and Rise Again of Privateers'' (The Independent Review, spring 2007, www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=49&articleID=631). He showed that public navies and armies began to displace private contractors in the 19th century, as governments became more powerful and better funded.
 Today, America no longer has a draft, its military bureaucracy can be inflexible and the public wishes to be insulated from the direct impact of war. Contractors are a symptom of government weakness, but are not the problem itself. The first Persian Gulf War, which enjoyed greater international support, was not reliant on contractors to nearly the same degree.
 Among many Iraqis, Blackwater and other companies have a reputation for getting the job done without much caring about Iraqis who get in the way. But part of the problem may stem from economic incentives. If Blackwater is assigned to protect a top American official, who is later assassinated, Blackwater may lose future business. A private contractor doesn't have a financial incentive to protect Iraqi citizens, who are not paying customers. Ultimately, this reflects the priorities of the United States military itself. American casualties are carefully recorded and memorialized, but there is no count of Iraqi civilian deaths.
 It is harder to recognize when private contractors are being underemployed. During the Rwandan civil war in the 1990s, the United Nations debated using two private contractors, Executive Outcomes or Sandline International, to intervene. The U.N. rejected the notion and instead turned to a poorly trained Zairean police contingent. We'll never know how private contractors would have fared, but the Zaireans were ineffective; some 800,000 Rwandans were murdered. 
 Yet the use of contractors is not a free lunch.
 Compared with the military, contractors are not subject to direct scrutiny by Congress and they are not covered by international law with the same clarity. Excessive use of private contractors erodes checks and balances, and it substitutes market transactions, controlled by the executive branch, for traditional political mechanisms of accountability. When it comes to Iraq, we've yet to see the evidence of a large practical gain in return; instead, use of contractors may have helped to make an ill-advised venture possible. 
 When private contractors are combined with government troops, the contractors usually can't do much better than the setting in which they are asked to perform. 
 When things are going well and the ''good guys'' are in control, the flexibility and experience of military contractors can make things go even better. But when the environment is hostile and events are spiraling out of control, the incentives of private contractors may lead to many mistakes.
 Note that a serious issue for Blackwater -- the allegations about needless deaths of innocent civilians -- has also been an issue for United States government forces from the beginning of the conflict.
 Most of all, contractors are appealing when a victory is possible in relatively quick order. The potential accountability problems won't linger for long; conversely, few contractors will look good when a conflict runs on for years.
 Currently, the chances of establishing a stable Iraqi government appear quite low. In other words, there is little upside, and an unstated goal of American policy may be simply to limit the damage. If so, we should be cutting back on private contractors, as the critics are suggesting, because there is no desirable end in sight. Of course, those same reasons suggest troop cutbacks as well.
 In the next conflict, however, the temptation to use contractors may again be strong. What if private contractors offer a real chance of making a positive difference? For instance, it was the private firm SITE Intelligence Group that obtained the first American copy of what is believed to be the latest video from Osama bin Laden, although it seems that government leaks have since damaged the trail of intelligence.
 Private contractors may not respect virtue for its own sake, but like most businesses, they will respect the wishes of their most powerful customers, in this case governments. What is wrong with Blackwater may, most of all, mirror what is wrong with Uncle Sam.

HEADLINE: Homey, With a Downtown in Transition

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
BY their own description, Eli and Elissa Slomnicki aren't the kind of people interested in keeping up with the Joneses. 
 When they decided to move from an apartment in Queens, they covered an area from Passaic, N.J., to Monsey, N.Y., seeking the right spot to raise their daughters, Rivka, 3 1/2, and Tova, 1. They kept coming back to West Hempstead, Mr. Slomnicki's childhood home. 
 A four-square-mile unincorporated area of 6,500 homes within the town of Hempstead, the neighborhood has an ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' appeal. It's not unusual there to find parents and their grown children living around the corner from one another. 
 ''It is a humble community,'' said Mr. Slomnicki, 27, a teacher. ''There is a wholesomeness, a community feeling.'' 
 In November, the family will be moving into a 1,700-square-foot center-hall colonial with a ''nice front yard'' and a ''nice sideyard,'' for which they paid about half a million dollars, he said. 
 Affordability was ''a priority,'' but he also emphasized what had truly won everyone over: a lack of ''pretension, which is good, especially considering it is Long Island.'' 
 The house, built in 1940, is within walking distance of his parents' and sisters' homes, as well as the family's place of worship: Young Israel of West Hempstead, an Orthodox Jewish synagogue. It is also a reasonable commute from Mr. Slomnicki's teaching job in Westchester and his wife's work as a speech pathologist in Queens. 
 Besides its central location, easy access to public transportation, parks, shopping and beaches, the Slomnickis' new home is a three-minute stroll from a new $10 million public library that opened last week on the site of a gas station and run-down strip mall.
 ''My baby sitter doesn't need to be driven there'' to take the children to story hour, Mr. Slomnicki said. 
 Yet the pleasures anticipated by the Slomnickis from their new life in this Nassau County suburb aren't easily perceptible to those who just pass through the 10-acre swath of West Hempstead's blighted downtown, along Hempstead Avenue near the Long Island Rail Road tracks. 
 At its center is the Courtesy Hotel, a '60s-era structure long a magnet for police activity. Rosalie Norton, a 40-year resident of West Hempstead who is president of its civic association, described the hotel as ''an embarrassment to our community.'' 
 To revitalize, she added, ''the community has been pressuring for this hotel to be closed, in any way, shape, size or form, for a number of years.'' Rallies have been held and more than 2,200 residents have signed a petition.
 The town of Hempstead has devised an urban renewal plan, but it is in the early stages of development. Ms. Norton's group is backing a quicker solution: a $64 million 176-unit luxury apartment building on the Courtesy site, proposed by Trammell Crow Residential, an Atlanta-based developer, which has already agreed on a purchase price with its owner, 140 Equities Inc. 
 Maria Rigopoulos, a development associate for Trammell Crow, said that the hotel's location near the train station would be ''perfect for commuters.'' With a clubhouse, swimming pool and landscaped courtyards, she added, the complex would ''change the whole look of Hempstead Avenue.'' 
 Charles T. Theofan, Hempstead's planning commissioner, agreed that the Courtesy looks ''just awful.'' But to him and other officials, the sticking point is the Trammell plan's density. To retain West Hempstead's ambience, he said, ''you must draw the line somewhere.'' 
 Hempstead's plan calls for rezoning the site to 45 units per acre and contemplates proposals for a mix of residences and retailing, parking and open space from four developers. The Trammell Crow project calls for 65 units per acre.
 Councilman Edward A. Ambrosino said residents' wishes were clear. ''I think that the entire community, from the senior citizens to the newborns, are in favor of a private sale of the Courtesy hotel'' to Trammell, he said.
 A. Thomas Levin, a lawyer for 140 Equities, expressed frustration, saying of officials, ''One would think they would live up to their promises that they would work with the community and us'' to make the deal, ''but they are not.''
 A hearing on the two opposing plans is scheduled for Nov. 13. 
 What You'll Find
 ''The biggest problem in West Hempstead is that our commercial areas do not reflect the character of the residential areas,'' said Nikki Stamatas Thaw, a local broker. 
 Beyond the shopping strips on Hempstead Turnpike, Hempstead Avenue and, to a lesser extent, Woodfield Road, are quiet streets lined with 1920s-to-1950s-era Dutch colonials and Tudors along with a few slightly newer raised ranches. The neighborhood fills a pocket south of Garden City, east of Franklin Square, west of Hempstead Village and, beyond Hempstead Lake State Park, north of Rockville Centre and Malverne. 
 It is clearly feeling the effects of renovation fever. The original homes are modest, but David Zivotofsky, a broker at Ark Real Estate in West Hempstead, says homeowners are ''taking ranches and Capes and squaring them off and making colonials.'' 
 The area is mostly white, with a substantial Orthodox Jewish population along with several churches, including the imposing St. Thomas the Apostle Roman Catholic complex. Restaurants abound, a number of them kosher. 
 ''Everybody gets along,'' said Ms. Norton of the civic association. ''They all support what is necessary for a common cause.'' 
 What You'll Pay
 Inventories are up and prices are down in the 11552 ZIP code. 
 There are 166 homes on the market, ranging from $299,000 to $1.099 million, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. There are also three co-ops for sale in the hamlet's one complex, ranging from $189,000 to $195,000. 
 For the second quarter of this year, the average price in West Hempstead was $429,100, almost 9 percent below the $471,500 average during the same period last year. According to the multiple listing service, 43 homes sold in the second quarter of 2006; during the same time frame this year, 32 sold. 
 Homes are also staying on the market longer, an average of 131 days this year versus 75 last year. 
 For buyers, however, treasures are plentiful. After 10 years living in a co-op in Mineola, Tom and Claudia Kirk, clothing store owners, are planning to close in December on a quaint $469,000 three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath Tudor. 
 ''It was a better value house-wise,'' said Mr. Kirk, who like many newcomers to West Hempstead also looked in Garden City and Rockville Centre. 
 What to Do 
 The town, county and state all offer amenities. 
 One county site scheduled for a face lift is Hall's Pond Park -- 11 acres, half of it a pond. The calendar includes summer concerts, a winter holiday celebration, a fall fair and an Easter egg hunt. 
 The Echo Park indoor pool complex, open to Hempstead town residents, has a diving tank, saunas, weight rooms and a seasonal outdoor pool. Fees run from $5.50 daily for individuals to $440 for a one-year family membership.
 At Hempstead Lake State Park, site of the largest lake in Nassau County, fishing is catch and release only, though two smaller ponds within the park are stocked with trout in the fall. Hempstead Lake Park also has 20 tennis courts, playgrounds, basketball courts, a hand-carved wooden carousel, bridle trails and a picnic pavilion. 
 At 27,300 square feet, West Hempstead's new library will double as a community center, according to its director, Regina Mascia. 
 The Schools
 Just over 300 of the 1,000 students who attend West Hempstead High School commute from Island Park, under a contract arrangement that has been in place for about 40 years.
 A total of another 1,300 students attend the district's kindergarten center at the Chestnut School, Grades 1 through 5 at the George Washington and Cornwell Avenue Schools, and the West Hempstead Middle School.
 SAT averages for 2007 were 476 for reading, 493 in math and 462 in writing, versus 491, 505 and 482 statewide. 
 The Hebrew Academy of Nassau County, an Orthodox yeshiva, has an elementary school with 350 students in kindergarten through Grade 6 and 100 in a separate preschool. Tuition ranges from $3,275 a year for a three-day toddler program, to $7,500 for kindergarten to $11,200 for 6th grade. 
 St. Thomas the Apostle School, a Catholic school with 500 children in prekindergarten through Grade 8, charges $3,460 per child. 
 The Commute
 West Hempstead, with two exits on the Southern State Parkway, is a 32-mile drive from Midtown Manhattan. The West Hempstead line of the Long Island Rail Road makes three stops there. Train rides to Pennsylvania Station take 48 to 60 minutes, some with transfers in Jamaica. Monthly tickets cost $178, slightly less online. The Metropolitan Transit Authority offers bus service to the Roosevelt Field mall, Long Beach, the Belmont Park race track and Valley Stream. 
 The History
 The hamlet's name dates to the late 1800s, when the Long Island Rail Road built a station on Hempstead Turnpike west of Hempstead village. Seven years ago, residents considered changing the name to Mayfair Park.
 The scheme was eventually voted down. The change, supported by the West Hempstead Civic Association and the local chamber of commerce, was criticized by residents who sensed bigotry in the attempt to distinguish the mostly white community from Hempstead, its largely black and Hispanic neighbor, which has a higher crime rate and a weaker economy.

MUSICOPHILIA 
 Tales of Music and the Brain. 
 By Oliver Sacks. 
 381 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.
 Urban legend has it that when a patron fell ill in Carnegie Hall and the call went out for a doctor in the house, half the audience stood up to help. Perhaps the concert was a medical benefit; more likely, it never happened. But there does seem to be no shortage of doctors who are musical, at least in New York, and one of them is Oliver Sacks, a neurologist and author, who has now combined two of his passions in one book. 
 In his earlier collections of clinical tales -- most famously in ''Awakenings'' (1973) and ''The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat'' (1985) -- Sacks presented with compassion, sensitivity and learning what, in coarser hands, might have been freak shows of the mind. The genre could have been an exploitative sideshow: a parade of misfits whose brains have been weirdly affected by disease, trauma, congenital defect or medical treatment. But Sacks is adept at turning neurological narratives into humanly affecting stories, by showing how precariously our worlds are poised on a little biochemistry. The result is a sort of reverse-engineering of the soul. 
 His new collection starts quite literally with a bolt from the blue, when a 42-year-old surgeon, Tony Cicoria, was struck by lightning in 1994. Cicoria's heart apparently stopped, but he was resuscitated, and a few weeks later he was back at work. Everything seemed normal until this fan of rock music was suddenly seized by a craving for classical piano music. He bought recordings, acquired a piano and began to teach himself to play. Then his head began to be flooded with music that seemed to come, unstoppably, from nowhere. Within three months of his electrocution, Cicoria had little time for anything other than playing and composing. 
 A dozen years later, Cicoria is still an extreme musicophiliac but has no desire to investigate his own condition with the finer-tuned forms of brain scanning that are now available. He has come to see his condition as a ''lucky strike.'' The music in his head is, he says, ''a blessing ... not to be questioned.'' (He was certainly lucky not to be killed. Standing in thunderstorms cannot yet be recommended as a new answer to the old question of how to get to Carnegie Hall.)
 Thanks to the willingness of others to be scanned, though, we now know that musicians' brains are different. The corpus callosum, which connects the brain's two hemispheres, is bigger in professional musicians. And people with absolute pitch (that is, those who can immediately name a heard note) have an asymmetric enlargement in a part of the auditory cortex. Because of this, and because of other distinctive differences in the distribution of gray matter, Sacks says that anatomists now have no difficulty in spotting the brain of a professional musician. (They cannot yet do this for the brain of a writer or visual artist.) It is not clear to what extent such marks of a musical brain are innate and to what extent they are the result of musical training and practice. But according to Sacks, these markers are strongly correlated with the age at which musical training begins and with the intensity of practice.
 Even with no training or practice, some unusual patients embrace music with an enthusiasm almost as intense as Cicoria's. These are people with Williams syndrome, whom Sacks calls a ''hypermusical species.'' The syndrome is caused by a rare genetic defect that produces a strange mixture of strengths (sociability, liveliness, large vocabularies and a fondness for telling stories) and weaknesses (most have I.Q.'s under 60). They also have heart defects and distinctive faces, with wide mouths, small chins and upturned noses. All, it seems, are extremely responsive to music from an early age. Some have striking gifts of musical memory, though not all are musically talented. 
 If music gives these individuals a joy that helps to compensate for their other disadvantages, it is little short of a lifeline for Clive Wearing. Wearing is an English musicologist and musician who contracted a severe brain infection and was left with a memory span of just a few seconds. His case is the most distressing in Sacks's collection and was featured in a BBC documentary aptly titled ''Prisoner of Consciousness.'' With no past, not even one from a minute ago, Wearing does not really occupy a present either. ''It's like being dead,'' he once told his wife. Although he does not remember her, he is always overjoyed to see her, continually meeting her for the first time. It is similar with his music. Asked to play a Bach prelude, he says he has never played any of them before; but then he plays one and says, while playing, that he remembers this one. In an intriguing and paradoxical conjecture, Sacks suggests that ''remembering music is not, in the usual sense, remembering at all. ... Listening to it, or playing it, is entirely in the present.''
 Music has been used successfully as a treatment for many kinds of mental suffering. Indeed the benefits of the singing cure are more evident than those of the talking one. The first formal programs of music therapy began in the 1940s, and it is now used successfully to ameliorate the symptoms of motor and speech disorders, aphasia and several forms of dementia. Sacks describes as astonishing the sight of deeply demented patients waking from their torpor or casting aside their agitation to focus on songs that are played to them. He also recounts an extreme case of Tourette's syndrome in another English musician, who was racked by nearly 40,000 compulsive tics per day. The man's life was transformed when his family got a piano. He now finds relief only when performing.
 Yet in rare cases, music can become a torture rather than a balm. At the end of his life, Schumann was tormented by musical hallucinations that degenerated into a single incessant note. Sacks describes a child who has been plagued by continuous involuntary music in the head from the age of 7. Such people must sometimes wish they were as unmusical as Ulysses S. Grant, who apparently claimed to know just two tunes: ''One is Yankee Doodle and the other is not.'' Freud, despite being both Viennese and a medical man, said he was almost incapable of obtaining any pleasure from music: ''Some rationalistic, or perhaps analytic, turn of mind in me rebels against being moved by a thing without knowing why I am thus affected and what it is that affects me.''
 In the end, Sacks's catalog of oddities sheds little systematic light on the mystery of music. He cannot be blamed for this -- the science of music is still in its early days. Readers will probably be grateful that Sacks, unlike Freud, is happy to revel in phenomena that he cannot yet explain.

HEADLINE: Kultur From That Other City of Lights

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

 BODY:
BERLIN
 BERLIN continues to exert a glittering if, to some, reptilian fascination. It will always be haunted by Hitler's ultimate evil. But it still breathes the giddy air of the 1920s -- campy, wicked and darkly fun -- and has become a new world center of youth culture and la vie de boheme. Today it is also a power center for the new Europe and an ever more ambitious building site for architecture rebuilt or eagerly modern. 
 The latest testimony to that fascination is Berlin in Lights, a 17-day festival in New York, which begins on Friday with a performance by Max Raabe and his Palast Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. Though the festival is centered on the Berlin Philharmonic and Carnegie, there are also chamber concerts and neighborhood programs, including Simon Rattle's acclaimed exploration of Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' as danced by schoolchildren; cabaret, pop and jazz; Turkish and Kurdish music and a Venezuelan orchestra, all representative of multicultural Berlin today; art and photography exhibitions; film screenings; and panel discussions. 
 Any of these elements could be terrific, but even in total they don't begin to give a full picture of the historical complexity and present-day vitality of Berlin as a cultural magnet. The festival's view of the past is dominated by the Weimar Republic, a 1920s burst of effervescence before the darkness of Nazism, and its view of the present is dominated by concerts, especially classical concerts.
 Though the city is a famous opera center with three companies, the is no opera in the festival. There is no dance, no theater and no extensive art exhibition. And there is no real attention paid to Berlin before the 1920s or between 1933 and the fall of the wall in 1989. Berlin's fascination -- especially for someone who spent formative years here after the war, as I did, and has visited many times since -- is far richer than any short festival can hope to explore.
 Before the first unification of Germany in 1870, Berlin was the rather sleepy, grim capital of the rather grim Hohenzollern kingdom of Prussia. Yes, Frederick the Great played the flute and composed, and cultivated a mini-Versailles at Sans Souci, in nearby Potsdam. (Long inaccessible as part of East Germany, it can now be visited on a day trip that also encompasses the lovely lake district of southwestern Berlin.) And the main boulevard, Unter den Linden, was graced by handsome neo-Classical architecture.
 After 1870 artistic life began to perk up in Berlin, the new German capital, though it was still overshadowed in the German-speaking world by Vienna and even Munich. The Court Opera on Unter den Linden -- the predecessor of the State Opera, led today by Daniel Barenboim -- was one of the stodgiest in Europe, repressed by censors and by Kaiser Wilhelm's pompous philistinism. The Berlin Philharmonic was coming into its own, and theater showed signs of life. Germany might have come late to the colonialist game, but not so late that it couldn't amass a hoard of exotic treasures, most of which were on display on the Museum Island in the heart of the city.
 The 1920s were certainly a time of bursting if sometimes tacky vitality. Brecht and Weill's ''Threepenny Opera'' and the musical ''Cabaret'' have pointed to nightclubs, prostitutes and the demimonde as central to the era's culture, an image that the Nazis, with their campaign against ''degenerate art,'' were also eager to propagate.
 But there was more, much more, to Berlin culture during the 20s. There were influential avant-garde composers, led by Arnold Schoenberg, Paul Hindemith and Weill. There were three full-time opera companies, with the State Opera, conducted by Erich Kleiber, challenged by the Municipal Opera under Bruno Walter and the Kroll Opera under Otto Klemperer.
 The theater flourished, with Max Reinhardt and other directors, and the '20s were the heyday of German modern dance. There was an impassioned Expressionist art scene. There were many competing newspapers; a clutch of coffeehouses where artists, intellectuals and scene-makers congregated; and a spirit in the air that resisted the Nazis to the last minute. (Hitler never won a free election in this left-wing, working-class city.)
 Berlin during the Nazis' 1,000-year Reich, which lasted from 1933 to 1945, can be divided in two. From 1933 to the early '40s, there was a lot of optimism: official and, if truth be told, popular. Yes, Jews and other official undesirables were repressed and worse, but they could be put out of mind, sometimes guiltily, sometimes blithely. After the Weimar Republic, with its inflation at the beginning and depression at the end, the Nazis brought an economic resurgence, fueled by Hitler's preparations for war. And for all the rents in the city's cultural fabric caused by the loss of Jews and political dissidents, artistic life continued with a surprising vitality, at least on the surface. Even jazz enjoyed a vogue, despite its racial ''impurities.''
 In the 1940s the situation grew increasingly desperate and artistically impoverished, with the central city incinerated by air raids and the suburbs heavily hit. (When I was a boy living in the suburbs right after the war, a mansion next door burned down, and terrifying detonations of unexploded bombs in the attic and bullets in the gutters lasted all night; my father feared that the Nazi Werewolf underground had arisen at last.) Cultural life shuddered to a halt even before Goebbels pronounced ''total war'' in 1944 and all performances were shut down.
 After the war the downtown was destroyed, people were hungry and leading artists had to be ''de-Nazified'' by Allied tribunals. It took years for theaters and concerts and bombed-out museums to come fully back to life. Yet until 1961 the huge city lay open to the culturally curious.
 That all changed overnight with the erection of the Berlin Wall. East Berlin was smaller than West Berlin, but it encompassed the heart of the city, since the Soviets got there first in 1945.
 What made West Berlin livable was the sheer size of the remaining city and the Arcadia of the southwestern lakes. And the culture. Berlin became a battleground of competing ideologies, with both sides in the cold war pouring money into the arts to demonstrate their economic and spiritual superiority.
 The West had the Berlin Philharmonic, the film festival, the German Opera (the successor to the Municipal Opera) and an energetic theater life strung along the Kurfurstendamm. The Free University in the southwest became a site of student activity all through this era. The West German government subsidized students, young people and families with children in an effort to prevent the city from withering away.
 East Berlin, accessible to foreigners under the old four-power Allied agreements but not to West Berliners, was a sad fortress. It reeked of dictatorship, down to the goose-stepping soldiers on Unter den Linden. Yet a number of artists, East German and foreign, remained attracted to the lures of Marxism, at least until the regime grew nakedly oppressive in the '80s. The Berliner Ensemble retained some of the tart grit that had made Brecht famous in the '20s. The Austrian Walter Felsenstein revitalized opera direction at the Komische Oper. The Swiss Benno Besson created productions of unequaled magical realism at the Deutsches Theater (Reinhardt's old haunt) and the Volksbuhne am Rosa-Luxembourg-Platz.
 With the fall of the wall in 1989, yet another era began for Berlin and its culture, one that has rivaled or outshone the Weimar years and continues unabated to this day. With the opening of East Berlin, rundown neighborhoods became meccas for young people. The first was Prenzlauer Berg, just north of downtown, but gentrification has begun to drive up prices and drive out artists, who now head for Mitte, which is the real downtown, Kreuzberg and Friedrichshaim. Young people from all over the world flock to the city, with English as its common language. 
 Berlin today has still not settled down economically. The old industrial base is gone, and the financial action has relocated to Frankfurt. There is no real international airport yet. And even the grudging federal subsidies here and there do not go far in supporting the three opera companies and the five or six major symphony orchestras.
 The Philharmonic plays in Hans Scharoun's odd-looking but acoustically exquisite Philharmonie, which used to rub up against the wall, a challenge to the East, and now lies in comfortable proximity to the revitalized Potsdamer Platz. Mr. Barenboim has established himself as the operatic leader of the city, and the venerable State Opera building will undergo major renovations. Famous conductors and soloists come and go, or stay and settle.
 There is a palpable air of excitement when you walk around Berlin today, as I did recently on a gorgeous weekend, the trees in full fall colors. Despite the political squabbles about subsidies, the big high-art institutions seem to be flourishing, and scruffy vanguard showcases abound. The Museum Island is being steadily rebuilt, and the gallery scene is challenging that of Cologne, the longtime center of German art sales. Theater is everywhere, and film is burgeoning. Even the ungainly Hohenzollern Palace, damaged by bombs and flattened by the East Germans, is to be rebuilt, with the old exterior and a new conference center inside. 
 The whole of the dead zone where the wall used to scar the city center (along with the site of the long-since-destroyed Kroll Opera) has been transformed into the federal center, with the Bundestag and the chancellor's office and the new central train station all near the old Reichstag. Norman Foster's postmodernist dome atop the Reichstag, akin in its juxtaposition of old and new to I. M. Pei's Louvre pyramid in Paris, offers a spectacular view of all this and more, to the west and south. The dome and Daniel Libeskind's zigzag Jewish Museum and Peter Eisenman's powerful Holocaust Memorial epitomize the architectural and spiritual revitalization of the city.
 By now the Kurfurstendamm has faded into a rundown echo of itself, shorn of the raffishness it epitomized during the Weimar Republic and the elegance of the '60s and '70s, and long since overtaken by the grandeur and hipness of the new East Berlin. Still, there are theaters and restaurants and fine hotels and lively late-night cafes on or near this central boulevard, and much of West Berlin has reverted to the upscale residential neighborhoods that dominated that part of the city before the war.
 The dance scene in Berlin, unrepresented in Berlin in Lights, seems especially frisky. The halfhearted ballet troupes of the three opera companies have been fused into a single Berlin State Ballet, led by Vladimir Malakhov with a pronounced Russian flavor. Sasha Waltz dominates the established nonballetic scene and is now ensconced in her popular new theater, restaurant and studio complex, Radialsystem V. She founded it with her husband, Jochen Sandig, who also founded Tacheles, the first and most famous of the arts centers (complete with music clubs and cafes) in Prenzlauer Berg. The new bohemian Berlin has already developed its own aristocracy.
 All contemporary dance in Europe these days is dizzyingly multinational, but nowhere more so than in Berlin. Foreigners like Constanza Macras from Buenos Aires and Jeremy Wade from New York flock there, availing themselves of patronage and subsidies unknown at home.
 It is fitting that New York is presenting a Berlin festival, however incomplete its offerings. Many have commented on the similarities of atmosphere and energy between these two world cities, their blends of tough realism, satiric wit, bounding ambition and artistic innovation.
 But unlike New York, even after the terrorist attacks of 2001, Berlin has suffered through, and perpetrated, unimaginable horrors. They lend even the deepest, giddiest artistic pleasures a somber undercurrent, a dimensionality, sothat the experiencing of art in Berlin today -- the consumption as well as the making -- is like that in no other city in the world.

The Glass Isn't Full
 To the Editor:
 While I would like to agree with Ben Stein that the cup is nearly full as far as the economic future is concerned (''The Gloomsayers Should Look Up,'' Oct. 21), I am now convinced that the cup is rapidly emptying, with one crisis on top of another, a view that is obviously shared by currency experts as the dollar reaches new lows. 
 We have overspent, sent our industries overseas and suffer from a continuing trade imbalance as well as a ballooning debt -- hardly signs of fiscal responsibility. Unfortunately, now may be the time to pay the piper for our financial indiscretions.

 Halloween Dollars
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Where the Jack-o'-Lanterns Are Only the Beginning'' (Oct. 21), which described the increase in spending on Halloween in the United States: 
 I recall a childhood where trick-or-treating required two hands, one for a candy bag and one to hold an orange Unicef box to collect coins for the underprivileged.
 My suggestion to the American populace is to consider matching their household Halloween expenditure with a donation to any organization that serves to feed the hungry, whether locally or internationally.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths DRUCKER, BYRD

 BODY:
 DRUCKER--Byrd, 78, died peacefully on October 25 surrounded by his loving family in New York City. The beloved husband of Janet for 57 extraordinary and memorable years, he is also survived by his adoring children, Carol, William and his wife Rhonda, and his youngest daughter, Abby, as well as three amazing grandchildren, Elizabeth, Sarah Beth and Matthew. His older brothers, Joseph, Simon, and David Drucker predeceased him. 
He was especially devoted to his sister-inlaw, Anita Caminiti, who showered him with laughter, kindness and an abundance of Italian cuisine. He met Janet at 15 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where they were both raised, and their lives have been inextricably linked ever since. After enlisting in the U.S. Army at 17, he served as a paratrooper in World War II. A graduate of Boys High School in Brooklyn, with both a B.A. and an M.A. from Brooklyn College, he was a devoted teacher of economics and history for 35 years for the New York City Board of Education. An educational innovator, he developed an alternative school at Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, which prepared high-school graduates for immediate entry onto a career track. He was the Executive Director of Camp Louemma, part of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, in Glenwood, New Jersey, for 17 years. During this time, he mentored young people in the social work field and created a wonderful camping experience for thousands of New York City children, in the process forming life-long bonds with many of the campers. In 1976, Byrd, along with his wife, Janet, founded Drucker Antiques, which is now operated by their son, William. Their shared passion for art, antiques and design created a business that has cultivated a worldwide appreciation for Georg Jensen silver. His passion, knowledge and perseverance enabled his wife, Janet, to complete her labor of love, the authoritative monograph on Georg Jensen silver, ''Georg Jensen: A Traditional of Splendid Silver,'' now in its second edition. In their 60s, they embarked on a new adventure, and moved from their longtime home in Canarsie, Brooklyn, into Manhattan, where they truly felt like every day was a holiday. He enjoyed summering in the Adirondacks and East Hampton. A passionate New York Knicks fan, whether they won or lost, he was a gracious sportsman and an avid swimmer. Byrd will always be remembered for his humor, intelligence, curiosity, persistence, courage, kindness, wisdom, and his ability to savor every moment of joy. Family was most important to him, and in his mind, a man's wealth could be measured by his abundance of loving family and friends, and in this regard, he was the richest of men, and will be sorely missed. One of the greatest lessons he imparted to his children and grandchildren was that the only things that could limit them were their own dreams. A memorial service will be held, Sunday, October 28, at 11:45am at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, at Amsterdam Avenue.

HEADLINE: Skybox U.

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA. 
Joe Nocera is a business columnist for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Not so long ago, a middle-age freelance speech writer named John Pollack came by my office. Pollack, who once wrote speeches for Bill Clinton, had a bone to pick with the University of Michigan, which he has been rooting for since he was 6. One of the country's most storied football schools, Michigan fielded its first football team 120 years ago; was a charter member of the Big Ten when the conference was formed, 111 years ago; won the first Rose Bowl, in 1902; and is the winner of 42 conference and 11 national championships. Michigan's football team generated around $50 million of the $87 million the athletic department reaped last year -- figures that trail only those of its archrival, Ohio State, in the Big Ten. Much of that money comes from such things as television rights, licensing fees for the school's logo and so on. But a lot of it also comes from selling tickets to games at Michigan Stadium, which can hold as many as 112,000 people, making it the largest sports coliseum in the country. Not for nothing is it called the Big House. 
 Michigan Stadium was the reason Pollack stopped by. A few years ago, Bill Martin, Michigan's athletic director, proposed renovating the Big House for $226 million. Given that it's 80 years old, the place could use an update. But included in the renovation plans -- which the university's trustees approved earlier this year -- are skyboxes and other expensive ''premium seats,'' something the Big House has never had.
 Practically from the moment Martin submitted the plan for skyboxes, Pollack has been obsessed with defeating it. 
 His objections -- shared by many Michigan faculty members and alumni -- range from the financial (the skyboxes cost too much and will not be paid off for more than a generation) to the egotistical (by capping future expansion, the Big House may eventually lose its status as the country's biggest stadium).
 Mainly, though, Pollack argues that the University of Michigan simply shouldn't be the kind of school that sells skyboxes to high-rollers; it should be better than that. ''Michigan doesn't need to keep up with the Joneses,'' he said. ''We are the Joneses.'' He added, ''One of the great things about college football, especially Michigan football, is that it is a great public space -- a place where autoworkers and millionaires can come together to cheer on their team.''
 Martin, however, claims that selling skyboxes and premium seats to well-heeled alums and corporations is the most sensible way to pay off the debt needed to complete the renovation. ''The other option,'' he says, ''would be to add $15 or $20 a ticket.''
 What's more, all of Michigan's chief competitors in the Big Ten, including Ohio State, Penn State, Michigan State and Iowa, already have skyboxes. In fact, with the exception of Notre Dame (the only school in the country with its own multimillion-dollar television deal), pretty much every big-name football school in the country has them, or is planning them. In Florida, the University of Miami has agreed to abandon the Orange Bowl for Dolphin Stadium, where it will take 
 in millions more per year, in no small part because Dolphin Stadium has luxury boxes and the Orange Bowl doesn't. Elsewhere in the state, four large universities have spent millions of dollars to create Division I football programs 
 in the last dozen years. In each case, the start-up costs were financed in part by donations from wealthy alumni or nearby residents. But still. The schools now have to pay millions a year to keep their programs going, and donors alone won't cover the costs. Two of the schools -- the University of Central Florida and Florida Atlantic University -- have also run up multimillion-dollar debts building expensive stadiums. Naturally, the new stadiums will have skyboxes, giant television scoreboards, naming rights and all the other ''revenue enhancers'' that were long thought to be the hallmarks of professional sports franchises. That's the whole point.
 In short, behold the college football arms race, where the rich (like Michigan) continue to get richer and the poor (the University of Central Florida) try to claw their way to a place where they can stand alongside the rich. Given this state of affairs, there is simply no way Michigan is going to be left behind. In Division I football, either you buy into the sports equivalent of mutually assured destruction or you drop out entirely. With the singular exception of the Ivy League, there really is no middle ground. In any arms race it's easy to get lost in the internal logic. Big-time college football is now so divorced from what actually goes on at a university as to be a kind of subsidiary, not even tangentially related to education. There are schools like Duke and the University of Chicago that get on quite well, thank you very much, without a serious football program. As Sheldon Steinbach, the former general counsel of American Council on Education, puts it, ''The most basic question of all is, who decided to get higher education into the intercollegiate athletic business?'' But at this point, major universities are not about to shut down a big-time football program, the way the University of Chicago did in 1939. There's too much at stake. ''These are schools that have thousands of students and tens of thousands of alumni,'' says James Delany, the commissioner of the Big Ten Conference, speaking of its member universities. ''At a school like Michigan, whether you like it or not, college football is part of Midwestern culture.''
 As a result, schools erect the fanciest stadiums, build the most up-to-date weight rooms, fly expensive chartered jets to away games -- spend money on all sorts of things -- in order to attract the best athletes. ''Since the players don't get paid, you can't just go out and hire the Tom Bradys of college sports,'' Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist who teaches at Smith College, says. ''So instead they throw money at everything else.'' One of Zimbalist's favorite examples is the salaries of top college coaches. ''They get paid pretty much the same as coaches in the N.F.L., about $2 to $3 million,'' he says. ''It doesn't make any sense from a normal economic point of view, because the average revenue of a top-30 college football team is about $30 million, whereas the average N.F.L. team takes in $200 million.'' But it happens anyway because when it comes to recruiting, Zimbalist says, schools ''want to be able to say that they have a coach with a national reputation, someone who has sent kids off to the N.F.L.''
 A similar rationale holds for stadiums, according to Zimbalist: ''They say, 'Come play for us because you will be in an N.F.L.-quality stadium, with a big new scoreboard with your picture shown whenever you make a good play.' '' But, he adds, while every school builds, or renovates, a stadium with the belief that it will ultimately make money and help defray the cost of the program, this doesn't happen all that often. ''They get into these arms races, in the hope that they can have a winning team, which will bring in more revenue, which will help pay their escalating costs,'' Zimbalist says. ''But of the 119 Division I colleges in any particular year, only 30 or 40 football programs probably run a true surplus.''
 Is Michigan one of the handful of schools where the economics make sense? Actually, it is. The athletic department operates like a not-so-small business, and it is highly unlikely to lose money on the skyboxes. The $87 million in annual revenue the entire department produces not only covers the costs of all the non-revenue sports like women's volleyball but also generated a surplus of $17 million last year. The escalation of costs poses very little risk to Michigan. Even if its football team has a string of bad years, it still has an immensely loyal fan base, it will still secure the financial rewards that come with being in the Big Ten and it will still fill Michigan Stadium every time the team plays a home game. Look at Notre Dame: on the field it has lost some of its luster in recent years, but it remains a financial powerhouse, with a packed stadium, a nation full of fans and that TV deal with NBC. According to the Sports Business Journal, its football program alone generates more money than any other program in the country -- over $60 million in 2005-6, the last season for which figures are available. Schools with great football traditions can afford to enter the arms race.
 On the other hand, the Florida newcomers in Division I -- Florida International and Florida Atlantic, along with South Florida and Central Florida -- lack long-term football traditions and generations of fiercely loyal alumni. The only way they can fill their stadiums is to build winning teams -- and to continue winning, year after year. They have jumped on a treadmill that they now can't afford to get off. It is doubtful that any of them are breaking even at this point -- not even the University of South Florida, which joined the Big East Conference in 2005 and has climbed into the top 5 of the college rankings this fall. Its total football revenue, according to the Sports Business Journal, was $8.8 million in 2005-6. 
 But given its ambition, its costs are likely greater. Keith Tribble, the athletic director of the University of Central Florida, which had $7.8 million in revenue in the 2005-6 season, predicts that the football team will break even in the next year or two. His calculation of what constitutes breaking even, however, does not include servicing the debt of the school's newly opened 45,000-seat ''Bright House Networks Stadium,'' which cost $54 million to build.
 So why do these schools do it? Partly because they're in Florida, perhaps the most football-mad state in the country. Partly because football is believed to be the best single marketing and advertising program any university can have. ''Most institutions look at what attracts alumni, what makes them contribute,'' Tribble says. ''Without fail, it all comes back to football. Most of the great institutions in the country are tied to the hip with athletics.'' The four Florida schools are mostly commuter schools, so having a big-time football program makes them feel as though they have joined the big time -- right alongside mighty Michigan.
 Maybe the best thing that can be said about pouring money into football is that, as Sheldon Steinbach told me, stadium construction is hardly the worst thing that goes on in college sports. ''Skyboxes are not the most cancerous elements in most athletic departments,'' he says. And what is? His reply: ''How about the recruitment of athletes who do not have the ability to benefit from a college education?'' Hey, someone has to take the field in all those fancy new stadiums. .schools 'can't just go out and hire the tom bradys of college sports,' one economist says. 'so instead they throw money at everything else.'

THE SURGEONS 
 Life and Death in a Top Heart Center. 
 By Charles R. Morris.
 317 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $24.95.
 The sicker you are, the more specialists your doctor will probably call in for consultation. The problem is that, like blind men feeling an elephant, each will swear your symptoms have everything (or nothing) to do with the part he or she knows best. Cardiologists will invoke the heart; gastroenterologists will point to the digestive tract; surgeons will want to, well, operate. In the end, the picture you get is not of an elephant but of lots of anatomical parts that don't quite add up. In this year leading up to November 2008, the same could be said of health care reform. For every would-be president, economist, policy wonk, health care provider and even movie director, there is a different and deeply cherished solution. 
 It seems particularly timely, then, that Charles R. Morris, a prolific writer whose multifaceted resume includes stints as a lawyer, banker and secretary of health and human services for Washington State, has now written a book on health care. ''The Surgeons: Life and Death in a Top Heart Center'' is an ambitious account of the complicated interplay among health care economics, policy and those individuals whose professional lives drive the medical system. Morris fully immerses himself, and the reader, in the complexities of health care; what emerge are riveting and clarifying snapshots of the often unfathomable behemoth we call our health care system. 
 How difficult is it to reform health care? Very difficult, Morris writes, when the parties involved have a tremendous amount at stake as well as completely different paradigms. To illustrate this problem, Morris takes us behind one of ''the splendid American silos of excellence,'' the heart surgery unit at New York's Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. Although his observations lack the rigor of those of the sociologist Charles Bosk in his book ''Forgive and Remember,'' Morris is astute and engaging. He movingly documents the lives of patients and families, and sharply illuminates stresses faced both by them and by doctors in, for example, the failed heart transplant of a 4-year-old girl who only a year before had been ''all bright eyes and arc-light smile.'' 
 Although his use of medical jargon sometimes obsfucates, Morris captures, with just the right details, the universes of fiercely competitive medical specialists and their teams, where responses are often not what one might expect. Following a cardiac surgery resident at 2 a.m., Morris writes that the man ''had been up for a very long time and should have been exhausted, but he didn't look it -- in fact, his face lit up when he saw an upcoming early-morning case: 'Oh, I want that case!' '' 
 In the final chapters of the book, Morris steps back, superimposing his clinical observations upon the larger issues of health care policy and economics, and he is at his best here in this more familiar terrain. His chapter on the controversies surrounding aprotinin, an antibleeding agent often used in cardiac surgery, is particularly impressive. Aprotinin came under question in early 2006 because of research published in a leading medical journal. Morris deftly goes from the individuals, describing the doctors' initial reactions (''Old points of reference were visibly wobbling, and the queasiness they felt was palpable''); to the theoretical, describing the strengths and weaknesses of the statistical method used in the paper; to the broad social and policy issues, revealing just how easily factors other than science can influence the acceptance of drugs and technologies. 
 In spite, or perhaps because, of the impressive range of Morris's writing, it is not always clear how each chapter relates to the others or to the book as a whole. One cannot help wondering with some despair if the elephant is too large for even the most insightful of blind men, if health care is not in danger of becoming, as Morris warns, but has already become a ''slow-motion political and administrative debacle.'' 
 What ultimately brings clarity to this book -- and hope for health care reform -- are the stories Morris delivers along the way. There is the beleaguered nurse struggling in the middle of the night to help two surgical teams perform an organ procurement, the world-renowned cardiologist whose belief in transparency includes recounting harrowing clinical moments to some 500 colleagues, and the young surgeon, a decade after medical school, working day and night and for hours at a time standing hunched over an operating table ''with no breaks for food, water or bathroom'' and a salary less than that of ''a kid fresh out of law school.'' Medicine is full of such examples, Morris writes, people ''working very hard under great pressure -- because it was the right thing to do.''
 For better or for worse, the quality of health care is driven by what Morris calls an ''artisanal'' value system, one that has little to do with institutional allegiances or administrative management objectives, but rather with ''internalized systems of ethics and the expectations of other professionals.'' And that, at least for now, as Morris shows us, may be the part of the elephant that saves us all.

 BODY:
Amy Marie Culver, the daughter of Mary Ann Culver and Dr. Stephen J. Culver of New Hartford, N.Y., was married yesterday to Sean Kevin Thompson, the son of Kathryn and James V. Thompson of Ludlow, Mass. The Rev. Ronald Franco, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle in New York. 
 The bride and the bridegroom are associates at law firms in New York. She specializes in labor and employment law at Bond, Schoeneck & King, and he specializes in litigation at Cravath, Swaine & Moore. They met at Boston College, from which they graduated and where she received her law degree. 
 The bride, 27, will continue to use her name professionally. She serves on the board of the St. Joseph School in New York. Her father is a urologist in private practice in Utica, N.Y., and her mother is his office manager and accountant.
 The bridegroom, 28, received his law degree and a Master of Laws degree in international and comparative law from Cornell. He also has a master's degree in international relations from the London School of Economics. His mother retired as a biology teacher at Baird Middle School in Ludlow, and his father is a lawyer in private practice there. He also serves as town moderator.

SECTION: Section 4; Column 0; Week in Review Desk; HOMES SALES FALL; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 526 words

HEADLINE: THE WEEK: Trouble at Home (and Beyond)

 BODY:
THE NEWS Sales of existing homes in September fell twice as much as economists had expected, to their lowest level in nearly 10 years, according to the National Association of Realtors. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS A house isn't the Fort Knox it used to be. Sales were down 19 percent from the same month a year ago, a decline that the trade group attributed to the credit crunch following the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. Analysts foresee things getting worse. ''We are expecting sales to continue to drop and not turn around until next year,'' Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insight, a research firm, told The Associated Press. 
 THE NEWS Foreclosures on homes purchased with subprime mortgages are expected to reach two million by the end of next year, according to a new Congressional report. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The forecast by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress was four times larger than the Bush administration's estimate last month of 500,000 foreclosures, in itself a huge number compared with recent years. The loss of real estate wealth just from foreclosures on subprime loans will total about $71 billion, the panel said, with another $32 billion lost on the value of other homes in neighborhoods where there are foreclosures.
 THE NEWS The nation's largest home lender said it would help borrowers restructure $16 billion in mortgages to avoid foreclosures or financial stress.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Countrywide Financial had faced weeks of criticism from advocacy groups who said it had not moved quickly to help its borrowers escape risky, high-cost loans made before the mortgage crisis took hold. ''Unprecedented times call for unprecedented remedies,'' Countrywide's president and chief operating officer, David Sambol, said. Its customers aren't the only ones hurting. On Friday, the bank reported a third-quarter loss of $1.2 billion, its first quarterly loss in 25 years. 
 THE NEWS Merrill Lynch reduced the value of its mortgage-related securities by $7.9 billion and posted a loss of $2.3 billion, its first since 2001.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Most of Merrill's losses were tied to the diminished value of complex debt instruments hit hard by the problems in the subprime market. ''We got it wrong,'' E. Stanley O'Neal, Merrill's chairman and chief executive, said, blaming an ''unprecedented liquidity squeeze.'' Standard & Poors, the ratings firm, called the write-downs ''staggering;'' the losses led Mr. O'Neal to float the idea of a merger with a big bank. Analysts said Merrill's risk management had failed. 
 THE NEWS Consumers who use heating oil in their homes should expect sharply higher energy bills this winter, industry and government analysts say.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Tight supplies and tension in the Middle East have pushed up crude oil prices, with heating oil futures reaching a record last week. Fortunately, weather forecasters have predicted a warmer than normal winter for the Northeast, where roughly six million people heat their homes with oil. Still, the Energy Department warned recently that heating costs in the Northeast could rise 22 percent over last winter, for an average seasonal bill of $1,827.

HEADLINE: In Argentina, a Campaign Promising Change Offers More of the Same

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
When Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced in July that she would seek to succeed her husband, Nestor Kirchner, as Argentina's president, the power couple said ''change was just beginning.''
 But that early campaign slogan, an effort to gently distance her from Mr. Kirchner, failed to resonate with the president's supporters, who favored more of the same policies that pulled Argentina from the depths of its crushing financial crisis in 2001 and have helped the economy grow by some 50 percent. 
 On a rainy Thursday night here, in Mrs. Kirchner's final campaign event before Sunday's election, the couple many refer to as the ''Clintons of the South'' left little doubt that her likely victory would mean more of the same.
 ''We had the dream of recovering the dignity of millions of Argentines that woke up every day with nowhere to go,'' she said from the same outdoor market in La Matanza, an industrial town on the fringes of the capital, where her husband appeared in the waning days of his campaign. Her husband, whom she referred to more than once, sat at her side. 
 Leading up to the election, Mrs. Kirchner, a 54-year-old senator from the center-left Peronist party, was leading in polls with more than 40 percent of the vote, about 25 percentage points ahead of her nearest rival, Elisa Carrio, a center-left congresswoman. Mrs. Kirchner appeared to have enough support to avoid a run-off and be elected outright.
 Besides making her the first woman to be elected president in Argentina, a victory would also make her the second woman in two years to be elected president of a Latin American country. Michelle Bachelet was elected president of Chile last year. But unlike Ms. Bachelet, Mrs. Kirchner is striding into the presidency with remarkable ease. Mrs. Kirchner has campaigned lightly in her own country, choosing instead to spend much of the past two months in Europe and the United States trying to woo international investors and look presidential beside world leaders. 
 For Argentina -- and for South America -- Mrs. Kirchner's likely victory would create a paradox. Unlike Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, Bolivia's Evo Morales or even Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, all essentially populist leaders hailing from humble backgrounds, Mrs. Kirchner is a proudly intellectual lawyer who is more at home mingling with presidents than with everyday people. 
 But the bulk of support she inherits from her husband comes squarely from Argentina's lower classes, many of whom see Mrs. Kirchner as aloof and tough to comprehend in speeches that often resemble university lectures. She could risk losing their support if she does not adjust her husband's economic policies to stem rising inflation and prevent a looming energy crisis.
 Mrs. Kirchner has had problems generating appeal among the middle and upper classes, Argentine pollsters say. 
 ''As inflation continues to rise, the lower classes will suffer, and she runs the risk of ending up with no support at all,'' said Daniel Kerner, an analyst at Eurasia Group in New York.
 Still, Mrs. Kirchner is already the most powerful Argentine woman since Eva Peron helped her husband, Gen. Juan Domingo Peron, rule the country from 1946 until her death in 1952. (Mr. Peron's third wife, Maria Estela Martinez de Peron, known as Isabelita, who was vice president when he died in 1974, led the country for two tumultuous years before being deposed in a military coup.) 
 Mrs. Kirchner has called herself part of a ''new generation'' of Argentine leaders. And few here, including her, see much similarity between her and Eva Peron, who displayed a legendary touch with the public. Mrs. Kirchner, for instance, refused to debate the other candidates and gave few interviews during the campaign, preferring controlled environments to open forums. 
 ''She seems like a cold person,'' said Sandra Mansilla, 42, an undecided voter in the hardscrabble Lomas de Zamora neighborhood, trying to explain why she was leaning against voting for Mrs. Kirchner. ''I still don't feel like I know her. She just makes me nervous.''
 But to supporters who attended her rally here on Thursday, many of whom were bused in by Peronist Party functionaries, the Kirchners are an improvement over previous leaders. ''What we want is more stability, and Cristina is the best candidate to give us that, the best person to make sure we don't go back to the economic misery we had before,'' said Eduardo Diaz, 60, a retired factory worker in La Matanza.
 The Kirchners, who met in law school as student activists, expressed support for each other during the campaign's final days. ''What is coming is much better than us,'' Mr. Kirchner said at an event on Thursday. His wife promised that he would continue to be involved in politics, even if he had no formal role in the government. ''He is a political animal in the true sense of the word,'' she said. 
 Mr. Kirchner's decision not to run was a calculated move by the couple to try to tag-team the presidency for the next 12 years, most analysts contend. They say Mr. Kirchner feared a lame-duck second term. And Argentina's election law allows a former president to run again after waiting four years.
 For her part, Mrs. Kirchner faces some tough policy decisions if she is elected. 
 In radio and television interviews this week, she defended official figures pegging inflation at 8 to 10 percent -- less than half what a host of outside economists say is the real level. Some prices are clearly on the rise; consumer groups this month boycotted tomatoes after the item more than doubled in price to a level higher than some cuts of beef.
 The next government will also face the real possibilities of energy shortages. Subsidies intended to keep energy prices low for consumers have contributed to a shortage of natural gas and electricity that could lead to brownouts or blackouts as early as next year, analysts say. Mrs. Kirchner, like her husband, has insisted there is no crisis and expressed confidence that the needed investment would come in time to avoid politically costly shortfalls.
 She has promised closer ties with Europe, and with the United States, which her husband all but snubbed in recent years as he focused his efforts on restoring the country's economy. 
 International investors will be watching to see whether Mrs. Kirchner tries to resolve Argentina's outstanding issues with the International Monetary Fund. The country defaulted on some $80 billion in debt before offering a restructuring plan in 2005. Some bondholders rejected the offer, leaving Argentina in default of $26 billion and unable to issue debt abroad.
 While other Latin American leaders have worked on buffing their image as populists, Mrs. Kirchner has focused on polishing herself into a world stateswoman. Her wardrobe and makeup have come a long way since her days living in her husband's Patagonia province of Santa Cruz. She has also tried to become a policy wonk, organizing meetings with groups of intellectuals during recent visits to Mexico and Spain, said Riordan Roett, the director of the Latin American Studies Program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
 While the Kirchners are a formidable political team, they are in some ways opposites. Mr. Kirchner obsesses over economic data every morning, while his wife spends at least an hour reading local and international press reports, paying particular attention to stories about politics and social trends in the United States, said two government insiders.
 With Mr. Kirchner expected to have a large role behind the scenes in running the country, some wonder who will really be in charge. ''How will the couple handle disagreements on major policy issues?'' Mr. Kerner said. ''In Argentina, where all decision-making power is concentrated in the hands of one or two people, this becomes a problem.''

HEADLINE: How to Find an Audience? Try a Zoom Lens

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 EIGHT weeks into the movie awards season, the half-year regarded here as show-prep for the Oscars, Hollywood is already littered with smoking ruins.
 While Malibu was burning last weekend, Ben Affleck and Miramax Films watched ''Gone Baby Gone'' do the same. The crime drama opened sixth at the box office with $5.5 million in domestic ticket sales and little promise of much more to come.
 Three spots back, behind the umpteenth rerelease of Tim Burton's ''The Nightmare Before Christmas,'' Reese Witherspoon and New Line Cinema did even worse with ''Rendition.'' This heavily promoted political drama took in just over $4 million. 
 As for ''Things We Lost in the Fire'' from Benicio Del Toro, Halle Berry and the DreamWorks unit of Paramount, why bother to torture the metaphor? The love-and-death drama took in $1.6 million.
 Putting aside questions of art -- not too many years ago, Marcia Gay Harden won an Oscar for her performance in ''Pollock,'' which took in less than even these films are likely to make by the end -- all three pictures, and a dozen more headed to the marketplace by Christmas, share a common business problem. They are what film marketers in their private moments call ''movies for no one.''
 That doesn't mean they're bad pictures. It means they have no obvious appeal to any of the four big demographic groups at which Hollywood has typically aimed its wares: males 17 to 24 years old, males 25 to 49, females 17 to 24 and females 25 to 49. 
 The industry's more nuanced movies must work to find an audience. And the audience must work to figure them out. 
 But you can't blame a potential customer who can't see the difference between ''In the Valley of Elah'' from Warner Independent Pictures and ''Grace Is Gone'' from the Weinstein Company. Both are about dead Iraq veterans. At a glance, it can be just as hard to tell what separates ''Reservation Road,'' by Focus Features, from ''The Girl in the Park,'' a Furst Films product that popped up in September at the Toronto International Film Festival, the traditional starting gate for the annual awards race. Both explore a parent's obsessive grief over a lost child. 
 And if the movie business is to keep making these smart little dramas in which ambitious actors and prize-hungry filmmakers take their annual shot at the gold, it will have to start doing what car makers and packaged-goods companies have always done: sharpen the message and narrow the targets.
 ''Clearly, there's room to do market positioning and concept testing research on every single movie,'' Chris McGurk, the chief executive of Overture Films said of the need to do something more than size up the effectiveness of ads that have already been created. 
 Overture is one of several newly funded companies, also including Summit Entertainment, United Artists, the Film Department and Groundswell Productions, that are about to make things tougher by flooding Hollywood's already crowded middle zone with still more pictures.
 One of the film industry's dirty little secrets is that its nearly obsessive reliance on testing of movie trailers and ads has been undercut by the relatively primitive methodology of some research techniques. Studio marketing departments, for instance, have often relied on samples of 300 in testing materials, whether online or by other methods.
 If that sample is divided equally into the four usual demographic quadrants, the response to a particular query in each group has an approximate margin of error of plus or minus 11 percentage points, as explained by Vincent Bruzzese, senior vice president of OTX, a market research company that handles much of Hollywood's testing. 
 Thus, a response in which 61 percent of men under 25 are revved up by a trailer is statistically the same as one in which only 39 percent like it. Even doubling the sample to 600, as OTX often does, yields a margin of error of plus or minus eight percentage points by Mr. Bruzzese's reckoning.
 That's still a pretty wobbly basis for deciding whether the high-stakes marketing campaigns, which routinely run to $10 million or $20 million for smaller movies, are actually getting through.
 In the last few months, Mr. Bruzzese's boss, Kevin Goetz, president of OTX's worldwide motion picture group, has been working Hollywood's lunch tables and office suites with a novel proposition: that companies vastly increase the size of groups on which it tests promotional materials for its ''movies for no one,'' a step that could put things in perspective for less than $200,000, about the cost of four or so focus groups.
 BY using a sample as large as 10,000, Mr. Goetz contends, the distributor of a film like ''Rendition'' or ''Things We Lost in the Fire'' could pinpoint with great precision who might respond to a movie, ''not just demographically, but behavior-graphically or psychographically.''
 In other words, they would identify inclinations of a possible customer. Then, instead of relying on instinct and experience to design and disseminate their message, marketers could follow a closely defined pool of likely buyers to their favorite Web sites, cable channels, magazine pages and stores, and reel them in far more efficiently than they do now with billboards, bus ads and full-page ads in the local newspaper.
 To date, Hollywood has been wary of what sounds like common sense, and for a number of reasons.
 The interval between finishing and marketing a film may not allow time for extra research; veteran marketers often do a good job of finding their customers without elaborate analysis. And some believe that samples of the size proposed by Mr. Goetz are far larger -- and more expensive, despite the economies of online testing -- than are really required for statistical validity.
 But another few weekends as awful as the last one may change some minds.
 Mr. McGurk, for one, said he could imagine, in limited circumstances, using some deeper testing even in decisions that contribute to a film's birth. 
 ''At the right time, and the right place, for the right movie, it doesn't hurt to add to your thought process,'' he said. 
 ''Just to check your gut.''

HEADLINE: Making a Fortune Small in Collector Cars

BYLINE: By DAVE KINNEY

 BODY:
TIRED of the stock market's gyrations? You say that Miami condo didn't pan out as you had hoped? 
 Perhaps, in a flash of financial fantasy, you have mused about riches that would be yours if instead you had invested that cash in can't-miss collectible cars. Maybe you were tempted by a particular new model that was certain to grow valuable -- to buy one and preserve it as a zero-miles example, a shrink-wrapped retirement fund. Collectors even have a nickname for such a practice: pickling.
 A look at past financial performance, however, might have you rethinking pickled cars as a road to riches. Few cars deliver a profit to their original owners when inflation, ownership costs and the potential returns of more conventional investments are considered. 
 One exception is a hot model whose initial demand drives the price well over the window sticker -- the Volkswagen New Beetle and Ford Thunderbird were memorable cases -- but any such effect is likely to be short-lived. 
 Here is a selection of automotive investments that fizzled. While some were fine automobiles, they are included here because of their poor performance as investment vehicles. 
 1963-64 STUDEBAKER AVANTI The last hope of Studebaker's dying automobile division, the Avanti was a fiberglass-body coupe with handsome styling done by a team working under the famed designer Raymond Loewy. 
 Any possible windfall for the original Avanti buyers was limited early on: first, the car became an orphan when Studebaker stopped production. Then came the introduction of the Avanti II, a continuation of the original car, albeit with a Chevrolet engine. The availability of a visually similar car, even if it was not the genuine item, has held back the appreciation of original Avantis. 
 Using the Consumer Price Index inflation calculator at data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl, the same $4,445 that an Avanti cost new in 1963 amounts to $30,286 in 2007 dollars. An excellent example, according to the Kelley Blue Book Official Guide for Early Model Cars, is valued at $24,100 today.
 1976 CADILLAC ELDORADO CONVERTIBLE The first of the modern can't-miss automotive investments, this car was promoted as the last hurrah for American convertibles. Impending safety legislation led many to pay huge premiums for cars thought to be the final examples of a breed nearing extinction. 
 The legislation never came, and convertibles returned. A new Eldorado listed for $11,049 in '76; recent auction sales for decent examples are in the $25,000 range. Using the C.P.I. inflation calculator, that $11,049 in cash is now equivalent to $40,485. Had the purchase price been invested in a mutual fund that tracked the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, it would have grown to $200,000. 
 1975-76 CHEVROLET COSWORTH VEGA Even the much-maligned Chevrolet Vega flirted with instant-collectible status. One performance version was powered by a twin-cam 16-valve 4-cylinder engine designed by Cosworth, the British engineering firm and racing engine builder. This unlikely combination, with a factory price of $5,916, was deemed a keeper by many owners. 
 Formerly mothballed examples still exist. A March 2007 sale of a 30,000-mile example in average condition for $8,800 may seem like a tidy profit, but you'd fire any broker who did not deliver a better rate of return over 30 years. 
 1975-76 BRICKLIN SV-1 The gullwing Bricklin was one of the best cars ever to come out of New Brunswick, Canada. Costing $7,490 new, a better-than-average example can be found today for less than $20,000, according to the most recent National Automobile Dealers Association Classic Collectible and Special Interest Price Guide. 
 1981-82 DELOREAN DMC-12 With its stainless-steel skin and gullwing doors, the DeLorean looked flashy, but performance from the rear-mounted V-6 engine fell short of the appearance. When introduced, its price was $26,175; the N.A.D.A. guide says an average example will sell for $27,100 today. No wonder so many roam the streets dressed up in ''Back to the Future'' guise. 
 1985-91 FERRARI TESTAROSSA The Testarossa was the car to have in the late 1980s, so desirable that it took some luck to find one for sale at its 1987 window sticker of $134,000. 
 ''People were ready to pay $30, $40 or $50,000 over list '' to buy one, said John Levy, a sales consultant with Shelton Ferrari in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ''The more people saw them go up in price, the more they were willing to pay.'' 
 ''Then the music stopped,'' Mr. Levy said, adding that ''a good early Testarossa could be had today for around $50,000.'' 
 1988 35TH ANNIVERSARY CHEVROLET CORVETTE Chevrolet has released quite a few special-edition Corvettes, including Indianapolis 500 pace cars and models for the 25th and 50th anniversaries. One even commemorated the car's 35th birthday. While 25 is silver and 50 is gold, 35 is coral -- endangered, yes, but not something that savvy investors hoard as an inflation hedge. 
 The same is true for the Corvette's 35th -- interesting, but hardly investment grade. If you had invested your $34,275 at the rate of inflation and walked to work, you would now have about $60,406. A very nice example of one of the 2,050 built will cost you about $21,000 today, according to the Cars of Particular Interest Value Guide. 
 1982-91 PORSCHE 944 The years have not been kind to the values of Porsches from the 1980s. As an investment by an original buyer, the saddest case of all may be the 944, a front-engine water-cooled 4-cylinder car that followed the tepid 924 in both design and execution. At introduction, the 944 cost $18,980. Today, one in good condition is worth $4,100, according to Kelley Blue Book.

YOU really cannot imagine how beautiful and yet how empty it is at Lake Pend Oreille in North Idaho. When I take my hardy little Thompson motorboat out in front of my future home there -- at a resort community called the Seasons, for avid boaters like me -- the water goes on forever. There may be one or two other boats at most, and eagles are nesting next to where I moor my boat for lunch. Hard to believe: it's real, perfect and uncrowded.
 On the other hand, here are a few parcels of the daily drama of life that are easily real. When scientists discovered nucular power, as George Bush and I call it, they considered its uses virtually unlimited. Even now, we have not plumbed all of the atom's utility. The same goes for hedge funds. 
 Supposedly, a number of wizard managers consistently earn more than 40 percent a year for their hedge funds. Yes, I know that this conflicts with every bit of investment and market theory -- or almost every bit. I know that such a thing should be impossible. But, supposedly, magicians like Steven A. Cohen, founder of SAC Capital in Stamford, Conn., can regularly earn 40 percent a year -- often more -- on their capital.
 But why waste our time on envy or disbelief? Let's put Mr. Cohen to work for the greater good. Let's have the federal government issue about $10 trillion in Steven A. Cohen National Debt Retirement Fund Bonds. After interest is paid on the bonds, if Mr. Cohen makes 40 percent on the money, the fund will return 36 percent a year. That means that in only two years, he will have made roughly $10 trillion for the taxpayers, with which he can pay off the entire United States federal debt.
 Even if Mr. Cohen follows his usual pattern and charges the client -- in this case, the government -- 50 percent, thus lowering the effective yield to a ''mere'' 16 percent, his brilliance and skills will have paid off the entire national debt in less than five years. That's unless, of course, Mr. Bush -- or Hillary or Mitt or Rudy or Barack after him -- add hugely to the national debt.
 But wait, as they say in the infomercials, there's more! Why do we need federal taxes? The government spends very roughly $2.3 trillion a year. Suppose that Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. issues $6 trillion in Steven A. Cohen Budget Anticipation Trust Bonds. And suppose Congress mandates that Mr. Cohen not charge a fee for managing this fund. In one year, his bonds will have earned enough for all federal expenditures, thus eliminating the need for taxes. And why not do this every year? Why burden us peons with taxes when stock market and other speculation can take up the slack?
 And that's just the beginning. Why not have a Medicare Anticipation account in which speculation is used to defray the avalanche of costs reasonably anticipated by Medicare? The power of uncompromising pure research and split-second timing is limitless. 
 My pal Phil DeMuth, investment guru of Conservative Wealth Management, has calculated that if Mr. Cohen uses his laser vision to keep making 40 percent a year indefinitely, by 2075 he will have as much money as the rest of the country put together.
 By 2080, on the same assumptions, he will have all of the wealth of the United States unto himself. Within a decade or so more (very, very roughly) he will have all the wealth in the world.
 I KNOW that there is a little problem called mortality here. But do you really think that a man who can consistently get 40 percent a year in speculation cannot defeat that problem? Anyway, he probably has a little black book with phone numbers or a black box with unimaginably complex strategies for trading locked up somewhere that will keep on churning out these results for his heirs.
 Now, I am a little troubled by where this leaves the other hedge fund managers who are also making 40 percent a year for their hedge funds, both here and abroad. At some point, the top players will start bumping up against limits, and against one another. Then it will be like King Kong versus Godzilla versus Mothra -- a giant creature in early horror movies that resembled an immense moth. Only the toughest hedge fund manager will be left standing. And I am not sure where this leaves China, which is growing, and will surely keep growing, at 10 percent a year.
 Mr. Cohen has the sechel (a Yiddish word meaning wisdom), but China has the bomb and the Thought of Mao Zedong. It's all too complicated for me. And I think that by solving the problems of the national debt and taxation, I have done enough for today. 
 Hedge fund power. Unlimited, clean and silent. In the meantime, enjoy Lake Pend Oreille and the splendid empty waterways and mountain forests of North Idaho before it all becomes the United States of Cohen.

HEADLINE: Fearing Fear Itself

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
In America's darkest hour, Franklin Delano Roosevelt urged the nation not to succumb to ''nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror.'' But that was then. 
 Today, many of the men who hope to be the next president -- including all of the candidates with a significant chance of receiving the Republican nomination -- have made unreasoning, unjustified terror the centerpiece of their campaigns.
 Consider, for a moment, the implications of the fact that Rudy Giuliani is taking foreign policy advice from Norman Podhoretz, who wants us to start bombing Iran ''as soon as it is logistically possible.'' 
 Mr. Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary and a founding neoconservative, tells us that Iran is the ''main center of the Islamofascist ideology against which we have been fighting since 9/11.'' The Islamofascists, he tells us, are well on their way toward creating a world ''shaped by their will and tailored to their wishes.'' Indeed, ''Already, some observers are warning that by the end of the 21st century the whole of Europe will be transformed into a place to which they give the name Eurabia.'' 
 Do I have to point out that none of this makes a bit of sense?
 For one thing, there isn't actually any such thing as Islamofascism -- it's not an ideology; it's a figment of the neocon imagination. The term came into vogue only because it was a way for Iraq hawks to gloss over the awkward transition from pursuing Osama bin Laden, who attacked America, to Saddam Hussein, who didn't. And Iran had nothing whatsoever to do with 9/11 -- in fact, the Iranian regime was quite helpful to the United States when it went after Al Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan. 
 Beyond that, the claim that Iran is on the path to global domination is beyond ludicrous. Yes, the Iranian regime is a nasty piece of work in many ways, and it would be a bad thing if that regime acquired nuclear weapons. But let's have some perspective, please: we're talking about a country with roughly the G.D.P. of Connecticut, and a government whose military budget is roughly the same as Sweden's. 
 Meanwhile, the idea that bombing will bring the Iranian regime to its knees -- and bombing is the only option, since we've run out of troops -- is pure wishful thinking. Last year Israel tried to cripple Hezbollah with an air campaign, and ended up strengthening it instead. There's every reason to believe that an attack on Iran would produce the same result, with the added effects of endangering U.S. forces in Iraq and driving oil prices well into triple digits.
 Mr. Podhoretz, in short, is engaging in what my relatives call crazy talk. Yet he is being treated with respect by the front-runner for the G.O.P. nomination. And Mr. Podhoretz's rants are, if anything, saner than some of what we've been hearing from some of Mr. Giuliani's rivals. 
 Thus, in a recent campaign ad Mitt Romney asserted that America is in a struggle with people who aim ''to unite the world under a single jihadist Caliphate. To do that they must collapse freedom-loving nations. Like us.'' He doesn't say exactly who these jihadists are, but presumably he's referring to Al Qaeda -- an organization that has certainly demonstrated its willingness and ability to kill innocent people, but has no chance of collapsing the United States, let alone taking over the world.
 And Mike Huckabee, whom reporters like to portray as a nice, reasonable guy, says that if Hillary Clinton is elected, ''I'm not sure we'll have the courage and the will and the resolve to fight the greatest threat this country's ever faced in Islamofascism.'' Yep, a bunch of lightly armed terrorists and a fourth-rate military power -- which aren't even allies -- pose a greater danger than Hitler's panzers or the Soviet nuclear arsenal ever did.
 All of this would be funny if it weren't so serious.
 In the wake of 9/11, the Bush administration adopted fear-mongering as a political strategy. Instead of treating the attack as what it was -- an atrocity committed by a fundamentally weak, though ruthless adversary -- the administration portrayed America as a nation under threat from every direction. 
 Most Americans have now regained their balance. But the Republican base, which lapped up the administration's rhetoric about the axis of evil and the war on terror, remains infected by the fear the Bushies stirred up -- perhaps because fear of terrorists maps so easily into the base's older fears, including fear of dark-skinned people in general. 
 And the base is looking for a candidate who shares this fear. 
 Just to be clear, Al Qaeda is a real threat, and so is the Iranian nuclear program. But neither of these threats frightens me as much as fear itself -- the unreasoning fear that has taken over one of America's two great political parties.

HEADLINE: Travel Sales Still Growing, but Numbers of Customers Are Declining

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
THE online travel category is still rolling along, but there may be trouble ahead.
 Like other e-commerce markets, travel is expected to produce double-digit sales growth this year in the United States, but unlike other major segments, this one is actually losing customers. According to a recent survey of more than 60,000 Internet users in the United States by Forrester Research, a technology consulting firm, 9 percent fewer people booked travel online this year than in 2005. It is the first time since Forrester began tracking Internet spending a decade ago that a category has lost shoppers.
 ''This is a wake-up call for the industry,'' said Henry Harteveldt, Forrester's online travel analyst. ''Customers are tired of spending two or three hours trying to find the airline or hotel or vacation package that meets their needs.'' 
 Of the four major online travel agencies contacted -- Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz Worldwide and Priceline.com -- only Orbitz and Travelocity disclosed statistics about their domestic customer bases. Both said they had increased, but neither would disclose the extent of the growth.
 Forrester's findings were echoed by research that was expected to be published this week by PhoCusWright, a travel consultancy based in Connecticut. PhoCusWright found that among travelers with access to the Internet, the percentage who usually book travel online dropped to 62 percent at the end of last year from 68 percent in 2005, while those who say they usually arrange travel offline increased to 31 percent from 25 percent during the same period.
 Industry revenues are still strong, mostly because those consumers who book travel online are doing more of it. According to the Forrester survey, the average online booker said he or she would spend 50 percent more on travel this year than in 2005. Fans of the bottom line may not be alarmed, then, that some customers have lost their taste for online travel agents, especially if serving the remaining customers proves more profitable. Customers who never call the company for help, for instance, are considerably more valuable than those who do.
 But Mr. Harteveldt said companies that relied on a shrinking base of customers would lose ground if they did not help online travel bookers overcome some longstanding hurdles. In particular, he said, online travel agencies and sites from airline, hotel and rental car suppliers rely on the same approach they used a decade ago: they require shoppers to type in their travel dates and locations and wait for a list of options that may or may not fit their budgets or needs. 
 The search engines of travel sites do not do enough to take other factors into consideration, Mr. Harteveldt said. ''Nowhere can you say, 'I have this amount of money to spend on a trip. These are my interests. This is where I live. Show me my options,''' he said. ''Whereas online retailers have done a much better job of improving the shopping experience in recent years, the travel industry has been standing still.''
 Online travel executives say part of the reason for the dearth of innovation is that the online travel reservation systems are largely extensions of technology built in the 1960s. Those systems were intended to quickly execute searches and transactions by handling small bits of information at a time, rather than including many bits of data about someone's travel preferences, for instance.
 Travel sites have, for years, spoken about their quest to offer more personalized trip ideas and bookings based on such preferences, but with few tangible results. Now, independent technology companies are starting to enter the market with their own services.
 Last week, for instance, LeisureLogix, based in Southlake, Tex., a technology company led by veterans of the online and travel industries, introduced a personalized search product for road travelers called the ''Road Trip Wizard.''
 The service made its debut on Travelocity (travelocity.roadtripwizard.com) and is to appear on other travel Web sites in the coming months. It asks travelers to select attributes that best describe their interests and trip preferences, and it returns an itinerary, including maps, driving directions, tourist attractions and hotels. Hotels can be booked through the service. Tickets to tourist attractions are to be added as the attractions improve their online booking systems.
 Michael Hulley, the chief executive of LeisureLogix, said the service was among the first to tailor a trip to a traveler's interests and needs. ''This is based on the entire travel experience,'' he said. ''It's not just about the destination, but the things you do along the way.''
 Andres Fabris, Travelocity's vice president of business development, said the new service would help the company tap into a market it had overlooked. Travelocity, which is owned by Sabre Holdings, regarded travelers who drive as less lucrative than, say, airline travelers, but it recently discovered that 85 percent of road travelers book midscale or upscale hotels.
 The personalized approach of the Road Trip Warrior service is something, Travelocity is working to incorporate into other recommendation services on the site, Mr. Fabris said. ''It's certainly very compelling to be able to establish your persona and preferences,'' he said.
 Lorraine Sileo, an analyst with PhoCusWright, said the LeisureLogix technology was ''a good advancement.'' But, she added, the information it presents to travelers must continue to be comprehensive if it hopes to yield well-tailored results to users. ''Hopefully, LeisureLogix can do that,'' she said.
 Travelocity's competitors, meanwhile, claim they are already making significant, if sometimes overlooked, improvements in the travel booking process. Orbitz, for instance, this year introduced sections of its Web site devoted to ''Road Warriors'' and family travelers, with lists of hotels and destinations deemed suitable to those groups.
 Expedia, too, said it had simplified and personalized the booking process. According to Paul Brown, president of Expedia North America, Expedia suggests hotels based on whether it thinks the customer is a business or family traveler, among other things. If the customer's search suggests he is staying midweek for one night in a city, for instance, Expedia will show him hotels near business centers.
 ''I won't say there aren't upsides to understanding more about the person traveling,'' Mr. Brown said. ''But we believe knowing about the occasion behind the trip, in many cases, is more important.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 5, 2007

 CORRECTION:
The E-Commerce Report column in Business Day last Monday, about online travel agencies, misidentified the location of LeisureLogix, a technology company that has introduced a personalized search service for travelers. It is based in Tampa, Fla., not Southlake, Tex. The column also misstated, in one reference, the name of the search service on the Travelocity Web site. As the column noted, it is the Road Trip Wizard -- not the Road Trip Warrior.

HEADLINE: Big Dreams, Big Expenses: In a Lavish Town House, an Art Gallery in Trouble

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON and PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
In the gossipy world of Manhattan art dealers who ship expensive canvases back and forth on little more than a handshake, it was talked about long before it opened in the fall of 2005: a lavish gallery in a town house from the Roaring Twenties that had just undergone at least $2 million in renovations.
 It was on East 71st Street, right in the heart of art-gallery country on the Upper East Side, around the corner from the renowned Frick Collection. One reviewer wrote that the look inside was ''robber-baron chic,'' with thick carpets on the floors and velvety coverings on the walls. 
 The rent was $154,000. 
 A month.
 The town house -- and the money it consumed -- seem to be central to understanding the widening legal and financial crisis that has made the gallery it housed, the Salander-O'Reilly Galleries, the talk of the art world.
 The story behind Salander-O'Reilly's tumble is a complicated one, but to art world rubberneckers who are both involved and watching from the sidelines, it is a story of big dreams and big expenses, combined with something unusual: a respected dealer who tried to expand beyond his long-established niche.
 Originally, the town house was planned as an offshoot of a smaller gallery eight blocks away, on East 79th Street -- one that had a solid reputation, mounted regularly reviewed shows and represented a comfortable roster of artists. The rent there was $58,333 a month.
 The smaller gallery closed within a year after the town house opened. Now the town house itself is dark, the locks on its wide front doors changed by order of a judge. The dealer behind Salander-O'Reilly, Lawrence B. Salander, is facing a tangle of lawsuits from angry collectors who say he and Salander-O'Reilly defrauded its customers and business partners.
 The lawsuits accuse him of falling millions of dollars behind on obligations like the rent and the payments he had promised the well-connected people who invested in paintings with him. One lawsuit described the gallery as ''nothing more than a Ponzi scheme.'' 
 Some artists' estates say the gallery sold consigned paintings without their permission for less than the paintings were worth, and never paid them. Some artists' relatives say they have discovered works entrusted to Salander-O'Reilly in other galleries or museums.
 The Manhattan district attorney's office says it has been reviewing complaints about Salander-O'Reilly, and at least one artist's family has gone to the police. John Crawford, a son of the abstract painter, photographer and printmaker Ralston Crawford, said that he did so after it became clear that at least a dozen paintings and photographs consigned to the gallery were missing. He estimated that they were worth $1.2 million to $1.5 million. 
 Mr. Salander ''used to say, 'Do the right thing for the art and the rest will follow,''' Mr. Crawford said.
 ''The idea was that he was putting everything he could behind the art, promoting it in an intelligent way and doing the right thing,'' Mr. Crawford said.
 Back in 2005, when Salander-O'Reilly opened the town house, dealers and collectors marveled at how Mr. Salander had managed such an extravagant expansion. 
 They marveled, too, at his strategy of using the town house gallery to show and sell old masters after years of specializing in 20th-century American art on East 79th Street.
 Richard L. Feigen, another prominent dealer, said he was ''flabbergasted by the size of the space'' and the scope of the operation Mr. Salander was trying to run. ''The market for old masters and Renaissance sculpture right now is a very small market and there are few buyers,'' he said. 
 Frances Beatty, a vice president of Mr. Feigen's company, said of Mr. Salander's foray into buying and selling old masters: ''It is as if a talented, successful pop singer decided to go into opera and then build himself La Scala. It's pretty ambitious and it requires very deep pockets.''
 Whispers of Salander-O'Reilly's troubles began to circulate last summer and became louder when The Maine Antique Digest published an article about some of the lawsuits. At the time, Mr. Salander was borrowing money -- $138,650 in June, $525,000 in July, $200,000 in August -- with more than 20 works of art as collateral.
 Sotheby's financial arm, which made those loans after reviewing documents from Mr. Salander that said he held title to the works in question, filed a lawsuit on Friday, claiming that its dealings with Mr. Salander should not be subject to a judge's ruling that essentially blocked the sale of the paintings and sculpture inside the town house.
 A lawyer representing Mr. Salander in some of the lawsuits said on Friday that he was not familiar with Mr. Salander's borrowing. Mr. Salander could not be reached to be interviewed for this article; a telephone number he provided during an interview two weeks ago has been disconnected. 
 In that interview, Mr. Salander said everyone had ''always been paid for the pictures I sold for them.'' 
 ''When people say it's a Ponzi scheme, it's a house of cards -- I've got millions of dollars of assets here,'' he said then. ''It's beyond belief.'' He added: ''The art business used to be one where people would shake hands and pictures would go out for millions of dollars and everybody got paid. All of a sudden, it's a business with lawyers and lawsuits.''
 Mr. Salander, 58, has been in the art and antiques business for nearly 40 years and made his name selling American art produced between 1900 and 1950. In 2001, he told The Art Newspaper, a London monthly, that his father, his grandfather and two uncles had been antiques dealers. 
 He also told The Art Newspaper that after his father died in 1969, ''I had to go to work.'' After a time at Astor Galleries in Greenwich Village, he opened a shop in Wilton, Conn., where he advertised 19th- and 20th-century paintings and furniture.
 By the mid-1970s, he had moved to Manhattan, where he eventually joined forces with another dealer, William O'Reilly. They moved to East 79th Street in 1989. He and Mr. O'Reilly parted company in the mid-1990s, although the gallery's name remained unchanged.
 People who dealt with Mr. Salander said he was passionate about the art he showed and sold. Mr. Salander was ''not a dealer that one would describe as reserved and methodical,'' said Maxwell L. Anderson, a former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art who is now director and chief executive of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. 
 Mr. Salander, Mr. Anderson added, was ''direct and a straight shooter, a person who is not polished in the ways of the art world, the niceties of convention, art world manners, but was an honest and direct person.''
 But as he began to move into old masters, some eyebrows went up.
 Some of Mr. Salander's clients had their misgivings as soon as they set foot in the town house on East 71st Street. 
 ''All I could think about was the overhead,'' recalled Alison Hilding, who had consigned paintings by her great-uncle, the Abstract Expressionist painter Giorgio Cavallon. ''I thought, this is trouble.''
 Even by the standards of the Upper East Side, Salander-O'Reilly's new showplace did not come cheap. 
 Besides the $154,000-a-month rent on the town house, built in 1923 by a fabric manufacturer, the gallery was responsible for property taxes of almost $20,000 a month. Mr. Salander did not put down a cash deposit for the lease for the town house; instead, he gave the owner an oil painting by Edouard Manet titled ''La Femme aux Chiens.'' He has asserted incourt documents that it was worth ''well over $10 million.''
 Within a few months of opening the 71st Street gallery, Mr. Salander was struggling to cover his expenses, court documents indicate.
 In the spring of 2005, he asked Elaine A. Rosenberg, his landlord on 79th Street, to let him put off paying most of his rent for more than a year, she said. Ms. Rosenberg said she agreed to the arrangement and began billing him for just one-quarter of the rent, or about $14,600 a month.
 ''He was carrying much, much, too much,'' she said in an interview. 
 Ms. Rosenberg, who said she had known Mr. Salander for more than 15 years, said he had explained the move to 71st Street by saying he needed more space and expected to attract ''all the new money'' to invest in European works. 
 Ms. Rosenberg said that she had had no complaint about Mr. Salander as a tenant until after he opened on 71st Street. But she said she believed that Mr. Salander's push to expand was motivated by financial concerns. 
 ''He needed money,'' she said Mr. Salander told her. 
 In May 2005, about the time Mr. Salander began deferring most of the rent on the 79th Street gallery, he presented another proposition to Ms. Rosenberg, according to a suit she filed against him in State Supreme Court. He invited her to put up $200,000 for a half-interest in ''Brown Table Still Life,'' a painting by Stuart Davis, an artist Salander-O'Reilly had long represented. She said in the lawsuit that Mr. Salander intended to resell it for $800,000 within about six months.
 Ms. Rosenberg said she gave him the $200,000. Mr. Salander bought the painting for $400,000, according to documents filed in the case. She asserted that he later sold it but did not share the profit or repay the $200,000. Mr. Salander has denied in court papers that he resold ''Brown Table Still Life.''
 To some dealers, Salander-O'Reilly's problems bring to mind a scandal that rocked the art world in 2005 and culminated in a bankruptcy filing by another East Side gallery, the Berry-Hill Galleries. Some of its creditors maintained that it had manipulated an auction at Christie's to drive up the value of its own paintings.
 Ian Peck, the chief executive of a firm that arranges financing for dealers and collectors and that was Berry-Hill's lead lender, suggested that the Berry-Hill bankruptcy and the Salander-O'Reilly situation point up the pitfalls of the art market, in which it can be hard to figure out who owns a painting, much less what it is really worth.

HEADLINE: A Risk-Taker's Reign at Merrill Ends With a Swift, Messy Fall

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr. and JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
The six-year reign of E. Stanley O'Neal at Merrill Lynch has been one of contradictions. He was a loner in an industry that places a premium on relationships. And he pushed Merrill into risky investments despite his experience as chief financial officer, where assessing risk was one of his responsibilities.
 Now after an $8.4 billion write-down and an unauthorized merger approach to a rival bank, Wachovia, Mr. O'Neal has lost the confidence of his board and is expected to resign as chairman and chief executive as early as today.
 Directors, having decided Mr. O'Neal should leave, met through the weekend to determine who should succeed him. 
 One possible successor who has drawn support from within the firm is Laurence D. Fink, the head of the asset management firm BlackRock, which is 49 percent owned by Merrill. One option the board is considering would keep Gregory J. Fleming as a Merrill co-president and name Robert J. McCann, the president of Merrill's wealth management unit, a co-president. 
 Mr. O'Neal's fall has been stunning in its speed and ferocity. This spring, Merrill's stock was trading around $95 a share, and Mr. O'Neal was being celebrated for transforming Merrill into a more aggressive, risk-friendly institution. Last week, the stock sunk to as low as $59 a share. 
 The events underscore that on Wall Street, even the highest paid chief executives with handpicked boards are not immune to the furies of investors and employees. 
 His fall is also a reminder of how dangerous it is to tinker with a firm's culture. Having declared the idea of a nurturing Mother Merrill passe, Mr. O'Neal has discovered how vengeful a spurned culture can be. 
 Mr. O'Neal's ascent -- through hard work and the cultivation of crucial relationships -- was unusual for its swiftness. He also has the ability to be at the center of major financial disruptions without taking on significant blame. He was a senior banker in the junk bond division when the firm had a $470 million write-down; he was a co-head of Merrill's institutional business in 1997, a few months before the Asian financial crisis hurt the markets. He was chief financial officer in 1998 when the firm had a quarterly loss because of bond trading and exposure to the troubled hedge fund Long Term Capital Management.
 People who have worked with Mr. O'Neal, 56, describe an aloof, calculating man who during his 20 years at the firm has made few friends. While he has been quick to forge temporary alliances with superiors like Herbert M. Allison Jr., a former president who was his first mentor, and Arshad R. Zakaria and Thomas H. Patrick Sr., who championed his candidacy for the top job, he has been equally quick to cut ties to them. 
 Some of his closest relationships date back to his days in the General Motors treasury department where he was first noticed as a smart, ambitious executive. It was at G.M. that he met his wife, Nancy Garvey, who was an economist and remains one of his closest confidantes, and John D. Finnegan, the chief executive of Chubb whom he recruited to the Merrill board in 2004.
 But colleagues say there was a part of Mr. O'Neal that seemed to resist this ascent. Twice, he came close to leaving the firm and was notorious for his propensity to fall into a funk when things were not going his way. A golf fanatic -- his handicap is nine and he belongs to four country clubs -- he often plays alone, in addition to the usual rounds with clients and a circle of friends outside Merrill. 
 But, colleagues also say that at times of crisis, he can display energy, acumen and leadership, as he did in the days after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Then Merrill's president, Mr. O'Neal worked countless hours as the firm tried to regain its footing. 
 For many, especially those far from the intrigues and complexities of Wall Street, Merrill Lynch stands for solidity and good faith, principles that were rocked by the events of the last few months. But old Merrill hands feel that the firm will survive, despite the notion that it may become vulnerable to a takeover. 
 ''This is a resilient franchise,'' said Stephen Hammerman, a former vice chairman of Merrill who supported Mr. O'Neal's bid for chief. Mr. Hammerman said he felt concern for Merrill Lynch employees who have seen the stock decline. 
 For a time, Merrill's business flourished as Mr. O'Neal took on more risk and made deep cuts. In 2006, Merrill made $7 billion from using its capital to trade for itself and clients, compared with $2.2 billion in 2002. Some riskier businesses that the firm was involved with, like private equity and lending, fared well this summer. 
 Merrill's exposure to the volatile and ultimately toxic market for complex debt instruments called collateralized debt obligations exploded to more than $40 billion from around $1 billion about 18 months ago. Initially, the increased risk was a boon -- part of a shift from the firm's classic position as a money manager with an excellent stock underwriting business to a bank that had become increasingly hooked on the high-octane, high-risk returns that came from investing its own money.
 In the second quarter, just before the collapse in the credit markets, fixed-income revenues skyrocketed 201 percent over the same quarter a year earlier. Underpinning this growth was the firm's market-leading position in packaging different and risky kinds of debt.
 Directors were briefed about the firm's subprime exposure in April and collateralized debt obligations in July, according to a person briefed on the presentations. While Merrill was scrambling to reduce its exposures, worsening conditions in late July shut down the market for even the highest-rated collateralized debt obligations, making it clear that Merrill's position was starting to look problematic, this person said. 
 From late July through September, Mr. O'Neal was actively involved in tackling the problem, said a person briefed on the events. He led daily meetings, and called in during his vacation. 
 He also had another window into the market's fall. As a director at BlackRock, Mr. O'Neal had been briefed on the dangers of high-risk subprime exposure. 
 On its second-quarter conference call, Merrill and Mr. O'Neal projected a sunny outlook, promoting the firm's risk management practices. 
 But in July, when the credit markets froze, it was clear that Merrill stood to lose a lot of money. As the market deteriorated, and Merrill faced bigger losses, tensions were beginning to boil over. In contrast to past Merrill chiefs who cultivated a clubbier style of management, Mr. O'Neal was not averse to letting rivalries fester.
 According to people briefed on the situation, Mr. O'Neal wanted to fire his chief financial officer, Jeffrey N. Edwards, and replace him with a longtime friend, H. McIntyre Gardner. 
 At the end of July, Ahmass L. Fakahany, who despite his lack of any trading experience had assumed broad responsibility over the firm's risk exposure, kept the board briefed on the situation. He sent an e-mail message to Charles O. Rossotti, the director in charge of Merrill's risk committee, according to one person briefed on the communication. In the message, which he copied to Mr. O'Neal, Mr. Fakahany told the board of the exposure. 
 With the markets worsening, Mr. Fakahany and Mr. Fleming sent a three-page letter to directors on Aug. 9, titled ''Board Market Update End July Results: Note from Fakahany and Fleming,'' discussing the mounting losses and troubles, and explaining that significant deterioration had taken place in July, according to a person briefed on the situation. The letter was also sent to Mr. O'Neal and Merrill's general counsel, Rosemary T. Berkery. The deterioration continued, ultimately reaching $7.9 billion in late October, almost $2.5 billion more than Merrill had announced only weeks earlier.
 For the board, the fast accumulation of bad news came as a shock. A year earlier, directors had paid Mr. O'Neal $46 million after the firm's impressive results. Now the biggest losses in the firm's 93 years were looming. 
 When directors were briefed late last week about Mr. O'Neal's approach to G. Kennedy Thompson, the chief executive at Wachovia, they were furious. Mr. Fleming, who is close to Mr. Thompson, had followed up Mr. O'Neal's initial overture, making it look as if it was more than just putting out feelers. 
 Even after that board meeting, it was by no means unanimous that Mr. O'Neal would have to leave. As late as Tuesday, the day before earnings were to be reported, one director told a friend that it was a mistake to lump Mr. O'Neal with other troubled chief executives like Charles O. Prince III of Citigroup, who is under scrutiny because of write-offs. Internally, employees viewed the merger talks as the last straw.
 ''We made some stupid mistakes and most of us said, 'Let's figure out how to make this better,''' said a financial adviser with over 25 years of experience at Merrill. ''But then you throw in the merger talks and the typical guy says 'We are desperate.' The sentiment is, these guys have to go.''
 But sentiment was building against Mr. O'Neal among former Merrill executives, some of whom made direct appeals to the board. If he leaves, Mr. O'Neal could be paid at least $159 million, according to an analysis by James F. Reda & Associates, a compensation consulting firm. Had he succeeded in putting together a merger, he might have left with as much as $274 million.
 Mr. O'Neal does not have a severance contract, but the board's compensation committee could grant him severance.
 By late in the week, it had become clear that a change was needed. At that point, three directors, all of whom had been recently selected by Mr. O'Neal, had taken the lead in considering life without him at Merrill -- Mr. Finnegan, Mr. Rossotti and Armando M. Codina, a prominent real estate developer who knew Mr. O'Neal from the G.M. board.

He then steered the company into riskier businesses, including mortgage lending. When Merrill became caught in the credit meltdown, Mr. O'Neal was isolated, with little support on the board.

HEADLINE: Logging Is Part of a Plan to Preserve 161,000 Acres In the Adirondacks Purchased by a Conservation Group

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: ADIRONDACK FOREST PRESERVE 

 BODY:
Late in the year, when the campers are gone but the hunters have not yet arrived, timber trucks rule Boreas Road in the heart of the Adirondacks, barging through the morning mists with 70,000 pounds of fresh-cut fir and spruce strapped to their backs. 
 ''That's one of ours,'' said Michael T. Carr, a 44-year-old bear of a man driving a green S.U.V. headed west on Boreas Road as one of the timber trucks barreled eastward. 
 That is a jarring statement coming from Mr. Carr, who is not a lumber man, or paper company executive, but executive director of the Adirondack chapter of the Nature Conservancy, one of the world's biggest environmental groups and, since June, the owner of 161,000 acres of highly prized Adirondack wild lands. 
 The conservancy entered the timber business when it purchased the land from Finch, Pruyn & Company, which had held it since the Civil War. As part of that $110 million deal, the conservancy agreed to continue logging to supply wood to the Finch Paper mill in Glens Falls, N.Y., for the next 20 years. 
 The Finch, Pruyn (pronounced Prine) lands, considered the last remaining large privately owned parcels in Adirondack Park, are an ecological marvel, containing 144 miles of river, 70 lakes and ponds, more than 80 mountains and a vast unbroken wilderness that only loggers and a few hunters have ever seen. The property also contains unmatched natural features like the blue ledges of the Hudson River Gorge, OK Slip Falls and Boreas Pond, with its stunning views of the Adirondack high peaks, which naturalists have dreamed of protecting for decades. 
 The Adirondack Explorer, a local newspaper, called the transaction ''the deal of the young century.'' Peter Bauer, executive director of the Residents' Committee to Protect the Adirondacks, said the conservancy's handling of the land ''will have a huge impact on what kind of park we have in the future.'' 
 Environmentalists cheered when the conservancy swooped in to buy the Finch holdings, but a stark reality is now setting in. Not all 161,000 acres will be preserved as public wilderness. The terms of the pulp supply agreement are confidential, but foresters with knowledge of the deal said the conservancy could cut at least 65,000 tons of pulpwood trees a year for the mill -- which is about 15 percent less than Finch cut in the Adirondacks last year. In addition, maples and other hardwoods could be cut under strict certified forest management guidelines. 
 The conservancy expects eventually to sell much of the land to the state. But to pay the enormous debt it incurred and the $1 million in annual property taxes, the group will, in the near term, have to sell some portion of the property to private owners. While those buyers will not be allowed to build on the land, they will be able to keep out the public. Some small parcels near existing hamlets might even be sold for housing or commercial development, Mr. Carr said. 
 Mr. Carr expects his decisions about which parcels to sell and to whom will anger as many people as they excite. 
 ''This is not a throw-the-gates-open-to-the-public kind of acquisition,'' Mr. Carr said. A team of scientists is now conducting a rapid ecological assessment of the land. Final decisions will not be announced until next fall, Mr. Carr said, and they will be driven not by concerns about recreational opportunities, or economic development, but ''by science.'' 
 ''We have no intention of making everyone happy,'' he said. 
 He also said that he realizes that people might be confused by a conservation organization being in the timber business. 
 ''Right now, people are not sure if we're going to cut trees or hug them,'' Mr. Carr said. He pointed out that in recent years wood supply deals have become accepted aspects of land preservation efforts, and the economics of this deal make logging -- according to high standards of forest sustainability -- absolutely essential. 
 Overcoming the perception that the conservancy has no business cutting trees is just one challenge Mr. Carr faces in managing one of the most complicated land deals ever attempted in the Northeast. Dealing with close public scrutiny is another. The conservancy came under criticism after The Washington Post published a series of articles in 2003 that focused on the group's transactions, particularly a deal in Texas, where it drilled for natural gas on sensitive lands it had purchased.
 But the most intense pressure is coming from local communities, environmental organizations and special interest groups, all clamoring to stake their interest in the property. Mr. Carr's list of petitioners is long: raft guides, float plane pilots, hunting clubs, loggers, hikers, school superintendents, buffalo ranchers and municipal golf course operators looking to expand. ''Mike Carr has created a five-year nightmare for himself in trying to decide how to unload this property,'' said John Sheehan, spokesman for the Adirondack Council, a nonprofit environmental organization. The impact of those decisions on the Adirondacks and the people who live, work and play there, he said, will be immeasurable.
 But overlapping regulations and competing interests abound within the Adirondack Park, the six million-acre Vermont-size slab of New York State that is a century-old experiment in conservation. 
 Created by the State Legislature in the late 19th century, the park is an unusual mix of public and private lands designed to preserve exquisite mountain wilderness and a rugged way of life. As state purchases added up, the conflict between conservation and economic development intensified, with some local officials arguing that enough property had already been protected.
 Over the last decade, many American paper companies in the Northeast changed the way they operated. They sold off their forestlands, creating historic opportunities for governments or conservation groups to acquire vast tracts of woodlands. During the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki, more than 660,000 acres in the Adirondacks were protected. 
 The Finch, Pruyn lands, while not the largest parcels to change hands, are in some ways among the most important, said Michelle L. Brown, conservation scientist for the conservancy, because they filled in many missing pieces of one of the largest northern forests left in the world. 
 ''What's most impressive to me is the connectivity,'' Ms. Brown said. ''Everything's intact -- the rivers, bogs, wetlands and forest all come together.''
 Seen from Tom Helms's 30-year-old Cessna 206 seaplane, the Finch, Pruyn lands are a mountain-size screen saver, with lines of softwood green surrounding rainbow pixels of autumn-colored hardwoods. Although Finch has cut trees here for 150 years, almost no signs of commercial timber operations are visible from 1,500 feet in the air. 
 ''It's the nicest piece of land in the Adirondacks that the state doesn't own,'' Mr. Helms said. 
 Leonard J. Cronin, Adirondack forest manager for Finch, said the company cut 3,533 acres of woodlands in the Adirondacks last year. Of that, 66 acres were clear-cut. 
 In other Adirondack land deals, the state has purchased easements restricting new construction on timberland. State officials said they are studying the Finch lands now for possible purchases, although some of the Adirondack towns are expected to resist because state-owned land is removed from property tax rolls and they feel the state already owns too much of the Adirondacks. Finch holdings are spread across 31 towns, and money from the state's Environmental Protection Fund can be used for land acquisitions if local communities do not object. 
 Existing leases with private hunting clubs that cover 130,000 acres of the 161,000 in the tract are another big issue. One recent morning, Mr. Carr was out surveying the lands when he ran into David Hubert of Queensbury, a member of the Gooley Club, one of the oldest sportsmen's groups in the Adirondacks. Mr. Hubert, 67, said he was worried about the future of the 16,000 acres the club has leased for the last 50 years. 
 ''Obviously, we'd like to see it put to use in the same fashion as it is now,'' Mr. Hubert said. He had just come back from hunting woodcock with his Brittany spaniel. ''I'd hate to see it become non-game-producing state land.'' 
 Mr. Carr has spent months listening to leaseholders and community leaders. Both the Adirondack Council and the Adirondack Mountain Club have already made their desires known: They want the state to buy about half of the 161,000 acres for forest preserve, with most of the rest sold with conservation easements to private buyers.
 And those groups agree that woodland crews should continue cutting trees for the conservancy. Mr. Carr said he hopes that shows there no longer needs to be a choice between cutting and conservation.
 ''At this scale, and with this much land,'' he said, ''there's room for both.''

HEADLINE: Reimagining the Automobile Industry by Selling the Electricity

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
Shai Agassi, a Silicon Valley technologist who was in competition to become chief executive of SAP, one of the world's largest software companies, has re-emerged with a grand plan to reinvent the world's automobile industry around battery-powered all-electric cars.
 Others are developing green cars, like the Tesla and Chevrolet Volt. However, Mr. Agassi is not planning to make cars, but instead wants to deploy an infrastructure of battery-charging stations in the United States, Europe and the developing world. 
 The new system will sell electric fuel on a subscription basis and will subsidize vehicle costs through leases and credits.
 ''We're basically saying this is just like the cellular phone model,'' he said. ''If you think of Tesla as the iPhone, we're AT&T.''
 On Monday, he plans to announce in New York City that he has raised $200 million from private venture partners, including the Israel Corporation, a large Israeli transportation and technology holding company, Vantage Point Venture Partners, as well as a group of private investors including Edgar Bronfman Sr., the liquor magnate, and James D. Wolfensohn, former head of the World Bank. Israel Corporation's $100 million investment was announced earlier this year. 
 In an interview Thursday, Mr. Agassi said tests of prototype vehicles would start in early 2008 and the company would begin commercial sales and service in two years. He said he was working to obtain commitments from both governments and carmakers.
 Mr. Agassi founded TopTier software in Israel in 1992 and then moved the company to California. TopTier was acquired by SAP, based in Germany, in 2001.
 He said his approach was a radical departure from other electric-car ventures that relied on advances in battery technology, which have come slowly.
 Instead, he plans to extend the existing electric-power grids with a wide network of intelligent recharging stations in urban areas and supplementing it with a smaller number of automated battery-replacement stations.
 Today, giant automobile makers as well as start-ups like Silicon Valley's Tesla Motors are struggling with life cycle, performance and the cost limitations of battery technology. Tesla, for example, has been delayed several times by battery-related issues and now says it plans to deliver its first models next year.
 General Motors has said it hopes to have advanced lithium-ion battery technology in place to commercialize its planned Chevrolet Volt, but those batteries are still being developed.
 There are also issues of safety with existing lithium-ion batteries that have become unstable under extreme temperatures.
 ''If you listen to the car companies, they suggest there is a fix, but it's not there yet,'' said Stephen J. Girsky, a partner at the investment firm Centerbridge Partners who formerly served as an adviser to General Motors.
 However, the new venture, which Mr. Agassi has named, for now, Better Place, would be viable even with existing lithium-ion battery technology, he said.
 The economics will be more compelling in Europe, where gasoline is roughly twice as expensive as in the United States, he said. Assuming a life span of 1,500 battery recharges, he said that the energy cost of all-electric cars would be about 7 cents a mile. That would be less than a third of the cost of driving a gasoline-powered car today.
 ''It's much easier to transport electrons than octane molecules,'' he said. ''We've already got a grid that goes around the entire world; all we have to do is extend it.''
 Mr. Agassi envisions tens of thousands of recharging spots that will adjust for both cost and use patterns. For example, a group of parking-lot chargers at a workplace might recharge a visitor's car before a regular employee's car parked for the entire day.
 The system will also supplement recharging stations that require about one minute of recharge time for every minute of driving, with a smaller number of car-wash-style stations for swapping batteries. This would make it possible for a driver to go to a station rather than wait to recharge a battery, he said.

HEADLINE: Study Links Lenders to Swift Foreclosures

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
In neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx hit hard by the subprime lending crisis, mortgages had the shortest of life spans -- taking about a year to go from approval to notice of foreclosure -- and many of those home loans were originated by the same few lenders, according to a report released yesterday by State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein. 
 The report found there were 19,729 foreclosure notices filed in New York City and Westchester and Nassau Counties from July 1, 2006, to July 31, 2007. 
 In the Jamaica and South Jamaica sections of Queens, the average time from mortgage origination to notice of foreclosure was 11 months. In Wakefield and Baychester in the Bronx, it was 14 months, the report said.
 In Queens, the study said, the greatest number of mortgages that resulted in foreclosure notices were issued by three lenders: Fremont Investment and Loan, WMC Mortgage, and the New Century Financial Corporation. Those lenders had also approved the most mortgages set for foreclosure in Brooklyn, the report showed. The three lenders totaled 618 foreclosure notices in the city and Westchester County during the 13 months studied.
 Subprime loans have helped borrowers with modest incomes and poor credit buy homes, but the loans usually carry higher fees and interest rates, as well as a higher risk of foreclosure. On Thursday, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, released a report projecting that of an estimated 364,433 subprime loans held by homeowners in the state, more than 20 percent would end up in foreclosure by the end of 2009. 
 ''The time has come for these lending institutions, all these lending institutions on this list, to step up to the plate,'' Senator Klein, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester County, said at a news conference yesterday. 
 He called on lenders to reconfigure subprime mortgages to help people avoid losing their homes. 
 The study was based on data from county clerks' offices, city property records and the research firm PropertyShark.com.
 Fremont Investment and Loan is a subsidiary of California-based Fremont General Corporation, one of the country's biggest subprime lenders until it was ordered by bank regulators in March to stop giving loans to unqualified borrowers. This month, the Massachusetts attorney general sued Fremont General and Fremont Investment and Loan, accusing both of engaging in unfair and deceptive lending practices. Fremont General has said the suit is without merit.
 Senator Klein was joined yesterday by four other state senators, as well as two homeowners affected by the subprime crisis. One of the homeowners, Jay Rosado, 40, said he and his wife, Ana, had been locked into two subprime mortgages from Fremont Investment and Loan on their Throgs Neck home. Their payment increased after two years by about $700, to $4,000 a month. After a long ordeal, the couple refinanced both loans at a lower, fixed interest rate.
 ''It's horrible what they're doing to people,'' Ana Rosado said of subprime lenders.

HEADLINE: Councilman Joins Race For Top Seat In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
City Councilman Bill de Blasio, who lost a bid last year for Council speaker, said yesterday that he would run for Brooklyn borough president in 2009.
 Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, becomes the second candidate to officially enter the race, joining Councilman Charles Barron, who announced his candidacy in May.
 Marty Markowitz, who has been the borough president since being elected in 2001, will lose his seat to term limits. 
 Mr. de Blasio, 46, who was elected to the Council in 2001, has a long resume in politics and government. He was campaign manager for Hillary Rodham Clinton during her 2000 campaign for the United States Senate. Before that, he served as a mayoral aide in the administration of David N. Dinkins.
 ''I'm excited about the prospect of providing leadership for Brooklyn at this time,'' Mr. de Blasio said in an interview. ''Brooklyn is the epicenter of new development in the city. A lot of cultural and business and political change is happening in Brooklyn. And the next borough president will have an opportunity to shape those changes.''
 He is considered an attractive candidate to some Democratic leaders because he has strong ties to labor unions. He has also sponsored welfare laws that seek to help low-income families, children and the homeless.
 So far, Mr. de Blasio has raised more than $300,000 for the race, according to his most recent filing with New York City Campaign Finance Board. Mr. de Blasio said that when public matching funds are included, he has more than $500,000 to spend on the race at this point.
 The Campaign Finance Board had no information about Mr. Barron's fund-raising.
 Politically, Mr. de Blasio believes he will appeal to many ethnic groups in Brooklyn largely because he has long worked with the diverse communities within his district, which stretches from Cobble Hill through Carroll Gardens into Park Slope, Sunset Park and Borough Park.
 ''My view is that I can build a wide coalition,'' Mr. de Blasio said. ''I happen to be an Italian-American with strong ties to southern Brooklyn,'' he said, referring to a region of the borough with a large Italian-American population. ''I come from brownstone Brooklyn and represent Borough Park,'' an area with a large Jewish population.
 ''And historically, I've worked well with the African-American and Caribbean community,'' Mr. de Blasio said.
 Last year, Mr. de Blasio was a prominent supporter of then-Councilwoman Yvette D. Clarke during her successful campaign for Congress. Ms. Clarke is the daughter of Una S. T. Clarke, the first Jamaican-born woman to have served on the Council.
 Earlier in the year, Mr. de Blasio lost an effort to become Council speaker; Christine C. Quinn of Manhattan won. And shortly after, he briefly considered challenging United States Representative Vito J. Fossella, the only Republican in the city's Congressional delegation, in a district that includes all of Staten Island and portions of Brooklyn. But Mr. de Blasio chose not to run, saying he did not have enough time to undertake an effective campaign.
 The race for the Democratic nomination for Brooklyn borough president is likely to be competitive and hard-fought. While Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Barron are the only two candidates so far, many other names have been mentioned as possible candidates.
 Councilman Domenic M. Recchia Jr. has said he is also considering entering the race. Mr. Recchia, Mr. Barron and Mr. de Blasio cannot run for re-election in 2009 because of term limits.

HEADLINE: Trash Talking World War III

 BODY:
America's allies and increasingly the American public are playing a ghoulish guessing game: Will President Bush manage to leave office without starting a war with Iran? Mr. Bush is eagerly feeding those anxieties. This month he raised the threat of ''World War III'' if Iran even figures out how to make a nuclear weapon. 
 With a different White House, we might dismiss this as posturing -- or bank on sanity to carry the day, or the warnings of exhausted generals or a defense secretary more rational than his predecessor. Not this crowd. 
 Four years after his pointless invasion of Iraq, President Bush still confuses bullying with grand strategy. He refuses to do the hard work of diplomacy -- or even acknowledge the disastrous costs of his actions. The Republican presidential candidates have apparently decided that the real commander in chief test is to see who can out-trash talk the White House on Iran. 
 The world should not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon, but there is no easy fix here, no daring surgical strike. Consider Natanz, the underground site where Iran is defying the Security Council by spinning a few thousand centrifuges to produce nuclear fuel. American bombers could take it out, but what about the even more sophisticated centrifuges the administration accuses Iran of hiding? Beyond the disastrous diplomatic and economic costs, a bombing campaign is unlikely to set back Iran's efforts for more than a few years.
 The neocons pushing an attack on Iran admit that a prolonged bombing campaign would be necessary and would likely only delay Iran's program. But it is still worth it, they say, and if everybody gets lucky maybe the attacks will unleash that popular uprising against the mullahs they've been promising for years. 
 That is the same kind of rose-petal thinking that was used to sell Americans a fantasy about the invasion of Iraq. Large numbers of Iranians are fed up with their government's corruption and repression and with being branded a pariah state. Rain down American bombs, however, and the mullahs and Iran's Holocaust-denying president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, are more likely to be turned into national heroes than hung from lampposts. And that's not even calculating the international fury or the additional mayhem Tehran could wreak in Iraq or what would happen to world oil prices. 
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is the other great hope (after Defense Secretary Robert Gates) for holding off a war. She still wants to give sanctions and diplomacy a chance. But, as with everything else she does, there's nowhere near enough follow-through. If the stakes are really that high -- and they are -- then Ms. Rice and her boss must tell Moscow, Beijing and the Europeans that relations will be judged on whether they are willing to place a lot more pressure on Iran. 
 They also need to offer Iran a credible way back in from the cold -- and clear rewards and security guarantees if it is willing to give up its nuclear ambitions. If it's really that important -- and we believe it is -- then it's time to send somebody higher ranking than the American ambassador in Baghdad to deliver the message. 
 For this to have any chance, Mr. Bush will have to tone down the rhetoric. Sure, a lot of these countries are letting greed cloud their judgment, when they balk at restricting trade with Iran. But it's a lot easier to justify when they say they're not giving the crazy American government an excuse for another war.
 Maybe the country will get lucky and Mr. Bush will listen to the exhausted generals. But this isn't just about surviving the rest of his presidency. Fifteen more months of diplomatic drift will bring Iran 15 months closer to figuring out how to make a nuclear weapon.

HEADLINE: f.c.c. set to end sole cable deals for apartments

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
The Federal Communications Commission, hoping to reduce the rising costs of cable television, is preparing to strike down thousands of contracts this week that gave individual cable companies exclusive rights to provide service to an apartment building, the agency's chairman says.
 The new rule could open markets across the country to far-ranging competition. It would also be a huge victory for Verizon Communications and AT&T, which have challenged the cable industry by offering their own video services. The two companies have lobbied aggressively for the provision. They have been supported in their fight by consumer groups, satellite television companies and small rivals to the big cable providers. 
 Commission officials and consumer groups said the new rule could significantly lower cable prices for millions of subscribers who live in apartment buildings and have had no choice in selecting a company for paid television. Government and private studies show that when a second cable company enters a market, prices can drop as much as 30 percent. 
 The change, which is set to be approved Wednesday, is expected to have a particular effect on prices for low-income and minority families. They have seen cable prices rise about three times the rate of inflation over the last decade. A quarter of American households live in apartment buildings housing 50 or more residents, but 40 percent of households headed by Hispanics and African-Americans live in such buildings. 
 ''Exclusive contracts have been one of the most significant barriers to competition,'' Kevin J. Martin, chairman of the commission, said in an interview. Cable prices have risen ''about 93 percent in the last 10 years,'' he said. ''This is a way to introduce additional competition, which will result in lower prices and greater innovation.''
 The decision is the latest in a series of actions by the commission under Mr. Martin to put pressure on cable companies to lower their rates and make their markets more competitive. In December, in a 3-to-2 decision, the commission approved a proposal by Mr. Martin to force municipalities to accelerate the local approval process for the telephone companies to enter new markets. The phone companies had asserted that many municipalities had been delaying approvals, often in the face of cable industry lobbying.
 Last month, the commission approved a rule that requires the largest cable companies to provide programs produced by their affiliates to all of their rivals, including the phone companies and satellite television companies. The commission is also considering a proposal to make it less expensive for independent programmers to lease channels from cable companies.
 Mr. Martin has also pressed the cable companies to offer so-called a la carte plans that would permit subscribers to buy individual channels, or groups of channels, at lower rates than they now pay.
 The new rule would shift the bargaining power over cable and broadband services to apartment residents from landlords and tenant associations. It has been long sought by consumer groups as part of a broader effort to cut prices to the roughly 100 million households that pay for access to television. 
 The change would be an abrupt reversal for the commission, which only four years ago ruled that such exclusive agreements sometimes actually promoted competition by giving landlords the leverage to negotiate for the best terms. 
 Commission officials said they had prohibited other exclusive contracts involving telecommunications, including those in commercial buildings, but trade groups representing cable companies and building owners have indicated they may challenge the commission's move in court.
 Commission officials said the rule aims to put an end to some common practices of landlords and tenant associations that have deprived tenants of choices. They said that in many communities, there has been only one cable provider, and while landlords and tenant associations could select a satellite television provider, the competition from those companies has not led to lower cable prices.
 The cable companies have also managed to shut out competition by signing long-term exclusive deals. The officials said they hoped that opening the apartment doors to the telephone companies, which offer the same packages of television, broadband and phone services as the cable companies, would force the cable companies to cut their rates.
 A few states, including New York, have laws that either restrict or prohibit a landlord or tenant association from entering into an exclusive contract with a cable company. But most states have no such laws, and no state has struck down existing exclusive contracts. Commission officials, consumer groups and rival companies maintain that even in those states like New York with access laws, the rules are not uniformly enforced. They said a federal regulation would fix that.
 In one area alone, Hilton Head, S.C., a small cable provider, the Hargray CATV Company, has been battling for two years with its larger rival, Time Warner, which claims to have an exclusive contract forever to provide service in developments to more than 20,000 customers. Similar battles have been waged between other cable companies and rivals involving buildings across the country.
 Moreover, consumer groups said the number of lengthy exclusive contracts appears to have increased in recent months as AT&T and Verizon have begun to expand their video services and as the commission has indicated it might intervene to ban exclusive arrangements.
 ''For people in apartment buildings, this could be the most significant step towards bringing down cable prices,'' said Gene Kimmelman, vice president for federal affairs at the Consumers Union. ''Most people in apartment buildings have been subject to a monopoly provider, with little or no local control and no federal control over pricing. This is the most significant step regulators can take short of regulating prices.''
 But large cable companies, as well as associations representing building owners and tenant groups, said the change would fundamentally alter the economics of cable television in apartments in ways that would be harmful to consumers. They are threatening to challenge the commission in court. 
 ''It is both unlawful and, as a matter of public policy, wholly inappropriate and counterproductive for the commission to bar cable operators from enforcing existing exclusive contracts,'' said Daniel L. Brenner, a senior vice president of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, the cable industry's main trade association in Washington. ''Exclusive contracts and building-by-building competition can, in fact, promote investment, efficiency and competition.''
 The commission and trade groups said they did not know the precise number of contracts, though they estimated the amount to be in the thousands.
 The cable industry and the owner associations said the cable companies were often granted exclusive rights to buildings after agreeing to make major capital investments in upgrading systems, and that a new rule striking the exclusivity clauses would be an illegal taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment.
 ''The F.C.C.'s approach is wrongheaded,'' said Jim Arbury, senior vice president for government affairs at the National Multi-Housing Council, which represents about 1,000 owners, managers and developers. ''They think that banning exclusives means there will be more competition, when the fact is that exclusive contracts play a definite role in the area of promoting competition.''
 He continued: ''It allows the apartment owner to play the various providers off against each other and get the best deal for residents in terms of quality and price.''
 Commission officials say that the agency has previously prohibited exclusive contracts in other telecommunications areas, and that the courts have upheld such restrictions. 
 The commission has, for instance, prohibited exclusive contracts for telecommunications services in commercial buildings. It has also required telephone companies that provide service to apartments to offer access to their wires to rival companies.

HEADLINE: Hulu Readies Its Online TV, Dodging the Insults

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
The knives are out for Hulu.com.
 Hulu is the new-media creation of two old-media rivals, NBC, which is owned by General Electric, and Fox, owned by the News Corporation. Since March, when the broadcasters announced their joint effort to bring free, ad-supported television shows to the Web, critics have pounced, predicting the venture would be doomed by diverging agendas, technical challenges and an all-powerful enemy: YouTube. 
 Skeptical bloggers even slapped Hulu with a derisive moniker: ''Clown Co.''
 Now the defense is ready to present its case. 
 Today, Hulu, now an independent company with more than a hundred employees and its own offices in Los Angeles, will begin privately testing its new service with select users at Hulu.com. It will also begin sending its videos to the sites of five distribution partners, Microsoft, AOL, MySpace, Yahoo and Comcast.
 Hulu is presenting select episodes of some 90 television shows, including new and old programs from NBC (''The Office,'' ''The A-Team''), Fox (''24'' and ''The Simpsons'') and an assortment of smaller broadcasters like USA Networks. It has also added two new partners, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which distributes programs like ''Chapelle's Show'' and ''Reno 911,'' and Sony Pictures Television, which will make selections in its archives like ''I Dream of Jeannie,'' available on Hulu.com. 
 All the shows are viewable inside a Web browser and festooned with advertisements.
 ''You will not find this lineup from top to bottom anywhere else,'' said Jason Kilar, 36, chief executive of Hulu and a nine-year veteran of Amazon.com. 
 Mr. Kilar says that although some of the same shows are also available free to viewers on sites like NBC.com and Fox.com, Hulu has a unique agenda: to marry the largest collection of professionally-produced video to the widest audience possible. ''We don't have to worry about showing TV schedules or letting fans get to know the actors,'' he said. ''All we have to worry about is the video.''
 Rival ABC, owned by the Walt Disney Company, is focusing on bringing high-quality versions of its programs to its own site, ABC.com. CBS has developed its own relationships with video sites like AOL.com and a new independent online video service, Joost.
 Hulu, demonstrated last week to reporters, might surprise some of its critics. In addition to television shows, the company is experimenting with free movies. The service will begin with 10 films, including ''Master and Commander'' and ''Sideways,'' though each will run with commercial breaks. 
 Hulu's long-awaited introduction and new content deals are giving the executives involved in the effort a chance to respond to the criticism. 
 ''I think there's a snarky desire to say this is big dumb media and this is a big dumb joint venture,'' said Peter Chernin, president of the News Corporation. He said he first conceived of Hulu when thinking of ways to get Fox shows distributed as widely as possible. ''If there is a product that's attractive to consumers, we'll be just fine,'' he said.
 Hulu might prove most attractive to advertisers, since the videos on Hulu are chock-full of promotional opportunities. Messages for companies like Cisco and General Motors remain above the video player during each program. Hulu is also using overlays, promotional graphics that roam over the bottom of the screen during a show. (YouTube is also experimenting with this ad format). Hulu is, however, cutting by half the length of traditional commercial breaks during its videos.
 For each show streamed online, Hulu splits the revenue with the content creator and the distribution site, like MySpaceTV or MSN. The revenue splits vary by the type of program, but the content owner takes a majority, according to Mr. Kilar.
 Hulu will offer some features not available on other online video sites. One innovation lets users share television shows and video clips with friends. An easy editing tool lets users isolate a select clip of any length from a program and e-mail that clip to a friend or post it on a blog. ''This is a big deal,'' Mr. Kilar said. ''It is a great way to let users express themselves through our content.''
 Mr. Kilar promises that Hulu will continually add new shows from its two primary backers. ''Fox and NBC are doing everything possible to clear the rights and get us material,'' he said.
 Critics have questioned whether NBC and Fox are truly motivated to make Hulu succeed. Both networks make many of the same programs freely available on their own Web sites. 
 In addition, Fox sells ad-free, downloadable versions of its programs on Apple's iTunes. NBC pulled its material off iTunes earlier this fall, citing Apple's reluctance to let content creators set their own price and now sells shows on Amazon.com's Unbox service.
 NBC recently removed its content from YouTube to make way for the Hulu introduction. Hulu ''is really the centerpiece of what we're trying to evolve to digitally,'' said Jeff Zucker, president and chief executive of NBC Universal.
 Hulu must still overcome some significant obstacles. If it wants to become the true destination site for professionally made TV shows and movies, it must attract other major content providers like Viacom and Disney. Those media companies reportedly rejected previous offers to participate in the service.
 The executives involved in Hulu say they will again approach those companies and others when the service is offered more widely, and give them better revenue-sharing terms than they can find anywhere else. But big companies like Viacom will likely be reluctant to embrace an effort jointly owned by two of their largest competitors.
 ''These are all friends of mine,'' Mr. Chernin of the News Corporation said. ''They all have their own strategies. They have every right to sit back and see how this works and if it is in their best interests. I'm optimistic that others will join us, but even if nothing else changes, I already think this has more premium video than anywhere else.''
 Another challenge: Hulu's operating costs could quickly escalate. Hulu wants to offer the rich video that people are used to seeing on television. It will have to spend far more than other video sites to store the video on servers and then transmit the files to users, and at the same time give away much of the advertising revenue to its partners.
 YouTube, by contrast, does not pay anything for its content (users freely submit it). It gets to keep all its ad revenue and does not provide video in a high-quality format. Still, because of the high operating costs of running a video-sharing service, YouTube is not thought to be very profitable for Google.
 ''To me the biggest challenge is economics,'' said James L. McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research who was briefed on Hulu last week. ''The content is good, and they are distributing it in all the right places. But over time they will have pressure to increase the quality of the streams and that is going to raise costs even more.''
 Mr. Zucker does not appear to be concerned about the long-term financial viability of Hulu. That might actually provide more fodder for those critics who say Hulu has so many diverging mandates that it will be difficult for it to create an enduring, stand-alone business.
 ''At a minimum it's another way for us to offer our content to users and get paid for it,'' Mr. Zucker said. ''If the site itself does well, that will be gravy on top of it.''

HEADLINE: Murdoch, A Folk Hero In Silicon

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
At the Web 2.0 Summit a few weeks ago, MySpace held an after-party at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. With a guest list of Silicon Valley luminaries and a party room redone in white -- carpet, chairs, table and yes, mostly people -- it was a very post-modern indication that MySpace, the social network owned by the News Corporation, was ready to engage with its brethren to the north by opening an office here. 
 Half an hour into the party, there was a ripple of excitement, and people started murmuring and pointing toward the door. When the crowd parted, I expected to see Mark Zuckerberg, the young overlord of Facebook, or Steve Ballmer, the battle-hardened Microsoft veteran. Then again, this is a MySpace party, so maybe Britney Spears or Lindsay Lohan? Instead, it was Rupert Murdoch -- old school, old media, and at 76, just plain old. 
 From the reaction of the crowd, it might as well have been Lindsay Lohan. He was overwhelmed by an immediate onrush of hospitality as the geekerati lined up to get a word with him. 
 Back East, the elites generally regard Mr. Murdoch, most especially with his purchase of The Wall Street Journal, as if a particularly unpleasant coup was under way. He is treated much the way he is in London (where he has owned The Times for more than 20 years), as an immigrant, a man of suspect values and provenance, even though he runs a $70 billion diversified media company.
 In the United States, Mr. Murdoch's appeal is thought to work in the heartland, where Fox News takes aim. But on the left coast, Mr. Murdoch is truly among friends. The attendees at the Web 2.0 conference know him as the ultimate market timer, the guy who swooped in out of nowhere and bought MySpace for $580 million two years ago, before its audience doubled and before social networks became the platform of the future. And this was before Facebook got a valuation of $15 billion via an investment from Microsoft on Wednesday. 
 ''This is not just another rich guy -- there are a lot of those around here,'' said John Battelle, one of the summit's hosts. ''He built News Corp. from not much, with his own two hands, and this is a room full of entrepreneurs. The other thing this room respects is intelligence, and they can tell he is smart, really smart, not just from what he says, but what he has done with MySpace.''
 The same characteristics that make Mr. Murdoch a nonmember of the club in the East -- a lack of correctness and, occasionally, business civility -- make him something of a folk hero in the context of the new economy, which is peopled by insurgents who see him as a fellow pirate, even though he already captains a giant ship. 
 In a joint interview on the stage of the summit with Chris DeWolfe, a MySpace founder, earlier that night, Mr. Murdoch brandished both humility and hubris. He said that the folks at News Corporation were ''trainees'' when it came to new media but added elsewhere that CNBC was ''half dead,'' that MySpace was probably worth 30 times what he had paid for it, and he all but licked his lips when he responded to a question about whether he would like to use The Wall Street Journal to ''kill'' The New York Times. 
 ''That would be nice,'' he said. 
 At a conference where most chief executives proceeded with euphemistic elegance -- Mr. Ballmer stonewalled questions about negotiating for a piece of Facebook even as the deal was being consummated and gave a long answer to a question about Google without mentioning its name -- Mr. Murdoch answered almost every question put to him, often naming names and frankly laying out his ambitions. He was a hit in the room and the belle of the ball afterward.
 And in a move that plays like raw meat in this lion's cage of developers, Mr. DeWolfe and Mr. Murdoch said MySpace would open the platform to applications or so-called widgets from outside programmers, a decision Facebook made in the spring.
 ''He is candid and he is aggressive,'' said Jason Calacanis, who sold his start-up, Weblogs, to AOL for a reported $25 million two years ago. ''He said during the discussion that he basically wanted to crush The New York Times and crush CNBC. When do you hear somebody in that kind of position being so candid?''
 It's not just Mr. Murdoch's aggression the audience responds to. In a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors in 2005, Mr. Murdoch suggested that newspapers were ''immigrants'' to the digital space who needed to learn from ''natives.'' 
 He seems to have gotten the hang of things pretty quickly, telling the Web 2.0 crowd, ''No one delivers huge audiences anymore.'' One of the conference's themes was that advertisers, who will finance things as diverse as cellphones and desktop applications, are no longer after just eyeballs, but consumer behavior, too. 
 For a so-called old media company, News Corporation has done significant work to move from taking orders for mass inventory to offering focused buys with specific audience characteristics. Mr. Murdoch recently bragged at a conference about being able to deliver, say, all the optometrists in the London area -- which is very Web 2.0, as they say.
 I waited my turn in the queue at the party, and Mr. DeWolfe, who had just signed a deal for two more years with News Corporation, made an introduction. Amid the throbbing house music, Mr. Murdoch and I chatted briefly about his purchase of The Wall Street Journal, which will be completed in December. 
 Perhaps in an effort to keep cognitive dissonance at bay, the journalists I know at The Journal have changed posture from doomsaying to a growing curiosity about what it will be like to work for someone who actually wants to invest in newspapers. I mentioned as much to Mr. Murdoch. ''That is the sense I am getting,'' he said.
 I also joked that he might have to cut a lot of checks to compete with my employer for national and international news, adding that this has been a tough business of late. But he insisted there was ''plenty of room for growth'' in the newspapers. 
 ''We can't wait to get started,'' he said. 
 Others can't wait either. ''Who isn't interested in seeing some other newspaper people who want to fight and do bold things?'' Mr. Calacanis observed. ''Murdoch is someone who is actually investing in newspapers. Even you have to be rooting for that.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Lobbyist's Messages Draw Scrutiny From City

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The city is investigating whether its former chief lobbyist in Albany violated lobbying rules when he exchanged e-mail messages with senior City Hall advisers shortly after leaving the city payroll in November, the authorities said yesterday. 
 City employees are prohibited from lobbying the city within a year after they leave its employ. The law is intended to limit the ability of former officials to exploit their contacts and experience in city government on behalf of paying clients.
 The lobbyist, Anthony P. Piscitelli, through e-mail messages, contacted Kevin Sheekey, the deputy mayor for government affairs; Jeffrey Kay, the mayor's director of operations; and a senior aide to Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, in a series of exchanges that began less than a week after leaving City Hall, The Daily News reported yesterday. The newspaper reported that it obtained at least 127 e-mail messages under the Freedom of Information Act. 
 Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said that the city's Conflicts of Interest Board and Department of Investigation had been notified of the matter.
 Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for Mr. Piscitelli, said yesterday, ''We don't believe in any way, shape or form that any violation of the letter or the spirit of the law has taken place.''
 Mr. Piscitelli, a lawyer, was named the city's top Albany lobbyist in 1998 by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and retained the position until July 2006. He then served briefly as an aide to Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta and resigned on Nov. 30 to join Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker, a law firm engaged in extensive lobbying.
 Mr. Piscitelli's e-mail messages to City Hall began less than a week after he resigned from his city job. In some of them Mr. Piscitelli made requests on behalf of his law firm's clients, including a bankers association, a technical college and an investment group hoping to gain control of the Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga thoroughbred racetracks.
 In one instance, Mr. Piscitelli contacted Mr. Sheekey shortly before Mr. Bloomberg was to speak before a State Assembly committee on a proposal to close state tax loopholes. The change ''would be particularly harmful to the banking industry (in case he gets a question),'' Mr. Piscitelli wrote.
 In an e-mail message to Mr. Kay, Mr. Piscitelli sought a City Hall meeting with representatives of another of his firm's clients, the Rochester Institute of Technology, as Mayor Bloomberg was preparing his announcement in December of a huge 25-year investment in environmental sustainability. Mr. Piscitelli forwarded the e-mail message, written by another member of his firm, which said the institute was planning a ''sustainability institute.''
 ''Jeff -- Who should they meet with?'' Mr. Piscitelli wrote at the time. Mr. Kay's response said, ''You could send them my way,'' but Mr. Loeser said yesterday that neither Mr. Kay or anyone on his staff had met with anyone from the institute.
 Mr. Loeser said yesterday that ''Mr. Piscitelli's requests were fruitless, except for requests for the same public information anyone is entitled to.'' He said the matter was being investigated by the city ''not because our staff did anything wrong, but because of the possibility that Mr. Piscitelli did.''
 Mr. Loeser said no city officials who communicated with Mr. Piscitelli had gone too far, even in creating the appearance of a conflict of interest. ''Members of our staff appear to have engaged in social banter and distribution of public information, both of which are entirely permitted,'' he said. 
 Gene Russianoff, senior lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, which has advocated even more stringent restrictions on lobbying by former city employees, said the current law ''is clear that you can't communicate on behalf of a paying client for one year.''
 Mr. Piscitelli, who is known as Skip, gained a reputation as an affable, low-key and effective lobbyist for the city in Albany. He has deep roots in the field, having worked as a legislative lobbyist for the city from 1990 through 1994. His father, Peter A. Piscitelli, was the city's chief lobbyist under Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1978 and 1979.

HEADLINE: What Kind Of Caution By the Fed This Time?

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
When policy makers at the Federal Reserve set interest rates on Wednesday, they will be paying less attention to what is happening to the economy than to what could happen. 
 Except for deepening problems in the housing market, much of the American economy shows surprising strength and little need for a boost from cheaper loans.
 The Commerce Department is expected to report Wednesday that the economy grew by at least 3 percent in the most recent quarter ended in September. That would meet what economists consider the nation's natural growth rate. Consumers have kept spending, companies have kept hiring and exports are climbing at double-digit rates. 
 All of that has happened even though financial markets have been volatile since early in August, when troubles arose in the mortgage market.
 But investors now seem convinced that the Federal Reserve, after two days of meetings that start Tuesday, will lower the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.5 percent, and Fed officials have done nothing in recent speeches to tamp down those expectations.
 Rather, Fed officials have stressed their inclination to act pre-emptively against the possibility of a serious downturn. Instead of pointing to actual weakness in the broad economy, they have focused on worries that the deepening fall in housing prices and the fears running through the credit markets pose dangers that ought to be addressed.
 A blunt analysis came from Frederic Mishkin, a Fed governor, speaking at the Fed's symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Sept. 1. In a dense and detailed analysis of how housing troubles could affect the rest of the economy, Mr. Mishkin estimated that a hypothetical 20 percent drop in housing prices by the end of 2008 could cause total economic output to shrink by as much as 1.5 percent within three years.
 Based on that analysis, Mr. Mishkin seemed to argue that the central bank should react to that kind of downturn in housing prices by lowering rates more rapidly than traditional Fed models might suggest.
 ''Monetary authorities have the tools to limit the negative effects on the economy from a house-price decline,'' Mr. Mishkin told the conference.
 It is unusual for Fed officials to make a direct link between monetary policy and asset prices -- whether for real estate, stocks or commodities like oil, gold and silver. For policy makers, the core issues are consumer price inflation and economic growth.
 But the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said that declining house prices could interact with problems like the turmoil in the credit markets to derail other parts of the economy.
 In a speech Oct. 19 on ''monetary policy under uncertainty,'' Mr. Bernanke argued for acting sooner rather than later when risks become apparent.
 ''Intuition suggests that stronger action by the central bank may be warranted to prevent particularly costly outcomes,'' he told listeners at a conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. 
 Mr. Bernanke went on to argue that central banks should sometimes depart from a cautionary principle, first enunciated by the economist William C. Brainard, that central banks have embraced for years.
 Mr. Brainard said that a central bank, when confronted with heightened risks in the economy, should react with small steps first and base future measures on the results that follow. If a feared downturn failed to occur, for example, a small reduction in interest rates would be less likely to stoke future inflation.
 But Mr. Bernanke maintained that economists had made ''substantial progress'' over the last decade in analyzing real-time economic data. A wide body of research, he said, suggested that the Brainard principle of caution ''may not always hold.''
 That view has been echoed by other officials. Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said declining house prices could lead to a slowdown in consumer spending, more mortgage delinquencies, more trouble in financial markets and ''serious downside risks'' to the overall economy.
 ''I want to emphasize that I do not see this extreme outcome as likely,'' Mr. Evans said in a speech last week at the University of Chicago. ''But it is one of those high-cost outcomes that we should guard against.''
 That would be in line with the approach promoted by Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke's predecessor. But analysts say this mind-set has a tough corollary that Fed officials have not followed as carefully: if the trouble fails to materialize, the central bank has to take back its generosity and raise interest rates as assertively as it cut them.
 Most economists say Mr. Greenspan was correct to reduce interest rates as the economy slid into recession in 2001. But a growing number of experts, including Mr. Evans of the Chicago Fed, contend that the Fed waited too long before it started to raise rates again in June 2004.
 Many Fed officials also see a cautionary tale in how the Fed responded to fears in 1998 caused by Russia's financial breakdown and the collapse of Long Term Capital Management, a major hedge fund company.
 Much as today, credit markets began to freeze up in fear. The Fed initially held back from any direct action, and then cut rates less than many in the financial markets hoped. Then it surprised investors with a big rate cut at an unscheduled meeting. 
 As it happened, the credit panic calmed down, and the American economic boom continued. But it was not until June 1999 that the Fed began to take back its rate cut, a delay that provoked some fear of inflation.
 ''The first lesson was that if you're going to be a firefighter, be sure you bring enough water,'' said Vincent R. Reinhart, a former adviser to Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke and now a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. As for the second lesson, he said, ''As any insurance adjuster will tell you, there can be more damage from the water than from the fire itself.''

HEADLINE: Bangladeshis in Queens Say Their Trust in a Countryman Cost Them

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
The promises and politeness were too much for Khurshid Anwar to resist.
 He was told that an investment of tens of thousands of dollars could be spun into millions. That despite his poor credit history and low income, home ownership was a realistic possibility. 
 Mr. Anwar, 51, might have been a bit naive, but he says he had no reason to mistrust the man who was courting him, Jacob Milton. After all, Mr. Milton, 41, was a fellow immigrant from Bangladesh, who called Mr. Anwar a big brother, visited his home, and gave him food and even a job.
 Mr. Anwar says he did not know that Mr. Milton had approached many of his countrymen with the same friendly flair, and that many would eventually have the same complaint: that they had been defrauded. 
 ''He plays with everybody,'' Mr. Anwar said during an interview at the home in Woodside, Queens, that he bought through Mr. Milton. 
 Mr. Milton was arraigned in State Supreme Court in Queens on Oct. 16 on several counts, including identity theft, scheming to defraud and grand larceny involving at least four people. Prosecutors also charged Nira Niru, another Bangladeshi immigrant, with helping Mr. Milton in his activities, at a mortgage office Mr. Milton managed in Jackson Heights.
 Mr. Milton's lawyer, Sally Butler, said yesterday that the entire story had not yet been told, but she declined to comment further. Mr. Milton, who is still in police custody, is scheduled to appear in court today for a status conference. 
 Since the initial complaint against Mr. Milton and Ms. Niru, about 30 people, most of them Bangladeshi, have come forward to accuse Mr. Milton of defrauding them, according to Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. 
 Prosecutors say that they are not surprised and that the case underscores an all-too-common trend, of immigrants who prey on their own. 
 ''I think it is indeed prevalent,'' Mr. Brown said. ''I think it's a case of the victims trusting individuals who share the same backgrounds and the same ethnicity as they do. These are people that they feel comfortable with.'' Though Mr. Anwar is not part of the initial complaint against Mr. Milton, he has gone to the police and he has a suit pending against Mr. Milton, accusing him of failing to repay $65,000 he had given him to invest in real estate. 
 The latest prosecution follows two other cases in which people from Bangladesh have been accused by prosecutors in Queens of stealing from their countrymen, for whom Jackson Heights, with its many Bangladeshi stores and restaurants, is a cultural center.
 In March, the Queens district attorney's office charged a woman with defrauding three Bangladeshi real estate investors of more than $600,000 in cash and property. In April, 10 Bangladeshis operating a mortgage company with offices in Forest Hills and Jackson Heights were charged with participating in a plan to defraud several lenders. 
 Mr. Brown said it was important to emphasize that the issue was not unique to the Bangladeshi community, a point echoed by community leaders. 
 ''Every country has good people and bad people,'' said Dilafroz Ahmed, the president of a group called the Bangladesh Society. ''The bad portion is very nominal.'' 
 There were more than 24,000 Bangladeshis living in New York City last year, with most of them, nearly 13,500, living in Queens, according to the Census Bureau. 
 Mr. Milton, a resident of Port Washington in Nassau County, was fairly well known in the Bangladeshi community, in part because he was the host of a Bangladeshi talk show on local-access cable television. 
 According to court papers, he had two aliases, Sabbirul Haque Talukder and Mohammed Saber, under which he owned multiple homes. Ms. Niru also had multiple aliases, the authorities say. 
 Mr. Anwar met Mr. Milton more than three years ago through a friend he often visited in the building where Mr. Milton worked. Mr. Anwar said that Mr. Milton quickly befriended him, visiting his home and sometimes bringing him food. He said Mr. Milton told him he resembled his older brother, so they referred to each other as brothers.
 ''He came to my house and he's talking like a family member,'' Mr. Anwar said. ''He said, 'I'm your family. Don't worry. I make you profit. I give you money.'''
 In August 2004, Mr. Anwar said, he wrote an initial check for $10,000 to Mr. Milton to invest for him in real estate. Mr. Anwar, who owned a South Asian video store in Jackson Heights that was about to go out of business, said he had been promised lucrative returns. 
 At the same time, Mr. Anwar said, Mr. Milton talked him into buying a house. He said Mr. Milton told him that for a fee of $25,000 he could take care of Mr. Anwar's credit issues and get him a house with no down payment. Mr. Anwar said that in addition to that fee, Mr. Milton asked for $40,000 in closing costs, and Mr. Anwar bought the two-family home for $600,000 in November 2004.
 A few months later, Mr. Anwar said, Mr. Milton offered him a job at a new mortgage office Mr. Milton was opening in Jackson Heights. Mr. Anwar said that Mr. Milton paid him very little and that he never saw any of the money he was promised for his real estate investments. So he quit the job after three months and stopped dealing with Mr. Milton. 
 Mr. Anwar is currently unemployed. His wife works at a Duane Reade drugstore and his 19-year-old son delivers pizza, but the family income is not enough to keep up mortgage payments on the house, which they are now trying to sell. They get by on credit cards and loans from family members, he said.
 ''The bad thing is we trust too much,'' said Nasima Khatun, Mr. Anwar's wife, referring to Bangladeshi people.
 Mr. Anwar, who said he had been a journalist in Bangladesh and fled to the United States in 1998 after his editor was murdered, said he was especially quick to trust Mr. Milton because they were from the same country. ''I am sad,'' Mr. Anwar said, ''because I lost everything. I lost my house. I lost my money.''
 Several other Bangladeshis who have dealt with Mr. Milton described similar solicitations. They said that he would lure them with dreams of becoming millionaires, treat them to food and call them family members. Most of them, like Mr. Anwar, were on unstable financial footing when they met him.
 But one of them, Mohammed Zaman of Woodside, proved to be a tough sell. He said that after he had been working for Mr. Milton for about two months, Mr. Milton told him that instead of paying him he wanted to buy several houses in his name, sell them and share the profits. At that point, Mr. Zaman said, he quit. 
 ''I don't trust him from the beginning,'' said Mr. Zaman. 45. ''That's why I don't make any deal.''

HEADLINE: Action on Development In Brooklyn and Queens

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL; Michele Bolton contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The City Council approved rezoning 206 blocks of Bedford-Stuyvesant yesterday, moving to protect the historic charm that has attracted a flood of new residents to the area and to spur economic development and the construction of low-cost housing along major thoroughfares. 
 The Brooklyn rezoning came as the Council also approved creating the largest historic district in Queens by giving landmark status to Sunnyside Gardens, a 1920s housing development considered a model for innovative urban design. The four-year battle over landmark status for the community has created angry divisions among neighbors. 
 Lawmakers also introduced a bill yesterday that would require large stores to design on-site recycling programs for customers to return carryout plastic bags.
 The Brooklyn rezoning covers the southern portion of Bedford-Stuyvesant, roughly bounded by Quincy Street and Saratoga, Atlantic and Classon Avenues. It is in keeping with the Bloomberg administration's approach to combining an increase in density along major corridors with a cap on size along many side streets.
 ''It includes everything,'' said Melinda Katz of Queens, chairwoman of the Council's Land Use Committee, adding that it reflected an effort to increase density while creating housing where appropriate, but also keeps the ''rest of the neighborhood low in density where it is appropriate to make sure that New York City remains a place where small communities can also thrive.''
 The rezoning grew out of a plan generated by residents concerned about new construction that was out of character and scale with its surroundings, and about the ability to remain in a neighborhood that had become increasingly desirable. 
 Over all, the new zoning caps the scale roughly as it is, preserving many streets lined with Victorian brownstones for three- and four-story row houses. Larger residential development, about eight stories, would be permitted along major thoroughfares like Nostrand and Bedford Avenues, with even taller buildings, up to about 10 stories if developers include a portion of subsidized apartments, along sections of Fulton Street and Atlantic Avenue. 
 In addition, the plan creates a mixed-use district at the southeast edge of the area, near Kane Place and Howard Avenue, adding residential use to a light manufacturing zone. The plan also adds a new district near the southwestern edge of the area that would allow residential, commercial and community uses.
 Albert Vann, a councilman who represents the area, said the City Planning Commission had promised to move forward next with rezoning the northern portion of the neighborhood, for which the community has reached consensus on a plan.
 On a more contentious matter in Queens, the Council approved a proposal for landmark status that had been simmering for four years among residents in Sunnyside Gardens, a leafy enclave of tidy houses and courtyards. Landmark proponents had urged the city to protect the embodiment of a 1920s vision of shared open spaces and consistent design encouraging socializing. Opponents, however, warned that landmark status, meaning that residents would need approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission to change the facades of their homes, would squeeze out poor people and mandate costly repairs.
 Also yesterday, the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, and Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr. of Queens introduced a bill that would require stores larger than 5,000 square feet to provide bins for customers to return plastic carryout bags for recycling. Under the proposal, stores would have to sell reusable shopping bags and could stock only plastic bags emblazoned with the message, ''Please return this bag to a participating store for recycling'' in letters at least three inches tall. 
 Intended to reduce the amount of plastic entering the city's waste stream, the bill would also require the more than 700 stores that would be affected to submit annual reports to the Department of Sanitation on the volume of plastic bags they collect and transport for recycling. 
 Stores would be liable for fines ranging from $500 to $1,000 for not complying with the record-keeping and reporting requirements, and $2,000 for each day that an acceptable program is not up and running. Bag manufacturers, who would be required to develop educational materials urging reductions, reuse and recycling of their products and to help arrange the recycling, would also face fines of $2,000 for each day they fail to comply. Under the plan, there would be no penalty for consumers. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference in Boston that he would need to study the bill before deciding whether to support it.

HEADLINE: In India, Poverty Inspires Technology Workers to Altruism

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India 

 BODY:
Manohar Lakshmipathi does not own a computer. In fact, in India workmen like Mr. Manohar, a house painter, are usually forbidden to touch clients' computers. 
 So you can imagine Mr. Manohar's wonder as he sat in a swiveling chair in front of a computer, dictating his date of birth, phone number and work history to a secretary. Afterward, a man took his photo. Then, with a click of a mouse, Mr. Manohar's page popped onto the World Wide Web, the newest profile on an Indian Web site called Babajob.com.
 Babajob seeks to bring the social-networking revolution popularized by Facebook and MySpace to people who do not even have computers -- the world's poor. And the start-up is just one example of an unanticipated byproduct of the outsourcing boom: many of the hundreds of multinationals and hundreds of thousands of technology workers who are working here are turning their talents to fighting the grinding poverty that surrounds them. 
 ''In Redmond, you don't see 7-year-olds begging on the street,'' said Sean Blagsvedt, Babajob's founder, referring to Microsoft's headquarters in Washington State, where he once worked. ''In India, you can't escape the feeling that you're really lucky. So you ask, What are you going to do about all the stuff around you? How are you going to use all these skills?''
 Perhaps for less altruistic reasons, but often with positive results for the poor, corporations have made India a laboratory for extending modern technological conveniences to those long deprived. Nokia, for instance, develops many of its ultralow-cost cellphones here. Citibank first experimented here with a special A.T.M. that recognizes thumbprints -- to help slum dwellers who struggle with PINs. And Microsoft has made India one of the major centers of its global research group studying technologies for the poor, like software that reads to illiterate computer users. Babajob is a quintessential example of how the back-office operations in India have spawned poverty-inspired innovation. 
 The best-known networking sites in the industry connect computer-savvy elites to one another. Babajob, by contrast, connects India's elites to the poor at their doorsteps, people who need jobs but lack the connections to find them. Job seekers advertise skills, employers advertise jobs and matches are made through social networks. 
 For example, if Rajeev and Sanjay are friends, and Sanjay needs a chauffeur, he can view Rajeev's page, travel to the page of Rajeev's chauffeur and see which of the chauffeur's friends are looking for similar work.
 Mr. Blagsvedt, now 31, joined Microsoft in Redmond in 1999. Three years ago he was sent to India to help build the local office of Microsoft Research, the company's in-house policy research arm. The new team worked on many of the same complex problems as their peers in Redmond, but the employees here led very different lives outside the office than their counterparts in Redmond. They had servants and laborers. They read constant newspaper tales of undernourishment and illiteracy. 
 The company's Indian employees were not seeing poverty for the first time, but they were now equipped with first-rate computing skills, and many felt newly empowered to help their society. 
 At the same time, Microsoft was plagued by widespread software piracy, which limited its revenue in India. Among other things, the company looked at low-income consumers as a vast and unexploited commercial opportunity, so it encouraged its engineers' philanthropic urges.
 Poverty became a major focus in Mr. Blagsvedt's research office. Anthropologists and sociologists were hired to explain things like the effect of the caste system on rural computer usage. In the course of that work, Mr. Blagsvedt stumbled upon an insight by a Duke University economist, Anirudh Krishna. 
 Mr. Krishna found that many poor Indians in dead-end jobs remain in poverty not because there are no better jobs, but because they lack the connections to find them. Any Bangalorean could confirm the observation: the city teems with laborers desperate for work, and yet wealthy software tycoons complain endlessly about a shortage of maids and cooks.
 Mr. Blagsvedt's epiphany? ''We need village LinkedIn!'' he recalled saying, alluding to the professional networking site. 
 He quit Microsoft and, with his stepfather, Ira Weise, and a former Microsoft colleague built a social-networking site to connect Bangalore's yuppies with its laborers. (The site, which Mr. Blagsvedt started this summer and runs out of his home, focuses on Bangalore now, but he plans to spread it to other Indian cities and maybe globally.) 
 Building a site meant to reach laborers earning $2 to $3 a day presented special challenges. The workers would be unfamiliar with computers. The wealthy potential employers would be reluctant to let random applicants tend their gardens or their newborns. To deal with the connectivity problem, Babajob pays anyone, from charities to Internet cafe owners, who finds job seekers and registers them online. (Babajob earns its keep from employers' advertisements, diverting a portion of that to those who register job seekers.) And instead of creating an anonymous job bazaar, Babajob replicates online the process by which Indians hire in real life: through chains of personal connections.
 In India, a businessman looking for a chauffeur might ask his friend, who might ask his chauffeur. Such connections provide a kind of quality control. The friend's chauffeur, for instance, will not recommend a hoodlum, for fear of losing his own job. 
 To re-create this dynamic online, Babajob pays people to be ''connectors'' between employer and employee. In the example above, the businessman's friend and his chauffeur would each earn the equivalent of $2.50 if they connected the businessman with someone he liked.
 The model is gaining attention, and praise. A Bangalore venture capitalist, when told of Babajob, immediately asked to be put in touch with Mr. Blagsvedt. And Steve Pogorzelski, president of the international division of Monster.com, the American jobs site, said, ''Wow'' when told of the company. ''It is an important innovation because it opens up the marketplace to people of socioeconomic levels who may not have the widest array of jobs available to them.''
 Mr. Krishna, the Duke economist, called it a ''very significant innovation,'' but he cautioned that the very poor might not belong to the social networks that would bring them to Babajob, even on the periphery. 
 In its first few months, the company has drummed up job seekers on its own, sending workers into the streets with fliers promising employment. 
 To find potential employers, in addition to counting on word of mouth among those desperate for maids and laborers, Babajob is also relying on Babalife, the company's parallel social networking site for the yuppie elite. People listed on Babalife will automatically be on Babajob, too. 
 So far, more than 2,000 job seekers have registered. The listings are a portrait of India's floating underclass, millions and millions seeking a few dollars a day to work as chauffeurs, nannies, gardeners, guards and receptionists.
 A woman named Selvi Venkatesh was a typical job seeker. ''I am really in need of a job as our residential building collapsed last month in Ejipura,'' she said, referring to a building collapse that killed two people, including an infant, in late July, according to The Times of India.
 In Mr. Blagsvedt's apartment one morning, Mr. Manohar, the painter, professed hope.
 He earns $100 a month. Jobs come irregularly, so he often spends up to three months of the year idle. Between jobs, he borrows from loan sharks to feed his wife and children. The usurers levy 10 percent monthly interest, enough to make a $100 loan a $314 debt in one year.
 Mr. Manohar does not want his children to know his worries, or his life. He wants them to work in a nice office, so he spends nearly half his income on private schools for them. That is why he was at Babajob in a swiveling chair, staring at a computer and dreaming of more work.

 BODY:
SMOOTHER SEPTEMBER SKIES It isn't just your imagination. Air travel really has become smoother in the lull after the summer and before the start of holiday travel season at Thanksgiving. In September, according to Flightstats.com, domestic flights on major airlines arrived on time 81 percent of the time, compared with 72 percent in August and 76 percent last September. Flight cancellations also declined, to 9,884 from 16,108 in August and 10,448 in September 2006. 
 TRAVEL GROWTH About $778 billion will be spent on leisure and business travel in the United States next year, despite a continuing decline in the number of visitors from overseas, says the Travel Industry Association. That would be an increase in spending of about 5 percent over projected levels for this year. The persistent decline in overseas visitors is attributed to increasing inconveniences and disruptions at United States customs and immigration entry points. 
 NORTHWEST ADDS PARIS ROUTE Continuing its expansion on trans-Atlantic routes, Northwest Airlines is adding daily nonstop service between Minneapolis-St. Paul and Paris on April 8, in a partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The service will be flown using A330-300 aircraft with 34 business class and 264 coach seats, Northwest said.
 COACH PLUS BUSINESS American Airlines started service between Kennedy International Airport and London Stansted airport, calling it the only trans-Atlantic service on that route that offers ''both business- and economy-class seats.'' Eos and MaxJet, of course, started flying all business-class service on the Kennedy-Stansted route in late 2005. American has said it will add a second daily flight on the route -- Stansted is closer to London's financial district than Heathrow -- in April. 
 ET CETERA The start-up airline Virgin America began twice daily service last week between Los Angeles International and Washington Dulles with introductory round-trip coach fares of $278 plus taxes and round-trip first-class fares of $898 plus taxes ... Last week, Embraer, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer, delivered its 300th E-Jet, an E-175. E-Jets are 76-seat aircraft in a niche between 50-seat regional jets and the smaller standard airliners like 737s. 
 JOE SHARKEY 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 3, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A brief report in the Memo Pad column in Business Day on Tuesday, about American Airlines' new service between Kennedy International Airport and Stansted Airport near London, misstated Stansted's proximity to London's financial district in comparison to Heathrow Airport. It is farther away; it is not closer. (A direct express train from Stansted to the Liverpool Street Station in the financial district makes the trip shorter from that airport.)

HEADLINE: Sugar's Sweetheart Deal

 BODY:
Of all the government's farm-support programs, there are few as egregious as the tangle of loans, quotas and import tariffs set up to protect the well-connected club of American sugar producers at the expense of American consumers and farmers in the developing world. This year's farm bill will add American taxpayers to the list of casualties. 
 Under the current system, the government guarantees a price floor for sugar and limits the sugar supply -- placing quotas on domestic production and quotas and tariffs to limit imports. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, sugar supports cost American consumers -- who pay double the average world price -- more than $1.5 billion a year. The system also bars farmers in some of the poorest countries of the world from selling their sugar here. 
 The North American Free Trade Agreement is about to topple this cozy arrangement. Next year, Mexican sugar will be allowed to enter the United States free of any quotas or duties, threatening a flood of imports. Rather than taking the opportunity to untangle the sugar program in this year's farm bill, Congress has decided to bolster the old system.
 Both the House bill, which was passed in July, and the Senate version, which could be voted on as early as this week, guarantee that the government will buy from American farmers an amount of sugar equivalent to 85 percent of domestic consumption -- regardless of how much comes in from abroad. To add insult to injury, both also increase the longstanding price guarantee for sugar.
 The bills encourage the government to operate the program at no cost to the budget, by selling the surplus sugar to the ethanol industry. That's not likely. Ethanol makers will never accept paying anywhere near sugar's guaranteed price. According to rough estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, supports for sugar in the House bill could cost taxpayers from $750 million to $850 million over the next five years. 
 Big Sugar is not the only beneficiary of this corporate welfare. The farm bill is larded with subsidies and other rewards for agricultural producers. The eagerness of members of Congress to please their sugar daddies is not surprising. Campaign donations from the sugar industry have topped $3 million in each of the last four political cycles. American consumers and taxpayers, as well as poor farmers overseas, shouldn't have to pay the price. 
 President Bush has been on the right side of the debate over farm subsidies. Big Sugar's sweet deal gave him another good reason to veto the farm bill if it doesn't cut back on all the goodies.

HEADLINE: Bias Is Seen As Landlords Bar Vouchers

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
With gentrification spreading into low-income areas, many landlords in struggling neighborhoods of New York City, who once welcomed tenants with federal rent subsidy vouchers, are now turning them away, according to some housing activists and real estate agents. 
 The vouchers, known as Section 8 vouchers, long a pillar of rent support for needy families, serve about 270,000 city residents. And for decades the program has virtually guaranteed landlords a steady source of rent and a modest profit. 
 But now, apartment listings routinely exclude voucher holders, marking a significant shift in the way many landlords have come to view the program. Many property owners and real estate agents say the program is overly cumbersome, and in a hot rental market, they say, there is no need to take on a Section 8 tenant. 
 With many voucher holders in the city having difficulty finding an apartment, housing activists are debating the program's effectiveness and are raising questions about what role, if any, race and class play in some landlords' refusal to rent to voucher holders, the majority of whom are black or Hispanic. 
 Unlike many cities, including Chicago and Washington, New York City -- home of the largest Section 8 program in the country -- has never had a law prohibiting discrimination against voucher holders. 
 But with the city's supply of subsidized housing shrinking, housing activists and some City Council members say such a law is needed more now than ever. 
 Councilman Bill de Blasio, a Brooklyn Democrat and a former regional director of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, has introduced a bill to prohibit landlords from turning away applicants solely because they have vouchers or other forms of local, state or federal government assistance. 
 Landlord groups argue, however, that Mr. de Blasio's proposed law would turn a voluntary program riddled with bureaucratic problems into a mandatory one. 
 ''We just don't think it's fair to force an owner to take a Section 8 recipient,'' said Frank Ricci, director of government affairs for the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents residential building owners in the city. He said it was not unusual for some property owners who accept Section 8 vouchers to have several office aides dealing with the program's requirements and bureaucracy.
 After receiving vouchers from the federal government, Section 8 tenants pay about 30 percent of their income toward rent, and the vouchers cover the balance. Eligible households are those earning no more than 50 percent of the metropolitan area's median income, or no more than about $35,000 for a family of four in New York. The rent limits for voucher holders seeking apartments are $1,069 for a one-bedroom and $1,556 for a four-bedroom.
 The refusal to accept Section 8 tenants is so widespread now that one person, who has held a voucher since July but has yet to find an apartment, resorted to posting a desperately worded plea for help on Craigslist. 
 ''Yes, I do have a Section 8 voucher and NO that does not mean I am a lazy person,'' the notice reads in part. 
 One renter, Omayra Cruz, 35, has been looking for an apartment, with no success, since receiving a new voucher in May. 
 She has been eager to move from the dilapidated apartment where she and her two daughters live on East 178th Street in the Bronx. A chunk of the ceiling fell off, and Ms. Cruz says she believes that the large patches of black mold on the doors and walls have contributed to asthma attacks that she and her daughters have suffered.
 Ms. Cruz, who supports her family on public assistance and does not work because of health problems, said that about 30 landlords in the Bronx have turned her voucher down. 
 ''To get an apartment is so hard, but before it was so easy,'' said Ms. Cruz, whose voucher is set to expire in November. Supporters of the de Blasio bill claim that landlords often deny Section 8 applicants as a way to mask broader discrimination against single mothers and black and Hispanic tenants. Landlords, property managers and real estate agents argue that the reluctance to take the vouchers stems from the program's payment delays and other administrative problems, not the racial or economic background of applicants. 
 Housing activists and anti-discrimination experts concede that they have no concrete evidence that voucher holders are being turned away because of racial bias on a widespread basis. Cliff Mulqueen, deputy commissioner and general counsel of the city's Commission on Human Rights, said no voucher holder had complained to them of racial discrimination. ''I haven't seen it, but if it's out there I want to know about it,'' he said. 
 At an April hearing on the de Blasio bill by a Council committee, Mr. Mulqueen said the Bloomberg administration had concerns about the measure, in part that it would limit property owners' ability to make sound financial decisions and would make Section 8 mandatory. 
 But Mr. de Blasio and supporters of his bill say that much of the discrimination goes unreported, and that it is nearly impossible for anyone to know when it does occur because there is no law to protect voucher holders.
 ''We think that this is really about gentrifying neighborhoods and the fact that this is a way for landlords to do race and gender discrimination under a nice-sounding name,'' said Bertha Lewis, executive director of New York Acorn, a community organizing group. 
 In April, the group released a survey that found that of 122 available studios (with rents under $1,000) and one-bedroom apartments (with rents from $1,100 to $1,200) listed on Craigslist and in The Daily News and The New York Times, only 16 advertisers, when contacted by the Acorn researchers, were willing to accept Section 8 vouchers. 
 One real estate agent said landlords had told her that one reason they do not want to take vouchers is that the Section 8 tenants do not take care of the units as well as other residents do. 
 A building owner in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, said he had a Section 8 tenant evicted last year after neighbors called the police about fighting and noise and the tenant stopped paying rent for months. The landlord said, though, that he had also had good experiences with Section 8 tenants.
 Jose Vargas, the owner of a building in Throgs Neck, the Bronx, posted a listing on Craigslist to rent a three-bedroom apartment that said, ''No Section 8 or programs at this time.'' Mr. Vargas said it was his lack of knowledge about how the Section 8 program works that led him to decline vouchers. ''I don't know anything,'' he said. ''I'm new to the market as far as renting.''
 Although housing activists contend that the rejection of vouchers is creating a housing problem, the extent of the problem is hard to measure. 
 Hundreds of Section 8 vouchers are terminated each year because they could not be used successfully; about 1,400 have been terminated so far this year. But the New York City Housing Authority, which administers the Section 8 program, maintains that the number of landlords who do not participate is relatively small and that there are enough landlords to meet the demand. 
 As of Sept. 30, there were 29,458 participating landlords, an increase from 2001, when the number was 25,642. Critics of Mr. de Blasio's bill contend that these numbers show that the problem has been overstated, and that landlords' discretion in picking qualified tenants is being mischaracterized as discrimination.
 Officials in other jurisdictions that have anti-discrimination laws, however, say discrimination against Section 8 is indeed real and widespread. 
 Ads in New York City that say ''no Section 8'' would be illegal across the Hudson. A New Jersey law prohibits landlords from refusing prospective tenants solely because they intend to pay using a Section 8 voucher. 
 First-time offenders can be fined up to $10,000. The state's Division on Civil Rights has investigated 180 cases of source-of-income discrimination since 2002, when the amendment was added to the state's Law Against Discrimination.
 Tracey Goldstein, a lawyer who represents property owners in New Jersey, said that complying with the amendment imposed an ''onerous burden'' on the state's landlords and opened the litigation floodgates. 
 ''Many owners have been subjected to baseless discrimination claims as a result of the amendment to the law,'' she said. Whatever the prospects of an anti-discrimination law, individual voucher holders in New York City are facing increasing competition. In July, with a boost of federal financing for the program, the Housing Authority handed out the first of 22,000 new vouchers it will receive from the federal government over the next two years. 
 Because of the new vouchers, there were 10,763 voucher holders seeking apartments as of Sept. 30, the largest number in the history of the city's program, Housing Authority officials said.

HEADLINE: Oil at Another Record, Surging Above $93

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM. 
Ian Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa.

 BODY:
Oil prices hit another record yesterday, and even the experts were hard pressed to say why.
 Crude oil futures closed at $93.53 a barrel, 1.8 percent over the previous high of $91.86 on Friday. Oil is on a steady march toward toppling the inflation-adjusted high of $101.70 it set in April 1980, analysts said, though many are at a loss as to what keeps driving the price. 
 ''There's no rational reason'' for oil to top $100, said Benjamin Dell, senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''But that's never stopped something before.'' 
 Simple mechanics of supply and demand do not explain the rally, analysts said, but a few events have contributed to the increase. Investors are wary of recent flare-ups in the Middle East, including growing tension between Turkey and Iraqi Kurds. And the Mexican crude producer, Petroleos Mexicanos, announced yesterday that a storm had temporarily cut its production by about 600,000 barrels a day.
 Also, the dollar hit another low against the euro yesterday, closing at $1.4424 and making oil more attractive to foreign investors.
 But ultimately, analysts say that yesterday's rally was a result of momentum: bullishness driving a bullish market.
 ''The Mexican drop in production is largely irrelevant,'' Mr. Dell said. ''It's just another headline to support what is a very bullish moment.''
 The equities markets, meanwhile, barely raised a brow. The major stock indexes recorded modest gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.37 percent, or 5.70 points, to close at 1,540.98. The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 63.56 points, or 0.46 percent, at 13,870.26, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 13.25, to 2,817.44.
 Stocks showed a similar ambivalence to rising crude prices last week. ''At this stage, you're kind of grappling for the signal that would start a reversal, and it's just not out there in the market,'' said Antoine Halff, head of energy research at Fimat in New York. 
 Shrugging off spiking crude, traders bought stocks yesterday in expectation of an interest rate cut by Federal Reserve policy makers at their meeting beginning today. Investors say a cut could provide relief from problems in the housing and credit markets and help counter the risk that expensive energy, by pinching consumers' pocketbooks, will lead to a downturn in overall spending. Consumer spending is a major component of domestic economic growth.
 But Fed bankers, who are wary that an aggressive cut could lead to inflation, might instead see surging oil costs as a harbinger of higher prices as producers who pay more for energy pass the costs on to the consumer.
 The dollar's weakening value, by giving the Fed more reason to cut rates, could also bolster the equities market. 
 The Canadian dollar traded yesterday at its highest level in 47 years against the United States currency, reaching $1.051 in the afternoon. Some analysts and economists expect the Canadian dollar to go past $1.0614 soon, the highest level it has achieved since Canada become an independent nation in 1867.
 The Canadian dollar has now risen almost 70 percent since its low of 61.79 cents in 2002. Some of the increase is attributable to high prices for Canadian energy and mining exports. But last week, David Dodge, the governor of the Bank of Canada, said that the Canadian dollar had risen too quickly and too high, although the comment had little apparent impact on currency markets.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32, to 102 29/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.38 percent, from 4.40 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills.

HEADLINE: Venezuela's Gas Prices Remain Low, but the Political Costs May Be Rising

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Jose Orozco contributed reporting from Caracas.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
In a country moving toward socialism, the beneficiaries of government largess here are still people like Nicolas Taurisano, a businessman who dabbles in real estate and machinery imports. He is the proud owner of a Hummer. 
 Motorists in the United States smarting from rising gasoline prices, take note: Mr. Taurisano pays the equivalent of $1.50 to fill his Hummer's tank. Thanks to a decades-old subsidy that has proven devilishly complex to undo, gasoline in Venezuela costs about 7 cents a gallon compared with an average $2.86 a gallon in the United States. 
 ''It is one clear benefit to living in an otherwise challenging country,'' said Mr. Taurisano, 34, who also owns a BMW, a Mercedes-Benz, a Ferrari and a Porsche. 
 Many Venezuelans consider the subsidy a birthright even though it bypasses the poor, who rely on relatively expensive and often dangerous public transportation. Economists estimate that it costs the government of President Hugo Chavez more than $9 billion a year.
 Critics of Mr. Chavez, and the president himself, agree that the subsidy is a threat to his project to transform Venezuela into a socialist society, draining huge amounts of money from the national oil company's sales each year that could be used for his social welfare programs. 
 Gasoline prices have often been a taboo subject for Venezuelan governments. There are memories of the riots in 1989, in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people died after protests set off by an increase in gasoline prices that resulted in higher transportation costs. That instability helped set in motion a failed coup attempt by Mr. Chavez in 1992, which first thrust him into the public eye. 
 After his re-election to a six-year term last December, when his political capital was abundant, Mr. Chavez called the gasoline prices ''disgusting'' and said his government was planning to raise them with a measure ''financed by those who own a BMW or a tremendous four-wheel drive.'' But he turned his attention to other matters, avoiding the touchy subject. 
 The link between social peace and gasoline so cheap it is almost given away is evident to many motorists. ''If you raise gasoline, the people revolt,'' said Janeth Lara, 40, an administrator at the Caracas Stock Exchange, as she waited for an attendant to fill the tank of her Jeep Grand Cherokee at a gas station here on a recent day. ''It is the only cheap thing.'' 
 During an oil boom that is lifting the incomes of both rich and poor, Venezuela is grappling with Latin America's highest inflation rate, about 16 percent. The local currency, the bolivar, has plunged almost 50 percent in unregulated trading this year, reaching a record low of about 6,000 to the dollar in October (the official rate is fixed at 2,150 to the dollar.) Gasoline is one of the few products subject to price controls here that is in relatively ample supply. Newspapers have been filled recently with tales of consumers struggling to find milk. Last month, eggs were scarce. 
 Economic uncertainty makes it harder to tinker with fuel prices because a small increase could cascade. There could be an impact on the poor, with higher costs for food and other goods for which transportation costs are important, said Francisco Rodriguez, a former chief economist at the National Assembly. 
 One option is to keep the price of diesel cheap, because it is used in most freight and public transportation, while raising gasoline prices for relatively prosperous car owners. Another idea is to give transportation vouchers to people in poor neighborhoods. 
 ''We are gradually moving toward an economic storm because of our addiction to cheap fuel,'' said Orlando Ochoa, an economist at Andres Bello University in Caracas. 
 Scholars trace the origins of Venezuela's subsidy to the 1940s, when leftists imposed caps on gasoline prices after overthrowing the government of Gen. Isaias Medina Angarita. Because profits on sales of gasoline went to foreign oil companies at the time, the measure was seen as a way of redistributing oil revenues to Venezuelans. 
 Leaders were forced to raise prices in the 1980s and '90s in the midst of financial distress. But Mr. Chavez has been hesitant to raise gasoline prices since his presidency began almost nine years ago.
 Venezuela is not alone among oil-rich countries grappling with subsidized gasoline. Iran, a close ally, was shaken by unrest in June when its government rationed gasoline, which cost 34 cents a gallon at the time. But a thriving car-buying habit rivaled by few nations is forcing the government here to sell greater amounts of cheap gasoline. 
 Vehicle sales in Venezuela climbed 49 percent in the first nine months of the year from the same period last year, in part because cars are seen here as an investing hedge against economic uncertainty. Not only has the bolivar dropped in value, but there is also concern over real estate as squatters are allowed to take control of vacant properties. 
 Fuel smuggling into neighboring Colombia, where prices are much higher, is also rife. Domestic fuel consumption is up 56 percent in the past five years, to 780,000 barrels a day, said Ramon Espinasa, a former chief economist at Petroleos de Venezuela, the national oil company. One-third of oil production now goes to meet the subsidy, he said. 
 Petroleos de Venezuela has disputed such estimates but recently stopped providing public figures on domestic fuel sales. A spokesman at the company said officials were not available to comment on the matter. 
 Despite government efforts to open the market to car manufacturers from Iran and China, bulky, gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles from the United States remain among the most sought-after automobiles here. 
 Perhaps the most coveted S.U.V. of all in Venezuela is the Hummer, an ethical quandary for Mr. Chavez. 
 ''What kind of a revolution is this?'' the president said on his television show this month, after a report here that General Motors was planning to import 3,000 Hummers to meet a rising demand. ''One of Hummers?'' 
 ''No,'' he said with the angry tone of a schoolmaster, answering his own question while announcing a measure that makes it more expensive to import Hummers and other luxury items like whiskey. ''This is a revolution of truth.''

HEADLINE: Gay Enclaves, Once Unique, Lose Urgency

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
This Halloween, the Glindas, gladiators and harem boys of the Castro -- along with untold numbers who plan to dress up as Senator Larry E. Craig, this year's camp celebrity -- will be celebrating behind closed doors. The city's most popular Halloween party, in America's largest gay neighborhood, is canceled.
 The once-exuberant street party, a symbol of sexual liberation since 1979 has in recent years become a Nightmare on Castro Street, drawing as many as 200,000 people, many of them costumeless outsiders, and there has been talk of moving it outside the district because of increasing violence. Last year, nine people were wounded when a gunman opened fire at the celebration. 
 For many in the Castro District, the cancellation is a blow that strikes at the heart of neighborhood identity, and it has brought soul-searching that goes beyond concerns about crime. 
 These are wrenching times for San Francisco's historic gay village, with population shifts, booming development, and a waning sense of belonging that is also being felt in gay enclaves across the nation, from Key West, Fla., to West Hollywood, as they struggle to maintain cultural relevance in the face of gentrification.
 There has been a notable shift of gravity from the Castro, with young gay men and lesbians fanning out into less-expensive neighborhoods like Mission Dolores and the Outer Sunset, and farther away to Marin and Alameda Counties, ''mirroring national trends where you are seeing same-sex couples becoming less urban, even as the population become slightly more urban,'' said Gary J. Gates, a demographer and senior research fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 At the same time, cities not widely considered gay meccas have seen a sharp increase in same-sex couples. Among them: Fort Worth; El Paso; Albuquerque; Louisville, Ky.; and Virginia Beach, according to census figures and extrapolations by Dr. Gates for The New York Times. ''Twenty years ago, if you were gay and lived in rural Kansas, you went to San Francisco or New York,'' he said. ''Now you can just go to Kansas City.''
 In the Castro, the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Historical Society held public meetings earlier this year to grapple with such questions as ''Are Gay Neighborhoods Worth Saving?'' 
 With nine major developments planned for Market Street, including a splashy 113-unit condominium designed by Arquitectonica, anxiety about the future is swirling. Median home prices hover around $870,000. Local institutions like Cliff's Variety, a hardware store selling feathered boas (year-round) are not about to vanish from this storied homeland of the gay rights movement. But the prospect of half-million-dollar condos inhabited by many straight people underscores a demographic shift. 
 ''The Castro, and to a lesser extent the West Village, was where you went to express yourself,'' said Don F. Reuter, a New York author who is researching a book on the rise and fall of gay neighborhoods, or ''gayborhoods.'' 
 ''Claiming physical territory was a powerful act,'' Mr. Reuter said. ''But the gay neighborhood is becoming a past-tense idea.'' 
 In the Castro, the influx of baby strollers -- some being pushed by straight parents, some by gay parents -- is perhaps the most blatant sign of change. ''The Castro has gone from a gay-ghetto mentality to a family mentality,'' said Wes Freas, a broker with Zephyr Real Estate. The arrival of a Pottery Barn down the street from the birthplaces of the AIDS quilt and the Rainbow Flag is a nod to change. 
 Sakura Ferris, a 28-year-old mother of a toddler, moved to the Castro because she liked its new eclecticism. At the Eureka Valley Recreation Center, a parent hot spot rife with Froggie pull-toys, Ms. Ferris's tot mingles with infants in onesies that read, ''I Love My Daddies.'' 
 The Castro remains a top tourist destination for gay and lesbian visitors. But Joe D'Alessandro, president and C.E.O. of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors' Bureau, and a gay parent who lives in the Castro, predicted that eventually the neighborhood would go the way of North Beach, ''still a historic Italian neighborhood though Italians don't necessarily live there anymore.'' 
 The Castro became a center for gay liberation in the late 1960s and early 1970s in a declining Irish Catholic and Scandinavian neighborhood. At its helm was Harvey Milk, the first openly gay city supervisor in San Francisco whose slaying in 1978 by a disgruntled former supervisor, Dan White, galvanized the community and set off riots when White was convicted of manslaughter instead of murder.
 Decimated during the AIDS epidemic of 1990-1995, the neighborhood rebounded in the boom economy of the late 1990s. But the social forces that gave rise to the Castro and other gay neighborhoods like the West Village and West Hollywood may be becoming passe. 
 While the state's Eighth Congressional District, which includes the Castro, saw an increase of about 20 percent in the number of same-sex couples from 2002 to 2006, surrounding districts had a 38 percent increase in same-sex couples, according to Dr. Gates.
 In West Hollywood, another traditional gay haven, the graying of the population and the high cost of real estate have resulted in once-gay watering holes like the Spike and the I Candy Lounge going hetero. A new kind of gentrification is under way in which young gay waiters and school teachers move instead to Hollywood and other surrounding neighborhoods. ''We often clamored for equality where gay and straight could coexist,'' said Mayor John Duran of West Hollywood, who is gay. ''But we weren't prepared to give up our subculture to negotiate that exchange.'' 
 While the Castro has been the center of a movement, it is also home to ''an important political constituency,'' said Elizabeth A. Armstrong, an associate sociology professor at Indiana University and the author of ''Forging Gay Identities: Organizing Sexuality in San Francisco 1950-1994''
 ''When people were angry about Dan White they were able to assemble quickly, spilling out of the bars,'' Professor Armstrong said. ''Physical location mattered.''
 The Castro still has the city's largest progressive Democratic organization, the Harvey Milk Club. A survey of registered voters earlier this year by David Binder, a San Francisco political analyst, found that 33 percent of the Eighth District identified themselves as gay or lesbian, compared with 13 percent citywide. 
 The Castro's activist legacy continues to exert a strong emotional pull: the corner of 18th and Castro Streets, where Harvey Milk; Diana, Princess of Wales; and Matthew Shepard were mourned and where gay marriage was fleetingly celebrated, is for many a mythic homeland. 
 Amanda Rankin, a 40-year-old tourist from Hamilton, Ontario, was taking a ''Cruisin' the Castro'' walking tour with three lesbian friends the other day.
 ''In America there still seems to be a lot of sexual repression left over from Puritanism and the pilgrims,'' Ms. Rankin said. ''Then there's San Francisco.''
 But its legacy has not prevented the neighborhood from harsh urban realities. As San Francisco real estate skyrocketed in the 1990s, the Castro had the city's highest concentration of evictions, as speculators ''flipped'' buildings, many of them housing people with disabilities and AIDS, to convert to market-rate apartments, said Brian Basinger, the founder of the AIDS Housing Alliance. 
 Even before Halloween, the Castro was grappling with violence and crime. Allegations of racial profiling at the Badlands, the neighborhood's most popular bar, led to a widespread boycott in 2005 and intervention by the city's Human Rights Commission. 
 The highly publicized rape of a man in the Castro in September 2006 led to the formation of Castro on Patrol, a whistle-wielding citizens' street brigade. In that attack, Mark Welch was raped five blocks from a store he managed on Castro Street. He said in that he later learned there had been two previous similar rapes in the neighborhood, but that had not been widely reported. 
 He said it took months for it to surface on a sex-crimes Web site maintained by the authorities. There are signs that the dispersing of gay people beyond the Castro vortex and the rise of the Internet are also contributing to a declining sense of community. An annual survey by the San Francisco Gay Men's Community Initiative indicated that in 2007 only 36 percent of men under 29 said there was a gay community in the city with which they could identify. 
 Doug Sebesta, the group's executive director and a medical sociologist at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, said, ''I've had therapists who have told me they are asking their clients to go back to bars as a way of social interaction.'' 
 The Internet is not a replacement for a neighborhood where people are involved in issues beyond themselves, said John Newsome, an African-American who co-founded the group And Castro For All after the Badlands incident. ''There are a lot of really lonely gay people sitting in front of a computer,'' he said. 
 Which is why the cancellation of the Halloween party by the city has provoked such a sense of loss. Many residents say that their night has been taken away. ''It's proof that whatever sense of safety we have is incredibly tenuous, '' Mr. Newsome said. 
 The city is shutting down public transportation to the Castro on Halloween and has begun a Web site, homeforhalloween.com, that lists ''fun'' alternatives, including a Halloween blood drive and a ''Monster Bash'' -- in San Mateo. 
 On a recent Saturday, Sister Roma, a member of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, an activist coterie of drag queens, sashayed down Castro Street in heavy eye shadow and a gold lame top. Though she looked well prepared for Halloween, she said she planned to be in hiding that night. 
 She wasn't feeling too deprived, however.
 ''Sweetie,'' she said, ''every day is Halloween in the Castro.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 5, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Tuesday about changes in gay enclaves like the Castro district in San Francisco referred incorrectly to the time frame of the AIDS epidemic, which took a heavy toll on the Castro neighborhood. The first cases of AIDS in the United States came to light in the early 1980s; the epidemic did not begin in 1990 and end in 1995. Because of an editing error, the article also referred imprecisely to an area in which 33 percent of residents identified themselves as gay or lesbian. It was District 8 of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors -- not the Eighth Congressional District, which includes the Castro.

HEADLINE: Justices to Hear Exxon's Challenge to Punitive Damages

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
Nearly 19 years after the tanker Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound in Alaska, the Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear Exxon Mobil's challenge to the $2.5 billion in punitive damages that the company was ordered to pay to thousands of fishermen, landowners and businesses.
 A jury in Federal District Court in Alaska had awarded $5 billion, which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit cut in half in a decision issued last December. It was the biggest punitive damages award ever ordered by a federal appeals court, and was five times the economic damage of $500 million suffered by the class of 32,000 plaintiffs. 
 Exxon argued in its appeal to the Supreme Court that given the nearly $3.5 billion the company had already paid in environmental cleanup costs, fines and settlements of private claims, the $2.5 billion was outside the boundary of constitutional due process that the court has drawn in recent decisions overturning other punitive damage awards.
 In accepting the appeal, however, the justices granted review only on three statutory questions focused on maritime law.
 As a result, while the case will be of interest to the shipping industry, the decision will shed little light on the constitutional framework that the Supreme Court intends to apply to the question of punitive damages. The case is scheduled to be argued in February and decided by early summer.
 One reason for the court's self-imposed limitation may be the absence of Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., whose ownership of Exxon stock led him to recuse himself from the case, Exxon Shipping Company v. Baker, No. 07-219. Beyond raising the prospect of a 4-4 tie in the specific case, Justice Alito's recusal may have enhanced a sense of uncertainty at the court over how to approach the punitive damages question.
 The court's close division on punitive damages has never followed typical ideological lines. In the most recent ruling, a decision last February that overturned a $79.5 million award against Philip Morris, the vote was 5 to 4, with two more liberal members, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens, joining two conservatives, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, in dissent.
 While Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Alito were in the majority in that case, their view of the fundamental constitutional issue remains uncertain because the Philip Morris decision avoided the question of whether the award was unconstitutionally excessive. Rather, the court found only that the jury might have improperly calculated the award on the basis of harm to smokers other than the man whose widow brought the case.
 To conclude that a damage award is so excessive as to violate due process, the court must first conclude that the Constitution's due process guarantee includes a substantive as well as a merely procedural component. Justices Scalia and Thomas reject that theory of constitutional interpretation. It is plausible that Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito may reject it as well. In any event, this is not the case that will resolve that mystery.
 Exxon is arguing in its appeal that the $2.5 billion award violated various principles of maritime law, including the principle that a ship's owner should not be subject to punitive damages for the conduct of the ship's captain unless the offending conduct was directed by the owner. Exxon's appeal asserts that the lower courts improperly subjected the company to ''vicarious liability'' for the negligence of the captain, Joseph J. Hazelwood, who set the Exxon Valdez on a course to strike the Bligh Reef.
 Lawyers for the plaintiffs told the justices that the verdict reflected the jury's finding that Exxon had acted recklessly in giving Mr. Hazelwood responsibility despite knowing that he was a relapsed alcoholic.
 The plaintiffs' lawyers said the damages judgment was ''unexceptional,'' and that the $2.5 billion punitive award ''represents barely more than three weeks of Exxon's current net profits.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Account of New York Years Often Differs From What Others Say

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
Barack Obama does not say much about his years in New York City. The time he spent as an undergraduate at Columbia College and then working in Manhattan in the early 1980s surfaces only fleetingly in his memoir. In the book, he casts himself as a solitary wanderer in the metropolis, the outsider searching for a way to ''make myself of some use.''
 He tells of underheated sublets, a night spent in an alley, a dead neighbor on the landing. From their fire escape, he and an unnamed roommate watch ''white people from the better neighborhoods'' bring their dogs to defecate on the block. He takes a job in an unidentified ''consulting house to multinational corporations,'' where he is ''a spy behind enemy lines,'' startled to find himself with a secretary, a suit and money in the bank.
 He barely mentions Columbia, training ground for the elite, where he transferred in his junior year, majoring in political science and international relations and writing his thesis on Soviet nuclear disarmament. He dismisses in one sentence his first community organizing job -- work he went on to do in Chicago -- though a former supervisor remembers him as ''a star performer.'' 
 Senator Obama, an Illinois Democrat now seeking the presidency, suggests in his book that his years in New York were a pivotal period: He ran three miles a day, buckled down to work and ''stopped getting high,'' which he says he had started doing in high school. Yet he declined repeated requests to talk about his New York years, release his Columbia transcript or identify even a single fellow student, co-worker, roommate or friend from those years.
 ''He doesn't remember the names of a lot of people in his life,'' said Ben LaBolt, a campaign spokesman.
 Mr. Obama has, of course, done plenty of remembering. His 1995 memoir, ''Dreams From My Father,'' weighs in at more than 450 pages. But he also exercised his writer's prerogative to decide what to include or leave out. Now, as he presents himself to voters, a look at his years in New York -- other people's accounts and his own -- suggests not only what he was like back then but how he chooses to be seen now.
 Some say he has taken some literary license in the telling of his story. Dan Armstrong, who worked with Mr. Obama at Business International Corporation in New York in 1984 and has deconstructed Mr. Obama's account of the job on his blog, analyzethis.net, wrote: ''All of Barack's embellishment serves a larger narrative purpose: to retell the story of the Christ's temptation. The young, idealistic, would-be community organizer gets a nice suit, joins a consulting house, starts hanging out with investment bankers, and barely escapes moving into the big mansion with the white folks.''
 In an interview, Mr. Armstrong added: ''There may be some truth to that. But in order to make it a good story, it required a bit of exaggeration.''
 Mr. Armstrong's description of the firm, and those of other co-workers, differs at least in emphasis from Mr. Obama's. It was a small newsletter-publishing and research firm, with about 250 employees worldwide, that helped companies with foreign operations (they could be called multinationals) understand overseas markets, they said. Far from a bastion of corporate conformity, they said, it was informal and staffed by young people making modest wages. Employees called it ''high school with ashtrays.''
 Many workers dressed down. Only the vice president in charge of Mr. Obama's division got a secretary, they said. Mr. Obama was a researcher and writer for a reference service called Financing Foreign Operations. He also wrote for a newsletter, Business International Money Report.
 ''It was not working for General Foods or Chase Manhattan, that's for sure,'' said Louis Celi, a vice president at the company, which was later taken over by the Economist Intelligence Unit. ''And it was not a consulting firm by any stretch of the imagination. I remember the first time I interviewed someone from Morgan Stanley and I got cheese on my tie because I thought my tie was a napkin.''
 Mr. Obama arrived in New York in August 1981, at age 20, from Occidental College in Los Angeles. According to his memoir, he passed his first night in an alley near 109th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, unable to get into his apartment. The next morning, he bathed at a hydrant alongside a homeless man. 
 Like other transfer students, Mr. Obama lived off campus and bounced from one apartment to another. For a while, he said, he lived with a Pakistani whom he calls Sadik. He recalls that when he lived in a walk-up on East 94th Street, he would chat with his Puerto Rican neighbors about the Knicks or the sound of gunfire at night.
 He writes that ''it was only now that I began to grasp the almost mathematical precision with which America's race and class problems joined; the depth, the ferocity, of resulting tribal wars; the bile that flowed freely not just out on the streets but in the stalls of Columbia's bathrooms as well,'' where the graffiti was both racist and anti-Semitic.
 In a long profile of Mr. Obama in a Columbia alumni magazine in 2005, in which his Columbia years occupied just two paragraphs, he called that time ''an intense period of study.''
 ''I spent a lot of time in the library. I didn't socialize that much. I was like a monk,'' he was quoted as saying.
 He said he was somewhat involved with the Black Student Organization and anti-apartheid activities, though, in recent interviews, several prominent student leaders said they did not remember his playing a role.
 One person who did remember Mr. Obama was Michael L. Baron, who taught a senior seminar on international politics and American policy. Mr. Baron, now president of an electronics company in Florida, said he was Mr. Obama's adviser on the senior thesis for that course. Mr. Baron, who later wrote Mr. Obama a recommendation for Harvard Law School, gave him an A in the course.
 Columbia was a hotbed for discussion of foreign policy, Mr. Baron said. The faculty included Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national security adviser, and Zalmay Khalilzad, now the American ambassador to the United Nations. Half of the eight students in the seminar were outstanding, and Mr. Obama was among them, Mr. Baron said.
 Michael J. Wolf, who took the seminar with him and went on to become president of MTV Networks, said: ''He was very smart. He had a broad sense of international politics and international relations. It was a class with a lot of debate. He was a very, very active participant. I think he was truly distinctive from the other people in that class. He stood out.''
 Mr. Obama graduated in 1983. In his memoir, he says he had decided to become a community organizer but could not persuade anyone to hire him. So he found ''more conventional work for a year'' to pay off his student loans.
 ''Sometimes, coming out of an interview with Japanese financiers or German bond traders, I would catch my reflection in the elevator doors -- see myself in a suit and tie, a briefcase in my hand -- and for a split second I would imagine myself as a captain of industry, barking out orders, closing the deal, before I remembered who it was that I had told myself I wanted to be and felt pangs of guilt for my lack of resolve,'' Mr. Obama wrote.
 Cathy Lazere, his supervisor at Business International, described him as self-assured and bright. ''He was very mature and more worldly than other people -- on the surface kind of laid back, but kind of in control,'' she said. ''He had a good sense of himself, which I think a lot of kids at that age don't.''
 After about a year, he was hired by the New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit organization that promotes consumer, environmental and government reform. He became a full-time organizer at City College in Harlem, paid slightly less than $10,000 a year to mobilize student volunteers.
 Mr. Obama says he spent three months ''trying to convince minority students at City College about the importance of recycling'' -- a description that surprised some former colleagues. They said that more ''bread-and-butter issues'' like mass transit, higher education, tuition and financial aid were more likely the emphasis at City College.
 ''You needed somebody -- and here was where Barack was a star -- who could make the case to students across the political spectrum,'' said Eileen Hershenov, who oversaw Mr. Obama's work for Nypirg. The job required winning over students on the political left, who would normally disdain a group inspired by Ralph Nader as insufficiently radical, as well as students on the right and those who were not active at all.
 Nearly 20 years later, Mr. Obama seemed to remember the experience differently. Gene Karpinski, then executive director of U.S. PIRG, a federation of state watchdog groups, met Mr. Obama in Boston. It was at the time of the 2004 Democratic convention, when Mr. Obama delivered the speech that made him a party luminary. Mr. Karpinski introduced himself. And, he recalled, Mr. Obama told him: ''I used to be a PIRG guy. You guys trained me well.''

HEADLINE: Safety Chief Is Opposing More Money

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
The nation's top official for consumer product safety has asked Congress in recent days to reject legislation intended to strengthen the agency, which polices thousands of consumer goods, from toys to tools.
 On the eve of an important Senate committee meeting to consider the legislation, Nancy A. Nord, the acting chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, has asked lawmakers in two letters not to approve the bulk of legislation that would increase the agency's authority, double its budget and sharply increase its dwindling staff. 
 Ms. Nord opposes provisions that would increase the maximum penalties for safety violations and make it easier for the government to make public reports of faulty products, protect industry whistle-blowers and prosecute executives of companies that willfully violate laws. 
 The measure is an effort to buttress an agency that has been under siege because of a raft of tainted and dangerous products manufactured both domestically and abroad. In the last two months alone, more than 13 million toys have been recalled after tests indicated lead levels that sometimes reached almost 200 times the safety limit. 
 Ms. Nord's opposition to important elements of the legislation is consistent with the broadly deregulatory approach of the Bush administration over the last seven years. In a variety of areas, from antitrust to trucking and worker safety, officials appointed by President Bush have sought to reduce the role of regulation and government in the marketplace.
 Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman, said that Ms. Nord had not coordinated her effort to kill the legislation with the White House. But he said that the administration shared many of her concerns and that Allan Hubbard, President Bush's top economic adviser at the White House, was preparing to send a letter to Congress ''that is probably even more forceful than Ms. Nord's.'' 
 The Senate Commerce Committee is set to vote on Tuesday on the legislation, which is sponsored by Senator Daniel K. Inouye, the Hawaii Democrat who heads the committee, and Senator Mark Pryor, the Arkansas Democrat who heads the consumer affairs subcommittee. 
 It would more than double the agency's budget, to $141 million, over the next seven years, raise staffing levels by about 20 percent, and give the commission broad new powers to police the marketplace. It would raise the cap on the maximum penalties to $100 million, from $1.8 million.
 Ms. Nord, who before joining the agency had been a lawyer at Eastman Kodak and an official at the United States Chamber of Commerce, criticized the measure in letters sent late last week and on Monday afternoon to the Democratic leaders of the committee. She was critical, for instance, of a provision to ban lead from all toys, saying it was not practical. She said that the proposal to raise the potential penalty to $100 million ''may have the undesired consequence of firms, as a precautionary measure, flooding the agency with virtually every consumer complaint and incident.'' Her concern, she said, was that the increase in complaints would so overwhelm the commission that, ''true safety issues would go unrecognized in the process.'' 
 She also criticized a provision that would give state prosecutors the authority to enforce the federal consumer safety laws.
 Manufacturers had agreed to another provision that would assign independent laboratories to test and certify the safety of products, rather than the agency. But Ms. Nord said she objected to the provision. She preferred that the agency determine the conditions for using independent laboratories. 
 Some of Ms. Nord's complaints were similar to the ones that business groups and manufacturers have raised, including that the legislation would be unnecessarily burdensome. But in other areas, like whistle-blower protection, her complaints went beyond those of industry.
 While companies generally have not objected to giving protection to whistle-blowers in the industries regulated by the commission, for example, she said it would ''dramatically drain the limited resources of the commission, to the direct detriment of public safety.'' 
 While Ms. Nord said she supported the committee's efforts in general, she issued a more modest proposal than the one under consideration in the Senate. It would, among other things, increase the maximum amount of civil penalties to $10 million, create incentives for companies to halt sales of recalled products quickly, and give the government the authority to seize assets of a company found to have violated criminal safety laws.
 Senator Pryor said Ms. Nord's objections surprised him.
 ''It's hard for me to know if it's just ideological or she is just expressing the wishes of the administration,'' Mr. Pryor said. ''Either way it comes to the same conclusion, and that is that they say they want more resources, but they are very reluctant to accept those resources.''
 Consumer advocates also said they were stunned by the letter.
 ''It was remarkable to send a letter like that to a committee, when you're in dire straits and you need increased funding and you've acknowledged that,'' said Ellen Bloom, director of federal policy at Consumers Union. 
 The agency has suffered from a steady decline in its budget and staffing in recent years. Its staff numbers about 420, about half its size in the 1980s. It has only one full-time employee to test toys. And 15 inspectors are assigned to police all imports of consumer products under the agency's supervision, a marketplace that last year was valued at $614 billion.
 Through an agency spokesman, Ms. Nord declined to discuss her opposition to the legislation. 
 Ms. Nord's letter was challenged by the Democrat on the commission, Thomas H. Moore. In a letter last week, Mr. Moore told the lawmakers that he generally supported the legislation for being ''strongly pro-consumer.''

HEADLINE: Home Prices Are Down, and So Is Confidence

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Home prices dropped again in August and consumer confidence remained at the lowest level in two years, reinforcing investors' bleak expectations for the economy, a new report showed today. The trouble signs came as Federal Reserve policy makers began a two-day meeting that could culminate in an interest rate cut. 
 The Case-Shiller survey found that prices of homes across 20 major United States metropolitan areas fell 4.4 percent for the 12 months through August, the steepest drop since 2001, when the survey began.
The measure, which is released by Standard and Poor's, is considered more accurate than comparable government reports and offers investors more evidence that the housing sector is facing its worst stretch since the early 1990s.
 Home prices in the New York City area fell 0.8 percent in August, and are down 3.8 percent for the year ended in August. Miami, Las Vegas and Los Angeles were among the hardest hit cities for the month, while Denver and Charlotte posted modest gains.
 Meanwhile, an October survey of consumers showed confidence in the economy at the lowest level in two years. The confidence index fell to 95.6 from 99.5 in September, which was also revised downward, according to the Conference Board, a private research firm.
 A fifth of those surveyed believe there will be fewer jobs in the next six months, and slightly more Americans expect their income to decrease compared with a year ago, the Conference Board said. The share of consumers who believe employment is plentiful dropped below 25 percent for the first time since August 2006.
 ''Home prices declining at an accelerating rate, that's not exactly anything new at this stage,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at the research firm MFR. But Mr. Shapiro said the confidence report suggested employment levels could be dipping, and he said he expected a weaker payroll report for October.
 Investors were cautious today, nudging stocks mostly downward. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 77.79, or 0.6 percent, to 13,792.47, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock was off slightly more. The Nasdaq composite, heavy with technology stocks, closed down a fraction of a point.
 Crude oil prices retreated from their recent gains, dropping $3.27 on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $90.26 at the close of exchange trading. 
 Investors are still confident that the Fed will cut interest rates when it announces its policy decision tomorrow. A cut would make it easier for banks and businesses to borrow money, which would ease investors' concerns about a tight credit market. 
 But there is a chance the Fed will decide hold rates steady. Broader economic measures, like promising jobs and sales reports, have revealed some strength in the overall economy, though the housing sector continues to stumble and the dollar is at an all-time low against the euro.

HEADLINE: The Right Places to Learn Entrepreneurship

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
Nearly 3,000 colleges offer classes in entrepreneurship, up tenfold in the last 20 years, according to the Kauffman Foundation, which is devoted to promoting ''a society of economically independent individuals.''
 So which school is the right place for those interested in starting their own companies?
Fortune Small Business spent seven months interviewing hundreds of entrepreneurs, professors, administrators, students and alumni to try to find out. The magazine answers the question this way: 
 It found that the best places to get an undergraduate education were Babson College, Indiana University, Syracuse University, the University of Arizona, and the University of Pennsylvania.
 The best places for learning online were Boston University, the University of Houston at Victoria, the University of Wyoming, and Western Carolina University.
 For cross-disciplinary studies, the choices were Cornell, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Wake Forest.
 For graduate school, the top places were Babson, Harvard, Indiana University, M.I.T., Stanford, Syracuse, the University of Arizona, University of California at Berkeley, the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Pennsylvania.
 The top choices for executive education were Babson, Harvard, Northwestern, Stanford, the University of Chicago and the University of Texas at Austin.
 And for family business, the best places were Babson, Baylor, Kennesaw State University, Loyola of Chicago, Northwestern and the University of Texas at El Paso. 
 DOES PASSION TRUMP ALL? Maybe we have the whole approach to teaching entrepreneurship backward, George Gendron writes in Inc. 
 Instead of teaching the subject to business majors, who then go out and try to find a niche to fill, wouldn't it be better to offer courses to people who are passionate about a potentially commercial idea -- no matter what their major -- to give them the specific skills they need to turn their dream into a reality.
 That is the approach Mr. Gendron, who founded the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program at Clark University in Massachusetts, is taking.
 ''The guiding principle of the program is a belief that the entrepreneurial skills we traditionally associate with certain discrete populations -- engineers in Silicon Valley, for example -- have become vital life skills for everyone in today's globally competitive marketplace and rapidly changing culture,'' writes Mr. Gendron who was the editor of Inc. for 20 years. ''And so this undergraduate program was not designed to attract management majors, although we do get many of those students. Rather, we chose as our mission to complement a rigorous education in the arts and sciences.''
 The school only offers a minor in entrepreneurship, meaning that students must take the majority of their courses in other disciplines.
 ''The goal is simple: to encourage these students to follow their passion, whatever that might be, but to marry those studies with a set of skills -- from salesmanship to an understanding of the principles of market research to the ability to lead and work in teams -- that will dramatically improve the likelihood that they'll be able to create an economically sustainable life around that passion,'' Mr. Gendron writes.
 FREE TO LOOK You don't need to take a course to benefit from the online learning available at the world's universities. Just rummage around their Web sites.
 For example the London School of Economics site has copies of business plans for companies that plan to offer everything from venture capital consulting to customized takeout pizzas.
 CREDENTIALS The article is called, ''Do you need a degree to be a successful business owner?'' and the author, Jennifer Mattern of J.H. Mattern, a public relations firm, is quick to answer her own question with ''obviously the simple answer is 'no,' because others have gone on to run highly successful businesses without a formal education.''
 But Ms. Mattern makes an intriguing point.
 ''What I hear a lot of people say (usually kids who start businesses at home online, and who haven't even finished high school yet) is that if so-and-so could do it without college (insert any ridiculously successful dropout entrepreneur here), so can anyone else. What they neglect completely is that the cases they cite are actually extremely rare. Banking on being the exception to the rule is very likely a large contributing factor to the overwhelming number of small businesses that fail within their first one to three years.''
 LAST CALL Getting (a little bit) mad may actually help your thinking, according to Psychology Today.
 While ''strong physiological arousal has detrimental effects on cognitive functioning,'' Wesley Moons of the University of California at Santa Barbara told Jennifer Garfinkel, in cases of moderate anger ''people are motivated to think carefully about the information available to them.''
 Apparently it's possible to be a level-headed hothead.

HEADLINE: Report Says Army Buys Boy Soldiers In Myanmar

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Add to the many hardships in Myanmar today one more danger: being a boy. According to a report to be released Wednesday, the military, struggling to meet recruiting quotas, is buying, kidnapping and terrorizing boys as young as 10 to fill its ranks.
 The report by Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group, says military recruiters and civilian brokers scour train and bus stations, markets and other public places for boys and coerce them to serve. 
 Some may simply disappear without their families' knowledge and spend years on the front lines of a brutal war against ethnic insurgencies.
 ''In recent years the military has continued to expand while at the same time losing large numbers of soldiers to desertion,'' a co-author of the report, Jo Becker, said in an interview. ''Recruiters and civilian agents are sweeping boys as young as 11 and 12 off the streets. Children are literally being bought and sold by recruiters.'' Ms. Becker is the director of children's rights advocacy for Human Rights Watch. 
 The recruiters and agents receive cash payments and other incentives for recruits, even those who fail to meet basic health and age requirements, said the report, which was based on interviews in Myanmar, Thailand and China.
 The large number of child soldiers in Myanmar's army -- and in the ranks of some 30 armed ethnic groups -- has been known for years, and Human Rights Watch has published earlier reports on it. The new report, coming at a moment of crisis in Myanmar, illustrates the kind of abuses that gave rise, along with economic hardships, to the huge anti-government protests in August and September that were crushed by the military junta a month ago.
 ''Even before the recent crackdown, many young adults rejected military service because of grueling conditions, low pay and mistreatment by superior officers,'' the report said. 
 In response to criticism, the government formed a high-level committee in 2004 to prevent the impressment of under-age soldiers. ''In fact, the committee is a sham,'' Ms. Becker said.
 She said it was impossible to say how many child soldiers serve in Myanmar, or to be certain of the full strength of the armed forces, which is generally put at roughly 400,000.
 But the report said that in interviews with 20 former soldiers, all but one estimated that at least 30 percent of their fellow trainees were boys under 18. Particularly in newly formed units, as many as half were under age.
 The legal age for military service is 18, but the report said recruiters and unit commanders often falsified new soldiers' ages.
 One of the report's case studies was of a boy who was made a soldier at age 11, even though he was only 4 feet 3 inches tall and weighed less than 70 pounds. The boy, no longer a soldier, told Human Rights Watch that his recruiter bribed the medical officer to certify his eligibility. 
 The report quoted some former child soldiers as saying they and others had been detained in cells, handcuffed, beaten, and bought and sold from one recruiter or battalion to another.
 Once in the ranks, the report said, child soldiers are subject to mistreatment by officers and are sometimes forced to participate in the human rights abuses that have been widely documented among the Tatmadaw, or armed forces. They include battlefield atrocities, the burning down of villages and the sexual abuse of women.
 ''One thing that is interesting is that many child soldiers say their first experience in combat is terrifying,'' Ms. Becker said. ''They are scared of being shot and often would hide or shoot their gun in the air. But they acclimatized very quickly, so often by the second or third encounter they were no longer afraid.''
 Some of those interviewed went on to serve 12 or 13 years in the army, she said.
 Desertion is punished harshly, according to the report, with arrests and beatings.
 The report told of a 16-year-old boy, Maung Zaw Oo, who had been forcibly mustered into the army at age 14, escaped and forced to join again soon afterward.
 He told researchers that the corporal who had brought him in received some money, a sack of rice and a big tin of cooking oil. When his relatives tracked him down, they were told he would be released only if they brought in five new recruits.

HEADLINE: A Cautious Market Awaits Fed's Move on Rates

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The market played it safe yesterday, but will the Fed follow suit today?
 That was the question on Wall Street's mind as investors sold off oil, driving the price down by over $3 a barrel, and generally hunkered down in expectation that the Federal Reserve will fulfill the market's wish and cut interest rates by a quarter-point this afternoon. 
 ''They've laid their bets,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. ''People now are going to wait and see what happens.'' 
 It was a day for traders to minimize risks. Crude oil prices retreated from record levels, falling $3.15 to close at $90.38 a barrel after Goldman Sachs advised clients to pocket profits from last week's rally. Stock markets dipped, with the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index closing down 0.65 percent, or about 10 points, at 1,531.02. 
 Traders are expecting the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a point, to 4.5 percent, making it slightly less expensive for banks, businesses, and consumers looking to borrow money. That would ease investors' concerns that the Fed in not indifferent to the continuing risks of a credit squeeze.
 But analysts say a cut has already been priced into the market. If central bankers are persuaded to keep rates steady because they think the economy has reached equilibrium, stocks could be primed for a sell-off.
 ''This is a market that wants to be careful,'' said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford financial services firm. 
 ''This is a new Fed chairman,'' Ms. Krosby said of Ben S. Bernanke, who has held the Fed's top spot for about 18 months. ''This is his first crisis. And we're trying to get a sense of how he operates.'' 
 The caution is understandable. By the end of the week investors will be flooded with more economic news, including the October employment report, which is one of the most up-to-date indicators. 
 That uncertainty was on display yesterday when crude oil prices fell, erasing recent record gains. 
 Few commodities have been more volatile this year than oil, which has surged nearly 80 percent since January. Investors sold after a Goldman Sachs report yesterday cited a ''cautious'' outlook for prices.
 Fadel Gheit, managing director of oil and gas research at OppenheimerFunds, complained yesterday that oil investors were determining prices with little focus on supply and demand.
 ''Oil dropped four dollars for no apparent reason today,'' Mr. Gheit said, ''because Goldman said it had to come down.''
 Some investors are also on edge over the outcome of today's Fed meeting. There is a chance the central bank will hold rates steady, based on broader measures that have revealed some strength in the overall economy. 
 But home prices dropped again in August, according to an independent measure, and consumer confidence remained at the lowest level in two years, new reports showed yesterday. 
 ''Home prices declining at an accelerating rate?'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at the research firm MFR, said. ''That's not exactly anything new at this stage.'' Still, the independent Case-Shiller survey fell short of analysts' expectations. Prices of homes across 20 major United States metropolitan areas fell 4.4 percent for the 12 months through August, the steepest drop since 2001, when the survey began. 
 The measure, which is released by Standard and Poor's, is considered more accurate than comparable reports from real estate groups and offers investors more evidence that the housing sector is likely to suffer more before the decline is finished than in any comparable period since the Depression. 
 Home prices in the New York City area fell 0.8 percent in August, and are down 3.8 percent for the year ended in August. Tampa, Las Vegas and Los Angeles were among the hardest-hit cities, while Denver and Charlotte posted modest gains.
 ''We've gotten past the notion that the housing market is going to stabilize this quarter, or the first quarter of '08,'' said Ms. Krosby of The Hartford. ''There's no one who expects that.''
 Meanwhile, an October survey of consumers showed confidence at the lowest level in two years. The index fell to 95.6 from 99.5 in September, which was also revised downward, according to the Conference Board, a private research group.
 A fifth of those surveyed believe there will be fewer jobs in the next six months, and more Americans expect their income to decrease compared with a year ago, the Conference Board said. The share of consumers who believe employment is plentiful dropped below 25 percent for the first time since August 2006.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills.

HEADLINE: Plain Truth About Taxes And Cuts

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
You're going to hear a lot about taxes over the next two years. Some of the things you hear will be true. Others will be less true. The goal here today is distinguish between the two.
 Last week, Charles B. Rangel, the Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, introduced a bill to overhaul the tax code. Above all, it would raise taxes on the affluent to pay for the elimination of the alternative minimum tax, which is hitting more and more upper-middle-class families. The bill has no chance of becoming law anytime soon. 
 Yet Republicans immediately and gleefully seized on the proposal as a preview of what a Democratic president would do. Vice President Dick Cheney called it ''a bad proposal'' filled with ''terrible ideas'' that would do ''an awful lot of damage'' to the economy. Most Democrats are less eager to talk about the Rangel proposal, but it's clear that they also think a fight over taxes can work to their advantage in 2008 and beyond. Tax policy, as they see it, is one way to soothe the middle class's economic anxiety. 
 There are big philosophical questions about taxes that facts alone can't answer. How important is it to let people keep the money that they earn? Will higher tax rates cause more cheating? How important is it to ensure that take-home pay is rising for every group of Americans? 
 But there are also some basic facts that ideology can't change. 
 If you keep these five in mind, you will have an easier time keeping up with the debate:
 As a group, the rich pay a greater share of taxes than in the past.
 The top 1 percent of taxpayers -- those with adjustable gross income of at least $267,000 in 2004 -- paid more than 25 percent of all federal taxes that year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That was up from 15 percent in 1979. 
 People sometimes pick nits with these statistics, and the numbers are indeed imperfect. They don't include state and local taxes, which hit the middle class and the poor harder than federal taxes. On the other hand, the numbers ignore money that the government sends back to taxpayers, like Social Security, which mostly goes to the poor and middle class.
 But don't get bogged down in all this. The big picture is clear enough. The main reason for the trend is also clear.
 The affluent are paying more of the taxes because they're making so much more money. 
 Tax cut advocates like to argue that taxes on the affluent have entered the realm of Robin Hood. This year, Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's former press secretary, wrote an op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal suggesting that a small slice of taxpayers was being asked to foot almost the entire bill for the federal government. ''The problem is that there is a tipping point after which piling taxes onto the rich will leave the government unable to meet its obligations,'' Mr. Fleischer wrote.
 Reading that, you would probably assume that the tax rates on high-income families have soared over the last generation. But they haven't. 
 A family in that top 1 percent of earners paid a total federal tax rate -- including everything from payroll taxes to income taxes to capital gains taxes -- of 30 percent in 2004. That was down from 41 percent a decade before. Since the 1950s, tax rates on high-income families have generally been falling. 
 The top earners pay a bigger share of the government tab than in the past because their incomes have risen so sharply -- even more sharply than their tax bills. (Mr. Fleischer was able to claim the opposite by looking only at income taxes.) 
 The affluent, in short, are paying less in taxes on every dollar they earn but earning many more dollars.
 Corporate taxes have dropped significantly in recent decades.
 There are two strange facts about corporate taxes. Everyone from Mr. Rangel on the left to Fred Thompson on the right is saying that high corporate taxes are hurting American companies. But the effective corporate tax rate isn't any higher than it has been on average over the last 25 years, and it's far lower than it was in the 1960s and '70s.
 ''A dirty little secret is that the corporate income tax used to raise a fair amount of revenue,'' says Richard Clarida, a Columbia University economist and former Treasury Department official under Mr. Bush.
 What's going on here? This country really does have a high corporate tax rate, but it also has so many loopholes that companies can often avoid paying the tax. A much smarter policy, economists say, would include a lower rate with fewer loopholes. ''Both the incentive and the ability to avoid the tax would then be smaller,'' says Leonard Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center in Washington. 
 The nation's total tax bill hasn't changed much over the years.
 Put it all together -- less corporate tax collection and lower individual tax rates, combined with more income for the people who face the highest tax rates -- and the trends mostly cancel each other out. The taxes that the federal government took in last year equaled 18.4 percent of the gross domestic product, almost exactly the average since 1980. The overall tax burden rose in the 1990s, fell during Mr. Bush's first term and has drifted up in the last few years as corporate profits and upper-end incomes surged.
 The obvious conclusion is that moderate shifts in taxes don't dictate economic growth. Mr. Bush's father and Bill Clinton raised taxes -- and the economy grew for almost the entire decade of the 1990s. The current administration has cut taxes -- and the economy has grown for almost all of this decade. 
 So if short-term economic growth were the only thing to worry about, you could make a good argument either for cutting taxes or for raising them. Unfortunately, there is another problem out there. 
 The budget deficit is worse than either party says it is.
 Mr. Bush has predicted that the deficit will disappear by 2012. But that prediction depends on the fiction that the alternative minimum tax will be allowed to grow ever larger in coming years. The Democratic presidential candidates, meanwhile, are promising to pay for their new programs in part by getting rid of some of Mr. Bush's tax cuts. But those tax cuts are already scheduled to expire under current law. The official budget numbers have already taken their demise into account. 
 White House officials are absolutely correct when they note that the current budget deficit isn't especially large. But it will soar in coming years, as baby boomers stop working (and stop paying very much in taxes) and instead move onto the Social Security and Medicare rolls If nothing changes over the next couple of decades, the United States will build up a debt burden to resemble Argentina's, as Mr. Burman points out.
 There are several ways to prevent that. Taxes could be raised across the board, or they could be raised on the affluent. Or the Medicare budget -- a much bigger problem than Social Security -- could be held in check if the government figured out how to say no to some expensive medical procedures. Or all of the above could happen. But something has to give. No amount of clever argument can pay the bills.

HEADLINE: Some Respite, if Little Cheer, for Skid Row Homeless

BYLINE: By SOLOMON MOORE

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Not so long ago, Kenneth Johnson, 29, lived in a West Los Angeles condominium with his wife and three children and earned $4,000 a month as a forklift operator.
 Now he is unemployed and divorced, and beds down each night on a grimy sidewalk in downtown's 50-square-block Skid Row. 
 ''It's weird to be down here,'' said Mr. Johnson, leaning against a wall as night fell. ''It's not a very easy feeling, but over a couple of weeks I got used to it.'' 
 Like thousands of others in this despairing city within a city, Mr. Johnson came to Skid Row because it is the easiest place in Los Angeles to find services, shelter and three square meals a day.
 And beginning this month, the neighborhood's homeless have also been guaranteed some respite from the police. Under pressure from the American Civil Liberties Union, Los Angeles agreed on Oct. 10 not to appeal a federal court order and will instead allow sleeping on the sidewalk, at least until the city provides 1,250 new beds in low-income housing. 
 The deal partly rolls back a zero-tolerance crackdown on petty offenses in the Skid Row area, including sleeping in public places, that was undertaken late last year by Police Chief William J. Bratton. The effort has reduced by about half the 8,000 homeless who frequented the area a year ago, according to police estimates.
 Some advocates express concern that the flight from Skid Row has left people cut off from vital assistance. The police, however, maintain that the area is safer -- for everyone, including the homeless -- with fewer people living on the streets.
 As of Oct. 6, the police had made 10,742 arrests in and around Skid Row this year, 15 percent more than in the corresponding period of 2006. At the same time, property crimes had dropped by 25 percent and violent crimes by a third, police statistics show.
 But while there are 17,000 shelter beds in Los Angeles County, most of them within the city, there are some 74,000 homeless across the county's 4,060 square miles, officials say. And despite the decline in their numbers on Skid Row, it remains an area with one of the nation's largest concentrations of the homeless. As a result, the shelters remain full every night, said Andy Bales, chief executive of the Union Rescue Mission, which operates one of them.
 Though the shelters have set up courtyard cots to accommodate the nightly overflow, some of the homeless prefer the street, which, they say, is safer. One woman, Guadalupe Ibarra, who showers and eats at the missions but does not sleep there because she fears for her safety, gestured at the sleeping bags and tents under a store's awning. ''This is our residence,'' she said. ''We all respect each other here.'' 
 Yet Skid Row's street people have been watching their territory shrink for years, as downtown developers open the long-neglected area to gentrification. Late-night restaurants, art galleries and refurbished loft spaces selling in the high six figures now form the edge of the neighborhood.
 Every few days, Hollywood producers descend upon nearby streets to floodlight a midcentury bank building or a bar, standing in for the grit of an East Coast city. Dogs are walked past bookstores and DVD shops, their owners only occasionally approached for change or cigarettes. ''There's a lot more money people around now,'' Ms. Ibarra said. ''They put fences and gates around a lot of places where we used to stay.'' 
 She said the changes had pushed many homeless people into East Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley, and west to Santa Monica and Venice Beach. (Homeless-population maps -- at http://homeless.cartifact.com/ -- that were produced by the police chart the dispersal of street people from Skid Row since last year.) 
 Much of Skid Row, however, remains a place of wandering drunks and drug addicts, with homeless people lining urine-stained sidewalks in sleeping bags, cardboard shelters and tents.
 Lee Ann Salazar, 63, said she had lived on the streets for six years. She tries to keep on the move, tending to 70 or so stray cats with a sack of Friskies. Ms. Salazar told of having recently been attacked by gang members who burned her shopping cart full of possessions.
 ''Living out here is like sliding down a 40-foot razor blade,'' she said. ''Your body cannot rest. It's like you're pulling out your eyeteeth to get up every morning.''

HEADLINE: Students' Family Members Are Deported

BYLINE: By TERRY AGUAYO and JULIA PRESTON; Terry Aguayo reported from Miami and Julie Preston from New York.

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
The parents and grandmother of two college students in Miami whose fight for legal immigration status came to symbolize the hopes of illegal immigrant students were deported to Colombia on Tuesday. 
 The parents, Julio Cesar Gomez and his wife, Liliana, arrived at Miami International Airport in the morning and were placed by federal agents on a commercial flight to Bogota. With them was Mr. Gomez's mother, Carmen Elisa Perilla de Gomez, 84. They were deported after the family's final appeal failed this month in a petition for political asylum first presented in 1992.
 Mr. and Mrs. Gomez are the parents of Juan Sebastian Gomez, 18, and his brother Alejandro, 20, both born in Colombia, whose illegal status became publicly known when the family was first detained by immigration agents on July 25. Classmates of Juan at Miami Killian Senior High School, citing his exceptional academic performance, rallied the support of federal lawmakers, winning a temporary reprieve from deportation for the two young men. 
 The Gomez brothers became public faces for hundreds of thousands students nationwide who are illegal immigrants and could benefit if Congress adopted legislation to give them legal status. The most recent effort, a bill sponsored by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, failed to pass a procedural test vote last week in the Senate.
 The deportation of the Gomez parents and grandmother, the boys' only immediate family in the United States, left it clear that the authorities would not extend any special protection to parents even if their children were to obtain legal status as students. 
 It left Juan and Alejandro with no means of economic support while they attend Miami Dade College, said Cheryl Little, the executive director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, a legal group representing the brothers. Ms. Little said she was working to obtain driver's licenses and work permits for the youths so they could find jobs to pay for their studies.
 A statement by Immigration and Customs Enforcement said, ''The family had full due process of law and exhausted all legal avenues of relief.'' Family members ''self-deported'' after officials allowed them time to put their affairs in order, the statement said. 
 After coming to the United States as tourists in 1990, Mr. and Mrs. Gomez stayed beyond the terms of their visas, starting a successful catering business. Mr. Gomez sought asylum, saying he faced threats from leftist guerrillas in Colombia because of his participation in a labor union there. 
 According to court papers, a brother of Mr. Gomez was assassinated by guerrillas in 1987, and in recent years a niece and a nephew were murdered. On Oct. 19, the Board of Immigration Appeals declined to reopen the case. 
 Juan Gomez, who was 2 when his parents arrived in Florida, drew attention by earning a 3.96 high school grade point average and receiving the highest possible score on 11 Advanced Placement examinations.
 Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida, and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and a presidential candidate, presented separate private bills on behalf of the brothers, which resulted in the suspension of their deportation until 2009.
 At the airport on Tuesday, the brothers were silent and calm, and their father appeared resigned, while their mother wept as she said goodbye to her sons. Mrs. Perilla de Gomez, who came to the United States in 1991, arrived in a wheelchair.
 ''It makes me sad to see that this country separates families,'' Mrs. Gomez said. ''We've never been separated.''
 Mr. Gomez defended the United States. ''This is the best country in the world,'' he said. ''I will continue to say that.''
 The Durbin bill that was defeated last week excluded illegal immigrant parents from any benefits under the measure, which would have given legal status to high school graduates who finished two years of college or military service. Opponents said it was an amnesty for immigrant lawbreakers that could draw millions of new immigrants to the United States.

HEADLINE: Hello, India? I Need Help With My Math

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Adrianne Yamaki, a 32-year-old management consultant in New York, travels constantly and logs 80-hour workweeks. So to eke out more time for herself, she routinely farms out the administrative chores of her life -- making travel arrangements, hair appointments and restaurant reservations and buying theater tickets -- to a personal assistant service, in India.
 Kenneth Tham, a high school sophomore in Arcadia, Calif., strives to improve his grades and scores on standardized tests. Most afternoons, he is tutored remotely by an instructor speaking to him on a voice-over-Internet headset while he sits at his personal computer going over lessons on the screen. The tutor is in India.
 The Bangalore butler is the latest development in offshore outsourcing. 
 The first wave of slicing up services work and sending it abroad has been all about business operations. Computer programming, call centers, product design and back-office jobs like accounting and billing have to some degree migrated abroad, mainly to India. The Internet, of course, makes it possible, while lower wages in developing nations make outsourcing attractive to corporate America.
 The second wave, according to some entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and offshoring veterans, will be the globalization of consumer services. People like Ms. Yamaki and Mr. Tham, they predict, are the early customers in a market that will one day include millions of households in the United States and other nations. 
 They foresee an array of potential services beyond tutoring and personal assistance like health and nutrition coaching, personal tax and legal advice, help with hobbies and cooking, learning new languages and skills and more. Such services, they say, will be offered for affordable monthly fees or piecework rates. 
 ''Consumer services delivered globally should be a huge market,'' observed K. P. Balaraj, a managing director of the Indian arm of Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley.
 But globalization of consumer services faces daunting challenges, both economic and cultural. Offshore outsourcing for big business thrived partly because the jobs were often multimillion-dollar contracts and the work was repetitive. In economic terms, there were economies of scale so that the most efficient Indian offshore specialists could become multibillion-dollar companies like Infosys Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro Technologies.
 It is not all clear that similar economies of scale can be achieved in the consumer market, where the customers are individual households and services must be priced in tens or hundreds of dollars. 
 Then there are the matters of language, accent and cultural nuance that promise to hamper the communication and understanding needed to deliver personal services. Already, some American consumers voice frustrations in dealing with customer-service call centers in India. At the least, the spread of remotely delivered personal services will be a real test of globalization at the grass-roots level.
 Even optimists acknowledge the obstacles. In a report this year, Evalueserve, a research firm, predicted that ''person-to-person offshoring,'' both consumer services and services for small businesses, would grow rapidly, to more than $2 billion by 2015. Yet consumer services, in particular, are in a ''nascent phase,'' said Alok Aggarwal, chairman of Evalueserve and a former I.B.M. researcher. ''It's promising, but it's not clear yet that you can build sizable companies in this market.''
 Veterans of the business offshoring boom predict an emerging market, but most are not investing. Nandan M. Nilekani, co-chairman of Infosys, said there is ''definitely an opportunity in the globalization of consumer services,'' and he listed several possibilities, even psychological counseling and religious confessionals. But, he added in an e-mail message, ''This is just 'blue sky' thinking! We have no business interest at this point in this direction.''
 What the offshore consumer services industry needs, it seems, is a solid success story in some promising market. 
 A leading candidate to watch, according to analysts, is TutorVista, a tutoring service founded two years ago by Krishnan Ganesh, a 45-year-old Indian entrepreneur and a pioneer of offshore call centers. 
 Concerns about the quality of K-12 education in America and the increased emphasis on standardized tests is driving the tutoring business in general. Traditional classroom tutoring services like Kaplan and Sylvan are doing well and offer online features. And there are other remote services like Growing Stars, Tutor.com and SmarThinking.
 Yet TutorVista, analysts say, is different in a number of ways. Other remote tutoring services generally offer hourly rates of $20 to $30 instead of the $40 to $60 hourly charges typical of on-site tutoring. By contrast, TutorVista takes an all-you-can-eat approach to instruction. Its standard offering is $99 a month for as many 45-minute tutoring sessions as a student arranges. 
 TutorVista also stands out for its well-known venture backers, its scale and its ambition. The two-year-old company has raised more than $15 million from investors including Sequoia, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Silicon Valley Bank. TutorVista employs 760 people, including 600 tutors in India, a teaching staff it plans to double by year-end. Its 52-person technical staff has spent countless hours building the software system to schedule, monitor and connect potentially tens of thousands of tutors with students oceans away. 
 ''Our vision is to be part of the monthly budget of one million families,'' Mr. Ganesh said.
 It is a long-term goal. To date, TutorVista has signed up 10,000 subscribers in the United States, and its British service, rolled out in September, has 1,000.
 Further gains will depend on winning over more customers like the Tham family in California. Since he was in elementary school, Kenneth has had stints of conventional tutoring, often in classroom settings with up to 10 other students. At times, this cost the family up to $500 a month. Last year, Ernest Tham, a truck driver, noticed a reference to TutorVista on a Web site and suggested his son give it a try.
 ''Kenneth was apprehensive at first, and I wasn't sure how it would work,'' Mr. Tham said. ''But, shocking to say, it's gone very well.''
 Kenneth said he initially found it ''very unusual, not seeing another person. You get used to it, though. It's not a problem.'' He schedules one or two sessions nearly every day, mainly for English and chemistry. With a digital pen and palette, he writes sentences and grammar exercises, for example, and his work appears on his computer screen and on the screen of his tutor. They discuss the lessons using Internet-telephone headsets.
 ''You can also get help with homework problems,'' Kenneth said, ''but they're not supposed to do all your homework for you.''
 In a year with the TutorVista service, Kenneth has improved both his grades and standardized test scores, his father said. 
 Ramya Tadikonda has tutored Kenneth Tham, among many others, from her home in Chennai, India. To achieve its ambitions, TutorVista must recruit, train and retain thousands of tutors like her. 
 Ms. Tadikonda, 26, is a college graduate who had previously worked as a software and curriculum developer for a math Web site for students, but left to raise her children. Earlier this year, she joined TutorVista, took the company's 60-hour training course, followed by tests and practice sessions for two months. She now works about 24 hours a week as a math and English tutor and makes about $200 a month.
 Ms. Tadikondasays she enjoys tutoring and the flexible hours. ''You can have a career and still spend time with your family,'' she said. ''I never thought I could do that.''
 The timing is right for global tutoring, according to John J. Stuppy, TutorVista's president and a former executive at Sylvan Learning, the Educational Testing Service and The Princeton Review. Improved Internet technology and the ability to tap of vast pool of educated instructors at low cost are crucial ingredients. ''It becomes possible to make high-quality, one-on-one tutoring affordable and accessible to the masses,'' said Mr. Stuppy, who joined TutorVista last year.
 Steve Ludmer, 28, and his partner Avinash G. Samudrala, 27, are betting the time is right for another kind of global consumer service. They left lucrative jobs in management consulting and private equity to start a remote personal assistant service, called Ask Sunday, which began in July.
 The company is based in New York, but its work force is mostly in India. It is one of a handful of startups trying to create a business in offshore personal assistant service. Some, like GetFriday, charge hourly rates of $15 or so, but Ask Sunday has a per-request model, $29 a month for 30 requests a month or $49 for 50.
 The requests can be unusual. A few subscribers had Ask Sunday search online dating services for short lists of people who meet their criteria. But the requests are mainly to help busy people like Ms. Yamaki, the New York management consultant, free up time and outsource hassles. 
 During a late meeting at the office recently, Ms. Yamaki said, she sent a one-line e-mail message from her laptop that told Ask Sunday to order her usual meals from her favorite Manhattan restaurant, for delivery at 9:30 p.m. When the meeting ended, her take-out food was waiting.
 To handle such personal chores, Ms. Yamaki has handed Ask Sunday a wealth of personal information, including credit card numbers, birth dates of family and friends and phone numbers for doctors, car services, favorite restaurants and others. She finds the convenience well worth it.
 ''The service is great in a pinch to make your life a little smoother,'' Ms. Yamaki said. ''And it's available 24 hours a day, which is more than you can expect from a personal assistant at work.''

HEADLINE: Classroom of the Future Is Virtually Anywhere

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER. 
E-mail: joeberg@nytimes.com

DATELINE: HERSHEY, Pa. 

 BODY:
 The university classroom of the future is in Janet Duck's dining room on East Chocolate Avenue here. 
 There is no blackboard and no lectern, and, most glaringly, no students. Dr. Duck teaches her classes in Pennsylvania State University's master's program in business administration by sitting for several hours each day in jeans and shag-lined slippers at her dining table, which in soccer mom fashion is cluttered with crayon sketches by her 6-year-old Elijah and shoulder pads for her 9-year-old Olivia's Halloween costume. 
 In this homespun setting, the spirited Dr. Duck pecks at a Toshiba laptop and posts lesson content, readings and questions for her two courses on ''managing human resources'' that touch on topics like performance evaluations and recruitment. The instructional software allows her 54 students to log on from almost anywhere at any time and post remarkably extended responses, the equivalent of a blog about the course. Recently, the class exchanged hard-earned experiences about how managers deal with lackluster workers. 
 Those students, mostly 30-ish middle managers and professionals trying to enhance their skills, cannot be with her in a Penn State classroom at a set time. One woman is an Air Force pilot flying missions over Afghanistan; other global travelers filed comments last week from Tokyo, Athens, Sao Paulo and Copenhagen. Dr. Duck cannot regularly be at Penn State, largely because of her three children. Yet she and other instructors will help the students acquire standard M.B.A.'s next August at a total cost of $52,000, with each side having barely stepped into a traditional classroom.
 Welcome to the brave burgeoning world of online education. It's a world most of us, whether we like it or not, will have to grapple with, as students, tuition-paying parents or employees. Nearly 3.5 million college or graduate students, one of every five, took at least one online course last fall, double the figures of five years earlier, according to a survey of 2,500 campuses published last week in a collaboration among the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the College Board and a Babson College research group. 
 Taken at face value, the study was chilling. This writer's first impulse was to recall a college course taught by Irving Howe, who read Robert Frost's poems with tenderness and an edge of menace that conveyed the poet's respect for the sinister beauty of nature. Those poems would not be as richly appreciated online.
 Yet for now such fears would be misplaced. The study's fine print makes clear that growth is not across the board. Selective private four-year colleges that are the subject of so much angst this season are barely dipping their toes, typically providing online courses for students studying abroad or slackers who needed that 8 a.m. math course to graduate. Some, though, have taken note; for example, Columbia for several years has offered online master's degrees in some engineering fields. 
 Still, the surge is mostly among community colleges, professional programs like business and education, specialized online schools like the University of Phoenix, and public universities like Penn State and Illinois that feel obligated to accommodate far-flung residents. And the numbers are expected to grow partly because Congress last year dropped a requirement that colleges deliver half their courses on actual campuses in order to qualify for federal aid, a move critics saw as an enticement for diploma mills. Just as newspaper and television professionals are fumbling to figure out how to survive in an Internet world they did not grow up in, professors and students are realizing that they will have to learn, as one wag once said, to play the violin while performing at Carnegie Hall. QUESTIONS persist. What kind of content works best online, and what gets lost in translation? Which instructors and students function best in the virtual classroom? What happens to all those brick-and-mortar dormitories? How do you calculate the price of tuition? 
 Barmak Nassirian of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers wonders what will happen, should campuses go exuberantly online, to the intangibles -- the late-night bull sessions, the serendipitous strolls with professors, the chance to feel one's oats in student government? And what will one more switch to electronic conversation do to our need for intimate human connections, he asks?
 Andrew Delbanco, the Columbia humanities professor, said flatly that it would be impossible to put his seminar on war and culture online because ''the energy and spontaneity of discussion among people sitting together in a small room cannot be replicated by electronic exchanges.'' 
 His statement, not surprisingly, came in an e-mail message. For we live, for better or worse, in a harried world where people spend a good part of their lives on airplanes, where professionals are obliged to upgrade skills, where friends would rather chat via the screen of e-mail than face to face. 
 It's instructive for a skeptic to talk to Dr. Duck's students -- online, of course. They point out that online postings are more reasoned and detailed than off-the-cuff classroom observations. Students learn as much from one another's postings, informed by the real business world, as they do from instructors, they say. And Kevin Krull, a technology executive, pointed out that introverts reluctant to speak up in class can strut their stuff. 
 For those who shrug off online courses as watered-down soup, Dr. Duck and her students say courses like theirs at Penn State's World Campus -- the university's online division, with 300 courses for 7,500 undergraduates and graduate students -- require many more hours of work; discussion is not limited by a classroom hour. They confess, however, that they miss the ability to read expressions and body language that confirm that a point has been truly understood.
 Online courses may not be suited to subjects like laboratory science or theater, but can work fine for the nut-and-bolts information and analysis required in a history survey or for the editing needed for a basic writing course. Still, even in those fields many professors would feel lost online.
 Dr. Duck, a respected instructor who taught conventionally for nine years and online for five, said she ''wouldn't go back to the classroom if they doubled my salary.'' Her work, she thinks, is on the frontier of education in a global economy 
 In her dining room, her children sometimes pause beside her as she teaches, and she does not shoo them away.
 ''It's good for them to see this in action,'' she said. ''It's going to be their world.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 5, 2007

 CORRECTION:
The On Education column on Wednesday about online courses included the incorrect cost, from a Pennsylvania State University professor, for the master's program in business administration at the university. It is $49,000, not $52,000. Because of an editing error, the column also referred incorrectly to a course the writer once took that he said would not be as effective if taught online. It was a graduate-level course, not an undergraduate one.

HEADLINE: Exile on Wall Street

 BODY:
In any world other than the one created by Wall Street, the resignation of E. Stanley O'Neal, the chief of Merrill Lynch, would have been a foregone conclusion. A week ago, the firm reported the largest quarterly loss in its 93-year history, as a staggering $8.4 billion write-down on investments in junk mortgages and tricky debt obligations contributed to an overall loss in the third quarter of $2.3 billion. 
 And yet, it appears that Mr. O'Neal's fate was sealed only after the Merrill board learned that he had authorized merger discussions with another bank, Wachovia, without first seeking board approval. If the board had liked the merger idea -- it was only one of several put forth as a way to pull Merrill out of its dive -- would Mr. O'Neal still have his job?
 Mr. O'Neal's departure notwithstanding, accountability is in short supply on Wall Street these days. Most major banks have reported deep profit declines recently, including Citigroup, Bear Stearns and Bank of America. In all those cases, the declines resulted from problems that their chief executives should have been able to spot a mile away -- and that no one believes have been vanquished for good. But no other head of a major American bank has as yet lost his job in the unfolding debacle. 
 As painful as firings and resignations may be, they are at times necessary, probably more so now than ever. The credit crunch, and the strains it imposes on the markets and the economy, will not be eased until investor confidence returns. It is not confidence-inspiring to see major financial institutions being run by the same people who were at the helm when the problems now wreaking such havoc were in the making. 
 Clinging to the old guard also runs the risk of dragging the problems out, which further impairs confidence by leaving investors to wonder how much worse is yet to come. A new chief executive who bears no responsibility for a firm's previous losses is likely to be more nimble in confronting the mistakes of the past, unencumbered as he or she would be from the human tendency to hide or play down one's failures. 
 There are almost certainly more financial shocks to come. As The Times's Vikas Bajaj and Edmund L. Andrews reported last week, at this juncture, economists expect that the troubles in the mortgage market could, all told, cost financial firms and investors up to $400 billion. The question is whether more chief executives will pay for those and other losses with their jobs. The boards of America's commercial and investment banks need to focus on the best way forward, rather than on the best spin for a bad situation.
